VLast year, that optimistic prophet and calculator, Sir. Sidney Webb, told you from this chair that by 1926 the Labour Party would have a majority and be in office. We cheered, but, I am sure, as we cheered; we doubted. Had he told you that he had made a calculation or had had a vision that within seven months of his addressing you your representatives in Parliament would form the Government, and that the next time you would be called together the Chairman\u2019s address would be delivered by a Prime Minister and the front chairs on the platform occupied by heads of Departments your comments, I am sure, would have been of the nature of \u2018Poor old Webb,\u2019 and in the evening you would has filled your glasses to drink to his memory. And yet that apparently insane miracle has happened. As a matter of fact it was one of the most likely of things to follow an election whenever it came.Progress in Spite of HumbugMr. Baldwin precipitated the events by a miscalculation of the strength of his Party and of Protection, and dissolved Parliament. A hurried union of the divided Liberal force followed. Although we were the official Opposition at the time, throughout the critical part of the election the Press seemed to have conspired to say the very minimum about us. Our meetings were hardly reported. When the success of our campaign became disquieting and some notice had to be taken of us, you will remember that false reporting became the rule and forecasts of the most discouraging kind appeared from our constituencies. spite of such a campaign, with all its loud speakers, lobster tin cans, and the mobilisation of all the humbug that could be brought together to deceive the electors, we won 47 seats, and brought our representation from 144 to 191, truly a satisfactory achievement gained almost exclusively owing to the confidence we had earned whilst acting as the responsible Opposition. There is some comfort in the assurance thus given to us that there is a fixed limit to the influence of tricky conspiracies and resourceful demagogues.The Conservative Party was well under half the House of Commons; we came next with a clear lead over the Liberals. No coalition was possible; the Labour Party, if it thought it desirable to take office, must; under the circumstances, very soon have had a chance of taking office.When the opportunity came, so far as I was concerned I never had a moment's hesitation as to what we should do. To have shirked responsibility would have been cowardly, and this country does not like cowards; it would have put us into a bad Parliamentary fix. Altogether it would have shown the spirit of shivering fear rather than that of trustful gallantry and the latter is the spirit of the Labour Party.The Need for Firm FoundationsBut there was another call also in the situation. We honestly believed that the country was in bad hands and that its policy was not well directed. Could we manage to do something to mould national policy in new shapes? Some things we should like to do we saw quite plainly we could not do, and in these we had to face boldly a little disappointment amongst our own people and a violent attack from the other parties. But, my friends, let there be no doubt about this. To ask a party to undergo the discipline and the loyalty of confessing that it has not been able to create or command the power and the conditions necessary for success on this great issue and on that, to get our rank and file to understand that the bigger and more enduring the structure the greater is the preparation required for laying its foundations and for beginning it, that, my friends, is essential to the gathering together of a movement that will not be blown hither and thither by every fair or troublesome wind.British Labour Gives the Lead   Other things we thought we could do. We believed that the very fact of our existence would have an encouraging influence upon movements and political ideals similar to ours all over the world. We believed that we could make our country stand for something inspiring and attractive to the other nations. We had no hope of a new world created by magic. We had hope of the old world beginning to show a response to a new creative spirit. I think we have succeeded in that.Some of our work had to be frankly patchwork. Problems like unemployment, an essential feature in the economic system and one that was aggravated by the political, financial and industrial disturbances of the war, and perhaps even more by the hot-headed follies of the peace, present an intricate system of adjustments that have to be dealt with in detail, involving labour, thought, experiment and change in supporting opinion.Tory NeglectFor real constructive work practically no preparation had been made by our predecessors, whose assumption seemed to have been that, after a few years \u2013 I think they generally thought months \u2013 of relief work, conditions would become normal. Thus it was that relief work, which ought to be employed as a reserve by men striving to effect economic changes, was used by our opponents as a fund to be exhausted whilst they were whistling for the change of wind, and they did not get it. We came in when the reserve was getting pretty low down, and obviously whilst we turned to consider the best schemes for reconstruction we had to see to it that the relief work reserve was added to and used economically, whilst the Insurance Funds were better adapted to the needs of the unemployed. A cure for unemployment is not yet, but I can claim that no Government has done more than this, under such unprecedented conditions, to alleviate the hard lot of the victims of unemployment.Housing Problem SolvedSo with housing. Again we found a policy being pursued, the benefits of which directly affected only a stratum of our people either at the top of the wage-earning classes or even above that. To that we offer no opposition. None whatever. The professional man in a small way and the whole class of people with modestly good incomes have a right to be housed, but that alone leaves untouched the great mass of wage-earners whose incomes are low and intermittent. They had been left out of account because the problem of how to house them is by far and away the most difficult part of the housing shortage to solve. There again we have brought new ideas to our assistance, and not merely more money. A combination of capital and labour, an organisation of the whole trade for the service of the community, is the most promising industrial development that has taken place in recent years, under Government influence. I appeal to every section to make it a success. The machinery may have to be adjusted, adapted and re-adapted. Rome was not built in a day, as the homely proverb runs, but the possibilities and evolution of Mr. Wheatley\u2019s expedient are unlimited.The People\u2019s BudgetIn national finance we have been doing equally distinctive work. A Budget, which took 6d. off Income Tax and a 1d. off beer, was followed by one of ours which took 1¼d. off a pound of sugar and 3d. to 4d. off tea, and put £30,000,000 into the pockets of the consumers of the country, and whilst it did that it took other burdens off the backs of the middle classes. That is business, and the next Labour Budget will carry on this good work. That reflection is, perhaps, the real explanation of our present difficulties. A second Labour Budget would jeopardise the lives of the two other parties.In a different field the Government has also been striving against very troublesome forces.When we took office I determined to take upon my own back a double burden, not that I was unmindful of the weakness of human flesh or ignorant of the weight and the worry I was taking upon myself, but I was convinced that if our country was to pull its full weight the authority of the Premiership would have to be cast into the same scale as that of the Foreign Secretaryship. So I made my will and took up my burdens, leaving one of those burdens, and that a very considerable one, on the capable shoulders of Mr. Clynes. The circumstances which called for this were exceptional; national interests asked for it, and we responded. What was the situation?Out of the Old RutsThe world was steadily falling back into the old ruts of alliance and pact, and force and its organisation, without the nations being made fully aware of what was happening, were creeping back into the minds of statesmen as, the only bulwark upon which they could lean for security. We found waiting for us a draft Treaty of Mutual Guarantee, in some ways a great advance on what had none before, marked in several of its provisions by the hand of men who undoubtedly had laboured hard and sincerely for peace, but yet a great menace to the League of Nations, and essentially a war preparation document. By persistent propaganda and pressure the question of national security had become exclusively one of armed force. Young nations born in the war, old nations exhausted by the war, were beginning to look round and in the sky of each they saw a cloud of menace, set there mostly by their own hands.The Psychology of PeaceOnce international policy was determined by that psychology, then farewell to peace; then limitation of armaments is nothing but an easement of burdens of taxation, it is not a measure of peace. Peace is something different from a mere limitation in preparation for war. Peace is not an interlude of apparent quiet in a germinating war policy. Peace has its own natural policy and organisation, its own method of handling questions, its own mentality, its own standards of justice, of right and of wrong. We came in just at the moment when the future was being settled. In that future alone we shall be able to see with what measure of success our work has been attended. A good fight has been put up, but we must scrutinise with almost meticulous care every proposal that is being made lest the germs of the old-world minds of militarism cling to them, for these germs will destroy them if they are there. We are not to be rushed. This is a job which has to be done in an efficient and workmanlike way, and it has to be done bit by bit as the nations find increasing security in a ruling justice. Of this I am sure. The work of the Labour Dele­gation at Geneva last month may give pride to all the men and women who, longing for the security of peace, have joined the Labour Party in search of it. Sometimes when I see the facts from the inside, I am never quite sure whether I should be indignant with the chicanery or wild with the ignorance of people who imagine that the war has left us in the position we were in before it broke out, and that all we have got to do is to wait for it to drift back into the old condition.The Problem of ReparationsIn all this unmaking and remaking of Europe - and, indeed, of the whole world - there is involved a disquieting upsetting of old trade conditions. To this natural dislocation has been added the purely gratuitous one of Reparations imposed in such ways as to show sublime ignorance of, the most elementary facts of economics. This error has been woven so closely into the peace settlement that no Government can, by employing the simple method of a pair of scissors, return to a sound position, either for itself or for the rest of the world. We were fortunate in that the Experts\u2019 Report gave us an opportunity of creating a machinery of control which I hope will in the end bring us back to wisdom. But meantime we must pass through some troubled waters before we get out of our present conditions, which we inherited from the war and the peacemakers.Punishing Ourselves by Punishing GermanyOur method of punishing Germany has, as a matter of simple fact contributed to her efficiency as a competitor, whilst it has weakened ourselves; and we must face for some time the pressure of Germany as an exporter. Our predecessors wasted valuable years after the armistice either in pursuing policies that were short-sighted or in doing nothing to direct our industry and to save our people. I know as a matter of fact that they were warned again and again by, friends both at home and abroad of what was coming, but all that happened was that the Tariff Reformer enjoyed some facilities to tinker with legislation. Mr. Baldwin with commendable courage - whatever the result may have been to his party - did produce his nostrum. It was no good. He said it was his only cure, but he has now dropped it. For ourselves we have asked the guidance of some of the most repre­sentative business men and workers - the two sides equally efficiently represented - and we shall be vigilant in protecting our interests.The Great DangerThe greatest danger to the industrial life of a nation is conservatism - the state of mind which has done far more damage to our agricultural interests than even the English climate - and with conservatism I put indolence, and the aim of Socialism is to get at the hearts of men, because we cannot survive unless we discover how to produce the willing worker and not merely the man who toils for reward. We have been too long thinking and speaking as though the spirit of artistic production was different in kind from the spirit required for manual production. Those of us who drank early from the refreshing springs which William Morris made to flow in a dull and deadening generation never held that heresy and never will. Men live by their generosities, by their loyalties; not by their interests, and their self-regarding impulses. And until somehow or other, by a change of heart and of condition, or both, we can put our industry on the footing of the willing gift of service, we shall have nothing but quarrels and the sacrifice of the common weal. It is the aim of getting our industry on that footing, that is the aim of the Socialist inspiration that gives us power in our Labour Movement.I Am No CommunistFor that reason I am no Communist. Pettifogging conspiracy, secret associations, backstair wire-pulling, mischievous stirring up of strife are neither in method nor in ideal the Socialism that has built up our Labour Party. They were detestable to our honoured founders like Hardie and Morris. They respected opinions with which they did not agree, but they kept them at arms\u2019 length. When they had enemies they preferred to have them outside, rather than open the door to have them inside. Never was it more necessary for our Labour .Movement to raise as its own flag the banner of democracy, of freedom, of progress by reason and of condemnation of tyranny by power. The war has threatened to make the world safe for dictatorships, for conspiracy, for mischief, for force coercing both the bodies and the minds of men. Unless we are prepared to engage upon a crusade against that, we had better put up our shutters and declare that we have wearied in well-doing. Communism, as we know it has nothing practical in common with us. It is a product of Czarism and war mentality, and as such we have nothing in common with it.The Only Way to PeaceThe only practical policy that could be adopted under these circumstances in order to try and bring peace on the one hand and create natural conditions of work on the other was to take Europe just as we found it with all its engagements and arrangements, and begin from what we found to straighten out point after point, one after another. That has been our aim. For instance, had Labour been at Paris, Reparations would have been very different from that they are, but the general agreement of the nations - Germany included - now is to accept the Experts\u2019 Report and see how it is to work, watching its effects almost from day to day and being prepared by the systems of arbitration and checks provided by the London Conference and the Report itself, to adjust expectations to facts. It is very sad that you have got to teach leading statesmen theoretical economics through the pockets of other people. I wish it were their own pockets that were bearing the financial consequences of their mistakes and blunders that you unfortunately are bearing. Against one thing I would warn the Movement. The German employers are using the fact that these Reparations have to be paid as a reason for reducing the wages, increasing the hours, and intensifying the slavery of the German workers. Whatever may be the ill effects of the Experts\u2019 Report, that is certainly not one of them, and I hope that the Labour Movement in this and in other countries will not be induced to fall into the trap thus laid for them and lend their countenance to one of the ordinary excuses which capitalism is always seeking to increase its grip on the lives of the workers.The Common MenaceThe whole Trade Union Movement of the World is morally bound to support German Trade Unions struggling to recover lost ground, for so long as the deterioration in social conditions in Germany which followed the Micum Agreement and the occupation of the Ruhr in particular lasts, low industrial standards will be a common menace not only to the political tranquillity of Central Europe, but to the standards of life of every competing country. So far as I know, every International Labour Organisation has passed resolutions asking for a trial to be given to the Experts\u2019 Report, and that has been the attitude of the Labour Government in this country.Recognising RussiaIn pursuance of the Government\u2019s policy of pacification, we recognised the Government of Russia because it is the Government of Russia, for exactly the same reason that Christian Foreign Secretaries have recognised Mohammedans and people whose religious persuasions were of somewhat more doubtful quality even than that. If my colleagues and my friends are to be accused of being Bolsheviks because we recognised Russia, of what an infinity of crimes and misdemeanours is my predecessor in office - the pre-eminently respectable Marquis Curzon - to be accused for having come to an agreement with Turkey. Immediately after the recognition of the Russian Government we proceeded to negotiate Treaties which would regularise our relations. The results are before the country now, and, as there was ample evidence whilst the negotiations were still proceeding, there are interests in the country prepared in the most bitter way to sacrifice every national concern for themselves.Lloyd George\u2019s Short MemorySometimes I have time to read speeches. I am now getting into the habit of making an opportunity, whatever the difficulties may be, of reading the speeches of those who are opposed to the Russian Treaty, and the reason is this. When I went into Downing Street, I was unable to take any novels and light literature with me. I was half way through an old Scotch novel, and in the course of a week or two I had finished it ,and then I was stranded. I used to have to go to bed with no preparation for sleep beyond a dip into Hansard or some Blue Book or something of that kind, and the result was that the strain upon my moral character was getting excessive. Then the Russian Treaties came out. Then the speeches against them began to be delivered, and then I had an ample supply of the literature of which I had been so long deprived. I hope Mr. Lloyd George is going on. It would be a great grief to me if his speech of last night were the last of its kind.The Need for Calm ReasonBut seriously, at a time when calm reason should be enlisted, if the country is to recover its feet, we hate the spectacle of wild endeavours to overwhelm opinion in earthquakes and tidal waves of heaving ignorant emotionalism. The destructive Plutos of society - not us, but respectable people, bankers like Mr. Grenfell and so on - shake the earth by scare headings, false news, and wild ravings, and whoever wishes to help the State by reflective common sense and reasonable endeavour is encompassed in mad upheavals of fear and passion. The criticisms on the Treaties have gone through various stages of perfervid excitement and no suggestion yet of calm examination. That perhaps, will come when we get them into operation, and no more sobering exercise could be undertaken by you than to turn up files of newspapers for the last two months and see the fluctuating and contradictory arguments and statements that have gone to upset public opinion.Mob Passion or the Public WillThey seek to turn popular government into the rule of mob passion rather than that of the public will. Men for a time overwhelmed in that have an uncanny habit of returning again in increased strength. Malignity and ignorance are the life, not the death, of what they attack. I refer to the stunt performances, not to certain criticisms made by the better type of journalists; but it is quite evident that so far as the other two parties are concerned, their one interest regarding the Russian Treaties is to prevent us from doing the work that the nation - and especially the working classes - requires. In so far as the Treaties come short of a really satisfactory settlement, that is due to the fact that the blunders and escapades of our predecessors still hang like poison clouds over all our endeavours. They may be wrecked, and then in years to come a troubled and out-manoeuvred nation will reflect with regret upon that, as it now reflects upon Denikin decorations, Koltchak calamities and Archangel asininities.The Dignity of GovernmentFor some days now the political situation has been causing us some little concern. When Mr. Asquith made that first speech of his after the Election, at the National Liberal Club, both my colleagues and myself took it as a plain intimation that if and when we took office we should have to eat out of his hand. Men who have any right to hold high State offices must, from their very nature, resent and repudiate such a relationship. That speech, unfor­tunately, settled for good the relations between us, and was the beginning of a policy which has been unwinding its unworthy course ever since then. Its latest phase demands a definite stand on our part. They have decided to have an election in three weeks, if they can force it. In preparation for it they are laying their traps, and when I saw in the newspapers this morning, and especially the Liberal Press, the shaking of heads about an election I really wondered did they think that all their readers were fools: There has been a trumped up stunt about the dropping of a certain Prosecution. What a chance for a worry! What a chance for a humiliation! What a chance for the wiles of a pettifogging lawyer!The Country Wants Our WorkEveryone knows that the country wishes us to go on with our work and not disturb and distract it yet with an election. We are perfectly willing to do our best - perfectly willing. We have never sought a rupture. We are not seeking it now. But the nation has never respected a Government without spirit or self-respect. The nation does not ask us to go on with our work under conditions that would lower the dignity of future Governments and cheapen the whole conception of the Cabinet. Every watchful person knows that we are in the midst of work -which cannot be interrupted except to the grave disadvantage of the nation, but which at the same time cannot be carried on except by men whose authority, in the eyes of the foreigner and of our own people, is respected by Parliament. If the challenge came on large issues, very well no one could complain - the Government least of all. But every member of any Government who has held office since the Irish troubles just before the war knows that if our Government had done everything of which it has been accused regarding this prosecution it could seek justification in what its predecessors have done.Satan Condemning SinSatan reproving sin! That is totally inadequate. Reproving! Why, it is Satan pretending to condemn sin, and to be the judge of the sin; after he himself has lived a sinful life through eternal years. If this were a mere disconnected blunder, a mere disconnected unfortunate incident, that, of course, would be no cause for anything more. But it is not that, and every man and woman who goes into the lobby for us or against us tomorrow knows perfectly well that it is not that. Every man and woman who refers to this question in the country may use words to deceive the electors, but if they tell the truth that is in themselves, they know it is not that. It is part of a scheme which in three weeks\u2019 time is designed to force a humiliated Government to the country. That is the situation. There is a dishonesty, an obliqueness, in the whole business. The Conservatives have a straightforward motion of censure down. I hear they are going to run away from it and vote against it. They are so afraid of us. To kill 192 needs all the wits and wiles and elastic conscience of 423. One of the most enjoyable spectacles to be witnessed would be, if I am spared till tomorrow night, to see the Conservatives running away from their vote of censure.Why an Election?But we understand a vote of censure, however. That we understand. That is straight fighting, though the poor victimised nation may well want to know what really is the occasion for it. How many Tory Governments would have survived votes of censure properly passed upon them for wire-pulling the law in their own governmental and party interests? I am not at all sure, however, that this is not a vote of censure caused by the shadow of our success upon their partisan prospects. The amendment, which in its form and origin must be treated equally as a vote of censure, is conceived in the spirit of medieval crookedness and torture. The Government is not to be censured. It is only to be insulted. It is not to be executed; it is, in the words of one of the Liberal papers, to be put on the rack. It is to be suspended as you suspend one of your clerks when suspected of a misdemeanour. You tell him to go away till the end of the week until you have inquired into it. At the end of that time, without hearing what he has to say about himself, you decide whether he is going to be discharged. It is to be suspended, as it were whilst a packed committee, consisting of seven sworn opponents and three defenders - none of whom can come from our front bench, whilst the other front benches can choose their strongest partisans - are to have a roving commission of injudicial inquiry, and are to report in censure on the Government - for I know the document is already drawn up - and then this is going to be published, with a minority report signed by our three members, on the eve of the election, which then they will force on some other issue.How the Plan WorksThis is how the plan works. Tomorrow night seven men out of ten to be appointed will go into the lobby condemning us, and the next day they will be appointed as judges to consider our case impartially.Our opponents are to pretend on the one hand that no election is required, and that we should go on with our work, at the same time as they rob us of the virtue of respect and lay us open to a charge, which it is their game to make at the end of this week, that when our usefulness as a Government has been destroyed we are mean-spirited enough to cling to office after we had received our death wound. If we go, they will pretend that we have caused the election; if we stay, they will accuse us of being limpets on £5,000 a year. They propose to drive us into the jails of their Inquisition, whilst the special pleaders and the executioners at their leisure prepare the biased indictment, the rack and the block. What a gorgeous game!Liberal Party\u2019s Grave ErrorBy this little manoeuvre we are to go down, and the fortunes of the Liberal Party are to be restored. They mistake their men. It. remains to be seen if the inheritance of principle and tradition, which still retain for the Liberal Party the allegiance of many worthy people, is to regard small tactics as Liberal principle and partisanship as Liberal, tradition. It also remains to be seen how the decently minded members of the Conservative Party will relish being made tools of in this kind of strategy by opponents whom they profess to hold in contempt. But before this Conference is over we shall know what the Fates have in store for us. Depend upon this - we shall surrender nothing of the rights of a Government. If there be an election, the responsibility is not ours. It will be caused by partisan abuse of Parliamentary votes, and the resentment against this chicanery, which will be in the heart of every Labour supporter in the country, will make our victories all the more numerous when the country is allowed to judge our work. Some fresh, clean fighting in the constituencies may clear the air and give us strength in the House of Commons which will make us independent of partisan interest.Attack!I hope that in its deliberations the Conference will remember what is at stake, that it will guard with special vigilance the spirit and the principles of our Movement, and when it is time for it to dissolve, the thousand men and women here gathered together will return to their posts and sleep in their armour until the word is given forth that the Labour Party is to take the field, not to defend itself, but to attack its enemies.

aVI have heard many Parliamentary Reports moved in Conference. I myself have been responsible for a number of them, but this Parliamentary Report differs in character from any of those that have come before Conference hitherto. For the first time we have a Report of the work of a Labour Government in power, a Labour Government supported by a great majority in the House of Commons, a Labour Government carrying out the policies of the Socialist Movement.I have been nearly 24 years in the House of Commons, years of struggle, years of being in a minority, with two short frustrated periods of office. It was not without emotion that I rose for the first time in the House of Commons with the consciousness of the backing of nearly 400 Members. Today my mind goes back, first of all, to the last Bournemouth Conference in that fateful year, 1940. I remember how this Conference took its great decision. It did not take that decision lightly, but it resolved that in the crisis of the nation the Labour Movement would take its full share of responsi­bility. We went into the Government as a united party. Through those difficult years we worked as a united party, and we came out as a united party. Those decisions were taken democratically by the Labour Party in con­ference. We did not have to wait to be told the party line from elsewhere.Those five years of responsibility were of inestimable value to us when the time came for us to take over the responsibilities of govern­ment. We had much experience. We had much knowledge of the problems that we had to face, but before we took over the Government we went to an election, and we fought that General Election honestly. I have known skilful tacticians in the political world who have told me that it was always advisable to go to the country on negatives, on criticism, on grievances and vague promises. I have known Govern­ments that have got in through a subterfuge.I have known Governments that have got in through stunts of one kind and another. We went in setting out our full programme, and as a result we were returned - as our opponents admit - with a mandate for our full policy. That is democracy in action.What has been our course of action since we obtained power? How have we approached our problems? I recall very well meeting the new Labour Parliamentary Party in the Beaver Hall in the City of London, and I stated then that our intention was to carry out our full programme. I said: \u2018We have to deal with the problems arising from the war and the aftermath of war, very heavy problems that will put a burden on any Government. We have schemes of social reform, schemes prepared during the war government, in the preparation of which your Labour Ministers took a very full share. We are resolved to carry through those great schemes.\u2019 But, I said, \u2018We also are resolved to carry out as rapidly and as energetically as we can the distinctive side of Labour\u2019s programme: our socialist policy, our policy of nationalisation.\u2019 That was the line of action laid down then. It was embodied in the King\u2019s speech, and this Report shows you how faithfully it has been carried out.This vigorous and forceful action rather upset our opponents, for some of them seemed to be rather scandalised that, having gone to the country with a clear and definite programme, we should proceed to carry it out. It was always their pretence that programmes of nationalisation were theoretical, ideological fads, drawing the Government\u2019s attention from its proper duties. Indeed, they went so far as to embody that view in a vote of censure which, as you will see from this Report, was well and truly defeated. The fact is that these measures of ours are not theoretical trimmings. They are an essential part of a planned economy that we are introducing into this country. They are designed to help in promoting full employment, economic prosperity and justice for all. They are vital to the efficient working of the industrial and political machine of this country. They are the embodiment of our Socialist principle of placing the welfare of the nation before that of any section and of dealing with every problem in a practical and business­like way. We have been able to show how essential our proposals are to the needs of the existing situation, and so, when it came to bringing our measures on to the floor of the House, our Ministers and our Members in the House had no difficulty in putting their case across. Let me say that I have never known a Parliamentary Labour Party with so many Members so capable of putting Labour\u2019s case across.We had secured a clear mandate from the people, and so, when we introduced the nationalisation of the Bank of England - which some of us can remember as a subject of such violent storms in Parliament and the press, which was regarded by some people as the end of all things - it went through with hardly a ripple on the surface of either House, and when we came to the nationalisation of the mines, although there was criticism in detail, it was quite clear that the Opposition had no alterna­tive. I recall very well, after the Second Reading debate, talking to an American statesman. He does not belong to our Party. The last thing he would like would be to be accused of being a Socialist, but when he came away from that debate he said: \u2018Your man Shinwell convinced me.\u2019 The case on the mines was unanswerable. Those two have already become law, but others are marching on. The Cable and Wireless Bill is in Committee, and so is the Civil Aviation Bill. Others are in preparation, and the process will continue. These measures are not the result of some a priori theorising. They come out of hard and practical experience and close study of the problems involved.I think that that is a pretty good start. You must not overload the political machine. I believe that quite a number of our Members in the House of Commons are realising that we have made our policy of full employment begin with them. You must not overload the adminis­trative machine either, because the Civil Servants are also experiencing full employment. In all these things we must observe the prioritiesI can assure you that we are planning ahead. We are planning ahead for the work of the next session after this one and the next after that. It is generally agreed that this legislative activity is unexampled. It is attributable to the energies of Ministers, of the Civil Service and of the House of Commons. 73 Bills have been introduced. 55 have already received the Royal Assent. There are a lot of fish in the basket, and they are not just minnows. There are pretty big salmon among them. Look at those three great measures of social reform: National Insurance, National Insurance Injuries and the National Health Services. In previous Parliaments any one of those would have been thought to have provided a full meal for a whole year. We worked on the basis of what was done under the War Government, but Parliament and this Government have improved on those first drafts submitted during the war years. We have produced them in the first ten months of our Government.Our opponents had some kind of a vague programme, not very clearly put across at the General Election, which was called the five year plan. As far as I can see they would have proceeded very leisurely to do in five years what we have done in ten months. We are in great measures of social reform, to vary my metaphor, two up and one to play, two on the Statute Book and one which is just going through Committee. We have had a wonderful spirit and wonderfully loyal support from all our Members in the House. Of course, they have criticised because we are trained in criticism, but their criticism has been con­structive.Let us look a little further into the fish basket. Here is another large one: the repeal of the Trade Disputes Act. At long last that unjust stigma on the Trade Union Movement, that injustice to Civil Servants, has been removed. The late Prime Minister invited us to go to the country on this issue, to appeal to Caesar. We appealed, Caesar gave his verdict, and the Trade Disputes Act is no more.We have had two successful Budgets. It is a remarkable thing that confidence in our British financial system has risen steadily with the work of the Socialist Chancellor of the Exchequer. Besides these Budgets he has introduced other measures designed to make money the servant and not the master, designed to cause capital to flow into those channels where it will bring forth most fruit for the benefit of the whole people.Among the lesser measures there are some which are of vital importance dealing with questions applicable to the miners, questions dealing with dockers, dealing with special sections of the people and dealing with the whole people. Besides these there are a number of measures which are absolutely needed in the stern conditions under which we are living.I would like you for a moment to consider just what the conditions have been in which this great volume of legislation has been placed on the Statute Book: not the easy times of peace, not a time of settled conditions, not a time of leisure for Ministers or for Civil Servants, but the most difficult time of all, the period of reconstruction after a great war. I say, the fact that we have been able to pass these measures with full discussion is a great vindication of the democratic system of govern­ment.But legislation is one thing and administration is another. Let us have a look at administration. No one, I think, would deny the magnitude of the administrative tasks that have faced this Government. People used to say to me before the election: \u2018Don\u2019t you hope you will not win? Look at the difficulty of your task.\u2019 We did not take that line. Take one or two of our major questions. Demobilisation is an enormous problem. Our policy was to maintain with reasonable flexibility the principles which had been laid down by a great Minister of Labour, Ernest Bevin, during the war. Nothing throws up more difficult cases than demobilisa­tion. Nowhere is it more easy to get prejudice, but I claim, looking back over these ten months, that our policy has been vindicated, and, con­sidering the difficulties, that great change-over has worked wonderfully smoothly, thanks not just to the Government machine but to the temper and patience of the fighting men and women, and to the full co-operation of organised labour.We then had the problem of the change-over from a war to a peace economy. Inevitably you will get some pockets of unemployment, but we have seen a wonderful and orderly absorption of labour into industry where it was most needed. Again, how much we owe to co-opera­tion with the Trade Unions. We have seen a remarkable expansion of our export trade. You can see here, too, plans working out to direct industry to where it is most needed, to see that never again are we left with those special areas which we had before the war, and that we do not over-congest areas like London and other centres.We have been giving freedom to develop where restrictions are not necessary, but we have kept on restrictions which are needed to prevent exploitation and inflation.Take another problem: housing. It is an enormous problem that cannot be solved quickly. Some people seem to think that one could build all the houses that one wants m the winter. They do not belong to the building trades. There is a lot of criticism by ignor­amuses, but now, week by week, work is going forward. Houses are being built, houses are in building, houses are being completed. We shall carry out the programme set us, not to solve the problem in twelve months, but, with the resources available, to go steadily ahead on our policy of providing houses for the people.In conditions of shortage of labour, shortage of materials, difficulties as regards food and transport, to talk of the complete removal of controls is folly. We do not try to keep any controls that are not essential. I think the steadiness of the nation is remarkable, and the demand for the abolition of controls is practic­ally confined to the lunatic fringe, but, actually, we do not want all the time to emphasise restrictions. Actually a new impulse has been, given by the Labour Government over the whole field of governmental activity. In every sphere administration has been given a definite objective. Besides the work of the Cabinet and its Committees in co-ordinating work, there is a wonderful effect from having Ministers who are animated by the same ideals. It helps them to make a co-operative effort. It helps them to take the broad view.You see, therefore, the Movement going forward, in agriculture, education and every department, and you see it, too, in the fighting services. There has been a new start. For the first time the remuneration of the fighting services has been deliberately equated with that of civilian workers. It is a bigger change, perhaps, than everybody realises.We are facing difficulties, but difficulties are made to be overcome, but our home problems are affected all the time by the world situation. Our home food troubles have been vastly accentuated by the responsibilities that we have for others. We are holding a firm balance between our responsibilities to our own people and our responsibilities to peoples of the world, and we are striving, and with success, to get the world food problem viewed not as that of a scramble for every country to get its own, but for all of us to overcome these years of dearth and, in the future, to have a world that is free from want. Coal shortages and transport shortages again are not just home problems. They are foreign problems. I need not tell you what energetic leads have been given by our representatives at international conferences. There are economic matters, monetary matters and social matters. This Labour Movement of ours has never been a narrow insular movement. It has always recognised that the cause of the workers all over the world was one. We have always realised that you cannot build up a little safety zone for yourselves and leave misery in the rest of the world.In this problem of foreign politics, in the implementation of the great responsibilities that fall on this country - because we were one of the great victors in the war - the Labour Government is resolved to carry out its responsi­bilities. I am not going to say much this morning on foreign affairs because you are going to have a full debate, and you will hear our great Foreign Secretary, Ernest Bevin. We are carrying out, in foreign affairs, our Party policy, and we bring to foreign affairs, as to other spheres, the touchstone of our Socialist faith. We are seeking to promote world peace by collective security. For many years we have been faithful to that doctrine when others fell away. At the time of the late Arthur Henderson we did our utmost.We have taken up again the work that fell from the hands of that great man. We support democracy and freedom everywhere. Let me say that we know what democracy means and we know what freedom means, because we have it ourselves. We know, too, that political world settlement is not enough. We must base the peace on economic prosperity and social justice. I say that we know what democracy and free­dom mean. We do not seek to force our ideas on other countries. We recognise that we live in a world of variously organised States, some Socialist, some capitalist, some Communist, and many with mixed economies. We have to live and work in the world with States of diverse characteristics, just as here in this country we live and work with our fellow citizens of diverse characteristics. We believe in the co-operation between peoples of different outlooks, and not the attempt to force a dull uniformit\u000a\u000ay on the world. We ask for others the freedom that we claim for ourselves.We proclaim this freedom, but we do more than proclaim it. We seek to put it into effect. Witness India. We have invited the people of India to decide their own destiny. If they will stay with us in the British Commonwealth we shall welcome them. If they desire to go outside, we shall stretch out the hand of friendship to them. Meanwhile, my three colleagues have been labouring over there, not to force something on India, but to help the Indians to solve their own problems.We have set an example in UNO, where we were the first to proclaim our readiness to hand over our possessions from the last war under a system of trusteeship. In the Colonial Empire also self-government marches on. No Govern­ment has given more complete proof of its desire to follow the path of democracy and freedom. We hear a few voices now, and again mumbling the old shibboleths about Imperial­ism. I must say they seem to me rather second-hand voices.Well, here is our work at home and abroad. We set this record before you, and this, after all, is but the beginning of things. We have had only just over ten months of Government. The work of a Prime Minister in these days is very heavy. The content of Government has expanded immensely in the last thirty or forty years, and no man can carry the burden of the Premiership without the loyal support and co-operation of his colleagues in the Govern­ment and without the loyal backing of the Party in Parliament and in the country. Let me say how fortunate I am in having such good and loyal comrades - a team of able colleagues working each in his own sphere and co-operating together in the general work of government. If you look around today you will not see any easy jobs in the Government. Every Depart­ment has its hard problems. Every Department needs an active and hard-working Minister, and every Department has got one today. There are Ministers who hold what are called sinecure offices where there is not much to do in the way of a department, but I am not sure that they are not the most hard-worked of all ministers. Let me refer to the Lord President the Council, Herbert Morrison. He does a great work in leading the House of Commons. That is where you see him, on the floor of the House. What you do not see is the mass of work he is doing behind the scenes in co­-ordinating the work of Ministers. Take the Lord Privy Seal, Arthur Greenwood. Our special measures owe an immense debt to his knowledge and hard work. Then, of course, there is the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Generally you come up against a Chancellor the Exchequer whenever you want something, and he says \u2018No,\u2019 but we have a constructive Chancellor: he is not a \u2018Yes\u2019 man and he will say \u2018No\u2019 on occasions, but not on every occasion, and that is what you want in a Chancellor of the Exchequer. And, of course, I have got the Foreign Secretary. I cannot run through the list of all my colleagues, but I especially mention another one - Lord Addison, the House of Lords. It is not an easy job to be in a permanent minority, but there are in that House what I used to call the thin red line of heroes - rather more of them now - and they are doing a very good work. The work of a Government is team work, and I want to give my thanks to my colleagues, whether as Ministers or as Under-Secretaries or as Whips; the last-named are people not ways popular, but we have a very good team of Whips. One other Minister I must mention once thought of the Chancellorship of the Duchy of Lancaster as being filled by dear old gentlemen - I filled it myself once - but, I should like to pay a tribute to the present Chancellor, John Hynd, and the difficult work that he has done which lies behind the occupa­tion of Germany.I wish I could mention all my colleagues, but they know we appreciate their work. We are backed by the finest House of Commons, I think, within living memory. I do not know what the House was like in the eighteenth century, but certainly it is the finest in our time, and much as I love and admire my colleagues of the past, I think that we have now in the House certainly the ablest and youngest, as well as the largest, Parliamentary Party we have ever had. If you look at this Report you will see how active they are, not only on the floor of the House but in Committees of every kind, in which they prepare themselves for work in the House and for bringing to bear that con­structive criticism which all Governments need.After all, this is only a beginning. I stand here with this experience of Government to reaffirm my faith in democratic Socialism. We will never sacrifice the liberties won by our forefathers. It is social democracy which can set us free from the tyranny of economic power and preserve us, too, from the dangers of the absolute power of the State. The inspiring vigour of Parliament, with its free and open criticism, is the source of strength of this Government, as of all British Governments. We rejoice in the co-operation of the people with the Government. We rejoice in the fact that great organisations like the Trade Unions co-operate with us, as well as scores of voluntary agencies, national and local, bringing to the governmental machine the surge of individual enthusiasm. That is a mark of the British way of life.No one realises more clearly than I do that we have a long way to go yet to reach the Britain of our dreams and the world of our desires, and we believe that we shall get from all the people of this land hard work and courage to take us through the years ahead. For that hard work men and women need the inspiration of a great ideal. We are not ashamed to proclaim ourselves a party of ideal­ists inspired by a living faith in freedom, democracy, and social justice. Through many years of adversity we have kept our faith, we have striven for the opportunity to translate our Socialist policy into action. That oppor­tunity has now come to us in full measure. We have, I believe, made a good beginning. We shall not falter. With faith in the justice of our cause and our ability to serve the nation we confidently face the future.

aVIt is twenty-two months almost to a day since the Labour Government was formed, and in this Report we give you an account of our achievements, a second installment of the carrying-out of the programme which we placed before the electorate. This record is one of which I think we can be proud. We have admittedly placed before Parliament a heavier and more important programme of legislation than has been submitted in any previous Parliament. Our opponents say that it is too heavy. But the times in which we live demand great changes, and there was a great legacy of past neglect which we inherited. Let me give you but one instance the problem of the mines.  That had been ripe, and over-ripe for decades. It was left to us to deal with the muddle of the past. That has meant a heavy addition to our legislation and it has meant also that we have been hampered by the neglect of the past in the reconstruction of the present and in our work for the future. No little of our troubles in the industrial and economic sphere is due to the fact that the mines were neglected. Now we have taken action we can see a change in the scene.There were great measures of social reform prepared during the Coalition Government. Many of those could have been brought forward during the war. They  were not brought forward. We have had to do that work: in fact, in twenty-two months we have had to do the entire programme that the Conservative Party had at the last General Election - a Five-Year Plan. We have a young and eager Parliament and a nation demanding great things. Therefore I make no apology on behalf of the Government for having given Parliament plenty of hard work. After all, work is what we are asking of the nation. It is just as well that Parliament should set a good example.I have received complaints of rushed legislation, of insufficient time to discuss great measures. I have been nearly twenty-five years in Parliament and I have never known an Opposition fail to make that complaint. We had a good many years in opposition, and the work of opposition takes a great deal of learning. You have to learn how to make the best use of the time, and we are resolved to give the Conservative Party the opportunity to become thoroughly versed in the part.I should like to pay a tribute to our members in the House of Commons and also in the House of Lords. They have been diligent. They attend much better than in any previous Parliament I have known. They are loyal. Of course, in a Party like ours there is always a great deal of freedom. They have been co-operative and they have collaborated with Ministers. And, after all, Government is not just a matter of Ministers giving orders. It is essential in a Parliamentary democracy that the Members of Parliament should be co-workers with .the Ministers. Let me pay a tribute particularly to two men who I think have done a great job in this Parliament - Neil Maclean and Maurice Webb. They have had the job of presiding over Party meeting; and, having had a longer experience than most of that particular work, I congratulate them. There has been immense activity in Parliament, and work on Committees, official and unofficial; and I should like to thank all my colleagues in Parliament, my colleagues in the Government and our members through­out the country for the help and support they have given to the Government. The record is before you. You know it quite well - and if you don\u2019t, you should.But quite as important as legislation is administration. Much of it is less spectacular but equally important. When you pass great measures, you set in train a whole mass of actions which have to be taken by Ministers. Health, Social Insurance and Education Bills all mean an immense amount of administra­tive work. You have to get those things through and coming in at the right time, and I congratulate those who have been in charge of the measures we have taken through on their implementation and on the work they have done. I claim that in every sphere of Government you have seen our Socialist impulse, our Socialist outlook.We have had some difficult times because some of our Ministers have been away ill. We are all very glad to get Herbert Morrison back again. He seems to have plenty of vigour. And I am glad to say, too, that the health of the Foreign Secretary, Ernest Bevin, has been better. The strain on him and on other Ministers is very heavy. And let me say a word for our Civil Service, who get more kicks than they should: The strain on the Civil Service is heavy. Civil Servants play their part splendidly. When I see, demands from this Conference and so many resolutions that this must be done immedi­ately and that must be done immediately, I want just to warn you not to overstrain the machine but to leave it to the Government to decide on priorities.Let us look at our purpose, our achievement and the work that lies ahead. First of all, what is our purpose? We came in with a double purpose, first, to deal with the very difficult conditions, internally and externally, resulting from a long war, and second, to lay the foundations of a new social order evolving from the old. We had to effect two transitions, one from a war to a peace economy and one from a capitalism based on private enterprise and private property to a Socialist economy based on the control and direction of the wealth and resources of this country in the interests of all the people. Neither of those transitions could be effected in a few days or a few months; it takes a long time. We had three great advantages in tackling this task and seeking to achieve our purpose. First, we had our Socialist faith as our guide and inspiration; secondly we had a clear programme integrated into a definite plan; and thirdly we had a fine Majority in Parliament. I would like to stress here the integrated plan. Our action in bringing great spheres of economic activity under national control and ownership was not the result of some academic theory; it was the essential part of our plan, a plan conceived in relation to the actual conditions of the world today and the actual problems we had to solve.How far have we advanced in achieving that purpose? In face of many difficulties we have effected a smooth transition from war to peace over a very wide field. You had demobi­lisation. You have not yet had the slackening of controls and you will have to have controls as long as there are shortages - and that is admitted even by our opponents, who like to clamour for controls to be abolished but quite often ask for them to be put on when they are asking questions in the House. It is admitted that freedom is relative: one man\u2019s freedom may be the enslavement of thousands. We have to try to get an equal measure of freedom for all. We have had to face world shortages and local shortages, a very difficult foreign exchange position and an uneasy situation in foreign affairs. They have always interrupted the plan. The plan must be worked in relation to the actual conditions of the time, many of the features of which cannot be foreseen. We might have had less difficulty if we had been content not to try so hard to get all the things we wanted done. Then you would have had other evils, other complaints and unemployment. The very vigour of our plan has made difficult the exact integration of every part of it.I am not going to deal with all our achieve­ments or I would take too long. I want only to indicate those general lines on; which we are, building the foundation of the future. There is the control of finance. There is the smaller tribute paid today by those who work to those who own. The Budgets of the Chancellor of the Exchequer have effected a great Control of finance, and a better distribution of pur­chasing power among the masses. The second thing is the transfer of basic industries into public ownership. A third is the control of the land and the planning of the country, not only to the economic advantage of the country but to make it a happy and a beautiful place for our people to live in. There is the direction of capital into the places where labour is. We are not going to have the Depressed Areas again. That is planning. We have an agricultural policy going forward, and it is first time in my recollection that any Minister of Agriculture has had his policy approved by all the workers in agriculture - farmers, workers and the rest. We have had the great building up of the social services, of health and education. There are many other matters too numerous to mention, but that is not a bad achievement for less than two years.Overseas we have been carrying out Labour\u2019s policy. What is Labour\u2019s policy overseas? We have sought to help all our fellow men towards self-government and towards higher economic standards. These problems are not easy. We have sought earnestly to deal with the great problem of India, the problem of Burma, the problems in the Colonial Empire. You heard the account of what is being done in that sphere. We are seeking to promote the economic development of the world in the interests of all peoples - not for some favoured few, as Mr. Nash pointed out so well. We have got away from that idea. We are seeking to develop the resources of the world for a higher standard life for all.In foreign affairs we have been following a policy based on support of the United Nations organisation. We have had a great many Ministers besides the Foreign Secretary going overseas and taking part in international conferences. People\u2019s eyes are too apt to be fixed on certain political discussions and to ignore the work going on in the Social and Economic Council and in the international field. A number of our Ministers, young as well as old, have taken part. And well they have done; and I would like to express my confidence in Ernest Bevin and his collabora­tors. I say that we are seeking earnestly to build up harmony and world peace, and I utterly deny the charge made by some people whose subservience to one great power makes them charge us with subservience to another. We are subservient to none. We seek to collaborate with all.Finally I will say a word on the work that lies ahead. We are not, I think - despite some prognostications in the newspapers - yet half way through this Parliament. We intend to complete our programme. That programme is only an installment of our long-term plan. We intend, with your help and the help of the people of this country, to carry that long ­term plan to completion. Can we carry it out? Well, we can legislate and we can administer, but the implementation of our plan does not depend on the Government alone, or Parliament alone, or the Civil Service alone; it depends on the co-operation of the people of this country. We have gone far now in deciding fairer distribution of the national cake. We must increase the size of that national cake. We must have hard work, good management, true economy and a full use of science if we are to increase the wealth of this country and raise the standard of life of our people. And we must co-operate to this end with other countries. We must raise the amount of available wealth in the whole world. We must march forward together.When we took on this great responsibility I said \u2018We face great difficulties. We have a great opportunity.\u2019 That opportunity has come to the British Labour Movement. It has come to the British people. It is for us to demonstrate to the world that democratic Socialism is the way to peace, the way prosperity, the way to freedom and the way to happiness.  Today there is no coherent alternative policy to Labour\u2019s in this country. Our opponents are bankrupt of ideas. They seek to deck out that shabby garment of competitive capitalism and organised selfishness with shreds and patches taken from our programme. But they lack the essential inspiration. They lack the moral ideal that informs our policy. They lack, in a word, our Socialist faith - the faith that has carried us to power after years of striving, the faith that can remove mountains, the faith in the common people, the faith that we can build a world of peace, a world of justice, a world of freedom, a world of happiness for all. In that faith we shall conquer.

aVThis records the activi­ties of the third year of a great Parliament, the third year of a Labour Government in power. You have before you a description of our activities, and I do not think I should serve you well if I went through all that Report in detail. I should only be telling you what you know so well already. But I would ask you to study the record and note the great variety of problems which we have had to tackle and have tackled; because, to hear some of our opponents talk, you might think that the Government had neglected all other prob­lems in order to pass Bills for the nationalisa­tion of certain industries. We have not neg­lected any part of the field. We have under­taken a great instalment of nationalisation; in the period under review we carried national­isation of transport and of electricity, and the Gas Bill is now surely on its way.There are other very important economic matters which have been the subject of legisla­tion. There is the Industrial Organisation and Development Act and the Agriculture Acts. There is a great group of social service and local government legislation. Perhaps the most outstanding of these is the National Health Service Act. Then there are reforms long overdue which we have had to take up owing to the neglect of past Governments - the Companies Act, the Crown Proceedings Act, and the Criminal Justice Bill now going through Parliament.Then there are measures to make democracy effective - the Parliament Bill, Representation of the People Bill; also very notable measures in this period dealing with India, Ceylon, and Burma, in which we have carried out the long­standing policy of our Party in respect to the extension of self-government to our fellow citizens of the British Commonwealth. We have given proof - I think a unique proof - of the fact that a true democracy seeks to build up on terms of equality and the fellowship of free nations linked together by common consent.I have mentioned only a small part of the legislative achievements of the past year, and I have done so not to make a boast but to pay a tribute to my fellow Members of the Labour Party in both Houses of Parliament for what they have done. In this I include Ministers as well as the rank and file. I have had more than twenty-five years in Parliament, and I have never known such good team work in the Labour Party as we have had in this Parliament. Of course, great publicity is given to any signs of dissent and disagreement or divergencies of view. There are sometimes divergencies that go beyond what is tolerable, and we have had to exclude some members, but I should like to stress the great loyalty of the vast majority of the Party and their steady service. You know that there is not much credit to be gained by working on Committees; there is not much limelight there, not even gaslight, but it is there that the hard work is done by the rank and file. I should like here to say how much we owe to the leadership in the Commons of Herbert Morrison - and of that wonderful veteran, Lord Addison, in the House of Lords, and of William Whiteley, the Government Whip, and his team.The record of legislation is a great tribute to the democratic machine of Parliament. It is very easy to criticise our Parliamentary machine, but you will not find in all the world any other machine which enables minority opinion to find full expression and yet allows the Government to be effective. But the best of machines depend on the men who work them, and the larger the Party the more diffi­cult it is to ensure that every individual has an opportunity of adding his contribution to the general pool. We do try very hard in the Party to give that opportunity. We have the Party meetings. I can remember when the Party meeting contained about thirty people. It is much more difficult when we may have nearly four hundred present. But it is an instrument of decision. We have set up numbers of com­mittees, some on a regional basis, some on an advisory basis, to which members can go and to which Ministers can go so as to get a full interchange of opinion, and I do not think there is really very much need for members who want to make their weight felt to go outside, to issue manifestoes, or to form their little groups. Of course, we always have had a few individualists in our ranks. There is always one who thinks that \u2018Our Johnny is the only one who is in step\u2019 - or should it be \u2018our Zilly\u2019? I have always felt that the right course is to put my views before my col­leagues, discuss with them, and then accept their decision. They may not convince me that they are right, but I believe that the foundation of democratic liberty is a willing­ness to believe that other people may perhaps be wiser than one self.I should like to say here that we owe a great debt of gratitude to Maurice Webb and Frank Bowles. Maurice Webb has been suffering under very severe physical disability; he has carried out his duties with a very fine sense of devotion, and we all hope that his health will improve. I should like also to mention Carol Johnson and his team. I lay stress on the fine team work in the House, because we shall need that team work in the time ahead.May I say that we get fine team work in the Government itself. It is the practice of our opponents for obvious reasons to try to dis­rupt our team - and I am sorry to say that some of our own supporters are also led away - by ascribing particular policies to particular members: Thus they talk sometimes about \u2018Cripps\u2019s economic policy,\u2019 or \u2018Dalton\u2019s financial policy,\u2019 or \u2018Bevan\u2019s dealing with the doctors,\u2019 or \u2018Bevin\u2019s foreign policy,\u2019 as if there was no co-ordination in the Government. Nevertheless there is co-ordination. Whilst every Minister is responsible for his own departmental decisions the collective respon­sibility both in home and foreign policy is with the Cabinet. We share the blame or the credit for every action of the Government. I take my full share of whatever is done by any of my colleagues.I am not much, given to complacency, but I am proud of the Party and of the Government. In the face of great difficulty we are carrying out a clearly defined policy - a policy based on principles and applied to the facts of the situation. That policy today holds the field. There is no alternative policy before the country. I read with great diligence the speeches of Mr. Churchill, a most distin­guished statesman, and of Lord Woolton, an expert salesman, but I have failed to discover any coherent alternative policy. Indeed, one of the features of the present Parliament is the incoherence of the Opposition under the somewhat intermittent leadership of Mr. Churchill. Sometimes the Opposition appears to demand the abolition of all controls; at other times they demand more controls. Sometimes they denounce the control of industry by the bureaucracy of the Civil Service and the dead hand of Parliament, and yet when, with their approval, the nationalised industries were entrusted to independent Boards, and not to Civil Servants, they de­manded that all those activities should be brought under survey in detail on the floor of the House of Commons. There is only one constant feature in the Opposition's tactics and that is their attempt to make capital out of the grievances and hardships which the con­ditions of today produce. They attribute them all to the Labour Government. Lord Woolton has no policy to offer to the public; his only stock is stinking fish.We intend to carry on the work to which we have set our hand and with your help we shall win through. We work in close co-operation with the great Trade Union movement, and let me say how much we owe to their steady support under great difficulties. We work also in close consultation with the Co-operative movement which has recently given a signal example of how they work with the rest of the movement. We are a great united community.I am not going to enter into detailed ques­tions. Yesterday the Conference discussed economic problems and tomorrow it will be discussing foreign policy. But before closing I should like to say a word on the spirit with which we approach our problems. We are engaged on a great venture - an unprecedented venture. We are seeking to build up a free Socialist society by the methods of social democracy. We have rejected all short cuts and suggestions that by laying aside our democratic principles for a time we can more rapidly achieve Socialism. Why is this? It is because the methods by which an end is sought profoundly affect the nature of the end attained. A society changed by undemocratic methods loses the habit of democracy. A society that casts aside in the struggle all moral principles loses those principles. We have seen that where this is done the return to democracy is first relegated to a distant future and then repudiated altogether.Often the reactionary principles employed in a fight for power are not laid aside when that power has been obtained. Socialism is a way of life, not just an economic theory, and in the process of achieving Socialism we have got to be good citizens of the Socialist State. Socialism demands a higher standard of civic virtue than capitalism. It demands a con­scious and active participation in public affairs. I think we have today a greater aware­ness of economic problems, a higher standard of education in public affairs than ever before. But that is not enough. We need today as much as in our pioneer days the idealism, the longing for a just social order, which aroused our enthusiasm and commanded our devotion in the days of adversity, and it is no less idealism for being married to knowledge.When I look at this Report I see before me the achievement of many things for which we of the older generation have striven. There is for instance, the ending of the Poor Law. I recollect joining up with the Webbs and George Lansbury nearly forty years ago in a campaign for the abolition of the Poor Law. It is now accomplished. And yet some people say we move too fast. I recall at the street corner urging a national medical service, urging nationalisation of transport, electricity, and the rest. How formidable were the obstacles which faced us then. Yet they have been overcome, and we shall conquer our present difficulties, great as they appear. But we realise today that the things which have been accomplished are only milestones on the longer journey on which we have set out. The road winds steeply ahead from the point which we are reaching now, and we can see more clearly the hard and rugged features in the landscape which were formerly hidden from us in the mists of the future. Perhaps we realise that the road is longer than we thought in the eager days of the youth of the movement. That does not depress me, for in the Socialist movement our reach has always exceeded our grasp. We are content with no low ideal.It has been said that one of the greatest dangers of civilisation today is that man\u2019s conquests in the realms of science have out­stripped his moral progress. It is the greatest task which lies ahead of all of us in the Labour and Socialist movement to see to it that the citizen\u2019s sense of obligation to the community keeps pace with the changes effected in the structure of society. We need to stress duties as much as rights. The social revolution which we are peacefully bringing about must be established not merely in institutions but in the hearts of men and women. I look forward to the continuance of the spirit of enthusiasm, idealism, and self-sacrifice which has brought us thus far. It will carry us further on our journey to freedom.

aVI thank you very much indeed for that kind welcome, which has deeply touched me. I suppose this is now the fifteenth year in which it has been my duty to move the Parliamentary Report at Conference. When­ever I do it I am always conscious that the work that has been done over the past year has been the work of a team, a team of Ministers in the Government working together, a team of Members of Parliament working together, and a great team of our members throughout the country loyally co-operating. At this Con­ference in the next two days we will be con­sidering a programme for the next General Election. That is right and proper. We are a democratic party. Unlike our opponents we do not ask for a blank cheque. We do not ask for blind confidence in a particular individual. We tell the country quite plainly what we intend to do if we are returned to power and, what is more, when we are returned to power we carry out our promises. We shall fight the next Election as we fought the last Election, on a clearly stated policy. But this time we shall also stand on the constructive efforts of our Party and the Government during the testing period of this Parliament.Mr. Chairman, in that admirable address that you gave us you reviewed in broad outline the work of the last four years. In reviewing the work of, this past year we must not think of it as something isolated; it is just a stage in carrying out a programme, in putting into effect a well-considered programme based on clear principles, a balanced programme, a programme fitted to the needs of the times in which we live, and carried out under the exacting conditions of the aftermath of war. That programme has now almost completely been carried out. It is worth while dwelling on that point, because you know it is most unusual. First of all, it is very unusual for a Government to have a clearly defined plan and policy for its work during the life-time of a Parliament. Secondly, it is most unusual for a Government to carry out that plan. Governments in the past have been content with a haphazard policy. Their legislative programmes have often been based on the exigencies of the moment, on the particular pull and influence of powerful Ministers. Many Governments in the past came in with the resolve to do as little as possible, and many of them succeeded. Administration was carried on on the basis of continuing what already existed, perhaps putting a few patches on a fabric which was regarded as generally satisfactory. We came in under quite different conditions and it is not just what has been done that differentiates the work of the present Parliament from that of its predecessors, but its method of approach, the general attitude to the problem and the tempo with which that work has been done.Let us look then at what has been done during the past year from that standpoint. Let us just see how that fits in with the general work of these four years. Look first at the social services. There we had a tremendous pro­gramme. In former days Governments that I have known if they introduced just one item of our social programme would have plumed themselves on being a great reform Govern­ment. A single effort would have completely exhausted them. But we have in this year completed this great programme. What has been done in this field has evoked the whole­hearted admiration of other nations. I con­stantly meet people from overseas, from other countries and from the Commonwealth, coming to see the pioneer work that has been done here. In this year the National Insurance and Industrial Injuries schemes have come into full operation. May I say that the smoothness and the paucity of complaints with which those schemes have been launched are a tremendous tribute to the work of our Chairman. The National Health Service has been launched. Its success has shown how great was the need. It has been launched successfully despite all the violent attacks on Aneurin Bevan. He had a most difficult problem to deal with. I have never known a Minister of Health who was not criticised pretty violently by the medical profession. But when with a flourish the Leader of the Opposition mounted a tremendous attack on the cost of the Health Services the trumpets had to sound a retreat and there was a com­plete fiasco for Mr. Churchill\u2019s unfortunate lieutenants who were left to lead the assault. But as has been well said, our success in these fields is shown to those of a mathematical mind by vital statistics and to all with warm human sympathies by the splendid condition of the rising generation of this country. Let me add here another great record, that of housing. Not enough to meet the nation\u2019s needs, but that is not due to any lack of magnitude in the efforts or any lack of vigour in pressing on the policy. It is due to the immense legacy of past neglect.Let me turn from the social services to another field, the field of nationalisation. During this year, to the Bank of England, Cable & Wireless, Coal, Electricity, Civil Aviation and Transport, we have added the Gas Industry, and Iron and Steel has now gone through the Commons and is in the House of Lords. That is a remarkable effort. I wonder how many of those who were at Blackpool four years ago thought we should have got thus far. I wonder what our com­rades of 50 years ago would have thought of that record. It will, of course, take time for these great organisations to become fully effective, for we are not ashamed to say that in the practical working out of these services we must learn by experience. The foundations have been well and truly laid and we shall go on, in close consultation with the workers, improving these schemes. We have made a great framework of our nationalised under­takings. We have got to be quite sure we have the spirit to work them in the interests of the whole community. That depends on good organisation, on the right people at the top and also the right spirit throughout the rank and file.It was a common cry of the Opposition that by bringing in these nationalisation schemes we were neglecting other fields of activity. Nothing could be further from the truth. Measures such as the Criminal Justice Act, Legal Aid and a host of others which you will see set out in this Parliamentary Report and its predecessors, form a body of legislation which would have staggered the easy-going Governments of the past. It is notable that so many of these things that we bring in are greeted with enthusiasm by people of all parties as reforms long overdue. They do not like it when we say: \u2018Why didn\u2019t you do it?\u2019 The fact is we get on with the job.There is another field I would like to mention that we have not neglected, which is very important, and that is the amenities field. At one time they used to say Britain was the workshop of the world. Well, it is pretty dull to live in a workshop all the time and some parts of the country look as if they are pretty dull. But our ideal is a Britain for people to live in, to live full lives in, for people to work hard but to have full opportunities of enjoyment. The National Parks Bill has gone through and new towns have been plan­ned. That baffling problem of betterment, neglected for years, has been tackled, and over a great range of activities we are trying to make this country worthy of the people who live in it.I have mentioned these particular subjects, but at the background of all our work is the economic problem, the problem of seeing that you not only get a right division of the nation\u2019s wealth, but get full production of the nation\u2019s wealth. I do not think any Govern­ment has ever had a harder task than we have had in these matters. You see, when you depart from laissez-faire, allowing everything to go haphazard and Governments washing their hands of the economic consequences, you come down to the constant day-by-day work of economic planning which is a tre­mendous burden on the economic Ministries. No one whom we take seriously in the House of Commons suggests that you can throw over everything and go in for laissez-faire, but throughout these four years, particularly in this last year, we have had to have the constant adaptation of our economic efforts to a changing world. We are constantly trying to take away irksome controls, but retaining the controls that are necessary. I am not going to speak to you this morning at any length on this subject. I understand that Sir Stafford Cripps will be addressing you, but I would like to say that in reviewing what has been done in this past year you must always take it in proportion, considering what has been done in past years. That is particu­larly important when you view such a thing as the Budget. That Budget policy has been carried forward by successive Chancellors of the Exchequer on certain quite definite principles. There has been a continuous process of raising the standard of the less well-to-do and reducing the excessive claims of the very wealthy. There has been a con­stant solicitude for the people with family responsibilities. There has been the policy of maintaining real wages by stabilising the cost of living. Our policy on subsidies has been criticised, but it has been of maximum assistance in checking inflation and getting a steady recovery. But after all, we are looking constantly to this question of productivity - the size of the national cake, as has been said. This last year has seen some wonderful advances in productivity and a great response to the needs of the export drive. If you look at what is happening to the economics of this country it is surely very heartening. Look at the state of the land as compared with the semi-derelict state that we had in so many areas between the wars. Agriculture is healthy today. Visit the British Industries Fair. These great achievements have been brought about by the nation in an economy planned for the first time. Look again at the Special Areas and see what has been done there, how hope has succeeded despair. Therefore we can claim that in this field an immense work has been done. But we have to operate in a disturbed world. The continued unsettlement of the world, the delay in making the United Nations Organisation a success, not due to any fault of ours, has obliged us to spend more on defence than we could have wished. But we have not shirked our duty both to our own country and to the democracies and we shall not shirk that duty.That brings me to external affairs. There have been difficult, intractable problems and the Foreign Secretary has shown immense patience and skill. He has combined firmness and conciliation and I rejoice that in these last months he has begun to reap his reward. Western Union, the Atlantic Pact, the Council of Europe, O.E.E.C., the lifting of the blockade of Berlin, are tangible results, the results of following a steady policy, often misunderstood and very often misrepresented by those who ought to know a great deal better. It is showing results and today more than ever before Britain stands out as the rallying point for all the democracies that are real democracies and not veiled autocracies. The Foreign Secretary has ever kept in mind the economic conditions that are needed as the basis of a sound and enduring peace. The recently announced agreement about the Nile waters is but one of the many projects that he has been pressing for to raise the standard of life in those countries where a higher standard is so much needed.In the colonial sphere we have been carrying out a two-fold policy, the policy of ever giving more and more self-government to the peoples of the Colonial Empire and of develop­ing the resources not only in the interests of the natives themselves, but in the interests of the whole world.May I say a word on the sphere of Common­wealth relations. Here we had to meet problems which had grown very great, because our Commonwealth is a living thing that grows and changes and has to be adapted in that process. We have sought by constant consultation to strengthen the ties which unite this great family of free democratic nations who set an example to the world, of co-operation. We regret that Burma and Eire have left the Commonwealth. We rejoice that India, Pakistan and Ceylon, Asiatic countries now free and equal members with the others, remain in the Commonwealth.Every Government has to work in the con­ditions which it finds. It cannot make those conditions for itself; it cannot command success where that action depends on other Governments. I claim that through these four years the Labour Government, loyally sup­ported by the Party in the House, by the great Trade Union Movement, by the great Co-operative Movement, by the whole of our Movement in the country, has deserved well, has been faithful to its trust. It has given leadership to the country and where leadership is given there is loyal support. It enjoys, I believe, a wide measure of confidence. That unbroken series of by-election successes, even when the immediate conditions seemed most adverse, was a wonderful testimony. When the time comes to seek the support of the electorate again we shall stand on a great record.I present to you, therefore, this Parliamen­tary Report as just a part of the work of the Parliamentary Labour Party throughout the past four years. I would like to express on behalf of the Government our gratitude to our members in the Commons, and in the Lords, for there they have a difficult task in all their work. May I mention one or two people by name. I would like to pay a tribute to our Leader in the House of Commons, Herbert Morrison; to Chuter Ede, his able lieutenant; to William Whiteley, the greatest Whip ever; and to the Chairman of the Liaison Committee, Maurice Webb. I would like also to pay a tribute to that grand old veteran in the House of Lords, Lord Addison. But above all I would like to say a word on behalf of people who do not perhaps get so much limelight, that is, the ordinary loyal members. There were a great many appeals yesterday for tolerance. It is an excellent thing, but, you know, I do not think the critics always show very much tolerance for the loyal members. The loyal members are frequently abused for their loyalty, but I have been now in seven Parliaments and I have never known a finer and more loyal Party than we have in the House. We have had to shed one or two on the left and on the right and we sometimes have a few little differences among the others, but the difficulty of pre­serving unity in a Party varies with its size. I remember when we were only 44. A Party meeting was a much easier thing then. But when you have a Party of nearly 400 and when you have the responsibility of govern­ment it is a much harder job, and I would like to thank all our members very warmly. You have to have discipline whether it is in the Party in the House, the Party in the country or the members of a trade union or a co-opera­tive society. Sometimes those who break away get far more publicity than the vast majority, who are loyal.The last year of a Parliament is always the most testing one. The greater part of the pro­gramme has been carried. The Opposition, as the time for a General Election approaches, becomes more active. By magnifying every grievance it tries to deflect the minds of the electorate from the solid work done during all those years. It relies on forgetfulness and on a lack of sense of proportion, and above all it seeks to sow dissension in the ranks of the Government. That is a temptation for all Oppositions. It is particularly a temptation for an Opposition such as we face today that has no policy of its own, that has not the faintest idea as to what it would do if by some misfortune it were called into power. No case - abuse the other side. The moral for us is plain: it is to carry on and preserve our unity.I think it is natural for many of us this week to recall the last time we met here in Blackpool. That was a fine Conference. We had just come through the ordeal of a great war. We had shared the responsibilities of govern­ment for five fatal years. We had then no illusions as to the difficulty of the task which faced the country and faced any Government called upon to take power. We accepted the challenge. We laid down the course we intended to follow. We won a great victory. We have faithfully carried out the policy that Conference approved, and that policy we believed, and believe, was the right policy for this country and the world, the policy of democratic Socialism in which we believe. The 1945 Conference was a historic Confer­ence: it marked the beginning of a new era. This 1949 Conference will also be historic. It will go down to history as the Conference in which account was rendered of carrying into effect a great programme and in which the broad lines of Labour\u2019s second programme were laid down. In between these Conferences great things have been done, but we have no illusions. The task before us is still very heavy. Let us accept again the challenge of the times in which we live. Let us accept it soberly, responsibly and with our faith un­dimmed. And let us remember always that our task is the creation of a society in which the citizens are conscious not only of their rights but of their duties, a society which is based not just on a particular economic system, but on the acceptance of a particular way of life. A Parliament and a Government can make new institutions, but only a great Movement inspired by ideals can make a new society. We can only achieve our aim if the men and women of our Movement are inspired by that same spirit of self-sacrifice, of service to their fellow men, the same vision and the same faith that inspired our early pioneers 50 years ago.

aVMay I thank you very much indeed, on behalf of my wife and myself, for, your kind words and for that very kind welcome.I now have the pleasure of moving the Parliamentary Report. That Report covers a very eventful period since we last met at Blackpool. It falls into two parts: there is, first of all, the final chapter of a great volume, and that volume is entitled 'The Achievements of the Parliament of 1945, and the second part is the first chapter of the volume of the Parliament of 1950. Between those two parts came the General Election.The Chairman, in his admirable and com­prehensive address yesterday, dealt very fully with the achievements of the Parliamentary Labour Party and the Labour Government between the years 1945 and 1950. By the time we had reached the period which this Report covers we had completed the major part of our programme. There remained the Iron and Steel Bill, which was going to and fro, so to speak, between the House of Commons and another place. With its passing by the House of Lords we completed our programme, and the Iron and Steel Bill is now to be implemented in accordance with plans.There were a number of other useful legislative measures though not major measures, but the period under review was really over-shadowed by the increasing severity of the dollar crisis. Far be it from me at this Conference to go into all the technicalities of the dollar crisis in the field of foreign exchange, but in face of the existing situation the Government took the decision to devalue the £. That was roundly condemned by the Opposition, but it has proved to be wise and successful because in the course of this period we have, in effect, pretty well balanced our foreign payments. That was a pretty remarkable achievement. Devaluation, of course, was only one item. The main result was brought about by the good hard work of the people of this country, of all classes, of all types of workers, with efficient leading by the Government.We had at that time also to undertake some slowing down of our investment programme, ­but we made no cuts in the social services. We did not cut into the fundamentals of the welfare state. Here again the Opposition said that what we did was quite inadequate, and so did a great many of the pundits in the press; but when the Budget came along it was found we had judged just about right. Incidentally, you might draw an interesting contrast between the demands that were made for cuts then and the lavish promises put forward by the Opposition when it came to the Election. But this difficult problem has taken a great deal of handling, and I would like, particularly, to pay a tribute to the work of our Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir Stafford Cripps, who has had a very heavy burden, and we all hope that when he returns from a rest his health will be fully restored.Then the other matter that concerned us in that period was the growing intensity of the international position. It saw the strengthen­ing of the forces of collective security by adding to the Brussels Treaty the Atlantic Pact. There the Foreign Secretary did great work and gave a great lead, and that work is being implemented today in the building up of strong forces for the stopping of aggression. That period also saw an important phase in Commonwealth affairs in the decision of India, although becoming a republic, to stay in the Commonwealth.So this memorable Parliament worked towards its close, a Parliament, I think, of unparalleled achievement. Towards the end of a Parliament, when major measures have gone through, there comes a kind of election atmosphere; sooner or later an election becomes inevitable. I would like to say that I have never known a Parliamentary Labour Party work together better and more loyally than that Parliament of 1945. We did, at the end of it, shed a few misfits, who were people who were really in line with the Communists, and at least one who was really in line with the Conservatives. We thought it better that they should go to their real affiliations, and the verdict of the constituencies has amply confirmed the action. We shed a few misfits but we shed very few tears.The work in the House of Commons was good and the work in the House of Lords was good. We have a comparatively small band there, led by a magnificent veteran, Lord Addison, who has just serenely passed through an operation and is very well, so he tells me. There again, very good work was done.May I say too, from the point of view of a Prime Minister and a Party leader, that I do not think any Prime Minister or Party leader has had such continued loyal support from his colleagues. A leader depends entirely on his colleagues in the rank and file as to what he can do. We have had wonderful support and a wonderful unity of spirit throughout.In February a number of our old colleagues who had done yeoman service retired from the Parliamentary Party, and unfortunately a number of good members lost their seats. We increased our vote but we lost a number of seats. There is one point that I notice in some quarters is sometimes forgotten: we won the election. It is very rare for a post-war government to win an election, after five years of pretty hard toil.We came to a new Parliament and there we found quite a novel and difficult position. I have been a member of two minority Labour Governments, and I hope and trust I shall never be that again. I have been one of a splendid majority and I have been one of a very, very small opposition, but I have never been in the position in which I find myself today. There is no exact historical parallel for the present position. There have been small majorities in the past. There was one government which had a nominal majority of five or six, that lasted for a number of years. That was in the days when political affiliations were very fluid. You found a great many members in those days describing them­selves as Liberal Conservatives or Conservative Liberals. There are a certain number of those in the House today. Therefore, there was always in those days the possibility of some re-shuffle and of an alternative government being formed with a party. That is not so in the present House of Commons because our majority, though small, is solid, and our Party is united. In fact, the only danger from the voting point of view in this House is not a question of opinion but a question of health. I would say that in this present Parliament our Members have shown a wonderful devotion, and our Whips have done a wonderful job. May I here pay a tribute to our great Chief Whip, William Whiteley. We are all sorry he cannot be with us. I was still more sorry for the reason: the illness of his wife. I am sure we would all like to wish her every success in getting through this illness.We have accepted the responsibility of carrying on government under difficult conditions. There can be no question of a coalition in peacetime. I think you will agree that the electors did not wish for another election immediately. Clearly, the right thing was for the Party with the majority to govern. But on what principles? Why, on the principles of the Labour Party, of our socialist policy; certainly not on the Conservative policy, and certainly not on the Liberal policy - whatever that may be. There does not exist something that is called a \u2018non-party policy.\u2019 I am rebuked freely in the press for lack of statesmanship, on the ground that I and the Government are carrying out Labour Party policy in respect of the Iron and Steel Bill. The alternative is not \u2018non-party policy,\u2019 it is carrying out the Conservative policy, because a negation can be a policy quite as much as a positive policy. Really, you can see that from our opponents.Herein these publicists show their quite unconscious bias, because they always regard conservatism as normal and socialism as abnormal. It is our task to change that so that people will consider it normal to have a Labour Government and an aberration to have anything else. Therefore we have no intention of carrying out the policy of the Opposition. If they support us in some matters, well and good. If they oppose us, well and good; it is their function. I am not impressed by curious arguments which try to show that the electors decided on this or that particular topic because some 2½ million of them voted Liberal. What people mean who vote Liberal is anybody\u2019s guess. In any case, General Elections are not plebiscites. We believe in carrying out the constitutional practice in this country, and that is that the majority should govern, having due regard, of course, for the opinions of the country and to circumstances. But the intention is that the Labour Government should govern.It is not my purpose to tell you when there will be a General Election - the General Election will come at the right time - but to turn to the period of the 1950 Parliament. Coming late, as it did, in February, obviously there could not be an extended legislative programme. There was the Budget, always a difficult thing to get through at any time in the House of Commons. It is a remarkable thing how, with so small a majority, we got that through, and got it through without any defeats.The whole of this position, however, has really been overshadowed by the increasing need for strengthening our defences. The Chairman, in his speech yesterday, showed what the basis of our Labour policy has been ever since the end of 1918. It is unpleasant to all of us to have to devote so much of our resources to defence, but we have a clear responsibility to this people and to the world to see that freedom shall not go down for lack of defences. The Government is not afraid of taking unpopular steps where those steps are right and we know we have the support of the great mass of our Party.I do not want to anticipate the debate on our programme or the debate on foreign affairs and defence which we are to have this week, but I should like to say this: that the course of the next few years may well decide the future of civilisation for decades or for centuries. We here, gathered at this Conference, must all of us appreciate the importance of the task which we, in our generation, are called upon to perform. We are called upon to give a lead to the peoples of the world because of the strength of our movement in this country and because our policy of democratic socialism is the only dynamic alternative to totalitarian communism. Only through that policy can we get peace and social justice. We have said again and again in times past from this platform that while we need defences to prevent war, our Movement is out to deal with the causes of war; and this Party and this Government has always bent itself to the task of seeking to raise the standard of life of the peoples all the world over, so as to try to destroy the soil in which the seeds of war flourish.Now there is no other alternative. Capitalism, you know, has lost faith in itself. When this Party was formed 50 years ago there was still the buoyant optimism of liberal capitalism. Except by socialists, its moral and its economic bases had hardly been questioned. Today, in the minds of those who support that system, there is question. It is not thought to be the answer. It certainly cannot give the enthusiasm that is needed if you are to conquer the very dangerous fanaticism that seeks to overturn the whole of the basis of our Western civilisation.We have that faith. We have our socialist faith, built up on our belief in the brotherhood of man. We may fail in our practical efforts - it is very hard, we all know, to translate these things into everyday life - but that is the ideal that is always before us. That is what we are seeking to achieve: a real brotherhood of man. We have our faith in freedom. We have our belief in the dignity and worth of the indi­vidual in society. We have our faith in toleration. We have our faith in social justice. We will conquer in that faith.

aVMay I thank you for your very kind and generous welcome. My duty this afternoon is to introduce to you the Labour Party Manifesto for the Election of 1951. We shall discuss it during the next few days and others of my colleagues on the Executive will be speaking to you on various points, so my task is to give you a general introduction to the Manifesto and to commend it to you.We open this Manifesto by saying that we are proud of our record. We have nothing to apologise for and we go into this Election full of confidence. It does not seem a long time ago since the 1950 Election. That Election was a remarkable achievement. It is rare for a post-war Government to survive a General Election in the atmosphere that follows a great war. There are inevitably many hardships, many individual grievances, which would perhaps tend to make people think, \u2018Let us have a change\u2019 and the idea \u2018Let us have a change\u2019 seems to be about the only thing the Tories are putting forward at this Election. But the electors showed a remarkable con­stancy. We had lost no by-election in the previous four and a half years. We came back with a majority, but a small one. And remem­ber, at that Election we told the people the truth. We did not promise them lower income tax, reduced taxation and greater benefits for everybody. We asked them, as an educated electorate, to face the facts of the situation; and that, again, is what we are doing in this Election.During those eighteen months of the 1950 Government we broke another record. For a Government with a small majority to get through eighteen months with no major defeat, with an Opposition thirsting for power, is quite un­precedented. Governments have lasted a long time on a small majority previously, but that was because the Opposition did not want to come in. Our Opposition has neglected no opportunity of trying to defeat the Government. And I want, here and now, to pay a high tribute to the Labour Members, of the 1950 Parliament. They have shown great loyalty, great con­stancy, great endurance. Many of them have attended the House at great personal sacrifice and at great risk; and I should like here to pay a tribute to one who, through illness, cannot be here today, and that is our great Chief Whip, Willie Whiteley.In this year we lost a great man, a great Labour leader, the outstanding Trade Unionist of his generation, a man who contributed an immense amount to the winning of the war and the greatest Foreign Secretary we have had - Ernest Bevin. I should like to pay my tribute to another great servant of his country and of our Movement, Stafford Cripps. He wore himself out in devoted service and we all rejoice that his health is being restored. We hope to welcome him back.Our work during those eighteen months has been difficult and necessarily not very specta­cular, but I should like to say to all of you that there has been no halt in Labour\u2019s advance. Some people take a superficial view and think of our advance as signalised mainly by the passing of particular Acts of Parliament. The real measure of our advance must be taken in looking at what has been done in the field of administration, as well as of legislation. What has been occurring during the eighteen months has been the implementation of the great measures that we passed in 1945. You can pass great measures like our Health Act, the nation­alisation of coal or of gas, or of electricity, but that does not mean that within a few weeks or months you are going to see a complete change in that service or industry. You can only begin the change, and it takes a great deal of time working it out.The National Health Service has been steadily built up, but it is only recently that we got the full report of one year\u2019s activities. In the mines we had to overtake the neglect and mismanagement of decades. On the railways you had the same thing. During these eighteen months great improvements have been made. I would pay a tribute to what has been done by the members of the boards, by the manage­ments and, above all, by the workers in those industries. I shall never forget the appeal that I made in the spring to the miners for extra work. It was not an appeal to their cupidity, it was to their patriotism and their sense of social service, and the response in which they gave us the extra coal we needed was a signal example of the new spirit that you get where there is work for the community.Of course, the Opposition say nationalisa­tion has failed. It has not failed. They say nationalisation was due to an ideological pre­judice. Nothing of the sort. Our nationalisa­tion measures were essential for the recon­struction of the country. The fact that they were in Labour\u2019s programme only shows the prescience of Labour in knowing what the times required. I recall very well Sir John Anderson\u2019s words: \u2018In the case of the Bank of England, Transport, Cable and Wireless, Electricity and Coal the onus of proving the need for socialisation may not unreasonably be held to have been discharged.\u2019 No one expected that we could reap the full benefit of those changes in a few short months. It takes time to work the economy, it takes time even to work the new spirit that is required - and that applies to some of the personnel in those industries who have not yet got the new spirit.These eighteen months have been marked by great progress; but it is progress that must be judged by remembering what the difficulties are. If Len Hutton goes in to bat for England and bats for three hours for 50 or 60 runs it may be an enormously creditable achievement on a very sticky wicket. We have had to bat on a very sticky wicket and great progress has been made. That progress must not be stopped by these great undertakings passing under the control of a Government whose members do not believe in the principle on which they were erected. That principle was the organisation of the economic resources in the interests of the whole of the people.During those years we have had the incessant work of planning. There are a few eccentrics in the House of Commons who do not believe in planning at all. They believe you can go back to laissez faire. There are others on the opposite side who believe in planning, but their objectives are different from ours. I assure you that a government in a modern state must plan the internal affairs of the country and must join with others in planning for a world society, because conditions in the modern world are such that you cannot plan in isolation.We are constantly in touch with our friends of the Commonwealth. Only last week there was a conference of Economic Ministers. We are constantly planning in the United Nations with other nations, because we cannot make progress without co-operation with other nations. Experience has shown that to have effective co-operation you must have control over your own economy. There have been Governments that have rashly abandoned controls, gone to their electors, told them they must give up controls, and they have met themselves coming back; they have had to put back the controls that they rashly abandoned. In our Government we achieved a very great success through the co-operation of all the Ministers and the country, but in particular this is connected with the name of Stafford Cripps.The people of Britain under the leadership of the Labour Government did a great work in reconstructing our viable economy and dealing with that difficult problem of the balance of payments. It was a great disappointment that, just as we were beginning to see daylight, we were forced to embark on rearmament.It is right that in our Manifesto we should give the first place to peace. Peace is a thing that we all desire, but peace does not come about through wishful thinking. Peace is not just a negative absence of war; peace means that you get rid as far as you can of the causes of war.We have taken our stand through very many years, through good or ill, on support for the rule of law. That other great Foreign Secretary of ours, Arthur Henderson, laid down the lines on which we have acted. Throughout we have supported the United Nations and when the challenge came in Korea we unhesitatingly went in with other members of the United Nations Organisation representing the democratic forces of the world. We realised that Korea was a test case we realised that armed aggression had arisen once more in the world and we accepted the logic of the situation, as a matter of respon­sibility, first of all to our own people and secondly to the whole of the free world.It is common practice of our opponents to try and run down Britain in the eyes of the world and to say that we have lost our influ­ence. It is quite untrue. We hold a unique place. From our geographical position we are a vital link between Europe and the New World. From our position as a leading mem­ber of the Commonwealth we bring together nations in all the continents and in particular we unite in one great association the nations of Asia as well as of Europe. Thus Britain has great experience.It is not our fault that the world is divided. We do not wish to see a great gulf between East and West. We have done everything we can to bring them together. We stand ready at any time to meet and deal with the people on the other side of the Iron Curtain. The fault is on their side of the net. They have only to make a real response, a response not only in words but in actions, to be able to get rid of this cloud of suspicion. But we have been forced by their attitude to build up a great non-aggressive treaty of defence, the Atlantic Treaty, and we have had to make our contribution to that.We worked out how much that contribution would be. We had to hold a balance all the time between the necessary support for arma­ments and the support of a viable economy in this country. That programme is going for­ward. We realised that sacrifices would be necessary, but it was essential, if the world is to be free from fear, if we are to get an accom­modation of relations with the other side of the Iron Curtain. I believe that there should be adequate strength in the freedom-loving nations. We do not like having to spend a great deal on arms, but we have to recognise the mentality of the people with whom we deal, who have a materialist philosophy and think in terms of strength.We get a lot of criticisms of our foreign policy. If we act independently we are told we ought to have consulted other people. If we consult other people we are told we are being subservient. The fault is always ours, never the other people\u2019s. In foreign affairs you have got to work with other people and you cannot just lay down your policy and expect everyone to accept it. Believe me, it is a hard life being a Labour Foreign Secretary!We keep a steady course and we have a steady people. That is an essential in a world where there is a good deal of nervousness and where it is easy for people to yield to hysteria. We shall keep on that steady course. We support the United Nations; when disputes arise we take them to the United Nations, as we did in the case of Albania, as we have done in the case of Persia.I am always hearing voices raised clamour­ing for what they call a strong foreign policy. What does \u2018a strong foreign policy\u2019 mean? People who use that phrase are living in the past; they are thinking of Lord Palmerston. Those days have gone for ever. But because we support the rule of law it does not mean that our policy in any case has been weak and vacillating. It does mean that everywhere we do the utmost we can by negotiation.Rearming has inevitably meant an increase in world prices. The fact is that if (as we do), we desire a rise in the standard of living in the world, particularly in all those areas that have had such a raw deal in the past, inevitably we increase the pressure of demand on available supply. Our policy at home has done that. Take electricity: there is a tremendous demand on our electrical resources. Why? Because so many more of our people want to use this amenity. There is a tremendous demand on the telephones unsatisfied. I can remember being Postmaster-General in 1931, and inaugurating a campaign to get people to have telephones. Why was there not that demand then? Because the masses of the people could not afford them.Therefore, you must not be surprised that there are these rising prices. They can only be met in the long rim by increased production in the world. We have been following a policy of abundance. The other way that was tried between the wars was a policy of restriction, of grinding down the demands of the people, with the result that in the 30\u2019s you had what they called a crisis of abundance, because there were things that no one could buy. We do not want to see the clock put back to that kind of thing. The answer is: increase produc­tion and meanwhile we must try and follow out a policy of fair shares.As a result of my visit to Washington last December we have been trying to deal with raw materials on an international basis, trying to get fair shares. At home here, too, we work on a policy of fair shares. Wherever there is this increase of demand and this shortage of supply there are the profiteers opportunity. You will see set out in our Manifesto addi­tional measures that we want to take to deal with those who profit out of the nation\u2019s needs.We have already sheltered our people very largely by such things as food subsidies and price control. We are going ahead with such things as fruit and vegetable marketing; restric­tion of dividends; public ownership wherever it is necessary and desirable; and the policy of redressing the inequalities of wealth, the policy of getting a greater distribution of wealth.Only a few years ago Wales was in danger of losing an enormous proportion of its popula­tion, of becoming derelict. Today Wales is a land of hope and a land of achievement. We have the same thing in Scotland, not only in the industrial belt but in the highlands and islands. You have the same thing in the countryside of Britain. Before the war there was increasing disequilibrium between town and country and here, too, you had those depressed areas. All that has gone and you see today a more prosperous countryside than we have ever had before. You have had a Government that has not only looked at the countryside as a means of producing food, but as part of our great national heritage of beauty. We are now cleaning up some of the mistakes of the past and we are throwing open the beauty of our country to all our people. Under the heading of Social Justice in our Manifesto we draw this contrast between the past and the present, but we are not satisfied with the present; we are pressing on for the future. As I said, the rate of our progress is conditioned by circumstances. We as a Government are always faced with multitudinous demands, all desirable in them­selves. They are pressed by different groups of people and it is good that there should be this enthusiasm. But the task of a Government is to make a decision on priorities and it is not an easy choice. You see some set out in our Manifesto. There is the problem of equal pay. We want to do it, but we have to find a time when we can do it. All these things must be conditioned by circumstances; we must make decisions on priorities.The crucial question of this Election, on which every elector must make up his or her mind, is this: What kind of society do you want? We know the kind of society we want. We want a society of free men and women - free from poverty, free from fear, able to develop to the full their faculties in co-opera­tion with their fellows, everyone giving and having the opportunity to give service to the community, everyone regarding his own private interest in the light of the interest of others, and of the community; a society bound together by rights and obligations, rights bringing obligations, obligations fulfilled bringing rights; a society free from gross inequalities and yet not regimented nor uniform.Our opponents, on the other hand, regard the economic process primarily as the giving an opportunity to the individual to advance his own interests; community interests, national interests, are regarded as a hypotheti­cal by-product. Their motto is: \u2018The world is my oyster; each one for himself.\u2019 The result of that policy can be seen by all. There was the army of the poor; there were the slums; there was beautiful Britain defiled for gain; there were derelict areas. The fruits of our policy can be seen in the new fine generation that is growing up, in the new houses - because we have done a great work in housing. You hear only of the people who are not satisfied. The people who are snug in a Council house do not write to you about it. The fact is that a very remarkable job has been done under great difficulties. You see our new towns, you see our smiling country­side. I am proud of our achievement. There is an immense amount more to do. Remember that we are a great crusading body, armed with a fervent spirit for the reign of righteous­ness on earth. Let us go forward in this fight in the spirit of William Blake:I will not cease from mental strife,Nor shall my sword sleep in my handTill we have built JerusalemIn England\u2019s green and pleasant land.

aVMr. Chairman, Prime Minister of Sweden, Lord Attlee and fellow delegates, the section of the report we are now discussing records the main events of the General Election. But I want to spend my time this afternoon not so much looking back over that exciting and hard fought contest but looking forward to the work of the Labour Government.Before I do this, however, let me add my tribute to what has been said by you, Mr. Chairman, and by other speakers this morning about the tremendous efforts made by every member of the Party in the historic weeks that ended on 15 October, and indeed, over all the months which preceded the campaign.First, may I pay my tribute to Transport House, to the General Secretary and the National Agent and all who worked with them at headquarters, in the Regions and in the Agency Services; to the Publicity Department who, it will be generally agreed, provided a service such as we have never seen before in any general election; to those responsible for the broadcasts and for the organisation of the meetings. But, most of all, I pay my tribute to the workers of this great Movement throughout the country, in safe seats, in marginal seats and in Tory seats, not yet marginal, for their efforts and for their dedication.Let me make this clear. None of us, whether as Ministers or as Members of Parliament are here through our own efforts or our own virtues. We are here because of the countless thousands of our supporters, animated not by thought of personal advantage but by devotion to a great ideal: we are here because of millions of our fellow countrymen who look to us to provide a strong Britain, a healthy Britain, and to create and maintain a new and just order of society.We shall not fail them nor shall we forget our debt to them in all we have to do.The Report refers to our narrow majority. But let us not understate the achievement in having reversed in one campaign an adverse trend that had been at work with increasing force over four previous elections, and in having turned the Conservative majority of over 100 seats into an overall Labour majority.Let me say how, in the light of that narrow majority, we have decided to fulfil our responsibility as a Government. At the first meeting I had with my colleagues, I expressed the view - and this was the position of all of us - that while the narrow Parliamentary majority was undoubtedly a headache for the Leader of the House and the Chief Whip, while it would require the more regular attendance of Ministers in Parliament than is usual (we are welcome there, not for our blue eyes, but for the pair of feet we take to the Division lobbies) it must not affect our work as a Government.I certainly do not underrate the tremendous load falling on members of the Parliamentary Party who by day and by night are working to carry through into statutory effect the principles for which they fought.If Members\u2019 salaries have now at last been brought to an adequate level, we can certainly say that they are geared not only to time worked, but to a substantial increase in Parliamentary productivity.But so far as the function of Government is concerned, we were resolved - let me make it plain - and we are resolved, to fulfil the duties of Government irrespective of short-run Parliamentary - still more - electioneering con­siderations.For two years, Britain has been without a Government because two successive Prime Ministers so conducted the nation\u2019s affairs as to think only of the electoral consequences of any decision they might be contemplating. For 12 months, up to the election, the Government was operating under the instructions of a Prime Minister, who on taking office said:From this moment on, the fact that there is a general election ahead of us must never be out of our minds. Every act that we take, every attitude that we strike, every speech that we make in Parliament or elsewhere must have that in mind.Having been entrusted by the nation with the duties of Government, we intend to govern. No decision will be burked, no deci­sion will be trimmed because of the possibility - however remote in our own minds - of an early election.If we are to look down at our feet the whole time, picking our way through some real or imagined electoral mud, we shall not be able to see the road ahead, still less shall we be able to see the stars that should guide our path.To proceed any other way would make good Government impossible. I believe quite frankly that it would be bad electoral tactics too, because I think the people of Britain want to see a Government acting with firmness and taking the decisions, popular or unpopular, that are called for.We have not, of course, lacked advice. From the moment we took office a beguiling tempta­tion was presented to us. The suggestion was that because we had no overall majority of votes in the country, we had no mandate to act in accordance with the principles we had put before the country.On this argument, no Tory Government from 1951 to 1964 would have had any mandate whatsoever - no mandate for Suez, no mandate for the Rent Act, no mandate for Selwyn Lloyd. But I cannot recall this new doctrine of \u2018a majority without a mandate\u2019 being put forward in those years by those same Conservative sources which suddenly dis­covered it to be a fundamental provision of the British Constitution.But, of course, things have changed: we have a Labour Government so the constitution is different. And now we are told that while the majority does not give us a mandate the twin claims of statesmanship and democracy require us to adopt the policies, in so far as they were identifiable, of a Conserva­tive Opposition which has neither mandate nor majority and whose policies had been decisively rejected by the British electorate.In our legislative programme for the present Parliamentary session, set out in the speech from the Throne on November 3, we made clear our intention to bring before Parliament the measures which we had promised to carry out during the election. Indeed, practically every major proposal set out in our Manifesto is included in the programme which is now before Parliament. I can understand the dis­appointment, even rage, which this programme produced. It was well expressed by a Vicky cartoon showing two Blimps in a club, one of whom said to the other, \u2018I always said you couldn\u2019t trust that fellow Wilson - he is doing exactly what he said he was going to do.\u2019Let me repeat: there is no major item of policy, and few if any minor ones which were set out in my own speeches and broadcasts during and before the election campaign - and I said quite a lot myself in those days - which is not before the House today in the form of legislation or is not in preparation for intro­duction, or is not going through the legislative and administrative machine.Legislation: from steel to the measure - designed to stop land speculation and profiteer­ing - to take urban building land into public ownership. Action is in hand to extend the workings of democracy in British industry, so that shareholders will be informed of any hitherto secret political donations made in their names and with their money.Our programme is honest because we believe it to be related to the needs of this country in the 1960s; it is democratic because we sought and obtained the mandate for it; it is socialist in its inspiration, its conception and its formulation.In the few words with which I wound up our last conference at Scarborough in October 1963, I said then that we should put before the nation a programme designed to restore a sense of economic purpose to the conduct of our national affairs, to restore a sense of social purpose and social justice to our national life, and to increase Britain\u2019s influence and standing among the nations of the world.Through our domestic policies, there run three golden threads: dynamism, compassion and concern for the liberty of the individual. Let me turn first to the problem of galvanising and dynamising the tired and spiritless economy which we inherited.First priority indeed, overlying all our policies, is urgent action to deal with the economic position.No one will now underestimate our econo­mic inheritance, the worst in that its gravity was denied and denied again for political purposes before the election. In January I warned the country of the growing gap between our imports and exports and drew attention to the ominous rise in imports - not materials required for industrial expansion - but, in the main, manufactured goods that we ought to be perfectly capable of making for ourselves on a competitive basis. All we got in reply was a Premier proclaiming pathetically from platform to platform that \u2018the economy has seldom, if ever, been stronger.\u2019 The then Chancellor knew the facts at any rate. He pleaded desperately for an early election. This being refused - and we all know why it was refused - it was the plain duty of the Government which decided to cling to office to take relevant and adequate action to deal with the economic situation. Action taken then would have averted the need for the much tougher action we have had to take. But, of course, to have done so would have been to confess their failure after 13 years\u2019 responsi­bility for the nation\u2019s affairs. And so the situation got worse, though in the election itself every attempt was made to make light of it. I was attacked by the Tories for drawing the country\u2019s attention to the fact that we were keeping going only by borrowing to the tune of £1 million a day. Even I was guilty of understating the position. The deficit was then running at £2 millions a day. And this was the reality behind the election posters which boasted of Tory prosperity.It was symbolic that only an hour or two before Labour was asked to form an administra­tion, the September trade figures were pub­lished showing one of the biggest monthly trade gaps of the year.From the start we treated the economic problem as one of the highest priority. We had to act quickly and relevantly to stop the bleeding. We introduced a system of charges on imports, necessary if imports were to be kept within bounds but doubly regrettable to us. I say \u2018doubly\u2019 regrettable because we were and always have been committed to vigorous action to remove restraints on world trade and to get a freer trading world; equally we were anxious that no one should feel that these temporary charges provided still more protection or encouragement to slothful attitudes in industry.These charges had to be imposed: we regret their effects on our friends in EFTA and the Commonwealth and the rest of the trading world. I repeat they will not be kept on a moment longer than is necessary, that we do not regard them as providing more than a tourniquet to stop the bleeding.But at the same time we began an urgent attack on the endemic problems of British industry, and above all the problems of increasing our exports. New and powerful departments of State were created: the Department of Economic Affairs under our Deputy Leader to take over responsibility for physical planning, responsibility for the preparation and implementation of a develop­ment plan aimed at an increase in those sectors of the economy where strength was imperative, particularly those most relevant to exports and to capital investment.A Ministry of Technology under Frank Cousins to mobilise our scientific resources and, more to the point, to see that the work of our scientists - as good as any the world can produce - was more quickly and effectively applied to industrial processes. This was quick Government action to redeem the pledge I gave at Scarborough when we last met.While our scientific effort is as good as that of any other country, we are still far too slow in applying technology to industry: in far too many cases new industrial processes which stemmed from British discoveries and inven­tions are worked out by keener and more practical industrialists overseas and Britain left in the humiliating position of paying royalties on a British invention.We are planning an urgent attack on the problems of those sectors of industry where Britain not long ago led the world and where our failure to innovate meant not only that we were losing our impact on export markets but that we were rapidly becoming major importers. We are planning - this is Frank\u2019s job - to redeploy our scientific and technological resources so that scientists and engineers who have hitherto been working on costly research and development projects for defence can be turned over to R and D in civil industry to produce new processes, new inventions, new industries with which we are once again going to lead the world.But no one expected - or at least I hope no one expected - the export factories, the investment, the modernisation, the innovation all to become effective in a matter of six or seven weeks. Even with George Lowthian you cannot build a new export factory in seven weeks. What we have to tell the world is that this work has begun, and begun with a will and a purpose, and that before long we shall have a dynamic, robust, thriving, competitive economy.We reinforced the measures to redeploy our physical resources, to streamline our industry, with a tough budget to ensure that action in the physical field was not frustrated in the financial; and I would pay my tribute today to the cour­age of our Chancellor of the Exchequer.I am not going to speculate into the reasons which led to a withdrawal of sterling. Nor is there any profit in condemning those who for any motive were willing to put political prejudice above what should be their first loyalty to this country and to the economic strength of Britain and the sterling area.But just as import charges were imposed because they were relevant to an import drain, so the increase in bank rate was imposed because it was relevant to a financial movement of this kind and this order. This was reinforced by the massive concentration of financial resources by the world community. We had always envisaged that this would be necessary. In my speech in Swansea, which some of you heard, I said then that with a growing export-import problem, stripped of the ability to introduce quick measures that would be needed in the industrial sphere, we should not hesitate to use the reserves and to use interest rates ruthlessly to protect the £. Let no one be in any doubt about our willing­ness to take every measure that is necessary.But let me make this clear; this is not a return to Selwyn Lloyd. We do not believe, as our predecessors did, that the way to deal with a kind of crisis which is endemic in the industrial structure with which they left us, is to bring the whole economy shuddering to a stop.The way to a strong £ is through a strong economy, not by creating unemployment, not by holding production down, raising costs, deterring investment and creating the inse­curity which breeds restrictive practices on both sides of industry.The answer to our problem is to make industry dynamic, to stir more of our manufacturers out of their slothful preoccupation with the easy home market, and it is what we are doing. The answer to our problem is the measures we are taking to increase industrial efficiency, to build up our exports and to substitute home production for imports wherever this can be achieved competitively and economically; to broaden the base of our economy with capital investment; through the training of skilled manpower and the encouragement to accept change, which this Government is providing, to enable us to expand without running into strains and stresses such as have revealed themselves in past periods of expansion.The measures we have taken, the further measures we shall be taking in the coming weeks, will create the conditions in which these problems are going to be solved. I believe that our people will respond to this challenge because our history shows that they misjudge us who underrate our ability as a nation to move, and to move decisively when the need arises. They misjudged our temper after Dunkirk, but we so mobilised our latent and untapped strength that apparent defeat was turned into a great victory. I believe that that spirit of Dunkirk will once again carry us through to success.For as I told the American people in a ceremony on the White House lawn earlier this week, we have great reserves of skill and craftsmanship, of science and technology, of talent for production and design and sales, which now they have been called into battle will produce a result which will delight our friends and surprise the world. This is the mood of Britain today, the determination, the readiness, the eagerness for change which swept Labour to power, and which will now sweep our country to victory in the economic field.Let us be clear what this means. It means new aggressiveness, a new cutting edge in our export drive. It means a new willingness to modernise and to innovate. It means readiness on all sides of industry to sacrifice short-term gain for the longer-term future. It means an end of \u2018I\u2019m all right Jack\u2019 attitudes wherever they may be found. It means a determined attack on restrictive practices on both sides of industry. There is no room in modern Britain for Luddites, be they trade union Luddites or boardroom Luddites. This country cannot afford now - if it ever could afford - unofficial strikes, wasteful stoppages, long, weary arguments about industrial demarcation, any more than we can afford out-of-date industrial methods, industrial promotion based on influence and connection rather than technical ability, or management attitudes which give a higher priority to tax avoidance or the earning of quick, uncoven­anted capital profits than to modernisation and innovation in industrial production methods, or aggressiveness in exports.Above all, whatever our role in industry, our approach must be not what we can take out of the national pool, but what we can put into it. For only by a massive sense of dedication, by every individual can we get the national sense of purpose that we need. And with economic purpose, social purpose, based on a nation which cares. I quote again those words of President Roosevelt, which I used in my final Party Political Broadcast on 12 October, three days before polling day: \u2018Better the occasional faults of a government living in the spirit of compassion, than the consistent omissions of a government frozen in the ice of its own indifference.\u2019The first Bill we introduced in this Parlia­ment was a small one but one close to my heart; one for which I and the Chief Whip and others have been fighting for years - a simple little measure to restore to local authorities the power to allow old age pensioners and others to travel free on municipal transport under­takings. (Applause) Not much, perhaps, but the whole force of the Tory Party was mobilised against it for nine years. But our major decision in the social field was to raise the level of retirement pensions and other benefits and war pensions, and to abolish prescription charges. And together with that, that long overdue act of social justice - to abolish the earnings rule for widows. For the election we promised early legislation to take our old age pensioners, the long-term sick and disabled out of the rut of poverty in which after 13 years of Conservatism they still remained.I share your disappointment that although the legislation was quickly introduced, and quickly passed through the Commons, it is not possible to start the payments when they are most needed - in the winter; though special provisions have been made to help those on National Assistance with their fuel costs. But for heaven\u2019s sake, don\u2019t let us get on the defensive about it. Some remarks I have read suggest that this Government, which was prepared in the midst of difficult economic circumstances to act where our predecessors had not acted and - if they had been returned - would not have acted, is a Government of unfeeling Scrooges. Let us put the responsi­bility where it clearly lies. If the Conservative Government of Sir Alec Douglas-Home had decided that pensions should have been increased, and if they had started the preparations in July or August, we could have had these increases in force by Christmas. Even without such an unrealistic assumption; if the Conservatives had only bequeathed to us a machine - perfectly easy to devise given time - which was more flexible and resilient to a Government decision of this kind, we could then, from the moment that Peggy Herbison was authorised by the Commons to go ahead after 16 October, have still had speedier implementation.Let the country know where the blame lies and let them see for themselves - when we have to face and Peggy has to face Conservative questions and speeches in the House - the nauseating hypocrisy of those who, when they could have acted, did not. Let us .ask the country what it thinks of a Party that has not the courage to vote against the pensions increase, but seeks unworthy electoral capital from voting against the provision of the money to pay for it. Because if you vote for the pensions increase and against Jim Callaghan\u2019s budget, you acquiesce in the end while rejecting the necessary means. This is an example of the irresponsible approach of which they wrongly accused us in the 1959 election, and which Hugh Gaitskell had to face.Again, our decision to introduce the repeal of prescription charges shows how different our conception of social justice is from that of the Conservatives. In successive economic crises, Tory Chancellors - Mr. Macmillan in 1956, Mr. Selwyn Lloyd in 1961 (aided and abetted by Mr. Enoch Powell; a formidable combination) insisted on placing additional burdens on those least able to hear them, the old and the chronic sick. This was their reaction to economic difficulties. Neither did they, as the economic position improved in preparation for successive elections, remove these burdens even though hundreds of millions were being handed out in tax con­cessions on the eve of each planned election. We have introduced these wide-ranging increases as a right, and as a right of all our citizens, which is due to them because of what they have done for us and the nation; not in any patronising, condescending Tory spirit of \u2018donations.\u2019We have acted firmly and decisively on housing. In every election speech we pledged the Labour Government to repeal the Rent Act and to restore security of tenure to those who had been robbed of that right by the Tories. Here, again, we acted quickly. To prevent a rush of evictions, the Minister of Housing and Local Government introduced immediately a measure to provide security of tenure. Equally, and this is an issue of great importance to our people in our older cities, he has announced to Parliament our intention to fulfil our pledge to proceed with leasehold enfranchisement. I said that our third objective is not merely to maintain but to enhance the freedom of the individual: We are democratic socialists, our Movement exists because we fight for people, not in the mass but as individuals. Because we believe in planning, and precisely because we do, we have to ensure that not only does Socialist planning not infringe freedom but that in everything we do we extend and make more real the freedom of the individual in an increasingly complex society. And, if anyone wanted proof of our determination, they could not find it better than in the widely welcomed appointment of Gerald Gardiner as Lord Chancellor, or our law officers, and the Minister in the Commons who will be occupied full time on working with the Lord Chancellor on measures of law reform.It was the post-war Labour Government that initiated the right of the individual to sue the Crown and which introduced legal aid. In that spirit, our appointment of law commissioners to cleanse the legal system of the mustiness and fustiness of centuries and our proposal for a Parliamentary Commissioner to examine the grievances of individuals against organised society, are conceived.You will expect me to say a word about the Parliamentary Opposition. I do not intend to spend much time on them - there are more important things to talk about. But at a time of goodwill, let us spare a thought for them. Let us not condemn them too harshly, for remember that these are men who thought that at birth they were ordained by Providence to rule over their fellow citizens; and to find themselves rudely deprived of the powers they exercised cannot have been easy for them. There may be some who would condemn the tactics and extravagances of individual Con­servative leaders, but let us remember that they are in a competitive situation. It may take a little time while the machinery of the Conservative Party evolves out of the existing democratic system of leadership election a new and more shining example of democracy in action, but even though it may take some time there are already on the Conservative Front Bench some who are turning their minds to the problem of the succession.Let us, therefore, in judging, recognise the pressures to which they are succumbing. Do not let us be too surprised about the total disunity they are showing on some of the most urgent issues of national policy. Mr. Maudling\u2019s conscience impels him to support our diagnosis of the economic situation and the remedies which we decided were essential; Mr. Heath condemned both. And should these two, after the succession has been decided, ever come to agree with one another, there will always be Mr. Enoch Powell, the Savonarola of modern Conservatism, to burn his leader\u2019s sacred relics. It is a fact that within one month of the Tory Front Bench preparing the fatted calf, or at any rate the shadow fatted calf, for his return, he succeeded in brusquely dismissing any idea of an incomes policy which has been a main theme of Tory economic arguments for so long, in rejecting any idea of economic planning to which we thought the Tories had claimed to be converted - to say nothing of his anti-Commonwealth principles. Between them they have already destroyed any claim of the Tory Party to provide a responsible and united Opposition, and we need a responsible Opposition in this country. Do not let us get away from it. But some day, when there is time from more urgent work, we will have to ask the Leader of the Opposition where he stands, with Mr. Maudling, Mr. Heath, or Mr. Powell, on all these questions. Because a Party aspiring at some distant day to act as an alternative Government should really have a fairly clear idea of where it stands on such fundamental issues as economic planning, incomes policy and our relations with the Commonwealth.Thirdly and finally, Mr. Chairman, I want to make clear to the Conference our ideas for increasing Britain\u2019s strength and influence for peace. Next week in Parliament we shall be having a debate on the Washington talks and on wider aspects of foreign affairs. I will not anticipate now the speech I hope to make then if in fact I am successful in catching Mr. Speaker\u2019s eye. I shall, of course, present to the House a full report of our Washington negotiations. Perhaps I had better make one thing clear. There were two conferences in Washington. There was the one that Patrick Gordon-Walker, Denis Healey and I attended and there was the one that I read about in certain sections of the British Press. The House of Commons will, I think, expect me on Wednesday to deal only with the one I attended.You know, I cannot understand why, since this Government came to power, we have had this long succession of Press stories presented - not just speculation or theorising, and that this may be happening or that Minister may be considering or even rumour about what we have said or done, but stated as a fact and in terms which might lead an innocent reader even to believe the stories to be true. In a period of seven weeks I cannot tell you how many Cabinet meetings I have read about which never even took place, or how at those which did take place we discussed subjects which have never been on the agenda; or how in these discussions which did not take place this or that Minister expressed a particular view on these undiscussed subjects and disagreed violently with another Minister, both having attributed to them views which they do not even hold, on subjects which were not discussed at meetings which had not taken place. Apart from those minor qualifica­tions you can take the stories for the rest as being broadly accurate.But there is a more serious thing: yesterday a London evening newspaper ran in successive editions as a main headline, as a \u2018fact\u2019 - no suggestion of rumour or anything of that sort - a flat story that I had given the President of the United States a secret pledge that we were prepared to participate in a mixed-manned surface fleet. This story is a lie. No such pledge was given. I had myself already stated flatly to the Press, and on television, on my return to this country on Thursday night, before this story ran in the paper concerned, that we had totally reserved our position on this question and yet despite that the editor of that paper on Friday disdained to print the truth and chose to headline the untruth.. It is not for me to remind such editors or journalists - and thank God, they are in a small minority - of their code of conduct in these matters, because there is a code of conduct relating to just this question. All I can say is that we shall not hesitate to state the truth which we know to counter the lies which they print.Having dealt with that let me now outline to this Conference the principles on which our foreign and defence policies are based, and I say foreign and defence policies because they must proceed in unity. We must not get into the situation again where short-sighted considerations of so-called defence make im­possible a foreign policy which can lead the nations to peace. And, equally, there must be a unity between our defence and our economic policies. What was wrong with the Tory defence policies was not only that they were misdirected but that they did not add up. They were not related to what this country could afford whether in terms of money or in terms of real resources.Britain\u2019s authority, as we have heard, depends far more on our economic strength and independence than on nostalgia or nuclear pretence. From now on, defence expenditure at home and abroad must be strictly related to what the country can afford. I am glad to say that this realism dominated the approach of every single participant in the recent Chequers Conference on defence policy and dominates the approach of the Government to the preparation of a new realistic and effective defence posture. Equally, I was glad to find that in Washington, President Johnson and his colleagues as well as the British Ministers were concerned to relate defence policies to the economic realities of both our countries. And let this be clear. An approach based on cost-effectiveness, value for money and a hard reappraisal of some of the sacred cows that we have inherited will, so far from weakening the efficacy of our defences, make them stronger and more relevant to Britain\u2019s task in the world.But turning to the broad lines of our world policy let me say first that we place at the centre of our approach to world problems the strengthening of the United Nations and its ability to keep the peace. Our new Govern­ment has had to live down the suspicion of those who have associated the name of Britain with Suez or with flat defiance of the United Nations at the time of the Katanga crisis or with the anti-internationalist speech of a then Foreign Secretary who went on to become Prime Minister. I believe there is a new realisation in the world today that Her Majesty\u2019s Government believe in the United Nations and will work for the rule of law in world affairs. I believe that our appointment not only as Ambassador to the United Nations, but as a full member of the Govern­ment, for the first time, of Hugh Foot - a great internationalist - is taken by the whole world, and not least by our friends in the Common­wealth, in Asia and in Africa, as a pledge of our sincerity. We have imposed an embargo on the shipment of arms to South Africa - we were obliged to do it - we have had to face the most vicious campaign of opposition and incitement by our opponents, led by the Leader of the Opposition. I believe this decision has been taken as an earnest of our desire to place ourselves again with our Commonwealth colleagues in conformity with the United Nations\u2019 decisions and in a posture of resistance to racialism in all its forms.But this is not enough. We need to streng­then the peace-keeping powers of the United Nations. We shall co-operate with our friends and allies in any steps that can be taken within the Charter to strengthen those powers, and we shall seek the opportunity wherever it may occur to improve the Charter wherever this is desirable. I believe that in the years immediately ahead of us, the world is presented with an opportunity and a challenge such as we could not perhaps have hoped for even a few years ago - an opportunity of which our fathers, the pioneers of this movement, dreamed - and that is: an opportunity to create a genuine inter­national peace-keeping force powerful enough to bring peace and order out of chaos, powerful enough to stop small wars from escalating into big ones. We, the Government, are hard at work to see that this opportunity is not allowed to pass by and we are prepared to contribute not only ideas but resources to provide a practical British contribution to the peace-keeping forces of the United Nations.Secondly, we seek to strengthen our alliance. This has been one of the main sub­jects that we have discussed in Washington. Over the past two years, particularly since the Nassau agreement, stresses and strains have developed within the Alliance, and there has been dangerous talk - if not intention - of the development of nuclear status by one or other member of the Alliance. The biggest danger the world faces today, and I put this beyond all other priorities in international affairs, is the danger of the spread of nuclear weapons. Heaven knows Britain under the previous Government never took the opportunity we then had to give a lead in internationalising the bomb. Heaven knows the previous Government, at the very moment when a lead had been given which could have led to an effective ban on nuclear proliferation, was prepared itself to resist that ban, to ignore that lead, and to encourage nuclear separatisms in others. And it is precisely because of this danger to mankind, which rests in the spread of nuclear weapons, that in the vitally import­ant talks in Washington this week, the emphasis was laid by both of us on collectivising NATO\u2019s nuclear power, and above all to do it in such a way as to stop the danger of any more fingers on the nuclear trigger.If that were all that had come out of our Washington talks - the united and fixed determination of the President of the United States and ourselves to do everything in our power to stop the spread of these horror weapons - that of itself would have provided enough justification for our meeting. But the great theme of our discussions was the fact that we were looking outwards, not inwards, outwards to ensure more effective peace­keeping forces, outward in our determination to seize any opportunity - and if none exists to create one - to put forward new initiatives towards arms control and disarmament. And here again, we have in Britain\u2019s Labour Govern­ment, for the first time a Minister of Dis­armament working full time on the initiatives that Britain will be proposing.You know we heard a lot at the Election designed to suggest that a Labour Government would not be in on these international discussions - we would not have a ticket. Let me make it clear that within seven weeks of taking office we have not only been partners - and I mean partners - in one of the most important international discussions since the war; we have for the first time for many years tabled a distinctly British initiative for which our friends and allies have been waiting. We shall be there at the Conference table and we shall be wanted as long as we have anything to contribute. The years of sterility are over and we now have a Government ready and able to take initiatives for peace.And our third objective, Mr. Chairman, is to work with the overwhelming majority of mankind towards the objectives with which mankind is concerned. This is why our membership of the Commonwealth is of such fundamental importance for world peace, and I am glad that our American friends empha­sised, as never before, their recognition of Britain\u2019s world-wide role, their realisation of the importance of Britain in the Common­wealth as a force of peace. In terms of modern economic and military strength, Britain alone can never exert the influence which Britain in the Commonwealth can exert. That is why it has been so important that with our decisions on South Africa our Government quickly and decisively showed its clear deter­mination to rejoin the Commonwealth and to quit our position of abject isolation. This is why by the creation of a Ministry of Overseas Development with a voice in the Cabinet - and a pretty powerful voice at that - we have shown our determination to play our full part in what I described in Washington as the only war we seek - the war against poverty and hunger, illiteracy and disease. This is why too in the great world struggle between those who believe in racial freedom and equality and those who side with their oppressors, the voice of Britain must be unequivocally heard on the side of freedom and equality. In my speech at Scarborough I said:There is no standing aside, no comforting refuge in abstentions or vetoes, we are either against oppression, or we condone it. In these issues, there can be no neutrals, no escape. For in this shrinking world, while political isolationism invites danger, and economic isolationism invites bankruptcy, moral isolationism invites contempt.We gave our pledge and as a Government we are fulfilling that pledge. Just as President Johnson fought his campaign on the issue of civil rights and won because of the courage he showed, so we have ranged ourselves clearly against racial incitement, racial dis­crimination and the evil exploitation of racial­ism which still goes on in our own country. For it would be hypocrisy to condemn racialism and colour prejudice and apartheid abroad if we tolerate it in Britain - or in our own Party. There have been those who have criticised my actions at the very outset of this Parliament in making this a major issue of challenge between our two Parties. I do not apologise. The section of the report we are debating relates to the general election. And every delegate here today knows that while the Conservative Leader had finally dragged out of him on television an assertion of the principle of equality in this country, a condemnation of racialism, nevertheless on the doorstep there were Conservatives, to say nothing of their near-Fascist allies, who were prepared to exploit primitive and ignorant passions for the squalid purpose of winning unworthy votes.Your Labour Government has announced its intention to legislate against racial intoler­ance. Your Labour Prime Minister has challenged the Conservative Leader to come out of his shell and to associate himself with that group of courageous Tories, Sir Edward Boyle and others, who were prepared in the election to lose votes rather than deal in the sordid currency of racialism.But if we are to condemn, our hands must be clean. And in your name I have condemned and will condemn every so-called Labour Club which operates colour discrimination and every group of misguided workers who try to operate colour prejudice in their working relationships.\u2018He hath made of one blood all nations to dwell upon the Earth.\u2019 This Labour Party of ours is more than a political organisation: it is a crusade, or it would be better that it did not exist.So, Mr. Chairman, I present Conference with our blueprint for the future. It is not the result of feverish activity of seven weeks in office, though there is plenty of that going on. It is the result of patient work in the National Executive, in the Parliamentary Party, in working parties and advisory groups which have employed the long years of opposition to good purpose, even at times when it seemed that we could not see an end to those years: men and women who were prepared to dedicate their abilities, their experience, their enthusiasm, their idealism to building for the future.But it has been far more than that. The purpose to which we have now set our hand is a distillation of the thinking and the idealism of the democratic traditions of this country over a century past.It is easy to be a Socialist today. It no longer means victimisation, eviction from one\u2019s home, persecution or worse. But the founders of our Movement, men of courage, men of infinite faith, were prepared to face persecu­tion and even death that a generation still to come might realise their ideals, might be permitted to create that new and just society which their vision could see gleaming above the squalor and exploitation and ugliness of Victorian industrialism. Now, as a result of the faith which they bequeathed to us, as a result of the courage of men and women in this room today, who have kept the flag flying - 33 years ago when our enemies thought this movement of ours was destroyed - as a result of the efforts of everyone in this hall and countless others in these past few months, the day for which we and those that went before us have waited is here. It is our task to be worthy of the torch they have handed on to us.For we meet today in these exciting first weeks of what is only the second Labour Government to be elected with power. Never in our history has Britain stood so greatly in need of the principles which our faith can generate: rarely in world history has this country been given such an opportunity to give a lead towards peace and disarmament and world brotherhood.Sustained and inspired by our great people, I give you this pledge: that we shall not fail, that from our endeavours we shall build a fairer, a more just society, that from our faith and. our ideals, we shall contribute our full meed towards creating a world of peace.

aVMr. Chairman and fellow delegates, I present to Conference the Parliamentary Report. The delegates here, and those whom we represent here today, were responsible by their unremitting and dedicated efforts for the election to Parliament, for the first time for 13 years, of a Labour majority. And it is entirely right and fitting that in the name of that Labour majority I should today report back to you. In every phase of the tough year through which we have gone, we have never for one moment forgotten those who put us there, the ideals for which they fought, the sacrifices they have made: for every one of us realises that not one of us would be in Parlia­ment today as a result of his own efforts, but that we are there as representing a determined people.When the country voted a year ago, it was not just a decision to replace one group of men and women by another, as in the long history of \u2018ins\u2019 and \u2018outs\u2019 which characterised an earlier phase of our Parliamentary history. The country took a decision. It was a decision for a New Britain, for a more positive and purposeful Britain - a Britain in which our economic resources would be planned and mobilised for the welfare of the British people as a whole \u2013 yes - but more than that, for the strengthening of Britain's influence in the world. It was a decision that our latent economic strength, measured not in terms of industrial buildings, and plant and machinery, but in terms of the innate skills and energies of our people, should be purposefully deve­loped year by year, in fulfilment of an economic and social plan - and not contemptuously and fitfully organised on a stop-go-stop cycle directed less to Britain\u2019s strength and well­being than to the electoral success of the Party of privilege. It was a decision that the economic strength, which has so long lain dormant and only partially realised, should be used to build a New Britain - a Britain that cares - a Britain that rejects the distortion which Tory policies and Tory philosophies had created. It was a decision - last October - springing from a sense of frustration - of shame even, at a distortion of our society which had come to exalt private gain and purely material affluence and which had sacrificed to that scramble for material affluence the social priorities - social affluence as opposed to private affluence - which is the hallmark of a civilised society.It was a decision that the old closed circle of opportunity based on family connections and school connections should go and should yield place to a land of opportunity for every boy and girl - for every man and woman - equal opportunity in our schools, equal opportunity to the right to higher education in all its forms, equal opportunity for the keen and thrusting and trained men and women in industry to get to the top. It was a decision that not only our industrial system, but every aspect of our national life that has been corrupted by the doctrine of a self-perpetuating establishment, should give way to an open society where knowing your job would mean more than knowing the right people.It was a decision that national purpose should override sectional interests and that just as social good should take priority over private gain, so earning money should take precedence over making money. It was a decision for change, not change for its own sake, but change, radical and dynamic, for economic and social purpose. It was a decision that this second industrial revolution (which Harold Collison has just referred to) should be tempered with a humanity that was lacking from the first industrial revolution, a lack indeed that led to the creation of this Labour Movement.It was a decision, in short, that Britain should have a government and that that government should govern.For Britain for a long period before the last election had had no government. Whatever limited ideals and policies had animated the incoming Tory Government of 1951, had long ago lost their fire. The Conservative Govern­ment had remained in office in a posture of almost total abdication, content to leave the basic decisions that affected Britain's economic life to the irresponsible and faceless controllers and manipulators of the centres of economic power. And drift and lack of purpose at home had led to drift and lack of purpose abroad.It was this abdication, this refusal either to take the decisions that had to be taken, or to make way for those who would; it was this sacrifice of decision to electoral manipulation that more than anything else created the formidable problems which have dominated the past 12 months - the first year of this new Labour Government.One thing I think, Mr. Chairman, you will allow me to say.For nearly a year now, Britain has had a government, prepared to tell the nation the facts, prepared to talk in the gritty accents of reality, to tell the nation what had to be done, and unafraid to take the decisions that have to be taken, regardless of their short-run political popularity or any long-run electoral considerations.We said it would not be easy. We said, in the spirit of the imperishable philosophy of Nye Bevan, first proclaimed here in Black­pool, that our actions would be governed by the language of priorities.Time and time again before the election, we warned that our entry into office would be dominated by a deep-lying industrial and trade crisis. A crisis which in the event, was made immeasurably graver by their postponement of the day of electoral decision, and their failure in those humiliating months to take the decision that had to be taken.When we issued those warnings, and I can take you back to a whole series of speeches beginning in Swansea in January, 1964, we underlined three things.We underlined first, that we should be facing this crisis with a limited range of financial weapons which would be all that they would bequeath to us, but that we should use these weapons to the full, if necessary, to make Britain strong and sterling strong, whatever it meant, and however this might appear contrary to our broad long-term policy. We said that long before the election.But we said, secondly, that while we were doing this, we would be taking every measure open to us not only by refurbishing and modernising the financial weapons, but also by creating new and more selective weapons of economic policy, to ensure that Britain should no longer be fated to plunge into a trade and payments crisis every time we dared, fitfully, for a few months, to break out of economic stagnation into a short period of expansion.For we said that the condemnation of the Conservative stop-go-stop cycle was not merely their emphasis on stop. It was their failure all the time to build up our economic strength, to broaden our industrial base with more and modern equipment, to speed the training of skilled labour - so that we could break out of this cycle of crisis.And the third thing we said - and all this was said before the election - was that if we faced a crisis, we would not, as happened in the bitter years that have followed each Tory election victory - seek to solve our problems by placing the greatest burdens on those least able to bear them; on the old, the sick, the disabled, the children. And neither would we hold back in a general freeze, the urgent task of bringing work to those areas where work was needed.Although the Parliamentary Report I am presenting today has been dominated throughout this past year by the economic situation we inherited, it would, I think, be wrong for me to deal in detail with either the crisis and its causes, or with the action we have taken because the First Secretary of State and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, if they catch your eye, Mr. Chairman, will be dealing with this on Thursday.It is for me only to draw out one or two central themes. One - we have met the successive developments of this crisis by decisions, by measures, that have been taken, measures which were not only relevant to the current need and the current problems and the current state of sterling, but were also relevant to the deep, underlying, longer-term problems we are facing. And equally, and no one would question this, the measures we have taken to rid this nation not only of the economic crisis that we inherited but of the industrial inadequacies, the industrial dis­tortion which underlay and caused that crisis - those measures that we have taken have been opposed, misrepresented and irresponsibly misused by the very men who bore the responsibility for the crisis and who, for their own unworthy reasons, had failed to take the decisions which they knew, and which they know, to have been necessary.My second point is that while we have had to use the rusty and outworn weapons they left to us, we have from the outset been making an attack on the root causes of our economic problems. We have attacked irrelevant and costly prestige defence projects. We have attacked the problem of our un­controlled capital exports. We have attacked the problem of our unbalanced investment programmes and the problem of government expenditure. But above all through the National Economic Development Council, through the separate councils for individual industries, through the Ministry of Techno­logy, we are engaged now on a great campaign to make this country technology-conscious and to speed the application of the fruits of scientific research to our industrial processes.And, Mr. Chairman, they fought us: they fought us on the aircraft cuts - the Conserva­tives, aided and abetted by the Liberals in their Censure Motion on the aircraft cuts; they fought us on our attack on the debilitating freedom of the City to export abroad capital which we needed at home; they attacked us on our policies to modernise industries - all the things we have done have been resisted and opposed by day and by night by the Conserva­tive Opposition.The long process of filibuster and delay on the Finance Bill has been presented by certain sections of the Press as though all that was involved was a cliff-hanging exercise in Parliamentary majorities and a long drawn-out Tory selection conference. But what was really at stake was this: the most fundamental reform of our system of taxation which Parliament has seen for over half a century - and we did it with a majority of three. And let it be noted that in this Finance Bill battle, there were 107 divisions in which the Liberals - shades of the 1909 People\u2019s Budget - voted 13 times with the Government for fiscal modernisation and 94 times with the Opposition against fiscal modernisation.There they were, Conservatives and Liberals alike, with modernisation on their lips, voting with their feet against urgent measures of fiscal reform. And what they were fighting against was the Government's attack on the expense account racket; against an effective capital gains tax; against the Corpora­tion Tax, which when it is stripped of all its technical detail was a measure to get industry to plough back more of its profits into expan­sion and re-equipment and modernisation and to distribute less of those profits as dividends; and when it is stripped of all its detail was a measure to ensure that less of our investment capital is exported abroad and more of it is kept where it is needed, here in Britain. For that Budget and that Finance Bill were directly relevant to our industrial problems. But they were more than that, they were an essential part of the task of creating a fairer Britain, of eliminating economic and fiscal privilege, they were an essential element in creating the climate of social justice that we always said would be necessary if we were to appeal to all sections of the community for restraint, for sacrifice of personal advantage in the matter of prices and incomes and productivity. How could George Brown have gone to Brighton if we had not carried through the Finance Bill first?Fourthly, we have the whole relevance of the National Plan to our future policies for industrial expansion. As George Brown will be dealing with this on Thursday, I don\u2019t propose to say anything about it now. This is a breakthrough in national economic policy. It is more than that. It is also a breakthrough in the whole history of economic government by consent and consensus. In a very real sense, the publication of the Plan marks the beginning of phase two of the work of this Parliament and of this Government.Because, after a year in which our first preoccupation was how to weather the storm, the whole world realises that despite the sour pronouncements of our opponents, we are now getting within measurable distance of balanc­ing our overseas payments. The economy is strong. Sterling is strong. Employment is strong. But let no one under-rate the weight that we have been carrying in facing this economic problem over this last year. Indeed, because our first year, which is the period covered by this Report, has been utterly dominated by the economic situation they left us with, it would have been perfectly under­standable if I had had to stand before you this morning and to say that because of that econo­mic situation I was sorry but we had lost a year in starting the attack on the problems we were facing last October: if I were to stand up and say that we have not been able to build the New Britain because we had a demolition job to do first, to clear away the damage left by the Tory economic crisis. If that were what I had to report, I would not have apologised to this Conference.But, in fact, this has been one of the most productive years in British Parliamentary history. It has been a year of Government. It has been a year of active and progressive legislation. The Parliamentary Report lists­ - and I am not going to go through the whole list - the massive legislative programme that we have carried through the House of Com­mons, or will have carried into law by the time this session finally ends next month. As one reviews this record it brings back to me all that they were saying a year ago, when they said that Labour would not be able to form a government. \u2018The chaps weren\u2019t there.\u2019 All right. Man for man, woman for woman, I challenge comparison between every member of the Labour Front Bench and their pre­decessors. I will go further. Man for man, woman for woman - I challenge any Tory editor to answer this (I hope you will pass this message on), and to make a comparison between every Labour Front Bencher and his Tory Shadow Cabinet opposite number - always supposing that any single Tory editor even knows at any moment of time who the opposite number is.Indeed, I would go further. Even if - and heaven forbid - all of my colleagues and I were to get under an illuminated tram tomorrow - every one of us - you could form out of our present second-eleven, our Ministers of State and Parliamentary Secretaries, a Cabinet and top Ministerial team at least as good as we present to you now, and far better than anything our opponents could put for­ward. You don\u2019t win either the F.A. Cup or the English cricket championship unless you have got good reserves.So, \u2018Labour could not form a government.\u2019 That was one of the things they said a year ago. Another thing they said was that we would not have firmness of purpose, that we would not govern with authority, that we should be pushed around. We have not been pushed around. We have not been pushed around abroad, and we have not been pushed around at home - and we are not going to be. This is government of the people, it is govern­ment by the people, it is government for all the people. And the accent is on government.Let me remind you of something else they said. That with a majority of three we could not get through major legislative programmes. And certainly all the time, while we have been doing this, there has been this anxious pulse-taking about our majority by pollsters and by Press alike. Day to day medical bulletins in the national Press. It has, in fact, been a diversionary Opposition tactic to concentrate attention on the size of our majority and not on the measures that that majority was systematically carrying through the House.Let me give you the figures. In this session so far, there have been 268 divisions. Thirty-nine of these were free votes - an unusually high proportion. Two hundred and twenty-nine, therefore, were straight confrontations between Government and Opposition. Three of these we can dismiss. They were lost when the Tories were playing their midnight game of Cowboys and Indians in the houses of Smith Square and Lord North Street - which Tony Benn generously connected up with a tele­phone so that they could know what they were voting about. And they talk about proxy voting for sick MPs! The other 226 we won and our average majority was more than 13. In only a handful of divisions did we have a majority below our nominal three. And just to put Scarborough into its perspective, perhaps it is right that I should record that the Liberal Party - what Mr. Grimond quaintly calls the Radical Left, voted 68 times with us and 157 times with the Conservatives. To be fair, on four occasions, they abstained.Five years ago, Mr. Chairman, you told Conference that you did not join the Labour Party to become a left-wing Liberal. To judge from the right-wing Liberal voting record in this Parliament, you would have been a lonely man if you had.It would be utterly wrong in presenting this Parliamentary Report to Conference if I did not now pay tribute to the magnificent work of the Government Whips, led by Ted Short, Sidney Irving, and if I might draw the veil aside a little further, our pairing whip, John Silkin I do not believe any team of whips has ever done such a magnificent job in the history of Westminster, but it would be equally wrong not to pay tribute to the tremendous morale and loyalty of our Labour Members, not least the new Members whom you returned to Westminster last October. Our new Members are already veterans. They have already been through what is one of the greatest Parlia­mentary ordeals in history and they have enjoyed it. I don\u2019t know how many times I have talked to some of our new Members during the small hours, even as dawn approached, talked to them a little anxiously perhaps, to be greeted with the rebuke \u2018this is what we came here for.\u2019And if the House adjourned at 3 am or 3.30 am you could see them gaily claiming that they had been lucky - they had got a half day off. But day by day, and night by night, as the small majorities ticked their way across the scoreboard, we were carrying through a funda­mental reform of our tax system. And the Finance Bill they said we couldn't get through, and that we wouldn't get through, is now the Finance Act.But, sir, you would agree that no tribute to the unity, the morale and the loyalty of the Parliamentary Labour Party could possibly be complete without a tribute to the Chairman of the Parliamentary Party, that great and ever young veteran, Manny Shinwell.In a lifetime of service to this movement, nothing has surpassed or will surpass his contribution in this past year.So, despite the economic crisis, despite the obstructive time-wasting manoeuvres of the Tory Party on the Finance Bill, the Rent Bill and other measures, we succeeded in a little over eight months in carrying through the Houses of Parliament 65 Bills. That is two more than the Tories managed in the previous session with a majority of 100; it is 14 more than the average for the 13 years 1951 to 1964. What is more, many of these were major Bills and we had to produce them without having had the time or the opportunity before we came to power, of course, to get them drafted. So that with the usual delays that an incoming government has, we have still been able to present a formidable legislative programme.I am only going to say a word or two about some of these Bills. The first one was referred to yesterday by Peggy Herbison. It was a small one but there are many here who know what it means in terms of real humanity when we carried out our pledge - in our first Bill - to introduce a Bill to give old-age pensioners on our housing estates and else­where the right to free or concessionary bus fares - the Bill the Tories refused to introduce, the Bill the Tories blocked for years.2.  We said we would take urgent action to raise pensions, and as Peggy told you yesterday, within a fortnight of Parliament meeting, we introduced the Bill.3.  We had given a pledge to abolish the earnings rule for widows and to increase the pension of the ten shilling widow. We honoured the pledge.4.  We said we would abolish the prescription charge. We abolished it.5.  We said we would provide security of tenure for families in their homes. Without waiting for our main Rent Act repeal measure, we put an immediate stop to evictions.6.  We had promised to repeal the Tory Rent Act, to provide new machinery for fixing fair rents, and to give Government and all others who required them, the powers they needed to fight the evils of Rachmanism. That Bill is through the Commons despite Tory obstruc­tion. It is in the Lords - within a week of Parliament meeting again, we intend it to become law. It was on the Bill to restore security of tenure, and it was on the Rent Bill that our new Members, not I imagine to their surprise, saw the full virulence of Tory Opposition tactics when the Tories were fighting for something near and dear to them, the rights of landlords and property interests.7.  We had said that those who lost their jobs as a result of industrial changes should receive, as of right, severance pay. In the Redundancy Payments Bill - which you carried through Parliament, Mr. Chairman, we have kept that pledge.8.  We said we would take action to bring new life to the Highlands and Islands of Scotland. The Highlands and Islands Develop­ment Act - what they call the \u2018Marxist measure\u2019 - is on the Statute Book.9.  We gave a pledge about the Trade Dis­putes Bill. We have honoured that pledge.10.  We have introduced a new Monopolies Bill to curb the abuses of monopoly power.11.  We said we would provide machinery to overhaul our archaic and obsolete system of law. The Law Commissioners have been set up and they are at work under Labour\u2019s Act of Parliament, and the Lord Chancellor is now due to present to Parliament the detailed and imaginative programme of law reform to which the Commissioners have set their hands.12.  We said we would get rid of the restric­tions on the right of railway workshops and other nationalised industrialised undertakings, to do work for export or for strengthening our industrial base. That was our pledge and the Minister of Transport has already acted. And we shall introduce a further measure to remove those restrictions which require statutory repeal.This is just part of our record for one Parliamentary session. We have begun to lay the legislative foundations of the New Britain, though - I must repeat this - it takes time, it necessarily takes time, for the legisla­tion to bear fruit. Dick\u2019s Rent Act, when it becomes law, will take time to work through but, at this, stage we cannot put it to Confer­ence.When I talk about phase two, if you like, session two of this Parliament, I am not only referring to the improvement in our economic position, I am referring to the fact that starting with the Plan a fortnight ago, we shall now have a steady flow of new Government measures and new Government Bills.Yesterday, Dick, the Minister of Housing and Local Government, told you something of our plans in the field of housing. Let me say that he did not tell you a half of it. He cannot yet, but he will soon, and he will have a great deal more to say when the National Housing Plan is published in a few weeks\u2019 time. You see, we have had to spend so much of the first session in clearing up the festering debris of the Tory Rent Act legislation. Now we can go forward.The housing problem, as every one of us said in the election, is the greatest social prob­lem of this age, comparable in its impact, comparable in terms of human misery, to the problem of unemployment in those pre-war years. We said in the election that we would treat it as a priority operation. We said that if it were necessary to hold back any form of less essential building so that the Housing Pro­gramme could be increased, we should not hesitate to see what was necessary and to do what was necessary. Yesterday, Charlie Pannell, the Minister of Public Buildings and Works, gave you details of what this meant.Dick told you what the programme was. Five hundred thousand houses a year by 1970, and a rising proportion of houses to let, but within that total is more to let and more for the owner-occupier. This is the only answer to the over-crowding problem in our towns and cities. The only answer to the problem of the slums, the only answer to the problem of Rachmanism - the evils of which the Tories, when they were in power first denied and then minimised - evils which were dramatically highlighted by the Milner Holland Report last autumn.Last week, we announced our plan for London Housing and Dick yesterday rightly paid tribute to Bob Mellish who has worked day and night to get this London housing programme launched - and it has been a labour of love.But you cannot build houses without land. Last week, the Minister of Land and Natural Resources published our White Paper with our proposals for a Land Commission. This, and the Bill which is to follow, make a reality of one of the central promises of Labour in the last election - our promise to deal once and for all with the problem of racketeering in the price of land, our promise to see that land is available when it is needed both for local authority housing programmes and for owner-occupiers; our promise that we would do this because otherwise Town and Country Plan­ning is meaningless; our promise - a basic theme of Socialist belief - that profits arising through the action of the community should accrue to the community.I call that a Socialist theme; yes, I should have thought a Liberal theme, too. That great \u2018modernising\u2019 Party on this theme at least at Scarborough last week carried through an exercise in recidivism which places its present leadership some years behind the Liberals of 60 years ago. In 1909, in 1910, they filled the land with song, \u2018God gave the land to the people.\u2019 Now, in 1965, we have the first fruits of Liberal revisionism: while they would not intend to throw doubt on the Almighty\u2019s intention in this respect, their researches suggest that He did not intend this declaration to be taken too literally.The Conservatives, predictably, condemned the proposals out of hand. The umbilical links between the Conservative Party and the land­lords and property interests are too close to permit of much objectivity. But it is interesting to see in their first statement that they now support a levy on land profits. Since when? In Government, right to the last minute, they rejected all our proposals for a radical solution. On television, and throughout the election, their leader proclaimed his determination to die in the last ditch in defence of the free market in land.Let this be clear. We regard our land proposals, worked out after an infinity of care and study, as essential to our housing pro­gramme and to our programme of rebuilding Britain. These issues cannot be discussed in the vulgar currency of Press comment about deals with this, that or the other political Party. Our land programme is a categorical imperative for this movement, for this Government, and for Britain.We will not trade this or any other principle with those who may be faint of heart or infirm of purpose. We shall insist that all these measures go through. To take any other course would be an abdication of the responsi­bilities of Government.As with land, so with financial provision. Dick referred to this yesterday. We shall announce our proposals for the long-term relations between the central Government and local government in the matter of finance. We shall announce our new and revolutionary proposals (that Dick was hinting at yesterday) for the finance of local authority housing. We are hard at work on rating reform.And let me say to our friends from Wales - I opened the General Election campaign just a year ago last Saturday in Cardiff - to our friends from the Midlands, from London and other areas, we are pledged in this forth­coming session to deal once and for all with the leasehold problem.Having referred to housing, I think it is right since this is referred to at length in the Parliamentary Report - and you would not want me to burke it - that at this point I should say something about immigration.I do not propose to anticipate the debate which is to take place on Wednesday about the Government\u2019s White Paper and our proposed legislation. But I want it understood that this is a decision, not of one Department of State, it is a Government decision, collectively taken and after the fullest consideration, by the highest authority in our system of government. But it is right, first, that I should stress our insistence on the positive attack on the prob­lems presented by immigration. This is a positive White Paper. There has been too much talk about the negative side of it. We have legislated against racial incitement and against racial discrimination in public places. A number of senior Ministers have been, and are, spending, and will continue to spend, a lot of their time, and an energetic junior Minister is spending practically his whole time, on the practical problems of assimilation and integra­tion of Commonwealth immigrants in our big towns and cities, especially in the fields of housing and education. We have sought to deal with the problem of immigration in consultation with other Commonwealth countries. But we must face the fact that largely because of the widespread evasion of the Act, in the concluding months of the Conservative Government - and, of course, the loopholes remain - there are towns and cities in Britain which are being asked today to absorb a degree of immigration on a scale beyond their social capacity to absorb, without serious risks, having regard to the time required for absorption.There have been those - and we all know there have been those - who did not scruple to play on issues of race and colour for squalid and ignoble political motives. I want to say to you, with all the emphasis at my command, that the Government takes the view that we have a duty to act here and that failure to fulfil that duty might lead in a very short time to a social explosion in this country of the kind that we have seen abroad.We cannot take the risk of allowing the democracy of this country to become stained and tarnished with the taint of racialism or of colour prejudice. I want to make it clear that in the positive policies set out in the White Paper for assimilation, for absorption, for integration, we proceed from the proposition that everyone living in this country, everyone who has come in or will come in is a British citizen, entitled to equality of treatment regardless of origin or race or colour.Time will be required for assimilation and this is why we must have restriction, particu­larly having regard to the widespread evasions. But I repudiate the libel that the Government\u2019s policy is based either on colour or on racial prejudice. We repudiate, and let me say for my part, I resent, the accusation of illiberality or of any desire whether on the part of the Home Secretary, or of the Government as a whole, to act in an arbitrary manner. Our concern was with evasion, and the new power - which I know has caused anxiety - in respect of repatriation relates only to those who have illegally or fraudulently entered this country.Mr. Chairman, I have referred to the last session of the Commons. Sixty-five measures in the last session: and it would not be right or proper for me to indicate all the measures which we can expect to see passed in the session which is due to begin on 9 November. We have already announced that we shall. legislate to give effect to the forward looking measures in Fred Peart\u2019s White Paper on Agricultural policies. Before Parliament meets, we shall be publishing our proposals for a Parliamentary Commissioner, the so-called Ombudsman, to investigate the griev­ances of individual citizens where a prima facie case is made out involving injustice or culpable neglect by great Departments of State. We shall be laying before the nation the reforms necessary in social security and our detailed plans for relating benefits to earnings.And we plan to introduce another measure of which we gave notice in the Queen\u2019s Speech at the Opening of Parliament last November. As part of our proposals to reform Company Law, so as to give shareholders greater information about the activities of the com­panies they own, we propose to introduce a statutory obligation on the part of members of boards of directors to give full details of any contributions of their shareholders\u2019 money towards the funds of any political party, or of any front organisation which exists for political purposes. I think that it will be generally agreed and here I confidently count on the unanimous support of the House of Commons, that this will not only be a valuable reinforce­ment of existing statutory provisions within the field of Company Law and the protection of shareholders, but it will also provide a necessary cleansing agent - cleaning up one of the seamier sides of British public life and improving the standard of our democracy.The Parliamentary Report I have just dis­cussed gives the record of our achievement in our first session. By the end of our second session, we shall have carried into law almost the whole of the specific pledges which we laid before the country last October, and on which all of us fought that great campaign. Our manifesto was designed for a full five year Parliament. It was not our final programme: it was the first of a broadening series of Socialist programmes, and yet, though it is designed for five years, in two sessions the greater part of it will have become law - to say nothing of a great programme of social reform which we have introduced or shall be successively introducing outside the specific pledges we made a year ago.I beg you, in your humanity, to consider what all this means for the Conservative Opposition. For their stock in trade is based on the repetitive use of two dying assets. One is their unscrupulous political use of the measures we have had to take to deal with their economic crisis. The second is their pathetic complaint that we have broken our election promises, and this complaint which, as we have seen in Parliament and outside, has taken the form of a newly discovered Conservative concern for many groups of people - or should I say groups of voters - whose needs they scorned for 13 years. They are suddenly concerned about aid for owner-occupiers, about aid for ratepayers, about the doctors, about the teachers. As I said on television last week, nothing is more pathetic than this repetitive complaint that in less than a year, we have not yet done everything that they failed to do, or neglected to do, or hadn't the humanity to do, or refused to do, or didn't know how to do, in 13 years.And now, as the economic deficit moves slowly but surely into economic surplus, and equally, as we put into effect measure after measure in fulfilment of the mandate for which we asked in our election manifesto - as these two things happen - so will this dis­credited Tory Party be reduced to a querulous and impotent irrelevance, because during all this period they have not put forward a single positive proposal.I call as witness 300 Labour Members of Parliament. In a year of almost unprecedented Parliamentary, activity, with measure succeed­ing measure in its passage through the House, we have not had from the Conservative Opposition, a single statement of alternative policy on any of the issues on which we have legislated. Negative opposition to one Bill after another, whether they are Bills for which we have sought and obtained a mandate, or whether they are corrective financial measures made necessary by the crisis they had bequeathed to us, on all these things their record has been not only negative, it has been nihilist. We have had from them no proposals, and, of course, anyone who looks at the political scene - even the Press will be admitting this in their leaders very soon - will say that when a country has to judge it is not judging between two parties on the record of how negative one of them has been in Opposi­tion: it is judging between a government and an alternative government, and the Conserva­tive Party have destroyed any claim they might have had to be regarded as a credible alterna­tive government.And so it goes on. Most measures they have denounced out of hand as soon as they have seen them. They have now set up a depart­ment in the Conservative Central Office to divide all our Bills and White Papers into two classes: those they attack on sight and those they attack before they have read them.Month by month; we have been promised the new statement of Conservative principles. It was ready in January, it will be ready in March. It was ready for a spring election, we should have it in July. Now we are told it is going to be available before, during, or after the Conservative Party Conference. For my part, I shall neither praise nor condemn its contents until I have read it. But I will say this. In so far as it calls for changes in Govern­ment policies, or improvements in our system of society, or improved quality of management in industry - which they now keep talking about - or reforms in trade unions, in so far as it calls for a fairer distribution of our social services, then the publication of this policy statement will be a more eloquent and damning indictment than any words or comments of mine could be, on the Conserva­tive record, of their failure to do all the things they now say are necessary, when they have just ended responsibility for the conduct of the nation\u2019s affairs and the shaping of our social system - which lasted for 13 years.Nye had a word for it, as always: Why look in the crystal ball when you can read the book? Thirteen volumes of it.This is one reason why their efforts to produce a policy should command our sympathy; they can produce nothing new without utterly condemning their own record.Another reason for sympathy - and I am sorry that I am not getting the sympathetic expressions on your faces that I hoped for - is that they are trying to produce a policy in a Party which is fundamentally divided not only on means but also on its basic philosophy. Weasel words cannot bridge the gulf between those who slowly and reluctantly have come to accept, at any rate, some measure of economic planning and those among their leaders - recently promoted some of them - who claim a policy of economic and social anarchy, a policy, a philosophy, which had already been repudiated by some of the more progressive Tories in the 1860s.But there is something more serious than this. We are told that under their new leadership, the old slogans will go and that new and more inspiring themes will lie at the heart of their policies. What are these themes? Partnership? Co-operation? A combined operation to modernise Britain? None of these.We are told, with authority, that the keynote is to be \u2018conflict.\u2019 That is to be the philosophy \u2013 \u2018conflict.\u2019 That the Conservative Party should now consciously ally itself with management against all other groups in the community.That management must be set against labour, that equally, labour must be set against management. This apparently is what is meant by the fashionable new word \u2018abrasive\u2019 - a return to the bitterness of Taff Vale and to the class-war philosophy of Galsworthy\u2019s \u2018Strife.\u2019 This is the modernisation. The Conservative Party, always materialist, is now logically getting itself ready to adopt a Marxist posture.I warn these men that they are playing with fire for electoral purposes. Some of them showed that they were not above unleashing the evil passions of race and colour hatred, and none of them, even yet, has denounced what was done in their name a year ago.But now, it is clear that in the top leadership of their Party there are men who will not scruple for electoral purposes to unleash a new source of conflict in Britain, in British industry, by incitement and provocation in industry. This Government of ours has not been slow to condemn nor slow to act where industry has faced paralysis through sporadic unofficial disputes and our condemnation, through your words and actions, Mr. Chairman, is directed against any - be they feudal managements, or irresponsible strikers - who have jeopardised our industrial recovery.Now the Tories, who for 13 years did nothing, claim to have discovered the problem of industrial relations. Let them realise that the course on which they now appear to be set, so far from reducing industrial problems, could set industry ablaze.The truth is that the new Conservative appeal to professional management is a diversionary tactic to conceal their basic preoccupation not with the functions of management and industrial efficiency with which we are concerned, but with ownership (following their tradition), with the rights of a privileged minority, by those who own money and make money out of that ownership, or those who own land and hold the rest of the country to ransom through the ownership of land. That was the inspiration of their Finance Bill fight when the Shadow Chancellor and his cub tycoons, that assembly of city acolytes, were fighting not for industry but for finance. It was also the spirit that informed the two successive Conservative leaders in their attacks on the Highland and Islands Bill and all other land legislation.For what they are engaged on is not a question either of measures or of men. It is a desperate attempt to provide the admen with what they call the new image.I have said before at this Conference that I don't think much of this image stuff. For us men at any rate, our shaving mirror tells us what the image is. It is something never very far removed from the face that we present. Nikolai Gogol, so far as I am concerned, has the last word on these Colman, Prentiss and Varley techniques in his foreword to his play, \u2018The Government Inspector,\u2019 a century and more ago when he quoted this Russian proverb: \u2018NA ZERKALO NYETCHA PYENYAT KOLI ROZHA KRIVA.\u2019 For the benefit of any who are not familiar with that, in the words of the authorised translation, \u2018Don\u2019t blame the mirror if the mug is ugly.\u2019Enough of them. We have more important things to talk about. We are building the New Britain, and with this I close my introduction this morning. We do not claim to have built it yet. In our first year, we were building with the brokers\u2019 men looking over our shoulder. We have had to clear from the building site the debris of wasted years. What we can say - it is a modest claim, perhaps - is that this year has been spent on the foundations, on putting the footings in. But in all we have done, whatever the difficulties, whatever bottlenecks we have had, and the two principal ones have been money and Parliamentary time, in all this difficult year, we have kept our eyes raised to the great design of the structure that we are seeking to build.I began this morning by saying what I felt was the vision of the New Britain for which our people voted a year ago. I have shown how in this unprecedentedly difficult year, we have started to move towards that new Britain. The years that lie ahead will see our forward march.Soon, we shall be announcing our plans for a great productivity drive, a great technological revolution, which will turn into a reality the vision that we proclaimed at Scarborough.This new Britain that we are building will be a Britain of opportunity. An opportunity for the young; an opportunity under the forward looking proposals which Alice Bacon has worked out in the Home Office for children, deprived of a fair chance in life, to have that: chance. And opportunity to us means for every boy and girl, the right to the educational development which will enable him or her to develop their innate talents and qualities to the full.This is why educational expenditure is running at a record level, why school building has been exempted from the restrictions of the past year, and why it is planned to raise it at so rapid a rate over the next five years. This is why we have made the purposive start on the ending of the 11 plus selection and on the creation of a truly comprehensive system. This is why the Secretary of State for Educa­tion and Science has moved to give effect to the plan set out in Signposts for the Sixties and approved by conference for the integration of the public school system.But equally, if there can be no arbitrary selection at 11 plus, there can be none either at 18 plus hence our drive to build up the universities and to establish parity of esteem between those universities with a technological background and those founded on older disciplines. And I am proud to speak as the. Chancellor designate of Bradford University.But this must be the Britain which releases the energies of our people at every age.We do not regard the battle for production as a limited private war confined to Ministers and Government servants, and top industrial managers and trade union leaders. It must be a battle in which the whole British people is mobilised. That is why we have called for the establishment of production committees in every factory, allowing all who have contributions to make to increased production to play their full part regardless of outdated ideas about the sacred preserves of management.We want to see - and here our great new regional councils can give the lead - the service of our young technologists and scientists mobilised in an assault on the technical problems of industry and I should like to see our junior chambers of commerce mobilise keen young business men, exporters, salesmen, marketing experts, for the attack on the export markets. We promised you two years ago it would be our aim to release the energies of the British people and we meant it.But this cannot be judged in industrial terms alone. The new Britain must be related not only to the quantity of production but to the quality of life. At Scarborough, I said the automative age would at once make possible these facilities and create the demand for increased facilities for the use of leisure.And even with the limitations which the last year has imposed, we all of us are proud of what Jennie Lee has achieved in providing for increased expenditure and increased investment in our national arts and amenities and especially for the extension of this programme to the provinces.And she is working with equal determination to make a reality of another cherished Labour proposal - the University of the Air, to provide for our people an opportunity of higher educa­tion, perhaps a higher education they missed through no fault of their own, whether vocationally or in pursuing more liberal studies. Jennie and those advising her have already studied in depth all that will be involved in creating a new national university of the air, with its vice-chancellor, its system of degrees and diplomas, its courses, using television and radio, particularly local broad­casting stations, bringing into the service the work of colleges of further education, making use of residential and correspondence courses, the W.E.A., and the extra-mural departments.There are those who are disappointed that we have not done more to alter the external trappings of our society. Frankly, we have been more concerned with the citadels of effective power than with its external embel­lishments. It has been more important to assert national and social responsibility in our economic and social life. This may be dis­enchanting, but we are more interested in the monthly trade returns than in Debrett, more preoccupied with reading what is said by the industrial correspondents and economic editors than what is said by William Hickey; more concerned with modernising the machinery of government, including the vitally necessary creation of modern regional machinery, much more with the action that will need to follow the Report of the Estimates Committee on the Recruitment, Training and Structure of the Civil Service than in altering the layout of Burke\u2019s Landed Gentry. In the language of priorities, we are more concerned with the work of the House of Commons - a newly national­ised House of Commons - than with the future of the House of Lords. Though I should perhaps mention that since last October, there have been no hereditary peerages created, and no baronetcies either, nor has the Labour Chief Whip followed the example of his Tory predecessors who regularly used the Honours List as a means of rewarding, and corrupting, their Parliamentary Party.That is our Parliamentary Report to you. We intend to get on with the job you gave us to do. I believe that is what you want. I believe that is what the country wants and for once, I find myself reinforced by the unity of the two public opinion polls - I have not seen an Express one lately - which show that an overwhelming majority of our fellow-citizens are sick and tired of manoeuvring, of Press gossip about an early and unnecessary election, and want to see what Labour can do with the mandate they gave to us. Others may manoeuvre. We have a job to do. We have not been approached by any other Party with a view to a pact, a deal or a coalition. It is entirely right and proper that a Party leader should be concerned to show the fullest respect, as he does, to those who elected their 10 Members; it is equally right and proper for us to show our equal respect for the views of those who elected our 300. We are clear what our mandate means in terms of our Parliamentary programme and in terms of executive Government. I hope that others will feel able to support these measures which we put forward because we believe them to be in the national interest. If they can, we shall welcome their support. If they cannot, we shall have to go on without them.So, if others find themselves unable honourably to support the measures we put forward - and I intend no reflection on their motives - this must be a matter for them. But if this leads to a seizure in our Parliamentary government, or a situation in which effective government cannot be carried on, then let this be understood - this will not then be an issue to be settled in the back corridors of the Palace of Westminster, it will be an issue to be settled by the sovereign and independent decision of the British people.For the power you conferred on us is not a gift, but a trust; it belongs not to us but to the whole British people; and it will not be the Parties or the pressmen; the pollsters, the principalities and powers who will decide: it will be the people, who alone can refresh and reinforce our mandate, and it will be to the people that we shall render the account of our stewardship in carrying out the task they gave us of building a new and fairer Britain.

aVMr. Chairman, fellow delegates, I move the adoption of the Parliamentary Report.A year ago when I presented the Parlia­mentary Report for the first session of the Labour Government elected in 1964, there were many who doubted whether we should still be in power today. We had a Parliament­ary majority of three.For weeks - and it is healthy to say this to those who daily foreshadow our early demise - publicity and public comment on the political situation had revolved around the question whether the death of the late Speaker would mean that our majority would disappear altogether. For a whole week before we met at Blackpool all comment on the Labour Conference was in terms of the Liberal Conference which had met at Scarborough; whether our Party\u2019s Conference at Blackpool would see the acceptance of the terms for survival which had been so seductively offered us at Scarborough. This Conference, this Movement gave the answer. That tail was never going, to wag this dog.Now, a year afterwards, we face the future in a vastly different situation. For the first time in the history of this Movement we have a Government in power which has increased its majority. After two years in office we now have a majority over the chief Opposition Party greater than anything achieved by the Tories, over us, in thirteen years of Conserva­tive rule. And I want to pay my warmest tribute on behalf of this Executive and of the Parliamentary Party to those who achieved that great victory last March - the workers of this Party on the doorstep, those who sustained us in the difficult days after we had first taken office, those who thronged the Committee Rooms when the Election was announced, those who cheered increased majorities and particularly Labour gains when the votes were counted. I repeat what I said here in Brighton after the 1964 victory - what I said at Black­pool last year - we shall not break faith.I am not going to spend a lot of time out­lining the legislative programme of the Government in the short 1964-66 Parliament and in the six months since the General Election. The Parliamentary Report, in the possession of every delegate here, speaks for itself, and you, Mr. Chairman, outlined its salient achievements. I am not going to out­line the 107 bills which since October, 1964, have received the Royal Assent, or the 25 more which are at present going through Parliament, or the further 12 which will be introduced before Christmas. It is not merely that we are maintaining a record level of legislative activity, what is more important is what these Bills are enacting and what they will achieve.A year ago, I said that by the time this Conference met, we should have enacted 90 per cent of the measures foreshadowed in the 1964 manifesto, measures repeated and con­firmed with all the authority of a Government in a manifesto which we put before the electorate last March. That pledge has been honoured. But to what has been achieved must be added the Bills now before the House. The Steel Bill has received its Second Reading; and my colleagues and I are deeply touched by the vote of confidence given to us by further revelations about the investment policy of the unit trust presided over by the Chairman of the Conservative Party.In 1964, too, we promised urgent action to deal with the land racket, urgent action to take urban building land into public ownership, to stop the rocketing prices, to provide the means of effective town and country planning, to ensure that land values created by the com­munity should accrue to the community which created them. Last March we asked for a vote of confidence in that policy. And now the Land Commission Bill has completed its Committee Stage in the House and is approach­ing the stage when it becomes the law of the land. The Conservative and Liberal Parties, who denounced the Land Bill by bell, book and candle, in the event failed to put up any effective opposition and let it through. By next spring, we shall have the powers we promised. Other Bills are going through or are shortly to be introduced - the Housing Subsidies Bill, the Industrial Reorganisation Bill, the Companies Bill, the Leasehold Bill, designed to end half a century of social injustice.This Government, this Party, this Parlia­ment, are working on a clear and decisive mandate from the British people. For the decision last March was a decision to reaffirm beyond all doubt the break that the British people had made with the past in 1964.That was not all it decided. For it proved that the British people accepted that Labour could govern, that we had the men and the measures that the country knew were neces­sary. It proved that Labour could give national leadership; that we rejected the Conservative concept of cynical conflict between class and class.It proved that the electorate was an adult electorate, that they would not be brain­washed by the soapy ad-men, that the people wanted policies, and leaders prepared to see those policies through. The electorate showed little interest in those who entered the Election hoping that by the end of it they would have learnt from their public relations people what kind of men they were - they wanted people who knew where they were going and where the country was going.The Election proved that the people of Britain were characterised by a common interest. The Conservative Party was defeated in 1966 by the new realisation of a common interest between those who wished to use their skills - managerial, professional, technical, in­dustrial - to help solve Britain\u2019s problems: by the realisation that 13 years of Conservative policy and Conservative abdication had brought Britain to the brink of economic disaster: by the realisation that all of us, members one of another as we are, were affected by the social injustices of the Tory affluent society; by the impact of technological change on occupational structure, blurring as it has blurred the old divisions between industrial and non-industrial workers.It was all these things. Above all it was a clear decision that there was no going back.The Parliamentary programme of which this report represents one year\u2019s progress is part of a continuing, consistent and conscious policy. Within that continuing policy we each have our own special personal priorities. These subjective priorities find general expression in a consensus acceptable to the entire Movement.Today I want to relate the measures we have taken, including the economic measures of this summer, to the path which this Party chose three years ago in Scarborough, and which the country chose a year later.The Scarborough programme was a pro­gramme which laid emphasis on change but made change an instrument of policy. It was a programme which called on Britain to mobilise the forces of change which lay still unrealised in the scientific and technological abilities of our people. But it was a programme which demanded that this process of change, in what is and must be the most rapid and fundamental industrial revolution of all our history, must be tempered by a spirit of humanity and social concern which the nineteenth century industrial revolution never knew - indeed which it consciously rejected.For we are the Party of change. We seek not to conserve, but to transform society.Industrial change to realise the vast potential abundance which has so long been denied; social change to redress the distorted balance between private self-seeking and social com­passion. Structural change which recognises the challenge to our society brought about by uneven regional development and by the great challenge which is presented by the urban explosion in terms of the problems of trans­portation and social environment; change in the relationships within our society in an age which rejects the feudal and class relationships which others seek, in conserving, to perpetuate. Change, too, in Britain\u2019s relationships with the world, which itself is changing on a scale which outpaces the modes of thought of an effete establishment.Because the greatest enemy that lies in our path in creating the kind of Britain we want to create is conservatism. We cannot afford Tory conservatism, with its smug pre­occupation, complacently looking on while the rest of the world passed us by.The full implications of the impossibility of returning to conservatism in any form may not have been fully realised by a minority both in the industrial and political Labour Move­ments. But even more it is manifest that the Tory Party, and their allies in the Press, and their disillusioned supporters in industry, have not yet begun to realise what has hit them.This is why the Tory Party has been reduced to a pathetic irrelevance, capable only of disporting themselves on the sidelines of the New Britain, contenting themselves at their social and political gatherings with ritual abuse of the men and ideas of a society which has rejected them. Incapable themselves of influencing events, all they can do now is to incite others to act as a surrogate opposition. For opposition in this country has reached an all-time low when their Leader can address an appeal to the Trades Union Congress to sabotage the policy of the elected Government by negative action. Or when a member of their Shadow Cabinet last week could address to the leaders of industry, who had been called to the National Conference on Pro­ductivity, a factional demand that they should use the occasion, not to promote the national productivity drive, but to sabotage the Con­ference by futile ideological attacks on the Government. It is characteristic that both these appeals were rejected with contempt by those to whom they were addressed, and that even the more sycophantic Tory supporters in the national. Press greeted these sleazy initiatives with ashamed silence. Enough of them.You will probably feel that the fact that I have spent two minutes dealing with the Tories exaggerates their importance - maybe so. No doubt it will be reversed next week at Blackpool; two minutes of Tory policy for every hour they devote to us.Our task now is to go forward from last March. It is not enough to reject the organised conservatism of the Tory Party. We cannot afford to perpetuate any form of dinosaur-type thinking in our own Party. If we are to consolidate our Election victory, we have to reject the, thinking which goes with closed minds and complacent attitudes, whether in the political or the industrial labour move­ments. We cannot afford to fight the problems of the sixties with the attitudes of the Social Democratic Federation, nor, in looking for a solution to those problems, seek vainly to find the answer in Highgate cemetery. Still less shall we find that solution if we listen to the siren voices of those who see it as their role in this Party to advocate, in the columns of Conservative daily and weekly papers, right-wing doctrines which have been rejected not only by this Movement but by the mass of the British people.For this Movement exists not merely to win Election victories, nor to repeat in the twentieth century the stately minuet of ins and outs which characterised the nineteenth century. We exist to change Britain, to change the form of our society, to eradicate from every part of our national life the conservatism which economically and socially was denying to the British people their full opportunity to realise what is in them. And we have to carry through this great revolution of change by consent and this means that we must have the faith and enthusiasm to change the hearts and minds of men.For a political rejection of conservatism is not enough. It is the stifling weight of establishment thinking we have to challenge, wherever it is found, and then to prise loose. In economic and industrial life, in Govern­ment, central and local, in Parliament itself, and in the inhibiting social framework within which our society still operates, we have to question, to challenge and to change.And it is because over these past two years and in the years immediately ahead, success or failure in all our objectives home and abroad will depend on economic success, we have first to challenge conservatism wherever it may be found in British industry.Tomorrow we shall be debating the July measures - and the necessity for them. And we shall be looking at them, not as a backward reversion to Tory stop-go policies, but as a necessary condition for national advance to economic strength and independence, to industrial expansion and rising living stand­ards. We have to look on them as measures which represent not a return to the tired measures of the past, but as a necessary step towards the future. At Scarborough I called this Movement to a programme of change which meant that thousands of our people would have to change jobs, that for thousands more the skills they learnt would become outdated - perhaps once, perhaps twice in the working life of those involved.For industrial change without labour re­deployment is a meaningless concept. We made this clear. But there were two speeches from the platform in that Scarborough debate and the second laid down the social conditions in which redeployment could be made toler­able. That is why, in the social programme of this Government since October, 1964, we have concentrated not only on the urgent measures needed to provide help to the old, age pensioners, the disabled, the sick and the widows, we have given priority to the social infrastructure required for industrial change and redeployment. The Redundancy Payments Act, the vast expansion of industrial training, the measures coming into force this very week for earnings-related benefits, not only for the sick and widows, but for those made redundant while changing jobs.We always recognised that the Balance of Payments crisis we foresaw in 1964 would have to be met with the weapons they left us with. For in those two years it would have been impossible to achieve either the changes in industrial structure or the changes in industrial attitude that were needed.And we shall not go forward to sustained expansion except on the basis of eradicating conservatism in all its forms.The conservatism that has to be eradicated from Trade Union thinking and outdated working practices I dealt with in my speech to the Trades Union Congress a month ago. And we must be on our guard to ensure that conservative thinking and conservative prac­tices are not strengthened by the understand­able reflex action of Trade Unions and their members to ill-considered provocative actions taken by some industrialists using as their pretext the measures the Government have had to take, in some cases using these measures as a means of escaping from the consequences of their own past mismanagement and lack of foresight.We have made it clear that we shall not tolerate a return to mass unemployment and purposeless industrial stagnation. I pledge my colleagues and myself to that determination. But in that determination we should not cling to protective practices and attitudes because words are being used which, because of past associations, arouse understandable emotional reactions within our own Movement.Equally, on the management side, the re­appraisal of industrial policies which these measures have forced must not be used as an excuse for timidity, for cancelling or retarding essential programmes of capital investment and modernisation, still less as an excuse for retiring into a feudal industrial shell. If this is a time for labour redeployment, these measures should be taken even more as a signal for a shakeout from the country\u2019s boardrooms. As every firm has to reconsider its costs, its expenses, as every firm is forced to prepare its programme for cutting down waste, this is a unique opportunity to accelerate the elimina­tion at all levels of management from the boardroom downwards of those who hold their position not on merit or professional qualifica­tion, but on social, family or financial con­nections, which provide no basis for selection in this ruthlessly competitive age.But the attack on industrial conservatism is already going beyond that. The drive for productivity, on which I had the privilege of listening to some of the most progressive minds on both sides of industry at the National Productivity Conference last week, requires a new approach to scientific management, to the use of technological expertise and the concepts of cost-effectiveness and value-analysis, in which today our best firms are as good as any in the world, but in which so many of our medium and small firms, and some big ones, still lag behind.The change must be not only in the quantity and quality of industrial equipment and modernisation, it must be in industrial struc­ture. I have referred to the change which our Parliamentary programme is forcing through - the public ownership of steel, and the mobilisation of our resources of building land in the interests of the nation. But this is only a part of what we are doing. Sector by sector, industry by industry, our national economy is coming under the searchlight of public enquiry. And we regard an enquiry not as they did, as a road block to change, but as a means of forcing change. For them a Royal Commission was a means of burying an embarrassing problem in the pigeon-holes of Whitehall. For us every enquiry is a means to action. There are three stages. One, get the facts. Two, challenge every established assumption in a mood of constructive irrever­ence; everything is subject to challenge, with no sacred cows. And three, having got the facts, having challenged the assumptions, then we must act.This is the basis of our enquiry into Trade Unions and Employers\u2019 Associations.There are those who would prejudge these issues and prejudge them indeed on class grounds. The Royal Commission we estab­lished should have been sitting years ago. But now it must be allowed to do its work of getting the facts, of challenging the established assumptions, and of providing a blue-print for action.This has been our attitude to industry after industry in the two years we have been in office; the docks and the Devlin Report, dealing first with the abuses in the field of the employ­ment of labour, leading in the Government's thinking to fundamental changes in the structure of the dock industry on the basis of public ownership. Shipbuilding - the searching Geddes Enquiry which has already led to fundamental changes ending restrictive practices and demarcation disputes on a scale of which the Unions concerned have every right to be proud. This will now be followed by fundamental changes in the structure and re-equipment of the industry. Plowden on aircraft; the Cameron Enquiry into indefensible practices in the printing industry; and the enquiry about to start into the structure and the organisation of the shipping industry. The enquiries - conducted by the Government itself - which have led to the White Paper on Transport Policy, which we discussed yester­day, leading to future Parliamentary action to remove the shackles so that the productive activities of nationalised industries can be given freedom to compete. And over a wide sector of industries, whose structure still reflects the conservatism of the past, and in particular the proliferation of small firms - family concerns and others which by their scale of operations are inadequate to meet the needs of this technological age - here we shall soon have the activities of the Industrial Reorganisation Corporation backed by £150 million of national finance. Parliament will be asked to vote for the establishment of I.R.C. later this month, and we have already heard that the Conservatives and Liberals characteristically intend to oppose it.And we have to use - we are using - the same irreverent process of challenge and reform in attacking conservatism in the structure of our social services. The new Ministry of Social Security represents the first fruits of our reappraisal, ending once and for all the National Assistance Board, with its last lingering inheritance from the age of the Public Assistance Committees.But above all, in the field of education. As we all recognise, investment in plant, equipment and machinery is more essential now than ever. But our future investment in the nation\u2019s children represents a programme which not only expresses our confidence in the future of Britain, but will mean wide and unrestricted opportunities in life for all our children. We had to cut back in July. We have had to impose painful cuts in public expenditure. But the programmes for housing, for hospital building and for schools go on unimpeded as our first priority in the creation of social capital. Yesterday Jennie spoke for the Executive and the Government about provision for primary education, about the Government\u2019s determination to create equality of opportunity in secondary education.Where the failure to move one motion rather inhibited what she was going to say to you.In higher education, too - we cannot justify the ending of the 11-plus if we are to perpetuate and intensify a system of educational apartheid at 17-plus and 18-plus.The Secretary of State for Education is pressing on with the Public Schools Commission; but perhaps less public attention has been given to fundamental reforms he is making in the field of further and technical education, as well as in the creation of our new technological universities. Industrial training, too, is moving ahead as never in our history. Industrial re-training is being stepped up as we reopen the centres the Tories closed, and push ahead with the creation of new ones. For far more of our young men and women we are combining industrial and educational training. And to set the seal on this new revolution in education, our plans for a new University of the Air, the first open university in the world, open in the sense that it throws wide the doors of university education to those who for any reason have been denied the opportunity of formal higher education.Again relevant equally to the widening of opportunity and to the attack on Britain\u2019s industrial problems are the new institutes, departments and centres for management studies, the National Computer Centre, and our unprecedented programme for providing computers for advanced research in our universities.And we are attacking conservatism in the Machinery of Government. In the first twenty-four hours of Labour Government in 1964, we carried through the biggest peacetime revolution in machinery of Government for half a century. That was how we began. Now, as the follow-through, every institution con­cerned with the machinery of Government is under review. Parliament itself, reflecting the insistent demands of an irreverent new intake of Members, is going through the first throes of modernisation. The Civil Service is the subject of an inquiry which is the most important attack on Civil Service problems since the Northcote-Trevelyan reforms of a century ago. Local Government is being examined by two Royal Commissions, for we cannot approach the problems created by the new urban explosion, the transportation explosion, the problems of regional growth, and the techniques of regional government, on the basis of legislation deriving from the 1880s. I cannot anticipate the findings of these Royal Commissions, but the reforms that will stem from them will be a challenge. And it may well be that when they have reported, your Government will have to challenge and fight inbuilt, ingrained conservatism in local authority attitudes, not least in the attitudes of some shellbacks among our own Labour councillors.The reform of our ancient system of laws and legal procedures.Already the Law Commission we promised in 1964 is at work. Indeed it has produced far-reaching and devastating reports on which we shall act. But the defence of the liberties of the individual goes beyond the modernisation of the law, for in the modern world, under any Government and any system of economic and social administration, bureaucracy - govern­mental but going far beyond government - can inflict injustice on the individual. Later this month Parliament will be asked to agree to the appointment of a Parliamentary Com­missioner, an Ombudsman, whose duty will be to enquire into alleged injustices affecting the lives, happiness and welfare of the individual.In two short years, when economic and social and international priorities rightly demanded our attention, we have not perhaps been able to attack the more peripheral problems of the William Hickey society. On the Honours System we have made a start. Since October 1964, as I said last year, no hereditary peerages have been created, no baronetcies either. We have, however, recom­mended the institution of a new order for firms who make significant progress in exports and in industrial technology. Shortly, as I recently told Parliament, I shall be announcing new and far-reaching changes in the Honours System.This is justification by challenge. Every established institution and doctrine in our domestic national life is going through a searching enquiry. But this process of enquiry is not confined to home affairs. In the past two years, we have carried through the most searching review of defence policy in Britain\u2019s peacetime history - a policy designed to restrict the uncontrolled escalation of defence expenditure to figures within our economic capability.So with nuclear disarmament, where our internal controversies of yesteryear seem strangely outdated by new and more fearsome challenges. Challenges where the immediate danger is not so much the nuclear armament of America, Russia, still less of Britain, France or even China, but of proliferation of nuclear military power to the sixth, seventh, and even tenth and twelfth degrees with all the dangers that holds for world nuclear conflict.Here again the new approach, the challenge to the prevailing assessments of even two years ago, mean that Britain now has the oppor­tunity to take the initiatives which for so long have been lacking.Again, in the fight against racialism which is now far more a divisive and explosive factor in world affairs even than thermo-nuclear power. It is Britain\u2019s insistence on standing by principles in the Rhodesian conflict which has kept the Commonwealth together - the Com­monwealth which our opponents in their introverted jockeying for Party position were prepared to see destroyed. It is that same insistence on principles which proclaims to the world that in Britain\u2019s long and not inglorious history of granting freedom to previously dependent territories, we are determined to see that the last chapter shall not be allowed to tarnish those that have gone before. To those principles we shall adhere. For while we have shown, in the Commonwealth Conference, and since, our willingness to go to the limit in securing an acceptable agreement, we shall not be prepared to abandon the principles that have inspired two successive Governments in this country, principles which are essential, not only to preserve the Commonwealth on which so much depends Britain\u2019s standing, in the world, but principles which in their moral inspiration represent the very basis of our democracy and everything which this move­ment stands for.We shall defend those principles and we have the right to ask the Conservative Opposi­tion whether they will at their Conference continue to insist that there must be guaranteed and unimpeded progress to majority rule, proof against gerrymandering or any racially inspired braking mechanism; whether they will continue to insist, as we are insisting, that any settlement reached is acceptable to the people of Rhodesia as a whole, to all the people; whether they will insist, as we are insisting, on a real return to legality as a condi­tion for negotiations.In these, recent weeks nothing has been more depressing to me than to read the statements of Sir Alec Douglas-Home and Mr. Duncan Sandys, who must be regarded as the two authoritative voices of their Party on this question, saying not only that the integrity of the Commonwealth for which they once worked has ceased to have any meaning for them, making clear, too, that their message to Rhodesia is that they are willing, even anxious to surrender the principles which they so stoutly upheld when they had the respon­sibilities of office. Before we were called to the responsibilities of Government, I said - in challenge to estab­lished conservative thinking - that defence must be the handmaid to foreign policy and never its master. But both foreign policy and defence policy will be dependent on our economic strength and therefore on the whole process of challenge to entrenched conserva­tism in British industry.Speakers on this rostrum on Thursday will rightly express themselves in strong terms. But for their speeches to be more than mere words, they have got to recognise the realities we shall be debating on Wednesday. Because whether we are talking about the future of our own country, or whether we are debating our ability to raise the standards not only of our own people but of peoples living at far lower standards of life than ours, or whether we are debating our strength and influence in the counsels of the nations and the way in which that strength and influence should be used, all this is sounding brass and tinkling cymbal if we fail to assert our full economic strength.There are many here who can bear witness to the fact that I daily receive letters and resolutions from Constituency Parties and Trade Unions - they can bear witness because they send them - asking sometimes in perempt­ory terms that Britain\u2019s influence and Britain\u2019s weight be thrown behind some great cause, some great issue, some great concern. But I say to this Conference - as I said to the T.U.C. - that that influence, that weight, that power to intervene, perhaps decisively, the power to lead, all these depend not only on our moral strength. They depend neither on resolutions nor on demonstrations. They depend on our material strength, on the mobilisation of our economic power and vigour. For I have never ceased in Opposition or in Government to proclaim the doctrine that in the last resort no one will listen to a Britain in pawn.Economic independence means more than this. It means that we must be to plan our social policies, our policies of economic reconstruction, with the assurance that we shall not be blown off course by adverse winds, whether here in Britain or abroad. We have been living on too narrow margins. For ten years and more we have not been in a situation when this country could engage on bold programmes of expansion and social advance with the assurance of the home capacity, and overseas trading surplus to give us the security we require. The economic problem has over­shadowed our every act since we took office in October, 1964. And some of the short-term measures we have had to take to secure our base for further advance have not always been understood even among those, such as the delegates here today; whose loyalty has never been in question.On platform after platform, before and during the 1964 Election, and during the 1966 Election, we said that paying our way must be our first priority. We warned the country of the type of measures that would have to be­taken to deal with any crisis, while our long-­term structural and technological reforms were taking effect. We appealed to neither cupidity nor complacency - the twin pillars of Con­servative electioneering over 13 years. And because we told the people the facts, and because we have taken the measures that were needed, since our last Conference we have seen our overseas payments deficit cut from £760 million in 1964 to £320 million last year.We have seen a record rise in our 1965 exports followed by increases this year which, compared with last year\u2019s, were double the average increase over the past 10 years.But the events of this summer, which my colleagues will be explaining in greater detail, tomorrow, created a situation where even our rapidly rising exports provided insufficient margins to see us through. That was why the July measures were introduced. And without anticipating tomorrow's debate I would just say this.The July measures were required to deal with a crisis. But, however rough and painful their immediate effects, we must regard them not as a backward reversion to stop-go, but as a necessary condition for the nation\u2019s advance to economic strength and independence, to industrial expansion and rising living stan­dards. We reject Tory stop-go methods. The Government is continuing with every weapon in the Government\u2019s armoury to stimulate industrial development in the areas the Tories neglected. It is to be seen again in our categorical exemption from the restrictions of the priority programmes of house-building, school-building and hospital building. Thirdly, our rejection - never found in the Tory stop-go - of the proposition that the burdens of retrenchment should be placed on those least able to bear them. For we have matched economic retrenchment with social advance.This is not all. The real difference lies in the use we shall make of the release of resources we have so painfully brought about. For them, crisis measures led to years of stagnation, to be followed by a feverish pre-Election boom which plunged the country once again into a balance of payments crisis - each crisis graver than its predecessor, each set of measures to deal with that crisis more devastating in its effect on industrial activity and employment. We have not cut back the consumer boom only to follow it with years of stagnation leading to a recrudescence of the uncontrolled consumer boom, with all that would cost the nation\u2019s economy. As I made clear to the National Productivity Conference, while we cannot contemplate any general easement of the deflationary measures until Britain is paying her way, and seen to be paying her way, we are prepared even in this period of restraint and restriction to use at any rate some of the resources which have been released to reinforce the measures we have taken for industrial reconstruction and re-equipment.The July measures, in fact, must now pro­vide us with a once-for-all opportunity to break the whole miserable cycle we inherited. So far from being a rejection of expansion, they create an opportunity to continued expansion, provided - but only provided - that we use this breathing space well, provided that we use it to strengthen our industrial base. So far from threatening the nation with continuing un­employment, by creating the opportunity for a new breakthrough in export production they hold out the surest guarantee we have of full employment for a generation. And by the measures we hope we have shocked the nation into accepting, we have provided the means to more efficient management, and to an elimina­tion of costly and wasteful working practices.These are the conditions, the only conditions for further and sustained advance. But they require a national response. A response in terms of productivity and a rejection of the industrial conservatism to which too many on both sides of industry still timidly cling. Equally, they demand a response in terms of an acceptance of, first the standstill, then the period of severe restraint in prices and incomes.We know what we are asking. We know and understand the anxieties, the fears, the suspicions, the sacrifices, not only of immediate transitory gain, but of long deeply held built-in industrial attitudes. We know how much has been done to try and make the voluntary system work. We know, too, the factors which have been operating against the success of the voluntary system.And now, with a month\u2019s further experience in these matters, I make clear again today, as I did at the T.U.C., that at the end of the day the Government must take the final decision in the interests of the nation as a whole. We shall not shrink from that decision.For what is at stake is whether we can have economic planning for full employment, if prices and incomes are governed by a free-for-all. What is at stake is whether in conditions of full employment price stability at home and abroad can ever be achieved, except through a conscious assertion of social responsibility in the matter of incomes of all kinds.The fact that incomes - wages, salaries and all other incomes - cannot be allowed to rise at a rate faster than national productivity, has been asserted by Trades Union Congresses and Labour Party Conferences for nearly 10 years. The planned expansion of wages based on pro­ductivity was one of the great declarations that came out of the Scarborough Conference three years ago.The Tories failed and they failed because they were not prepared to create the climate of social justice for which we had called. After Scarborough I said that, precisely because we would be prepared to contribute the necessary conditions, we would have the right to ask the people of Britain for a prices and incomes policy. And it is precisely because we insist that an incomes policy must cover all incomes and not just wages, it is precisely because Labour Budgets have attacked the system of fiscal privilege in expense accounts and tax-free capital gains, while a new system of industrial taxation favours investment as against divi­dends, it is precisely because we are ending the free-for-all for the speculator, the land profiteer and the landlord, it is for all these reasons, that we have the right to say now \u2013 \u2018We have delivered; and we have the right now to ask that, not only this movement, but the nation should give their assent to what the national interest requires.\u2019Years ago we demanded a change in Government attitudes - and we had to have a change in Government to secure it. We have now the right to ask for a corresponding change in the attitudes of all in industry.I have stressed this aspect of the call your Government is making to the nation, not because it is the central issue or the be all and end all of economic and social policy. It is not. Equally it is not the central issue in all we were elected to do; it is simply one essential pre­condition to everything I have painted on to the far wider canvas I have tried to show this morning.And those issues are first and foremost independence, with all it means in terms of social advance at home, the lead we must be able to take in the war on world poverty and the fight for peace. For Britain, above all a socialist Britain, the Britain you and I want can never opt out of world history.The productivity, industrial modernisation, the sense of self-discipline and restraint for which we ask will provide the industrial base for social advance, for the assertion of a new system of privilege in this country, based on need and not birth, based, too, on a fair and equal chance in life for all Britain\u2019s children - everything that makes up our whole new vision of society.But above all, we are fighting to give a new meaning to democracy, a militant, partici­pating, progressive, socialist democracy that will release and mobilise the energies and skills of all our people. In seeking a total and conscious rejection of conservatism in all its forms, we are aiming to transform our society by consent, to build a new Britain and to show a world wherein far too many countries socialism exists without democracy and democracy without socialism, that we can succeed where others have failed in meeting the challenge of our times.These are the inestimable gifts which this Government and this people can give to Britain for this generation, and every genera­tion to come.In October,1964, on the day when, for the first time for 13 years, a Parliament assembled with a Labour majority in the House of Commons, my colleagues and I, all the mem­bers of the new Administration, were called to a service in the Crypt Chapel of St. Stephen\u2019s, St. Mary Undercroft in the Palace of West­minster, a service of dedication before we embarked on the tasks ahead of us. Last April, with our mandate renewed, I asked my colleagues to meet once again in a service of re-dedication. One of those who joined in conducting the service, a member of our Party, Donald Soper, expressed the aims of this Government in this short prayer:O God, grant us a vision of our land, fair as it might be;A land of righteousness where none shall wrong his neighbour;A land of plenty where evil and poverty shall; be done away;A land of brotherhood where all success shall be founded on service, and honour shall be given to excellence alone;A land of peace, where order shall not rest on force, but on the love of all for the common life and weal;Bless our efforts to make the vision a living reality;Inspire and strengthen each one of us that we may give time, thought and sacrifice to speed the day of its coming.When the time comes, I would want this Government, this Movement, to be judged not only by the British nation, but by history, by our success or failure in turning this prayer into a reality. (Standing ovation.)

aVI move, Mr. Chairman, the acceptance of the Parliamentary Report.We are now nearing the end of the first Parliamentary session following the 1966 General Election, and the very full Report which has been circulated to delegates has got to be seen not only as a long list of Acts of Parliament but as a record of Government action. And far more, it is a spelling out in terms of Government action of the basic social and economic priorities of this Labour Government.What we have had to do in dealing with the economic crisis is the cause of the deep anxieties which fill the hearts of every one of us here at this Conference, and I am going to deal with those anxieties. But it is vital that our concern about them should not blind us to what we have done in these three years, and the enormous progress we have made towards achieving the goals that we together set our­selves here at Scarborough four years ago.Today I am going to give you the facts. In the three years we have been in office we have ended the slide to social inequalities and public neglect. We have put in hand a dramatic deployment of resources in favour of those in greatest need, in favour of the under-privi­leged, on all fronts of social action - social security, health and welfare, the housing of our people, the education of our children and our young people - the most massive ever carried through. We have set out to make good the damage done to our society by a system of Tory Government, a Tory Government which upheld a two-standard system that in another country won recognition in the phrase \u2018private affluence and public squalor.\u2019And remember what we have done is so far only three years' work. We are still less than half way from the Election of October, 1964, to the statutory end of this Parliament. Already our plans, our plans for further expansion, have been laid for the next three years and beyond against the background of the resources which will be available.Remember, too, that we have carried through this programme of social advance against a background of inherited economic difficulties. When they were faced with econo­mic crises, the Tories cut the social services again and again. When economic crisis over­took them, as it did every four years, they placed new burdens on those least able to bear them. Twice they increased the weight of the prescription charges. They cut school building, they cut the building of houses to rent. To be fair to them, they did not cut the hospital building programme. They had hardly any hospital building programme to cut.Now my colleagues from the platform this week are giving the facts about the social pro­vision we have made for bettering the lives of our people, and let me this morning draw these facts together.Provision for the old, the sick and the disabled. In 1963/64, the Tories\u2019 last financial year - and remember this was a peak year for them because they deliberately pushed up their social services spending as the Election drew nearer - in 1963/64, the total they provided for social security was £1,970 millions. This year we are providing £2,831 millions, an increase of £861 millions. (Applause) For every £100 they were spending, we are spending £144.Provision for the young - education. Their last full year, £1,363 millions: this year, £1,936 millions - an increase of £573 millions. For every £100 they provided on education, we are providing £142. Nor is our provision confined to school hours. On sport and other youth activities we are spending exactly twice as much as the figure they had worked up to in their pre-Election programme.Provision for health and welfare services. Their last full year, £1,118 millions: this year £1,619 millions, an increase of £501 millions. Again, for every £100 they provided in their peak year, we are providing £145.Housing and slum clearance. Their last full year, £657 millions: this year £1,018 millions, an increase of £361 millions. Again, for every £100 they provided in their peak year we are providing £155. I am giving you these figures, and I do not apologise because these are facts. (Applause)Now let us take the total spent on all the social services, on health and welfare, the social security and education of our people - and here I am excluding the massive help that we are giving to local authorities with their rates and the provision we are making for redun­dancy payments.I once said in those Opposition years, \u2018Among civilised men greatness amongst nations is judged not by a country\u2019s battle­ships, its supersonic bombers, its arms or its H-bombs, or by the speed and efficiency by which it can mount an imperialist military excursion. It is judged by its treatment of the least privileged of its citizens, its young children, its old folk, its war disabled and those injured in factories or in the mines.\u2019 Fine words, always easy in Opposition?Now the achievement. Our total provision for social services of all kinds for which, again, they allotted £5,144 millions in their last full year, their peak year, we are now providing £7,457 millions, an increase of over £2,300 millions over their last full year in office. (Applause) Fine words, then proud facts, facts achieved by your Labour Government.In a fortnight\u2019s time at the Conference of the Conservative and Opportunionist Party at Brighton (applause), they will promise slashing cuts in taxation. Let them at Brighton say which of these items of expenditure I have outlined they will cut. Pensions? Health? Hospitals? Housing? I remember that before the 1964 Election they boasted that they had costed everything. We doubted it then, but now that Mr. Marples has brought in a com­puter to grind out Party policies at the press of a button, it should be easy for them now to give us the answer. So let them give the facts and figures at Brighton of which of these items I have outlined they would cut in the interests of reduced taxation.Because the figures I have given you represent social priorities against an economic background which would have driven a Tory Government into social retreat and panic demolition. I have no doubt that some of you will feel like asking, \u2018Yes, but what about defence spending?\u2019 Quite right. In 1951, when there was a great debate about the rearmament programme, I expressed my doubts, as many of us did, about the priority between defence expenditure and social expenditure. We had then committed ourselves to a defence pro­gramme of £1,700 millions, and that had to be set against a total expenditure in 1951 on the social services of £2,069 millions. In other words, for every £100 allocated for defence, £122 were being spent on the social services. Now today, for every £100 we are spending on defence we are spending £340 on the social services, and in 1970/71 our planning provides that for every £100 we shall be spending on defence we shall be spending £390 on the social services. And in real terms, that is allowing for increased prices, defence expendi­ture this year has already been cut by one third, more than one third, compared with that 1951 defence plan.I doubt if there is a delegate here this morn­ing who, in 1964 or 1963 when we were last in Scarborough, even though the gravity of the economic position was at that time deliberately concealed from us by the then Government, I doubt if there is a delegate here who then would have thought that three years later we would be able to report an increase of £2,300 mil­lions, or nearly a half, in our provision for the social services.And for those who say we could spend more on the social services if we spent less on defence, let me remind them of this. The increase in our total provision for the social services - I am not talking about the total spending, I am talking about the increase since we came to office - that increase is considerably more than the total amount we are now spending on defence, a defence pro­gramme which we have cut. We have switched resources from defence to the social services - the right priority for a Socialist Government. (Applause)Now let us see what these Socialist priorities mean in human terms. Let us go into the home of an old-age pensioner. Of course, we have not abolished poverty yet. But for everyone in receipt of the basic pension, in three years we have raised the benefit paid by 22s. 6d. per week for a single person - 22s. 6d. a week over three years. In 13 years they only managed 37s. 6d. And, on top of this, now the social security supplement as of right to those who need it.Or suppose we take the case of a newly bereaved widow. Her husband was 55, he, had worked 40 years; he was earning, let us say, the average wage in British industry. In 1964 his widow would have had £4 15s. for the first 13 weeks. Now, that newly-bereaved widow would receive £10 8s. for 26 weeks. And after that she gets the Labour Government\u2019s increased rate of benefit, and she also gets everything she can gain from our abolition of the earnings rule for widows. (Applause)Or take housing subsidies. On a typical house, the subsidy is now over £85 a year against £24 when we came into office. Or a typical flat, a flat in many of our cities costing £5,000, the subsidy for this is now £112 as against £24 three years ago.Take our housing record which Tony Greenwood presented to Conference on Monday. Record completions, record starts, an all-time record in nearly half a million houses now under construction. Houses built to let: in a year of Tory squeeze, 1963, after 12 years in office, they built 124,000 houses to let. This year, despite economic difficulties, we shall complete not 124,000, but getting on for 200,000: 16 houses for every 10 they were building four years ago.Schools: they averaged 475 new schools a year. We are building well over 600 and we have just allocated more in the areas of greatest need. Primary schools, our first need: they averaged 295 a year, we are building 500.Hospitals. New hospital building: in their 13 years they spent £22.6 million a year. This year, we are spending £97.3 million. For every £100 they spent each year in their term of office, we are spending £431.So I could go on. All these achievements are a part of our Parliamentary Report to you, the victories won against bitter, sour, sullen opposition, won after weeks of weary com­mittee stages and long all-night sittings: the fruit of three years\u2019 clash between the Socialist way and the Tory way.But let us pause a moment now, in reverent remembrance of clashes and controversies which are no longer with us: a long list of bitter controversies which not long ago took the centre of the political stage and did that because the Conservatives put them in the centre of the political stage.The 1957 Rent Act, the proud creation of Duncan Sandys and Henry Brooke, now as irrelevant as the one and as forgotten as the other. There lies that Rent Act, dead, un-mourned, even by the party for which so long it was a living symbol of their eternal articles of faith. And in its place security of tenure for our people and a right to a fair rent.Or another forgotten controversy, Rach­manism, which right up to the end they tried to argue did not exist, or, if it did exist, it was all exaggerated, and, even if it wasn\u2019t, nothing could be done about it. That was what they said. In one quick, clean surgical operation our Rent Act has cut out, almost to its last ves­tiges, from London and our other big cities, this malignant growth which flourished and festered under Tory housing policy. (Applause)Prescription charges, the last refuge of every bankrupt Tory Chancellor, abolished in one short, sharp Act a few weeks after Labour came to office.Land racketeering, which the Tories defended as essential to a free market economy, essential even to the British way of life, and which right up to the last hour in October, 1964, they refused even to restrain - and now, because of Labour\u2019s Land Commission Act, another lost and almost forgotten controversy.Leasehold. How many resolutions have we had over the years, how many hours have we spent at Conference after Conference attacking this social blight which Tory landlordism insisted on retaining in our older towns and cities? We shall not have much to debate in future. The Leasehold Reform Bill is now in its very last stages. The Tories carried out their pledge to fight it every inch of the way. Legalised robbery, they called it. When our measure becomes law later this month, it will guarantee to a million British families security in their homes. (Applause)The other controversy, steel, so recently the ark of the Tory Covenant - and the key to the Tory treasure chest? Now, an issue settled, and settled for all time, in the interests of a great industry and the workers in that indus­try, and the nation that depends on that industry.These were some of the problems and con­troversies forced on the nation by a Tory Government. And they are dead. The prob­lems we are facing today, problems we debated yesterday, are problems of adjustment, of transition, deep economic and human problems of change arising from the restructuring and modernisation of our industrial fabric.We here do not look at these problems as technical problems. The issues raised - this was true yesterday, and it is true today - go right to the very heart of this movement. We are meeting at a time of deep concern and debate about the economic situation, and par­ticularly about the effects of the measures the Government had to take, on production and, above all, on employment. This concern is not only inevitable: it is right. For if any of us, however beset by the need to put Britain\u2019s international economic position right, were ever to forget for one moment the human realities, the realities for every family in this country, then none of us would have the right to bear the responsibilities that you have entrusted to us.For us unemployment is not a matter of social, still less economic, statistics. It is a human problem, and for very many people in this hall it has human - and bitter - memories.No-one who was brought up in one of our older industrial areas in the years of the depression - as I was in the West Riding, or Wales, Lancashire, the north-east or Scotland, or Cumberland or the Black Country - could ever erase those memories from his mind: what unemployment meant for his neighbours, his friends \u2013 one\u2019s own family - not in terms of living standards only, but the deeper psycho­logical effects that loss of work, loss of status, loss of dignity, loss of security and, perhaps above all, loss of hope brought to a familyFor many of us here, certainly for most of us who remember those days, this was the issue which brought us into politics, what we saw, what we lived through and our determina­tion that these things should be no more. And we are still, all of us, the same people.We reject as an instrument of economic policy the creation of a permanent pool - as they call it - of unemployment. Our aim, our whole policy, is to secure full employment, but to secure it on a permanent basis. (Applause)What else was the purpose of our controls over capital investment overseas; our insistence on keeping Britain competitive through a prices and incomes policy; of con­trolling office and factory building in the Midlands and the south and offering grants and premiums to help the Development Areas? What was the purpose of all this if not to end unemployment? And when these measures proved insufficiently powerful we took the July measures of 1966, to prevent the economic disaster which threatened us with a deeper and more lasting unemployment prob­lem. We have paid a heavy price for those measures, but those measures were necessary. There was no alternative.One consequence at least of those measures has been that over a wide sector of British industry, productivity has increased, costs have been reduced and waste eliminated. We have had a remarkable rise in productivity, in output per man, over this past year. But it has been increased productivity so far only in a negative sense. We have been producing the same amount as last year with less employ­ment. This is one of the tragedies we face because of its contribution to the unemployment problem although equally it is one of our main reasons of hope for the future.Because we are now able to look forward to the rising production which Jim has told us more than once this summer will be coming this autumn, and the rising employment which this increased productivity has made possible. And we have it in our power now - as never happened in the old stop-go cycle - to go for­ward to increased production and increased employment if and only if we remain competitive in the markets of the world.Production has already begun to increase. The latest figures show that the increase in our basic unemployment figures month by month in the earlier part of this year is now corning to an end. For the first time for nearly eighteen months the number of jobs available has started to increase. Let me ask you to take your minds back to last year, we remember the anxieties of the motor car workers who demonstrated at our conference last year. They are not here this year. The industry is moving, its leaders tell us, into a record boom, and it is a new opportunity that industry is fading, having now streamlined its costs, that makes so tragic the repeated unofficial strikes of the past few weeks. Add if next month\u2019s unemployment figures against the background of this developing boom were to show significant unemployment among car workers, let it be clear that will be due to strikes and not due, as we were told a year ago, to Government policy.I warned about the problems we face this winter because of weather and other factors which every winter temporarily raise the unemployment figure. But basically now there is an upturn in the economy. Last week, I warned, too that we will resist pressures to embark on an irresponsible reflationary policy which would undo all that has been achieved, and make meaningless the sacrifices for which we have had to ask. And yesterday Jim made clear why.The break-out that is now open to us must be industrial, technological, regional, because however necessary, monetary policy, credit squeezes and the rest, however essential to deal with a short-term critical situation, these things do not of themselves provide the answer. The answer lies in industrial restructuring and reorganisation. Above all, it lies in the application of technology to our industrial processes and in speeding the process of industrial change.This was the message of Scarborough 1963. Let me remind you what that message was. It was first a demand for more purposive policies in education, to strengthen our educational system and above all to widen the gates of educational opportunity including higher education, including too, adequate facilities in every part of our educational structure for the training of scientists, technologists and engineers.And that Scarborough message; secondly, was a demand for the mobilisation of our scientific talent, on the job of creating new opportunities far our industry - and in that mobilisation to carry through a massive re­deployment of scientists, from defence projects to the needs of industry and peaceful reconstruction.That Scarborough message, thirdly, was the long neglected need to apply the results of science to British industry whether in moder­nising our older industries or in creating new industriies bated on science.And fourthly, the message of Scarborough was the message of technological change, a second industrial revolution, yes, but the message was a revolution which by this time would be humanised, would be tempered with a humanity and a care for social values; a care for human values which was lacking in the first industrial revolution. And I remember with what insistence the need to relate this revolution to human values was pressed, in the debate, in speech after speech from the floor, and in Dick Crossman\u2019s reply from the platform.I said here at Scarborough that if socialism had never existed the challenge and opportunities of the new scientific revolution would have brought it into being, and if I believed that four years ago, I believe it more than ever now in the light of the last three years through which we have lived.The traditional socialism of this country was created out of the squalor and the inhumanity and the exploitation of that first industrial revolution.And today in some of our older industries and in the environment of some of our older industrial areas, we still have the problems of economic and social change resulting from that industrial age of brass and iron, muck and money. The delegate from the Rhondda spelt out that inheritance yesterday in, for me, one of the most moving speeches of this Conference. (Applause) And socialism today, the socialism of the future, means translating into human terms the immeasurable possibili­ties which science and technology, freely encouraged and harnessed to social needs and national needs, can create.That was the message of Scarborough four years ago, and today, after four years - three of them in government - we look at that Scar­borough message against the harsh test of reality - but also against a proud record of achievement.First, and I take the first part of that message, what we have achieved in education - education at all levels. We have increased teacher training, the first guarantee of smaller classes. We have stepped up primary school building. Our determination to end the vicious system under which the educational future of a child can be determined by an arbitrary and unscientific test at the incredible age of 11. (Applause) This battle is now on. We are deeply engaged in it all over the country. We intend to win it - all of us here together. (Applause) But this is not all. The message of Scarborough was that if neither humanity nor the long-term needs of the nation could afford segregation, educational apartheid at 11 plus, equally we could not afford an unfair process of segregation at 18 plus. We called for a rapid expansion in higher education, the widening of the gates of opportunity, to every kind of higher education. There were 22 universities in Britain when we were last in Scarborough. Today there are 44. (Applause) And this is partly because all the former Colleges of Advanced Technology have achieved or are achieving university status in a very real sense. And as we then demanded, here is one place where an end has been put to the educational snobbery which stood in the way. When we were last in Scarborough, there were 203,000 students in our universities and our other institutions of higher education. Today, there are 325,000, an increase of 60 per cent; 105,000 of these are in science and tech­nology, an increase of 32,000 over four years ago. We are now spending £470 millions on higher education, 88 per cent more than four years ago. Capital spending on universities is now double what it was four years ago. The number of teachers in training has risen from 54,000 to 95,000 this year. We are spending £124 millions, nearly 75 per cent more than four years ago, on scientific research at our universities and research councils. We are linking the work of these universities more and more, and of the Colleges of Further Educa­tion and the new Polytechnics more and more with industry and with the regions where they are situated. So that was the first message of Scarborough.And the second theme of Scarborough - ­scientific and technological research. This year Government spending on all civil scientific research and development will be about £266 millions compared with £158 millions four years ago. And this includes as we then demanded, a massive redeployment from defence research to civil research.And we are getting priorities into our scientific research - priorities not only between civil and defence research, priorities within civil research, because we cannot afford at once all the research - and all the equipment - all our scientists would want.Now I come to the third theme, the applica­tion of all this scientific research in technological application to British industry. You have had our reports to Conference about what Frank Cousins and now Tony Benn have achieved in carrying out the Scarborough mandate at the Ministry of Technology. I am not going to go over this whole story, it is too long, but when you have heard about the emergency action taken to save the British computer industry - and how it is now going from strength to strength - the establishment of a completely computerised publicly-owned banking service through the giro system, and now about the new national data processing service, based on seven giant British com­puters, which come into operation this week, the reorganisation of the British machine tool industry, and the massive help the Ministry is giving to its most forward-looking designers in producing more and more modern instruments backed by Government guarantee - when you heard from the Minister how Aldermaston scientists and the miniature servo-mechanisms originally built for missiles are now being redeployed on the production of artificial limbs for the industrially disabled and for thalido­mide children - you can see that Scarborough mandate working in applications which none of us could have seen four years ago. But you can see the emergence in practice - now not prospect - of the themes we then endorsed. The theme of making the commanding heights of British technology independent of American domination. The theme of transferring human resources and physical resources from military research to the blitz on our economic and social problems.And the theme of reducing our humiliating inherited dependence on industry overseas for the supply of advanced modern machinery - machinery which, given the right lead and the right stimulus, we have always known could and should be pioneered and produced in this country.And the fourth theme, Mr. Chairman, of Scarborough, was the humanising of the tech­nological revolution. We said that the indus­trial pattern of the future and the pace of industrial change would not only call for vastly expanded programmes of training young people in industry. It would mean that very many of our industrial workers would have to be given facilities for retraining, for learning new skills, once and perhaps twice during their working lives.Yesterday Jim announced further actions we are taking in order to encourage training; Government Training Centres, training in the factory and the rest, and because of what we are doing we have the right to demand a similar sense of urgency from many in industry.After the T.U.C. at Brighton I asked the Economic Committee of the General Council to come to see me. What I said to them then I want to say to some of the powerful industrial delegations here this morning. You have expressed your concern about unemployment - and, you know, my colleagues and I feel that concern as deeply as any who spoke at the rostrum either in Brighton or here in Scarborough.Here is one practical thing you can do, you can remove the restrictions on employment of men when they have been trained (Applause) - and this applies equally to men trained in Government Training Centres and to men trained up to semi-skilled level in the Develop­ment Areas. Because already there have been too many cases where Government training, and industrial training at Government expense, has been frustrated and negatived by a veto from the shop stewards and others on their being employed in jobs which make use of their new skill (Applause) It is right in Congress and in Conference for all of us to make speeches about unemployment, but those speeches must be backed by action in the unions especially at local level. (Applause)And equally important with many is the need to bring new work to the areas affected. One of the big differences between us and the Tories has always been that we recognise that Britain\u2019s industrial problems \u2013 Britain\u2019s em­ployment problem - above all the ability to expand without lurching into balance of pay­ments difficulties - is dependent on mobilising the full productive power of the regions which were neglected for so long; the recognition that our problems could not be solved on a two-nations policy. Yes, they were ready to talk about the two nations, but they were never prepared to make them one. They were never ready to apply with sufficient vigour the policy of restraining excessive growth in the pros­perous regions that was needed to create full employment in the areas which for so long they left depressed.We acted. Our decision to schedule large areas - nearly the whole of Scotland, large parts of Wales, the south west, north east and elsewhere, as Development Areas, this re­placed their policy of narrow growth points which would have left whole areas to decay. Our advance factory building programme - more than twice as large in three years, as they achieved in 13 years - our boosting of Govern­ment expenditure for factory development in these areas - fourfold compared with the last Tory year. Our tighter grip on factory development in congested areas - our exten­sion of this control to office building, the sharply discriminating investment grants for Development Areas; the regional employment premiums started last month - £100 millions a year for the Development Areas. This is what we have so far done. Now in the period of industrial expansion which lies ahead there will be further clear and deliberate discrimina­tion in favour of the Development Areas.Four years ago we talked of science-based industries in the Development Areas. The enlargement of scientific research facilities, the time required for that research to bear fruit and the still longer time required to apply it to industry, meant that very little could be achieved in a period of three years - or longer. No one expected it.But let me tell you this morning of a new proposal for the establishment of new science-based industries in Development Areas.As a result of great advances in nuclear generation, where Britain now leads the world and here let us not be backward in again proclaiming another triumph of public enterprise (applause) - as a result of these advances the new generating stations of the 70\u2019s will be able to produce electricity for industrial use far cheaper than electricity costs today. Thank God for that. (Laughter and Applause)This will mean that it will be economic to establish big new industries in this country which we have not had before because our power costs were not competitive with hydro­electric power overseas. And it will mean the opportunity, in Development Areas, for new industries which we have not previously had in this country. Industries which will help to make us less dependent on overseas production.We are now prepared to build publicly-owned power stations to work in partnership with private enterprise smelter industries - the electricity to be supplied at a price based on the stations\u2019 own generating costs. And the construction can start now. We are ready to start today to discuss with the aluminium industry the provision of one or more giant smelters, competitively powered with nuclear electricity, and this need not mean any further erosion into the coal industry because these stations, and the industries they will bring in their train, will be additional projects, addi­tional consumers of electricity which do not exist today.Indeed, there is a possibility - which I am now discussing with the Chairman of the Coal Board - of associating the coal industry with this type of project in the Development Areas. (Applause)The Secretary of State for Economic Affairs will be announcing more details about our proposals later today. This is one more contribution to the problem of the regions and to the strengthening of our national industrial base to add to those which Jim outlined yester­day. This is right on social grounds; it is right on human grounds; and it is right because of the special problems caused by the rundown of older industries in those areas.But it makes hard economic sense, too. The essence of the Tory stop-go policy was that industrial expansion was halted after a brief period because of overheating in the pros­perous areas of the Midlands and the south and because of the crippling shortages of labour, skilled and unskilled, leading to a loss of potential exports and an increase in imports. That was the essence of the stop-go cycle.Then, because of this overheating in the Midlands and the south, the nation as a whole was plunged back into a freeze which rapidly spread to the very areas which had barely emerged from the previous chill and where unemployment was still too high. It is the pur­pose of this Government, by every means in our power, including those the Chancellor described yesterday, to narrow and ultimately to eliminate the differential between the Development Areas and the rest of the country. There is no surer prescription for continued industrial advance without launch­ing into localised inflation and overheating.But there is more than this. Historically, American development was based on an advancing frontier in the West; that of Russia on an advancing frontier in the East. In this crowded island the new industrial frontier for the next generation depends on opening up again the areas of the first industrial revolution which the Tories allowed to decline into grime and decay - the areas where industry was born. We accept this frontier as a challenge to the Government, but it is a challenge, too, you know, to our young people.Mr. Chairman, we have already got under way a vast programme of urban renewal and modernisation which is literally changing the face of Britain. All over the country, but per­haps most strikingly in the older industrial areas of the north, the grime and muddle and decay of our Victorian heritage is being replaced. The new city centres with their university precincts, their light, clean and well-spaced civic buildings, will not merely brighten the physical environment of our people, they will change the very quality of urban life in Britain.If this is true of old areas, old industries are coming to life as well. There is the work of the Industrial Reorganisation Corporation, hard at work in the modernisation and restructuring of our industries. There is the decisive and timely help given by the Ministry of Tech­nology to an ailing shipbuilding industry to help it to break through into the new age of shipbuilding created by the container revolu­tion and also to enable it to enter on a com­petitive basis the age of the giant tanker.One of our troubles is we cannot always tell you what is coming next in the field of new encouraging development. Last week I was on television answering some very grave anxieties on development areas. There were many people in development areas wondering whether the shipbuilding industry had a future. I could not tell them that night - I did not want any last-minute hitch - that the next day we should be announcing the biggest tanker order in the history of this country ­(applause) - which would not have been pos­sible but for the work of Tony Benn and his Ministry in seeing that order through.Mr. Chairman, I have talked about the road to economic success. As Jim made clear yester­day and as I have to make clear again today, there is no easy road. What we can put before this Conference is what we must do if we are to solve our problems, including the establish­ment of full employment. First, the increase in productivity we have achieved over this year in such heavy cost in human terms must not be dissipated. As production and employment increase, there must be no return to waste, whether in the use of labour or in any other element that enters into the cost.Secondly, expansion must proceed through investment in industry, through exports and import saving, and through imaginative regional policies, and through developing unused resources in the Development Areas.Thirdly, expansion must be based on an unremitting insistence on the application of new technologies in British industry, embrac­ing research and design and marketing and management. But we have the right, as I have said, to insist that technological advance must be tempered by human considerations.Fourthly, there can be no success for our policies, for exports, or the breakthrough to full employment, except on the basis of a fully effective policy for prices and incomes, in partnership, with the T.U.C. and in partner­ship with industry.Fifthly, we must proceed on a basis of partnership between Government and indus­try, not only on a basis of full consultation, of full partnership in decision, but on the basis also that the Government cannot submit to dictation by any industrial interest about the course it is necessary to pursue.This is the prescription for a strong economy, strong at home and abroad; for firmly based expansion, for rising and assured employment, for social justice. This is the message of Scarborough 1967. This is the New Britain.Before I sit down, I think it is right that against this realistic policy - and all of us here know it is realistic - the policy which will be the policy of this nation for the next three years, and beyond: it is against this that we must, I think, spend a few moments - I so rarely do this; I am going to do it this morning - testing the specious claims of those who from time to time press themselves upon the attention of the nation.We have now had three years to judge the record of the Conservative Party in their role as Her Majesty\u2019s Opposition. Not I believe in our lifetime, certainly not in 1945-51, have we had an Opposition which so clearly rejected from the outset any pretence to be an alterna­tive Government - (applause) - and which chose instead the more pleasant role, perhaps - the negative role - of the opportunist reacting to events.I want to make it clear that I have got every sympathy for them. (Laughter) Their motivat­ing force is a sense of deprivation, a sense that men ordained by a benevolent Providence to rule our affairs should have had power so rudely wrested from them by democratic electoral process. (Applause)In Parliament they are ineffective, apart from occasional sparks emitted by one or two of their leading shadow ex-Ministers now without even shadow portfolios. (Laughter) They fail as an Opposition, precisely because they have not realised that you cannot oppose unless you have a coherent and constructive alternative to offer to the policies of the Government. (Applause) For three years they have opposed practically every measure we have introduced, even some which they intro­duced and which we have re-introduced. They had to get on the pop radio bandwagon, after they were pledged to abolish pirate radio. The test they have applied - at least they have been consistent in this - has not been, \u2018Will this measure help Britain?\u2019, but will it win votes, will it call into being some potentially powerful lobby which will help them on the road back to office and power.They have opposed every measure proposed by the Government to secure economy in expenditure, whether on costly prestige air­craft, or on any other single item. In this Parliamentary Session alone - I do not want to inflict an all-night sitting on you - they have opposed defence economies in Malta and Aden - and, of course, further east - they have demanded more spending on pay for doctors and dentists in the Forces, and pressed it to a Division, more money on university students, on drugs legislation, on pensioners, on S.E.T. refunds, on aid for Barbados, and a lot more besides. All this, and transport, too, where they have put forward a programme which on the best authoritative costing would increase Government expenditure by £10,000 million.Yet at the same time they promise to cut taxation. (Laughter) On taxation they proclaim the fiscal dreams of a Gladstone, and on expenditure they speak the language of the pork barrel. When the news is good for Britain they pass by in silent embarrassment­ (laughter) - too small to proclaim the achieve­ments of a Britain in which they are remote from power. And when the going is hard they are quick for party advantage to provide aid and comfort to those at home and abroad, the sell-Britain-short brigade who scrutinise every cloud over Britain in the hope of a speculative silver lining for themselves. (Applause)This is a proud country, a country which has no time for those who knock Britain when we are up against it and no time for a party who could boast of a Britain which, when they were in charge, ran into a gaping deficit, and a party who now indulge in petulant pro­nouncements to denigrate a Britain which is paying her way. This is our country and this is their country too. You know, I may have views - and I think it is safe to express them in Scarborough - about the action of the M.C.C. in dismissing the captain I would have wanted to see in the West Indies (applause) - I cannot tell you what those views are, because they are unprintable (laughter) - but however that may be it will not stop me cheering from afar for every run, every wicket our cricketers get on to the scorecard. (Applause)Not the Tories, so they look for other consolation. Deprived of national power, they seek to instruct local councils from their Central Office - this is a party that fought local election after local election on the high principle of keeping politics out of local government. (Applause)Now, I read in the Daily Telegraph - and I believe it (laughter) - of their leader, and I quote, \u2018instructing\u2019 local Conservative coun­cillors. I do not try to instruct local Labour councillors, I know what I would get if I did. (Laughter) And I read in The Times - and I believe that too - an elaborate account of how the G.L.C. now is to be run not from County Hall but from Tory Central Office. This is what they voted for, or what they abstained about. (Laughter) Equally, you know, we have every right to expose the Tory successive attempts to seduce for factional purposes great industrial organisations into resisting Govern­ment policy on clearly defined national objectives.Consider their record: on the eve of the 1966 Trades Union Congress, they took time off from their reiterated desire to constrict our free trade union movement within the legalistic shackles of a corporative state to instruct Con­gress to reject the Government\u2019s appeal for an effective prices and incomes policy, even though this was an end for which Tory Chan­cellor after Tory Chancellor, and even Chair­man Hogg, had striven. (Laughter) Striven they had, though not one of them was ever prepared to will the means. The Trades Union Congress treated this appeal with the contempt it deserved.A year ago, too, in a hastily prepared noc­turnal statement (laughter) Conservative leaders appealed to British industry to convert the National Productivity Conference, repre­senting all sections of industry, which was meeting under my chairmanship, into a forum for the dissemination of Conservative irrelevancies. The Conference refused. But more recently, when a policy of partnership between the Government and industry re­quires a new approach to the problem of Government participation and help in essen­tial industrial projects, including projects which in these past few weeks have been proved to be necessary to save essential British industries from bankruptcy, at this moment of time their leaders issued the instruction - again an instruction, and I quote, \u2018private enterprise must fight,\u2019 and this at a moment when private firms have been approaching the Government as never before for help. (Applause)On this occasion, because of certain announcements made last week, the Tory leadership may think they would have had more success. On the forthcoming Industrial Expansion Bill, an essential instrument in the fight for economic expansion and full employ­ment, they may be feeling from the most recent decisions of the Confederation of British Industry that they have at last chalked up a success in instructing somebody to do something. It is my duty to tell them that they misjudge the situation, that the Grand Council of the C.B.I. may share their ignorance of what our proposals mean; they do not share their malice. (\u2018Hear, Hear\u2019) Mr. Chairman, the Government must govern and if it is our duty to resist demands from the Trades Union Congress to repeal legislation we consider essential, it is certainly no less our duty to resist a demand from others in industry that we drop proposed legislation which we believe to be in the interests of the country. (Applause) But all this apart, this Conference - I say this now before I sit down - has the right to ask the Opposition two questions. The first: What is their policy on prices and incomes? Mr. Maudling considers it essential; Mr. Powell indicts it as nonsense, then, as that is not good enough, condemns it as a \u2018silly nonsense,\u2019 and then he sentences it to perdition as \u2018transparent nonsense.\u2019Now, where do they stand? Actually, I believe from their own words that they have now come to believe in the need for some sort of a prices and incomes policy, but I believe too that here at least they have a policy, a policy which on one or two occasions they have inadvertently and indiscreetly blurted out and which they would like really to keep a dark secret. You know, I think this should be very carefully studied. Their official spokesmen have made it clear that there would be no problem of rising incomes, no pressure for higher wages, if the level of demand in this country were cut to and were kept at a lower level than it has been. We have the right to ask them, to what level? Even today, with unem­ployment at a figure none of us here is pre­pared to tolerate, industry after industry is demanding higher wages. The Tory prescrip­tion, then, must be for a still higher level of unemployment, but at what figure? I think the trade unions and I think the nation are entitled to know.At least let them recall this, that their official spokesman earlier this year used these ominous words: \u2018It is easy now to see our mistakes. We made life at once too easy and too hard for private enterprise; too easy because to keep unemployment far lower than it is now we kept demand too high and busi­nessmen therefore had full order books whether they were efficient or not.\u2019For us, today\u2019s figure of 555,000 unem­ployed, with whatever seasonal variation up and down may occur, that figure is too high. (Applause) For the Tories, on the other hand, on their own arguments, that figure is too low, because it does not achieve such a balance between demand and supply as to deter trade unions from formulating wage claims.But secondly we are entitled to demand a clear statement about their policy for the social services and about the extension of means testing. I believe what they say on this is serious, I believe this has been thought through. What they seek now to do is to restore to our people all the indignities of a public assistance society. Since our last Con­ference your Government has abolished the stigma which many people felt attached to the old national assistance. They want to go right back now, and this in a year in which we have seen the publication of a report showing that up to half a million of our fellow citizens were too proud to claim National Assistance when they had the right to it and when they needed it.Now, thanks to Peggy Herbison\u2019s historic measure, those 500,000 are getting the help they need and getting it of right. Whatever the Brighton Conference may proclaim, we here are dedicated to the maintenance of human dignity. We reject the means test society and we reject those who demand that we put the clock back 30 years to restore it. (Applause)So, Mr. Chairman, let us leave to them their vision of Britain, the Britain they seek to restore, a class-ridden Britain, a Britain of privilege, of social privilege, of educational privilege, a Britain based on the right of that privileged class to lord it over all the rest of Britain\u2019s citizens whom we represent. That Tory Britain which before we next meet in Scarborough will have been consigned beyond recall to the social history of a bygone age. (Applause)That was their Britain.  The Britain we are creating is the one which we, all of us, set out from Scarborough four years ago to create.The Government, the Parliamentary Party, whose Report I am commending to Conference, could have no being except for the work and devotion, the support and under­standing, not only of the delegates here but of those whom they represent, the people of Britain. I have given you a progress report of what at this half-way stage, after three years, we have accomplished with the mandate you entrusted to us, a record of social advance, but a record, too, of an indomitable fight for the future of Britain against the constraints imposed upon us by the economic situation we inherited.We have asked our people for great sacri­fices and we know how deeply those sacrifices have cut into the lives of our own people. We are determined, with your continued support to see that those sacrifices will not have been in vain. Your support has carried us through days - through years - of unprecedented difficulty. We honour that trust. We are determined to be worthy of it.

aVMadam Chairman, fellow delegates, thank you for what the BBC, if they are true to their usual form, will tonight describe as a hostile reception.This is the Conference they will look back on and say: \u2018That was when Labour came back fighting.\u2019This has been a rough year for all of us in this movement. A rough year for those who have worked their hearts out in by-elections only to see the Party go down. It has been a year of bitter disappointments in the local elections. We have suffered the loss from our civic life, for a time at any rate, of the services of many hundreds of councillors, with a lifelong record of selfless, work for their local communities.It has been a year in which an oppor­tunist Opposition, backed by the special interests which support them, have thrown everything at us. Politically, personally, the lot. And in all these months I have not replied. Not yet. I shall choose my time.But we have come through. We have not lost our nerve and we are stronger for it. We shall need this nerve, this determination, this comradeship, in the period still ahead of us, when all of us know there can be no relaxation, no let-up if we are to achieve all that we have set out to do, and all that will stem from it. One thing; we know now the worst they can do to us. And they know it, too.The Tories know that time is not on their side. Whatever brave show they put on in Blackpool next week, the truth is that they have already started their cruel post-election inquest on what went wrong.And the reason they know that time is not on their side is because they have an uneasy and growing fear that Labour has got the measure of the problems - the problems not that your Government only is facing but that Britain is facing. The problems not of four years past, but of forty. The problems of moving forward from Imperialism to a modern industrial society. They can see that a pattern is emerging.It is precisely because they sense this that only a few weeks ago they made that carefully planned, much heralded act of des­peration, their campaign directed to suggest that a final and overwhelming economic crisis was only days away. They must have known that there were many in the City, and still more abroad, who, hearing these warnings and believing them, might well have been led to endanger Britain\u2019s recovery with an artificially induced flight of capital. Not for the first time. Next week here they will parade their patriotism. But it always comes off second-best wherever they see a prospect of party gain.Labour seeks to unite the nation in support of the policies of change which are needed. The Tory Party seek only to divide and destroy.Not one word of what they are saying is relevant to the pattern which is emerging and which will be the main theme of this Conference.The emerging pattern of post-Imperial Britain, of the new Britain in a fast changing world. Change made necessary by the economic sacrifice and disruption caused by two world wars and Britain's sacrifices in those wars. Changes whose roots go even further back to the turn of the century, when Britain lost the industrial primacy which she had won in the age of coal, steel and cotton.Britain under Clem Attlee\u2019s post-war Labour Government made a brave attempt to reconstruct the economic damage of the war and to begin to come to terms with the post-Imperial world. Under the Tory Government Britain lost her way precisely because the Government of those years failed to recognise the shape of the world that was emerging. Instead of building on the industrial achievements of the post-war Labour Government, all we had was Edwardian nostalgia and drift.Instead of refashioning an industrial structure that could compete with the new and more dynamic economies of East and West, we lost ground year by year. In those 13 years Britain\u2019s share of world trade in manufactures fell from 21 per cent to 14 per cent - by a third.Over the same years the Tory Govern­ment\u2019s refusal to come to terms with the facts of our world position meant that our overseas Government expenditure, mainly defence, got out of control.In 1959 overseas Government spending was £270 million. The year we took over, 1964-5, it was £477 million. Over £200 million more. And still rapidly rising.Their achievement was this - to narrow and weaken our economic base at home while widening the superstructure of military commitments abroad which their ever-weakening base had to support. The econo­mic strength that Britain can put forward can never be greater than what Britain\u2019s industry can produce and sell.While they neglected Britain\u2019s industry, they gloried in the role of world policeman and world bankers. They neglected every chance to reduce our sterling balance and the vulnerability of sterling as a reserve currency. They borrowed short in order to lend long because doctrinaire financial imperialism and the prestige of the City demanded they lend long.In October 1964 we took over the role of world policeman with an intolerable rate of overseas military expenditure; just as we took over under-equipped fighting services stretched beyond endurance to meet Duncan Sandys\u2019 ill-defined commitments. And equally in 1964 we took over the role of world banker, a 1914 role in a world where because of two wars we had lost the assets and the investments which half a century earlier had made the role practicable.Britain was facing a double problem; first, the vulnerability deriving from a weak indus­trial base. And, secondly, combined with that, an excessively committed sterling position. Our predecessors shirked it - hoped it would go away by pretending it wasn\u2019t there. We faced up to it. By 1966 we had reduced the balance of payments deficit from over £800 million to £89 million. But, even so, our vulnerability because of sterling\u2019s reserve role and the vast accumulation of sterling balances drove us into a crisis.That was what our inheritance meant; four years have shown the emerging pattern of what we have done to deal with it.It is the mark of a Labour Government that we distinguish between the short-run measures, which may often have to be harsh, on monetary and fiscal management, and the more fundamental measures of industrial reconstruction which are the basic deter­minants of our economic strength.I do not need to remind this Conference that in Swansea four and a half years ago I warned about the short-term measures which would have to be taken, to enable a Britain, not yet master of its own affairs, to meet the economic storms to which we were so vulnerable. The measures of July 1966 - the only response a Government could make to the strike of capital we were facing. The fiscal measures in Budget after Budget, high interest rates, credit squeeze. The economy measures I announced last January covering every aspect of Govern­ment expenditure from defence to the social services. An incomes policy which by the very nature of things requires statutory backing.No responsible Government could have acted otherwise. No Conservative Government would have had the guts.Your Government will take full note of everything that was said in yesterday\u2019s debate. I am proud of the fact that we could have a debate like yesterday\u2019s. That this mature Labour Movement could debate issues so deep and so fundamental without for one moment losing sight of the basic comradeship that has brought all of us here. I was not surprised at any of the views expressed. When the decisions were taken by the Government which were so strongly attacked yesterday my colleagues and I knew and sensed what every delegate who spoke yesterday was feeling.None of us have changed. We were debating policies that are unpopular but which we believe to be necessary and right. If because of the views expressed yesterday we were now in midstream to abandon those policies, there is no-one here who would respect us for such a decision. To abandon now the policies that we believe to be right would be just as cowardly and in the long run as destructive of this Party as to have shirked bringing them in.All these short-term measures, distasteful as they are, had to be taken while the basic measures of industrial reconstruction were taking effect. And we had warned that those industrial measures would take time. But whatever measures we have had to take even against these overwhelming difficulties, they have been tempered by compassion.Everything we had to do was necessary while our industrial measures were being given time to work.That is what I warned this movement about in July and what I have to warn you against today. We know, and every objective commentator on British industry knows, even the Tories know, that while we need many months more of resolute economic measures, increasingly our long-run indus­trial policies will deliver dividends in exports and economic performance which, provided only we hold firm, will produce their own political dividend. What I was warning the movement about in July, and I do it again today, is any weakness or lack of resolve which will enable the Tories to garner, to reap, the fruits of the industrial reconstruc­tion we are putting through with such pain and at such cost.In presenting last year\u2019s Parliamentary Report, I summarised the progress of the Government in restructuring and modernis­ing British industry.We began our frontal attack on the prob­lems of British industry on the day we took office. The results are now beginning to come through. And they will come through in increasing measure next year and into the Seventies.It has taken time. The industrial con­troversies of 1964, 1965, even last year, have receded into the past. And, as the Tory speeches gather dust, their authors would like to forget they ever made them.There were those early gibes about the establishment of the Ministry of Technology, which was even then saving and then building up a distinctive, indigenous British computer industry, and planning the reconstruction of machine tools, ship building, micro­electronics, and the heavy electrical industry, among others.All the work of those days is bearing fruit today in export order after export order, headlined almost daily in the financial and industrial press. Before the last election, throughout the election and after the elec­tion, our opponents fought to prevent the establishment of the Industrial Reorganisa­tion Corporation. Now they praise it. They scoffed at the enquiries we set up into industry after industry - enquiries which I promised you at Brighton two years ago would be followed by action. The whole structure of the shipbuilding industry has been revolutionised on a high productivity, low cost basis, no longer losing orders but gaining them from the rest of the world.The motor industry has been reorganised with Government help and today faces the prospect of a greater security based on a spectacularly stronger export position. We are now in process of creating an electrical industry complex which will enable us to meet on equal terms the giants of Europe and even of America. The aircraft industry - it seems a long time since the aircraft employers paid their workers a day\u2019s wages and chartered trains to come and demon­strate in what some commentators were pleased to liken to the hunger marches of the past. Last week\u2019s headlines splashed the words of their own trade association - £800 million of export orders this year. The Rolls Royce American aero-engine order; the largest export order in Britain's history, and designed to be a forerunner of still larger contracts.In the atomic energy industry, the funda­mental reorganisation announced by Tony Wedgwood Benn a few weeks ago. A re­organisation designed to ensure that Britain\u2019s research lead in the civil uses of atomic energy can be matched by a corresponding success in sales of multi-million-pound nuclear reactors abroad. Here again we are creating what five years ago at Scarborough we planned to create. Great new science-based industries with public enterprise not only providing the science base but participating through a major shareholding in the industry which is being created to exploit the results of that research.The three great new import-saving aluminium smelters foreshadowed in my speech last year, now given the green light in three development areas - English, Scot­tish and Welsh. Computers - the industry the Tories were allowing to die, now under I.R.C. sponsorship a great £100-million complex. The most powerful computer com­plex outside America, now poised for an aggressive export sales campaign in the markets of the world in contrast to countries not very far away which tamely allowed their industries to submit to the American invasion.These examples I have given are part, but only part, of the far wider emerging pattern in Britain\u2019s science-based industrial revolu­tion. And all of this could have been started not in 1964 but ten years earlier if we had not then had a Government whose industrial posture was unconcern and abdication. Men who were prepared to wash their hands and see British industry decline in relation to that of almost every other advanced indus­trial country. Men who left vital industrial decisions to the haggling of the market place and the clamour of take-over bidders whose motive was not, as I.R.C. are insisting in the mergers of today, greater industrial efficiency but the exploitation of some under-valued piece of property or tax manoeuvre. Even today, four years after, they have not learned. Our conception of a powerful, streamlined modern industrial base. Their leadership - look at last week\u2019s speeches - seem incapable of raising their eyes above the level of a tooth and claw price war in a street-corner shop.I know that industrial reconstruction on such a scale causes grave anxieties amongst many here as we see new industrial giants developing in private industry. Yes, many of them as a result of deliberate Government purpose. Where industrial reconstruction leading to larger integrated units creates greater industrial efficiency based not only on size but on an associated management revolution, the Government believe that this process should be not only tolerated but actively encouraged. I emphasise the motive of efficiency and export power, in contrast to those takeovers whose motive is purely financial and bears no relation to efficiency. And particularly in contrast to those where, after a perhaps unwholesome series of financial manoeuvres, the industry concerned is left saddled with an insupportable burden of financial commitments.This is why; following the totally inadequate consultation which attended the GEC/AEI merger, I insisted in the House of Commons on a code of conduct providing for full consultation. Barbara\u2019s department took charge of this and published the new agreed code this summer - effective in the case of GEC/English Electric.So far, I have dealt with reorganisation in what are predominantly growth industries. Reorganisation means change and change is painful We are a Party of change and because of this we have always put in the forefront the measures needed to ease the effects of change on those most likely to be hurt. The Government took early action through redundancy payments, wage-related benefits, a rapid extension of industrial training facilities and in other ways, so that as industrial reorganisation gathered speed, those least able to defend themselves could be protected.Most of the industries to which I have referred, most of those where industrial restructuring is taking place, are growth industries. That restructuring, whatever the short-term painful effects, is the best means, through increasing our competitive power, of providing real security for workers in the future. Restructuring is the condition of growth, and growth is the condition of job security, not for these industries alone but for Britain. I remind this Conference of what Barbara said, dealing with these matters in her speech on Sunday at the Eve of Conference demonstration, when she said that the question was not how many would lose their jobs if mergers took place, but how many more would lose any hope of a job if we were not pressing on with the restructuring of industry.It is the industries where change is associated with contraction which create the biggest human and social problems. The railways, the coal and cotton industries and, in certain sectors, steel, are industries where rapid technological change means redundancies; where, in very many cases, there is little prospect or re-employment within the industry.The Government realise what this means both for individuals and for whole communities, many of them in remote areas. That is why in the case of coal we have provided machinery for thorough consultation at national, regional and local level. That is why the Coal Industry Act of last year makes provision on an unprecedented scale at a cost of £133 million to soften the impact of economic change. For example, for redun­dant men over 55, for whom other work is not available, it provides three years\u2019 guaranteed income equal to 90 per cent of their previous take-home pay.That is why we have insisted on expanding the facilities for training both in our rapidly extended Government Training Centre pro­gramme and in Government assisted training within industry. Government training centres alone - there are today three times as many in operation as there were five years ago when the Tories had been 12 years in office. But we still need more places, particularly for retraining those who have lost their jobs through industrial change. Last year emphasised that all we are doing in industrial training will be wasted if we cannot end the local trade union obstruction to the employment of men who have been trained in new skills.That is why, too, we have over the past year produced still more powerful incen­tives to aid regional development with new, unprecedented help for the new Special Development Areas - areas where, because of the closure of a colliery, because of remoteness from other industrial centres, an intolerable rate of unemployment results.In my speech a year ago, I referred to regional development as Britain\u2019s new frontier. It is not for me today to set out in detail all the further actions we have taken. Let me give you one fact. Special­ - discriminatory - assistance to the develop­ment areas this year, including the additional investment grant differential is running at £250 million compared with about £150 million last year, and a mere £18 million in the last year of the Tories.A streamlined, powerful, efficient, indus­trial base in Britain - that is what the British people are building with the aid of the policies I have just described. But this industrial reconstruction, while it is an essential condition for putting Britain right, cannot succeed unless our people are prepared to accept Britain\u2019s new role in the world for the later 1960s and the 1970s. This is not easy. It has not been easy for any of us to readjust to the new situation. Two years ago I told this Party that never again would Britain engage in any war, other than self-defence, except on a basis of collective security. Our whole defence policy has been based on the rejection of unilateral, go-it-­alone, do-it-yourself, military adventures, the rejection equally of Suez imperialism, and the delusion of the so-called independent deterrent.Reshaping of our defence commitments began as soon as we took office; it has been a continuing process, culminating in this year\u2019s defence accounts. As part of the comprehensive statement on Government expen­diture which I announced in January, I made clear that following the evacuation of Aden, our defence planning would be based on a withdrawal of all our forces from our principal Far Eastern bases and from the Persian Gulf, to take effect by the end of 1971. I said further that we recognise \u2018that our security lies fundamentally in Europe and must be based on the North Atlantic Alliance.\u2019I do not intend to anticipate today the debates they will be holding next week on our firm announcement to withdraw from the Far East and the Gulf. On the one hand, the official leadership is committed by speeches from Canberra to Cornwall to the proposition that we have to spend hundreds of millions maintaining a phantom military presence in the Middle East and Far East. While even the right wing Guru from Wolverhampton recognises that you cannot promise the country sweeping cuts in Government expenditure while pouring hundreds of millions into maintaining in the Far East a military establishment which is increasingly irrelevant to Britain\u2019s emerg­ing role in the modern world.Defence, then. And if even with the strengthening of the industrial base which we are achieving, we can no longer afford the role of world policeman, equally we can no longer afford the role of world banker.I have told you how the prestige policy of borrowing short and lending long has made Britain vulnerable to the shocks of world capital movements, even when our trade and industrial base was improving. Last year a crisis in the Middle East led to financial turbulence and panic withdrawals of sterling balances. The rapid improvement in our balance of payments was halted and this was a major factor in driving us to devaluation. In 13 years they were increasing not only Britain\u2019s military overstretch, but also our monetary overstretch. We have sought con­sistently for a revolutionary change in world finance. This is now beginning to show results. If there can be no defence policy for Britain except on a collective basis, still more is this true of Britain\u2019s overseas cur­rency position. We are all members one of another. The lessons for all of us in the sterling area, and, more widely for the world financial community, have been underlined by the Basle Agreement.Monetary chauvinism is as out of date for Britain as military chauvinism. Following Basle, we now have a collective international role for sterling. And we must go on from there. Our economic role in the world depends much more directly on the efforts we ourselves make to put our house in order.Your Government accepts this challenge. And again I repeat, we shall hold firmly on the course that the Government has set. We shall expect the full support of this movement in carrying this through.And we have the right to ask for this. Because, while our industrial reorganisation and our financial reorganisation have had of necessity to be a slow and painful process, there is one part of our policy, and a part very close to the hearts of the members of this movement, on which we have gone ahead of the schedule we put to the British people in 1964.The economic strength we are earning the hard way is being built up not for the purpose of statistical satisfaction, not even for economic independence; it is the necessary condition of still further social advance here; and of our aid to hungry nations over­seas. That is what socialism means. Speeches and resolutions will not earn that advance. Only work - and the painful processes of change.Last year I gave Conference the figures for each of the social services, showing the tremendous increase in the resources the Government had by that time made avail­able compared with the last full year of our Conservative predecessors.In the year since then, expansion has continued in every area of the social services. In that year - I take the latest figures - we have completed an all time record of almost 420,000 houses. In that year we have com­pleted an all time record figure of 821 primary and secondary schools and over 375,000 school places. Remember the Tory 1964 election posters \u2018-Sh! Don\u2019t tell the Labour Party the Conservatives are chalk­ing up 10 new schools a week.\u2019 Now over this past year we have been building not 10 schools a week, but practically 16. Sh! The Conservatives don\u2019t want to know.Again in that year we have invested another all time record figure of £109.7 million in hospital building, providing for a record number of modern hospital beds. In that year we have completed a record number of health centres. Three times last year\u2019s completions.In human terms again this autumn we shall have some 203,000 students starting a new term at university; 111,000 starting a new term at colleges of education and 205,000 students starting a new term to study advanced courses at colleges of further education. We are, in 1968, ahead of the Robbins\u2019 target for the number of full-time students in higher education for 1971. (Flash­back to Scarborough 1963)Again, the best available figures show that in our hospitals we had 130,000 whole-time nursing and midwifery staff, 23 per cent more than four years ago. This means, just as much as our all time record hospital building programme, better treatment, better comfort for the sick.In cash terms, the retirement pension, widow\u2019s pension, flat rate unemployment and sickness benefits, have all been raised to a new record level of £4 10s. per week for a single person and £7 6s. for a married couple. Supplementary benefits, raised in October last year, go up again next week. The extended provision for rate rebates, for families in greatest need, comes into force today. To relieve what has now become the greatest problem of poverty in the country, the problem of large families, family allow­ances next week will stand at 18 to 20 shillings per week, against 8 to 10 shillings a year ago.I know family allowances are unpopular with very many of our people. I know that payment of family allowances is subject to widespread criticism and even more wide­spread misrepresentation. But if you accept that the duty of the community is to eliminate poverty, then we cannot turn aside from this great problem of poverty in our families.This is why we have acted. Explain it. Stop apologising. Stop defending. We have a duty to the least privileged in our com­munity. We have to do what is right simply because it is right.In January, the Government\u2019s action to curb rising rates of expenditure from defence to the social services has, I know, caused great concern to every delegate here. Deeply repugnant decisions had to be taken, desirable and urgent reforms postponed. But to say that, and feel it, does not mean, in the words I hear so often, that we have cut the social services. We have not. What we have done is to restrain the rate of future increase. But this year\u2019s expenditure on the health and welfare service is planned at £38 million more than last year, over 50 per cent above the last year of the Tories. Next year it is planned to rise by a further £63 million; and it is planned to go on rising. This year\u2019s expenditure on education is running at a rate of £77 million more than last year, and next year it is planned to rise by a further £93 million, with further rises in later years. Expenditure on social security is £176 million above last year and next year it is planned to rise further.Last year I compared our total expendi­ture on the social services with our total expenditure on defence. After the January decisions, the social services will be rising and defence expenditure will be falling still more sharply than we planned a year ago. Today, for every hundred pounds we are spending on defence, we are spending £364 on the social services. Next year for every hundred pounds we are spending on defence we shall be spending £376 on the social services: This proportion will grow year by year.You have made clear, at every level in the Party, your feelings about one or another of the January measures. That is the right of every member of this Party. That is why we are a great movement. Having done that, now it is equally our duty to go out and proclaim our achievements. (Yours, too, if I may say so)For they are great achievements and they are your achievements. These figures of financial provision, of bricks and mortar, and hospital beds and school places are the munitions of the social revolution. Year by year they represent an emerging pattern of an approach to social problems and social need which is based on priorities, inevitably changing priorities.We inherited a great problem of poverty we were pledged to eradicate. We began where that poverty was then most severe, but now the priorities are changing as we are finding resources to deal with the problem I have spoken of, the problem of large families. As we move from one area of the social services to another, from flat rate to earnings-related benefits, this is to be crowned by the plan which will soon be put before the country, the completion of our comprehensive review of social security, our great plan for National Superannuation, yes, the end of the Tory swindle.Changing priorities in education. The urgent provisions we had to make for primary schools and for better teacher train­ing facilities. Education is opportunity and, year by year, we are tackling on a priority basis those problems, from slum schools to shortage of teachers which deny opportunity. But, more clearly than ever, is emerging the great guarantee of educational opportunity - the widespread adoption of comprehensive education.Changing priorities in housing over four years. Freedom from eviction, fair rents. More houses built to let. The attack on the slums. Option mortgages and 100 per cent mortgages for lower income families want­ing to own their own homes. And as we come to terms more and more with the inherited problem of the slums, growing provision for a new priority - the improve­ment of older but structurally sound houses.Our socialism is not measured in material progress only. When, before 1964, we charted the path that Britain would follow under a Labour Government, we spoke of a new concept of freedom, the broader freedom without which social democracywould be meaningless. Freedom from contempt, the enhancing of the dignity of man.This is the only answer to the violent society. We in the Labour movement oppose the importation of violence; equally we oppose the importation of authoritarianism to meet that violence. Some public figures provoke the one, and then invoke the other to deal with it.This problem of violence has become a world problem. It is associated in many countries with a swing to the right. Only the forces of reaction, it is urged, have the will and the ruthlessness to stamp out the cult of violence which their words and policies have incited.The words of the Swedish Prime Minister at our demonstration on Sunday are the answer. An answer not in words only, but backed by one of the greatest election victories in his country\u2019s history.We shall meet the appeal to reaction here in Britain as Swedish Social Democracy has met it, not by complacent assertions that it can\u2019t happen here, but by asserting our faith that social grievances require social solu­tions - by positive social action by the State. By what, the Swedes in their election called the Strong Society.We reject equally the apostles of authori­tarian violence on the one hand and negative violence on the other. Both are essentially and profoundly anti-democratic. Both seek to destroy. The Conservatives at home and abroad seek to destroy the defences we have built for the weak against those who abuse economic and social power. The nihilists in their despair seek to destroy the very fabric of organised society.We assert that the challenge of violence can be met only by a strong community responsibility to protect the individual against the insolence of economic and social power.We are the Party of human rights. The only Party of human rights that will be speaking from this platform this month. Human rights: this has been the central theme of this Government\u2019s actions from the day we took office. In my first speech as Prime Minister I got embroiled with the Tories over Smethwick. In our first inter­national statement, we issued, in the strongest terms, a warning against racial extremists in Rhodesia - a warning of what we should have to do when faced with an outbreak of racial extremism in Rhodesia - a warning on which we had to act - followed by the assertion of the six principles on which we stood and on which we stand.For the struggle against racialism is a world-wide fight. It is the dignity of man for which we are fighting. If what we assert is true for Birmingham, it is true for Bulawayo.Last May Day, I said that this moral law was equally binding whether we were talking of Birmingham, England, or Birmingham, Alabama. But this is not a moral law that is binding in respect of race alone. It is binding for all issues involving freedom and democratic institutions.If ever there were a condemnation of the values of the Party which forms Her Majesty\u2019s Opposition, it is the fact that the virus of Powellism has taken so firm a hold, at every level; that last April those who sought to disembarrass themselves of the man felt constrained to claim that they were not dissociating themselves from his doctrine but only from his phraseology. That it was all a matter of words. That was April. In September even the words didn\u2019t matter any more.Four years, then, have seen an emerging pattern. Britain\u2019s response in terms going far beyond money and materials, to the challenge of a world which is rapidly chang­ing, to the challenge presented by the fact that Britain\u2019s role in that world has changed. It is a response marked by the qualities which history will ascribe to this Government - resolution and determination in economic recovery and reconstruction, even if this has meant standing firm against deeply cherished attitudes of the past. In economic affairs and more widely the quality of resilience and a willingness to accept change, indeed what­ever the short-term costs, to harness change to our purposes. Above all the quality of compassion and concern, the concern for the material wants of those here and amongst us and throughout the Commonwealth and yet wider; and, transcending material wants, concern for the right and dignity of men as individuals.These emerging themes were based on predetermined principles. And within those principles a strategy which has meant responding to changes in the nature of the problems we have had to face. We have never been afraid to learn from our own experience, even though the lessons have, sometimes, been bitter. The Conservatives have shown, and predictably will show here again at Blackpool next week, that they have learnt nothing even from their own experi­ence; that this rapidly changing world - a world of excitement and opportunity as well as challenge - is a world they shrink to enter. Not only are they unable to appreciate the basic character of the problems that have to be solved, they have not even grasped yet what the problems are. We shall hear nothing from Blackpool next week except an attempt to solve the problems of yester­day by the methods of the day before yesterday.We here can see the emerging themes of our comprehensive attack on the problems which we have inherited. Behind the themes, the strategy for the future. There is no party political strategy. There is only the strategy for Britain.And the strategy for Britain means con­tinuing to pursue the economic policies that are necessary, regardless of popularity, what­ever the pressures, until we are paying our way and have achieved independence. At the end of the road, Britain will reap all the dividends from the industrial change which at such pain, at such cost, we are forcing through. This industrial change is the economic miracle of which independent commentators were beginning to write and speak in the spring, the commentators whom I quoted at Newtown.I warned then at Newtown that if we were to let up now, if we allowed anything our opponents did to cause us to lose our nerve, it is they, and not we, who would reap the fruits of all we have done. I said then, I repeat today, that is not going to happen. I quoted the words of Nye Bevan - words spoken from the Opposition front bench - when he said that the Tories were reaping the fruits of the trees we had planted. It has been a backbreaking job planting those trees. I intend to see they are not going to gather that fruit a second time.And this means we continue in the policies the Government have laid down. For today, as for four years, we have to face the con­flict between what is right in the long-term and what is necessary in the short-term.The short-term measures we have taken, first in defence of the pound, and now to make devaluation work; the long-term measures towards the restructuring of indus­try and the initiation of an incomes/prices policy; these measures have been devoted in the first instance to working with the system we have inherited. What we have yet to see are the results of the changes in the system which we have set in train, particu­larly those directed to broadening and modernising the industrial base on which our whole economic future depends.For three of these four years we were engaged in the battle to defend the pound. It was right to fight that battle, and for a great part of that fight our rapidly diminish­ing deficit suggested that it could be won. Had we won it, we could have restored what had not been bequeathed to us, independence and freedom of action, at less cost to the lower-paid workers and those who in the past have always paid the price of economic crisis.Every devaluation in other countries has meant a heavy price for those least able to defend themselves. This is why we never regarded it as an easy way out when siren voices were pressing it upon us as a panacea for all our problems. It has not been an easy way out. The need for stricter control of expenditure, public and private, is greater than ever. The need for a sane, planned prices and incomes policy is greater than ever. Above all the paramount need for increased productivity is greater than ever.Everything for which we have fought before devaluation we are fighting for now. Our policy is the same policy pursued with more drastic means. Devaluation was no easy way of dealing with our problems. It meant inevitable sacrifices and inequalities - sacrifices and inequalities we have fought by special measures to protect those relying on social security and to protect the larger families on lower incomes. To accept the logic of a free-for-all economy, a free-for-all in wages would mean that the lowest paid would suffer.For we came to power to put the balance right. The balance between those who suffered and those who gained in the Tory free-for-all. The balance between private and public expenditure.We have gone through a great deal together in defence of everything we stand for, against everything they are capable of throwing at us. But we have come through. And we are now on the attack again.I have set out the task of this Party, as we go forward from defence to attack. It is the job of every member of this Party to join with their Government in defending the bastions we have won from those who would seek to drive us out for their own gain. It is for every member of this Party to join us in attacking the false and empty doctrines of those who, having failed the nation, now seek to exploit the problems of change in order to get back into power to control the destinies of a nation whose problems they do not understand.How many of our members, bewildered by the barrage of misrepresentation, have even failed to defend us against the attacks of an unscrupulous Establishment? But it is not a defensive posture for which I ask. I charge you now to go over to the attack, yes, attack them on all the things we have had to do to strengthen the economy, attack them above all on the positive things we have done, which they have opposed, and which even now they are seeking to under­mine - not least the programme of social advance of these last four years, but indeed the Welfare State itself.For us clearly the emerging pattern shows us the way forward. It is still not an easy way nor shall we offer you an easy way. It is still not a time for complacency and over-confidence, but we are now setting out on the decisive year. A year in which what we all do can decide the future of this movement, the future of this country. Let us hammer out together the way forward for this crucial year. Let others divide. We have something to fight for, something that is worth all the attacks, worth all the toil, worth all the work we still have to do. The future of Britain and the future of our children. A future for which we must go out and fight, a future which fighting we shall win.

aVMadam Chairman and fellow delegates, I present to conference the Par­liamentary Report.As you know, Madam Chairman, I always believe what I read in the newspapers. Well, I mean, don\u2019t we all? Now I read that this is the last Labour conference before your Government seeks a fresh mandate. I wouldn\u2019t know - yet. It could well be.Every delegate here knows what is at stake. What is at stake for Labour. But even more, what is at stake for Britain.Now, as we look at the first five years of Labour in power, there are those who are at last beginning to see the pattern developing.I am a little bit worried that those who talked us down so much may now be going to the opposite extreme. My answer to them is that we shall show the same steadiness of nerve when they are writing up our suc­cesses as we showed when they hadn\u2019t a good word to say about us.Five years of change. Labour is chang­ing Britain, and changing it for the better. There can be no going back.Look around. Look at the changing face of Britain. Everyone here knows, because he has seen what is developing in his own area. That new hospital - just one in an all-time record hospital-building programme. Those new schools - 3,500 of them opened under Labour. Housing - nearly two mil­lion families in new homes built under Labour. The fresh look on the face of our older towns and cities. The change and the hope which Labour policies have brought to our older industrial communities.Hope in the changing North, hope in a re-born Scotland, hope and change in Wales. These are the areas which, at conference two years ago, I pledged would be the New Frontier of industrial development. You know what Labour is doing to bring work to these areas. You have seen the factories that are going up.The Conservatives have announced that if they got back to office, they would cut back on the resources we are spending on this job. We are promoting change. Theirs is a prescription to bring back decay.Look around. How much has already been done to end the vulgar distortions they so deliberately and selfishly developed. Just ten years ago this month, they were fightingan election on the gospel of materialism.In fact, if we were to hire Colman, Prentis and Varley today they could tell the same glittering story of increases by the hundred thousand, by the million, increases under the Labour Government, in the ownership of cars, washing machines, telephones, refrigerators, T.V. sets, transistors, the lot. As they could for every other industrial country. The Scandinavian countries, the Six, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, America, the rest. It has been going on continuously under Labour as under the Tories. But that was all they had to boast about.What your Government is proud of is that, at the same time, we have been cor­recting the distortions. We have been build­ing a compassionate society.Despite all the cramping, and, at times, menacing effects of the international economic crises into which this country was allowed to drift five and more years ago, we are, this year, spending on all our social services, including health, housing and education, 70 per cent more than in the last full year of the Tories.We are changing Britain for the better. We are already creating a Britain of which we can be proud. And the world knows it. The world\u2019s tourists are coming here in their millions. We have all seen them here this summer. They are coming here to buy because they get better value for money in our shops than anywhere else in Europe. But they are coming, above all, because the new Britain is exciting.Last year, nearly five million tourists came to Britain, almost half as many again as the numbers who came to look at Britain in 1964. Still more this year. It is not just the Tower of London, not just the Beef­eaters they want to see either, nor even the Kings Road. Nor only London, or even Edinburgh, or Caernarvon. It is Britain.Month after month, the Tories have been painting the picture of a Britain down in the dumps. That\u2019s how they see our country today. That\u2019s how they want to see it. But it isn\u2019t the Britain that really exists. It isn\u2019t the Britain that these hundreds of thousands of tourists have been coming here to take a look at. They have been coming here because to them Britain - yes, Britain with a Labour Government - is an exciting place. A Britain with life and vigour and achievement. With care and compassion.Many of our visitors come to look at what British industry has done, and at the people who have made it possible. Many others come to see what we are doing in the imaginative creation of new com­munities. Britain\u2019s New Town designs are a focus of admiration when architects and planners meet.Britain is exciting because of the change in the pattern and quality of life. Especially for the young ones everywhere. A lot of us were at the Durham Gala this year. Look at the kids who were there. Keen, lively. And we have got kids like them everywhere in this country of ours.It is not only that they face much brighter prospects - educational opportunity, greater freedom, a much wider range of prospects in their work, a much wider variety of things to spend their money on. Of course, all this is true. It is the way they reflect all these things in how they look, how they dress, their sense of fun and enjoyment.Youth is joining in creating a new society. Youth is involved in these changes. And they have a sense of involvement. Labour is recognising this, by giving them rights and responsibilities which young people have never had before. This liveliness bears no relation to the dispirited society of Tory mythology. We are people who are getting things done.No, we didn\u2019t have the billions to get to the moon. But we\u2019re winning quite a lot of golds these days down here. I don\u2019t just mean sport - though I remember the Tory laments in the years after the war, that we were not winning the medals and the cups because athletes in a socialist Britain must by definition be undernourished and starving. Even our horses, so the legend went.Our technological progress in both public or private industry gets a great deal more recognition and respect abroad than it gets in the jaundiced columns of the Tory press. It has not just happened. It is the result of the Government\u2019s industrial policy over the past five years, a policy which is now delivering the goods.Productivity in Britain\u2019s coal industry increased more than 9 per cent last year, now ahead of the European Community. In nuclear energy - our prototype fast reactor now going ahead at Dounreay is 3 or 4 years ahead of anything else in operation or planned in any part of the Western world, including America. A science based industry and it\u2019s in a development area.So are the aluminium smelters now being built by private industry with Government encouragement; in three development areas, Northumberland, Invergordon, Anglesey. Yet, the Leader of the Opposition the other day was reported as criticising these ventures, despite the work they create, despite the imports they will save. Sour comment, but what about the other success stories?We lead the world in vertical and short take-off aircraft. The Rolls-Royce engine, RB211, which won from America the biggest order in the history of British aviation. And more to come. A triumph of private enter­prise, but a triumph for imaginative Govern­ment action in providing the decisive launch­ing aid.The hovercraft, fostered by Labour\u2019s National Research Development Corpora­tion and by the Ministry of Technology. Unrivalled in the export markets of the world.The Cephalosporin antibiotic used to save lives where penicillin and other established drugs failed to cure; Cephalosporin, now earning millions of dollars a year from its American royalties alone, and making a profit for the British taxpayer.Then there is spray steel making; satellite communications stations; pulse code modulation; Dracone barges; the new aviation navigational aids; the ammonia steam-naphtha process; the electron-probe analyser and the rest.And still newer developments. Carbon fibres, already in use in aviation but likely to transform a growing part of the world\u2019s industries. The biggest development in world raw materials since the discovery of man­made fibres and special steels. This is a new British achievement, a product of work in a Government research establishment developed by public enterprise under Labour Government legislation in Collaboration with industry. And American private enterprise is falling over itself to buy the right to use this product of British public enterprise.Some of these developments, such as the creation of the most powerful computer industry in the world outside American ownership, depend directly on Government assistance through the I.R C., against which the Tories fought, before, during and after the last election. Or aid through the Indust­rial Expansion Act which raised them to a new pitch of frenzy eighteen months ago. The Leader of the Opposition has now solemnly pledged his Party, if he ever got the chance, to end both.Can you recognise this Britain of achieve­ment in the welter of propaganda the Tories are pouring out to denigrate the work of their fellow citizens? This sort of Tory propaganda tries to make Britain out to be as dingy as those who peddle the propaganda.With the generosity which inspires all my comments on the Opposition Party, I said not long ago that I acquitted them, at any rate, of any charge of patriotism so far as the economic welfare of our nation is con­cerned. When the economic indices in any month give comfort to Britain\u2019s critics and enemies abroad, you can see all their top people - looking like Victorian undertakers  welcoming a wet winter and the promise of a full churchyard.No-one here is going to get over-excited about the trade figures of one single month. But I\u2019ll say this to you. There is reason for pride in the fact that in the first eight months of this year, our exports are up by 9 per cent over the first eight months of last year, by volume,. And 30 per cent above the exports for the same months of 1964 - again by volume. And the orders for next year\u2019s shipments are rising sharply.There was that remarkable statement in The Economist newspaper only a few days ago. They confessed that a few weeks earlier they had been expressing deep fears about Britain\u2019s economic situation. Now they say, and I quote their words: \u2018In these past few summer months of 1969, Britain has been running one of the strongest balances of payments among the major powers of the world; indeed, on the face of the latest figures, the second strongest behind only Germany.\u2019I welcome the editor\u2019s apology, though I think he is pitching it a bit high now. I am not sure I like these gentlemen claiming economic miraclesWe all recall how Her Majesty\u2019s Opposition were dining out on the prospects of our failing to get the balance of payments into surplus. The champagne corks popping. Now, as Britain moves from long years of deficit into surplus, their champagne is turning into gripe-water. Earlier this month came the Treasury figures for the second quarter of this year, showing a balance of payments surplus of £190 millions, that is seasonally corrected, £100 millions.Britain\u2019s friends applauded these figures. But not the Leader of the Conservative Party. This is what he said. Sourly he dismissed Britain\u2019s achievement. I quote: \u2018The second quarter is always a good quarter... If we are to keep the thing in perspective, we have to recognise that this comes at the end of five years of Labour Government.\u2019Well of course he has got a point. The second quarter of the year is usually - he said always - seasonally favourable. He has got another point. We have been in office nearly five years. So let us see what the balance of payments surplus was in the seasonally favourable second quarter of 1964, when the Rt. Hon. Gentleman himself was in charge of the nation\u2019s overseas trade. Remember our surplus in 1969 was £190 millions \u2013 that\u2019s plus. What was their sur­plus? There was no surplus. Their achievement was a deficit of £184 millions - a minus. Their achievement after nearly thirteen years was to produce a quarter\u2019s results £374 millions worse than what we have just published after less than five years. And in the second quarter. \u2018The second quarter is always a good quarter.\u2019Not when he was in charge.I\u2019ve often tried to understand the way their minds work. I think it\u2019s this. It is really a psychiatric problem caused by deprivation from the office to which they thought providence had called them at birth - or even before. This has so warped their vision that a Tory deficit of £184 millions was a sign of unparalleled economic strength and virility, while a Labour surplus of £190 millions is the result of an impoverished and debilitated nation, crippled, paralysed, shackled by bureaucratic controls, bled white by taxation.I believe they are getting rather worried about the image they will be presenting in this hall next weak. I have given some thought to their problem. What I think they should do is get a new flag, like their co-belligerent Ian Smith. I have gone to the trouble of working out a motto for them - Bonum patriae Conservatoribus pessimum, which being translated, broadly indicates that what is good for the country is bad for the Tories.But I don\u2019t give up hope for them. They are very well bred. I read a few weeks ago that there were more Etonians on the Tory front bench now than even in the Macmillan and Douglas-Home Cabinets. So perhaps they will respond to my appeal to them to keep all their sour gripes for the home market, and not use them for export.We are getting used to this talking down of Britain when they go abroad.He was at it again a few days ago. The Conservative Central Office disseminated an article he had written in the American journal Foreign Affairs, in which he affected to claim that Britain was less able to com­pete in the European Economic Community than in 1962. Fortunately, the American audience he was addressing can form their own opinion on the facts. It is a pity he did not study that moving ballad of John, Greenleaf Whittier, \u2018Bar­bara Frietchie\u2019 \u2013\u2018Shoot, if you must, this old grey head. But spare your country\u2019s flag, she said.\u2019I will make them this offer and they can consider it next week. If they stop telling lies about us, we will stop telling the truth about them.But for modern Tories, lack of economic patriotism is not enough. There must also be a total lack of responsibility in the formulation of their so-called policies.This has taken the form of a rake\u2019s progress of mounting expenditure commit­ments, combined with mouth-watering pledges to reduce taxation. Their Party spokesmen, from the Leader of the Op­position sideways, have committed them­selves to an East of Suez presence. The cost of this has been authoritatively estimated at between £250m and £300m a year. What with a fifth Polaris submarine, and other commitments, they are committed to increased expenditure on defence on a scale of over £300m a year.And all this before they get a chance to let Julian Amery loose on another flock of costly prestige aircraft. Denis Healey has already saved the country £2,000m as against the programme we inherited. But there are Tory expenditure commitments outside, in addition to the defence field.Their own Daily Telegraph, a fortnight ago said, \u2018The Conservative promises to spend are legion.\u2019 Shadow after Shadow pops up, to promise £20m here, £50m there, £100m somewhere else. Shadow beneficiaries, like the promises, are legion. Hardly a single deserving or undeserving section of the community is omitted, provided there is a prospective pay-off in votes.Some of these are specific pledges, naming the amount, the concessions. Some are vague promises, as Tory leaders take to the road dispensing to each area they visit Shadow largesse froth their inexhaustible pork barrel.The Telegraph\u2019s independent costing? I quote: \u2018The party has not put any figure on its total of promises, but it is hard to see them costing less than £1,000m a year.\u2019That grim looking family in the Tory posters would really be paying too much tax.Irresponsibility. Opportunism. Take their latest manoeuvring on the Common Market.I grant him this, no-one has been over a long period a more passionate believer in Britain joining the Common Market. But now you get the same \u2018on the one hand this and on the other hand that\u2019; the same desire to wound without being caught out striking that we have had on race, on hanging, on Rhodesia. It is, of course, no accident that Mr. Powell, a few weeks ago, announced the Tory Party\u2019s Common Mar­ket policy as his Target for 1969.But, for a vintage performance of transparent opportunism, let me take you to Sheffield last Wednesday. The aim was to create the maximum confusion by saying that a further application to join the Com­mon Market, without certain things being done, would be folly.So he set up a whole series of phoney Aunt Sallys and then proceeded to get knocked down by them.The first Aunt Sally he tangles with is his great new discovery that before entry Britain would have to be sure that all of the six present Common Market members wanted us. A brilliant perception. We can\u2019t get in unless they do want us - all of them. The Rome Treaty lays it down. That is what his 1963 veto was about.Aunt Sally No. 2. He says there must be no commitment to a federal organisation in Europe. I am gratified. Every time I have said this the Tories have attacked me.Aunt Sally No. 3. At Sheffield he attacked us in terms for our 1967 application. While he is fully in favour of going in, he was reported as saying that a great deal of damage was done to Britain\u2019s case by our application in 1967.But does he think this decision was wrong? Did he think it then? Hansard, 9th May, 1967, Col. 1300 \u2013 \u2018We welcome the application which the Government are making and we wish them every success.\u2019 Indeed even earlier on 5th November, 1966, he made a speech at Harrogate. I quote the report which said that he called on the Government for a firm declaration of intent to join the European Economic Community\u2026\u2018Let it be declared,\u2019 he said, \u2018that Britain wished to become a full wholehearted member\u2019 and he spelled out his demand for a declaration on every obligation that will be involved.He went on: \u2018Time is not on our side. Now is the moment for decision.\u2019Now nearly three years and one Powell speech later apparently it was the wrong decision.Aunt Sally No. 4. Now, as a delaying move - I quote again \u2013 \u2018The British people should be given every scrap of information available.\u2019 He boasted of how much information they gave. Really?I remember the storm in the House of Commons when, behind closed doors in Brussels, he stated Britain\u2019s entire negotiat­ing terms to the European Council of Ministers. He refused to inform the British Parliament or the British people what he had committed us all to. It was only after a leak in Western Europe seven weeks later, which was published in Britain, that they had to publish a White Paper.When Labour\u2019s Foreign Secretary stated our position and all the major issues involved at a meeting of W.E.U. on 4 July, 1967, he spoke at 4 p.m. and the White Paper was laid before the House an hour later.\u2018All the information?\u2019 All we got from him were those monthly recitals giving the latest state of play on the higher groceries.We have always insisted that before any decision can be taken, Parliament and the people have to be given the facts. That is our position today. And now the very full information we gave in 1967 has to be brought up to date.Weeks ago, I sent an instruction that new calculations should be undertaken of the estimates and assessments made two and a half years ago.Agriculture and the cost to Britain\u2019s balance of payments, on various possible assumptions about developments in agricul­tural prices.Capital movements. The estimate of the balance of advantage or disadvantage of capital movements, where a great deal has changed since 1967.The trade balance. Since 1967 British exports to the Six have increased by 41 per cent by value. What new assessments can be made on likely trends in both exports and imports?These estimates are being prepared by the combined action of all the Departments concerned. When they are ready, they will be made available to Parliament, for public discussion and debate.When we announced our Common Market policy in 1967 we said that, in or out of Europe, Britain had to be strong. If we failed to build up our economic strength, then, in Europe, we should not be able to face the competition. If we failed to build up our economic strength, then, outside Europe, we should become a backwater. So we gave first priority to building up our economic strength.And, in what we have done, our security and our independence lie. Whatever the outcome of negotiations about entry. Our application remains. Our statement of 4 July, 1967, remains, subject to changes made necessary by the passage of events. Our position is clear.The Six have many problems, not least the present state of European agriculture. If they, the Six, are ready for negotiations to begin, we are ready. If, in these negotiations, we achieve terms satisfactory for Britain, on the lines we have outlined, then negotiations will succeed.But, unlike the situation in 1961, we no longer face the challenge of Europe cap-­in-hand. Europe needs us just as much, and many would say more, than we need Europe.It is the common interest of all of us to achieve economic unity. But, if this cannot be achieved, we can stand on our own feet. At a heavy price for Britain, no doubt, but at a heavier price for Europe, and at a devastating price for Europe\u2019s influence in the world.This Conference starts from the achieve­ments of the first five years of your Labour Government. It is our job over this next year to make sure that everyone in this country recognises and gives credit for these achievements. We all know it can be done.But, I must warn you, now is the time for confidence but not complacency. The 1945 Government perished because by 1950 powerful voices, both inside and outside the Party, were urging that all we had to do was to consolidate what had been achieved. They said the main job had been done. But our job is only beginning.This Government\u2019s programme of urgent and forward-looking legislation is enough to keep Parliament busy for the first two or three years of the next Parliament.The legislation, all the work of the Labour Government, after the next election will continue to reflect changing priorities. In the last five years most of our energy has had to go into dealing with the balance of payments problem, and into the reorganisation and modernisation of industry.But for us as socialists, technological achievements and the balance of payments surplus are not ends in themselves but only means. Means to those ends which we are in politics to achieve, human dignity and social justice.The priorities of the past five years have been dictated by the over-riding economic situation and by the beginning of our attack on poverty and the major social problems. But as socialists we must con­tinuously change our priorities. Change the priorities because as we change society, as we advance, the problems of society are changing. And as we advance, the stan­dards we set ourselves also advance.In opposition we equipped ourselves to deal with the problems neglected by the Tories and based our priorities on them. Some may even have thought that that was the only job we needed to do. But exper­ience of government has emphasised new needs and therefore new priorities.This is why Labour Government always has work to do. This is why Labour Government can never run out of steam.In the years ahead we have still got to make economic strength and a balance of payments surplus an urgent priority. This is why we are not going to imperil the hard fought ground we have won in the battle for economic solvency and economic independence.Without this strengthening base we shall, not able to sustain that rate of growth of the economy which makes it possible for us to meet in full the growing priority needs of our society, including full employ­ment.Without this strengthening base we can­not contribute, as we should, to the needs of the developing countries who constitute half of mankind.A few months ago we had a great Commonwealth Conference in London. Twenty-eight countries - most of them not long ago subject dependencies of an empire, now all of them independent, eight of them having achieved that independence since 1964. A great deal of the time of that con­ference was devoted to economic affairs, the living standards of the one quarter of the world\u2019s population which between us we represented.For them, and for others, the problem is not whether the rate of growth of the British economy is going to mean that we can treble or quadruple our own standard of living per head by the end of the century. What half of mankind is concerned about is whether they can avoid, and whether we can help them avoid, a cut in their own miserably inadequate standard of living.That is why we need strength at home, and as we achieve it we shall be increasingly concerned with the broader perspectives of industrial change. We shall be increasingly concerned with investment in human beings as well as investment in technology.More and more we have to concentrate at every level in Government and industry on the basic problems which undermine industrial relations. Problems, not of Britain only or mainly, but problems that are now being faced by Germany, France, Italy, the United States.More and more we have got to ensure that those who give their skill to industry are enabled to contribute more to the de­cisions of industry. More and more we have to find means of making a reality of in­volvement and participation by workers in industry - making a reality of the National Executive Committee document on Industrial Democracy which the N.E.C. pre­pared under the chairmanship of Jack Jones and which was approved by confer­ence last year.Unless we do that, any industrial policy would simply make eleven million indus­trial workers slaves of a process, slaves of a machine. We intend the process and the machine to be the means to a fuller life for them. Fuller, not only in terms of the reward of their labour. Fuller, not only in terms of the increased social wage which a more efficient economic machine will make increasingly possible. But fuller too, in other aspects of the quality of life. In more leisure and in fuller facilities for the enjoyment of leisure.Madam Chairman, looking back over this past decade it is clear that the 1960\u2019s have been a period of immense change and economic crisis for Britain. The politics of the 60\u2019s have inevitably been heavily centred on the problems of economic man­agement. The decade that lies ahead will not be free of economic difficulty. But it is already clear that other problems are moving to the centre of the political stage.First, our environment. There is a two-fold task: to remove the scars of 19th century capitalism - the derelict mills, the spoil heaps, the back-to-back houses that still disfigure so large a part of our land. At the same time we have to make sure that the second industrial revolution through which we are now passing does not be­queath a similar legacy to future genera­tions. We must deal with the problems of pollution - of the air, of the sea, of our rivers and beaches. We must also deal with the uniquely 20th century problems of noise and congestion which will increasingly dis­turb, unless checked, our urban life.First among the priorities of the 70\u2019s is to get rid of the scandal of bad housing and no-housing. That is why all of us here are on the same side as Shelter, indeed we were there first.I am not going to get into an arid and cold argument about how you define homelessness. The problem is those without homes; the problem is those living in slums; and it is the same problem of human misery.Shelter themselves acknowledged how much has been done by this Labour Government. In a few weeks time, in a little over five years, your Labour Government will have built two million homes. This is a record contribution in re-housing the homeless and the ill-housed. Homes for two million families, in just over five years.In the last four years, 340,000 slums have been cleared in Great Britain, we are proud of this record but everyone here is deter­mined to do a great deal more.More to stop 4½ million older houses from becoming the slums of the 70\u2019s. This is the task which our Housing Act of this year - a greatly underestimated piece of legislation - was specifically designed to tackle. An advance in housing standards the Tories were too mean to aspire to.So, on this vital problem of giving all our people decent homes we welcome the job that so many organisations are doing. We welcome, too, the urgent and passionate pressure which organisations like Shelter can bring to this. When it comes down to it, aren\u2019t your ideals the same as theirs?And, when it comes down to it, can their ideals ever be achieved by the Party of ­the Rent Act, the landlords, the Party which let Rachmanism flourish? By the Party which is pledged in national and local terms to cut back on the people\u2019s housing? This should be a target for Shelter. By demo­cratic means. Fighting them city by city and town by town when, in their insensate and insensitive economies, the local councils they control are cutting back in the programme needed to relieve overcrowding and to re­move slums. That is why every fighter against homelessness should be in the attack. But, let every one of them realise that if this problem is going to be solved only a Labour Government can solve it.Time and a Labour Government are needed - needed to deal with problems that have been piling up over decades, and the new problems that a socialist Britain de­mands must be solved.I said earlier, look around you at the new schools going up. But we have to look around, too, at the slum schools in our big towns and cities. And in the country­side where the children have an equal right to modern surroundings. Because, even with a record school building pro­gramme, we have had to concentrate our resources first in the new housing estates and the new overspill areas where there were no schools at all. And the downtown slum schools have remained. Slum schools can no more be tolerated by any socialist than slum houses. We have already in the past two years made a start on nursery schools. To get the priorities right for nursery schools, primary education, slum schools, time - and a Labour Government - are needed.Look too, at the new hospitals that have been built. But look around too, at the urgent need to replace those Victorian buildings. Bastilles in which too many of our sick, including the mentally sick, have to be treated. In the past few months scandals have come to light in the treatment and care of the mentally handicapped, including the very special problem of mentally handi­capped children. Scandals which must not diminish the admiration we all feel for the dedicated care which so many of our health service workers have shown and are show­ing, almost without recognition. Dick Crossman had the courage to insist that these problems should not be swept back under the carpet. This is another area of community concern which had never come into the centre of the stage because other and apparently more pressing problems crowded it out.It calls for a new priority within the health service and already the Government have recognised this. This is a problem that will be with us in the next Parliament and beyond. How we deal with this is the test of a decent society. Time and a Labour Government are needed.There are other social problems which are not problems of bricks and mortar at all. Festering social problems that plague, not only Britain, but every advanced urban community.As socialists, we have equally deep concern about these. And, because we have always asserted that social grievances require social solutions, we have the right to be listened to.Labour\u2019s promotion of community rela­tions and the eradication of social disease spots is making human rights a reality in England, Scotland and Wales - and North­ern Ireland. We reject those who exploit social grievances for political and racial purposes. That is why I today again condemn the trend to Powellist thinking and Powellist policies.There are, of course, no headlines in the patient, dedicated social work which is going on to ease the urgent social problems of our great cities and towns, still less the unsung success of those who are patiently working to bring about integrated social communities. But there are headlines in the contorted hatreds of the dedicated racialist. There are those here and abroad who seek the answer to these problems by the oppressive use of authority. Labour\u2019s answer is that authority must be used to assert human rights. Madam Chairman, we are building in Britain not an authoritarian society, nor a negatively permissive society, but a strong, tolerant and compassionate society.That is why we are concerned not only with the physical environment in which our people live and work but the moral and political environment that determines still more the health and happiness of us all.This is our faith. This is our vision. But faith and vision backed by a policy of socialist priorities.Next week in this hall they will see a gathering to which not only policies, but faith and vision, are strangers. We go forward from today into the year ahead, into the 70\u2019s. We have the faith. We have the vision. We have the means to make that faith, that vision, a reality. We cannot fail.

aVLast year this Conference met in the spirit of pride and confidence. Pride in five years\u2019 achievements in transforming our society. Confidence in the more rapid advance which lay before us once crippling economic deficit had given place to economic strength. This year our task is to resist those who seek to halt and to reverse those achievements, who seek to turn back.18 June should not be seen simply in terms of a rejection of one set of men, of one Party, of the replacement of one Government by another. It was the rejection of a system of society based on a set of values of which our people are proud, but which our opponents discounted as they preached their philosophy of greed. All that is yours, they said, all that you dream of achieving will still be yours, but you won\u2019t have to pay for it. The taxes on what you earn will be cut. There will no longer be a problem of rising prices. Their cynical conclusion was that enough of the electorate would be prepared to place at risk all the Labour Government have achieved for the better and fairer education of our children, for dignity and civilised standards in old age or sickness; all we have done to help the casualties of modern industrial society, to create a fairer and more equal society, in return for the lure held out by the Tories, the lure of increased spending power.Their cynicism was vindicated not so much by those who voted but by those who did not trouble to vote.Now our task, above all others, in the months ahead is to overcome that cynicism by making clear the values in which we believe, by convincing our people that only by our Socialist policies can those ideals be achieved.It means exposing the emptiness of those Tory promises as time reveals that emptiness; it means a determined fight for our principles as others proclaim the doctrines of selfishness and sectional advantage.It means fighting to preserve the concept of the national community, caring for all, and willing to share, against those who have reck­lessly embarked on a course of dividing our people, of promoting conflict and exalting personal advantage.How we are to do that must be, the keynote of this Conference, the task of this Movement, starting now.First we must expose what has happened in the three months since the General Election. Contrary to the promises they held out of immediate action to change the direction of our Government and our society, we have had - as even the Conservative press are beginning to bear witness - a period in which Government, action, decision, have been at a discount.This is not to say that in the first heady days no decisions were taken. There was, indeed, that short burst of \u2018instant\u2019 ideological arrogance. Three decisions within three days before the Cabinet had even met.Sir Alec Foster-Dulles searching for Com­munists on the Indian Ocean bed and concluding that the threat must be met by shipping arms to Apartheid South Africa. The Governess of the Board of Education reversing the trend of a generation of educational thought and advance by giving encouragement and fresh hope to reactionary Tory education authorities in their fight to maintain the 11-plus. The decision to put council houses on the market and diminish the stock of immediately-needed accommodation for the overcrowded and the unhoused.And very soon thereafter the decision to abolish the Land Commission: values created by the community no longer to accrue to the community: values created by the community were now to enrich the speculative developer.Instant decision when it was a question of pandering to Tory prejudice.Indecision, procrastination when problems had to be faced up to.That was why after that first week they pulled the blankets over their heads and hoped the problems would go away. The only recorded case in zoology of hibernation in the summer.This from a Government whose Leader's final clarion election call was: \u2018Britain is in danger of falling asleep.\u2019From a Leader who two days before polling day outlined a policy to be \u2018pursued immed­iately.\u2019 Immediately. An instant economic policy to be carried out at one stroke.Now, a hundred days on, even the Tory press has had to admit what everyone else knows, and most people are saying, that Britain has no government. There\u2019s been nothing like it since the Hans Andersen story when the populace turned out to see the whole imperial establishment parade through the streets - only this time it is the clothes that have no Emperor.Though no words of mine could rival the for-once attributable briefing by a Downing Street spokesman recorded in the Financial Times a few weeks ago: \u2018The Government is in the back seat but it is watching the driving mirror to see what others are doing.\u2019By mid-August Conservative papers were appealing for reassurance that a government existed. Even the Daily Sketch ran a panic headline: \u2018Reassure us, Ted.\u2019And even now, he hasn\u2019t. For what they have discovered is that the mess they are in is the promises they made, promises they cannot keep, promises they knew they wouldnot be able to keep when they made them.It is right that what they then promised must be set on the record. Kept on the record, for now we face a massive nation-wide brain­washing operation aimed at persuading you that what you heard them say is not what they now want you to think they said.They were going to act. The emphasis in that last pre-election week was on immediate action, at a stroke to reduce the rise in prices, increase production and reduce unemploy­ment. They are his words. It\u2019s in the book.A Better Tomorrow. On TV last week he was asked by Mr. Burnett after three months, \u2018When is tomorrow?\u2019 \u2018Well,\u2019 he said, \u2018we are working towards it all the time.\u2019 We are working towards tomorrow all the time. Watchman, what of the night -and how long will it be?That wasn\u2019t the pre-election mood.Sir Alec Douglas-Home, I quote: \u2018In the first month of a new Conservative Government, taxation will be reduced. That would do more than anything to release energies.\u2019 He can be dismissed from the case. Economics were never his strong suit.But what of his Leader, the present Prime Minister? Last week was not his first interview with Mr. Burnett. Before the election Mr. Heath gave a firm pledge to him - to the electorate - that they would abolish S.E.T. and they would cut direct taxation in the first budget. Now, apparently, no budget till April: no sense of urgency, still less emergency there. That\u2019s not what they said in that last week of the election. Already immediate action ruled out.But now they are hedging even about their budget policy when finally they are forced to introduce one. S.E.T. not to be abolished. Reduced maybe - but not yet. Mr. Robert Carr was put up last month to say that the present Government unfortunately could not \u2018make progress with expansion and the reduc­tion of taxation to which the Government is pledged, till we have got this present cost inflation spiral under control.\u2019 Mr. Barber was reported as confirming this. But what his Leader said on 16 June was that cutting taxes, and especially S.E.T., was the immediate way to \u2018break into the price/wage spiral by acting directly on prices and costs,\u2019 to give us a \u2018breathing-space\u2019 while long-term policies were being worked out.I am not in fact today going to embark on a considered attack on the Conservative Govern­ment\u2019s economic policy, because I don\u2019t know what it is - any more than they do.A government whose leader pledged himself in the Manifesto to deal \u2018honestly and openly with the House of Commons, with the Press and with the public\u2019 relies not on open straight talk, but on closed, anonymous hints behind cupped hands.Mr. Heath and Mr. Barber will not deny that the message they are putting out on taxes is this:No immediate action. No abolition of S.E.T. in the first budget;In fact no decreases in taxation until they\u2019ve made those sweeping cuts in public expenditure, the mighty promise of which always set those Tory audiences ablaze;Cuts in expenditure or not, they can\u2019t cut taxes until they\u2019ve broken the wage-spiral.The whole public discussion of Tory economic strategy has now been reduced to a plaintive barnyard soliloquy by the unfortunate Secretary of State for Employment and Productivity about which came first, the hen or the egg. And the price of both is going up under the Tories.But they are not even pretending now that they have a policy for prices, at any rate for stopping them rising. True, the repeated assertion that they had is precisely what won the election. Morning, noon and night. I recall that moving appeal the Conservative Leader made to the housewives of Leicester. Someone had given him a shopping list. Bread, how dear that was. And, oh dear, it\u2019s going up again. Milk - what price does he now think that will be when the better tomorrow dawns? He revealed the most intimate secrets of his larder, jam, sausages, the lot. He wept that the housewives were telling him that they had to go for the cheaper cuts of meat, buying standard eggs instead of large ones.Oh yes, and he mourned that the dinner money at school takes more out of her purse. Strangely I haven\u2019t yet read that school meals have become cheaper under the Tories. But let me put this question to Mr. Heath. (Cap\u2019n, art thou sleeping there below?). Since I know he would not wish his speech to the Leicester housewives to be dismissed as vulgarian vote-getting, will he just reassure them now by giving a pledge, for what that is now worth, that the review of public expenditure they have announced will not involve an increase in the price of school meals?But it was not only in Leicester. To make assurance doubly sure, there was his firm pledge of immediate action on all prices, private sector and public sector, issued with a blaze of publicity, by coincidence just two days before polling-day. In view of the organised attempt to bury this effusion - well, it is being said, after all, Mr. Heath didn\u2019t actually write it, it was written for him - I feel it right that so superb a passage of English prose should not be allowed incontinently to be swept into oblivion. In other words I\u2019m going to read it.But there is a very real alternative which ought to be pursued immediately. That alternative is to break into the price/wage spiral by acting directly to reduce prices. This can be done by reducing those taxes which bear directly on prices and costs such as the Selective Employment Tax, and by taking a fain grip on public sector prices and charges, such as coal, steel, gas, electricity charges and postal charges. This would at a stroke, reduce the rise in prices, increase production and reduce unemployment. It would have an immediate effect on moderating the wage/price spiral which would far outweight any effects of a higher pressure in demand for labour.\u2018Immediate,\u2019 \u2018at a stroke.\u2019 He went on: \u2018In this way we can obtain a breathing space which must be well used to put our industrial relations on a sound footing \u2026 to cut direct taxation and to encourage savings\u2026\u2019 And so forth.In other words, this was to be done at once.And in case any one had missed the point he concluded with the choice which in his view the country was facing: whether to continue with a Labour Government, or (I quote) \u2018Whether it would prefer immediate and determined action to avert such a crisis.\u2019 Well, we haven't had it. The crisis. Or the action.One action he was going to take was to hold prices down artificially in the public sector. We warned him at the time that that would mean Treasury subsidies, and they would mean not lower taxes but very much higher taxes. The Treasury soon told him.So we had a short period in which Ministers fell over themselves to raise charges in the public sector, even when it wasn\u2019t necessary. One was in the field of public transport. In the election, of course, we had had his doleful forecast, in due course, if Labour were returned, of a minimum fare of a shilling for short journeys on bus or tube. A shilling minimum. It may be a surprise to him, but this took effect on 16th August, just two months after he came into office: the shilling minimum fare was imposed. By the Tory Greater London Council.Labour had refused to approve it and sent it for impartial enquiry by the Prices and Incomes Board.The Tory Government, in an unaccustomed fit of exertion, approved it.For good measure, when it came to half-price fares, the Conservative Government further approved a new break-through in the higher Conservative duodecimal mathematics, based on the inflationary principle that half of one shilling is sevenpence.But the Tories said, public sector prices would be scrutinised with vigilance. Not though, to protect the consumer.When Mr. Heath saw Mr. Victor Feather we got the real threat: publicly-owned industries would be starved of finance, and subject to rigid price control, not to protect the consumer but as a sanction to enforce a wage policy selectively directed against public employees.Before Parliament adjourned they told us of their Policy for the private sector. There was to be no further use of the Prices and Incomes Board to deal with excessive price demands; the early warning system for price increases was to go.Then we got this pearl from Mr. Robert Carr: \u2018We believe that where there is competition that is the most effective means of safe­guarding the consumer, and the less it is interfered with the better.\u2019So you must thank all the gods of competi­tion, and Mr. Carr, their earthly spokesman, for the safeguards you are privileged to enjoy against price rises by private enterprise which led first the oil companies, then the tobacco industry, the bakers, the cement industry, to put up their prices.But you should be so lucky. The safe­guards didn\u2019t stop there. A fortnight ago the country was electrified by an announcement that the early warning system, and the agreed system of price-control for the brewing industry, were to be abrogated. This was announced by Farmer Prior who, although he can claim a higher degree of sophistication per live-hundredweight than most of his colleagues, decided that he could not improve on the words of Mr. Carr. \u2018Where there is competition that is the .most effective means of safeguarding the consumer, and the less it is interfered with the better.\u2019I cannot tell you how thirsty dockers in my constituency, tears dropping into their tankards, blessed the name of Prior: nor of their mortification the next day when they read in their Daily Telegraph the headline: \u20184d.-a-pint beer rise forecast,\u2019 for in beer as in bread, the mills of competition grind slowly. But they were happy to read in the City page of their Daily Mail the following Tuesday, with what joy the news had been received in the brewery-shares section of the Stock Exchange.For even this period of inert government has enabled me to acquit the Conservatives of a charge I have sometimes heard, that they lack care and compassion. I was reluctant to believe this because we had that election broadcast of theirs, when Mr. Chataway said: \u2018I care - and Ted cares too.\u2019They lost no time in showing that care when approached by the bankrupt brewers. Indeed I must in fairness to them, record another case, the deep concern shown by the Minister of Housing and Local Government when he overruled the report, made by the inspector after a public inquiry, and decided a planning case on behalf of a major brewery company not 20 miles from here.Not content with falling over themselves to allow private enterprise to raise its prices, the next step was to encourage them to do it.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, whose appointment is the only thing Mr. Heath has ever done to suggest that he has a sense of humour, will not be disposed to dispute the source of the message which one paper after another simultaneously felt moved to announce a fortnight ago.The headline in the Guardian: \u2018Tories to let prices go free.\u2019 In the Daily Telegraph: \u2018Price rises to rebuild working capital in order.\u2019 \u2018Companies may raise prices with tacit Gov­ernment blessing.\u2019The Times: \u2018The shortage of company liquidity is acknowledged; and it is argued that the solution lies in raising prices where this is necessary for maintaining profits, investments and working capital.\u2019\u2018The solution lies in raising prices.\u2019Three months to the day after that dramatic promise of immediate and direct action to break the price/wage spiral, the Government had decided that they had so little to offer their industrial friends in fulfilment of their promises to reduce taxation on industry - on top of all the other pledges to reduce taxation - that their only solution to deal with the prob­lem of the squeeze on liquidity, the problem of cash flow in industry, was to encourage industrialists to get on with it, to put up prices and get more money for them­selves.So now we know. A Government elected precisely because of its pledges to tackle rising prices insists now that in private enterprise prices are not high enough.A Government elected after accusing its Labour predecessor of planning to hold down wages, has embarked now on deliberate action to hold wages down, starting with the weakest and lowest paid. And this at a time of free-for-all in prices.The Government\u2019s strategy has now emerged.It is a strategy first of distraction. To dis­tract the country from the Government\u2019s failure by putting all the blame for their econ­omic difficulties, not on their own irresponsible election promises, but on the trade unions and their members. And in shifting the blame, to use the whole power of Government in enforc­ing a policy of selective interference with wages, to the point where the costly and bitter disputes they were elected to avoid are not only to be allowed to happen, but actively provoked.It is a strategy, second, of ostentatious in­difference to the modernisation of industry, and the needs of the development areas, by discard­ing priority industrial and regional projects.It is a strategy, third, of re-shaping public expenditure on principles which pre-date the welfare state, and by methods which must inevitably destroy the welfare state as we know it today.First, the policy of a deliberate show-down with organised labour. The Government standing aside when their intervention is necessary to avert or end a dispute, in the private sector; the Government acting as provocateur in wage negotiations in the public sector.In the private sector, denying conciliation where conciliation is needed. Deciding that fifty years of conciliation are to be set aside. That the Secretary of State\u2019s job was to be that of a querulous referee who conceives it as his function to stand on the touch-line selectively throwing his bottles at just one set of players.This and his discriminatory wages policy against the public sector, miners, nurses, railwaymen, probation officers, teachers, manual workers in Government employment. Ministers who have talked of anarchy are hell-bent on intensifying anarchy. Those who have talked of disputes are dedicated to pro­voking them.There is one clear and definite message on which this Conference has already shown its determination.The Tories are not going to be allowed to divide one section of our national community from another. To resist the Tories is one thing, and determination to resist is unequivocal. But we all recognise the clear responsibility on this Movement: I mean this Movement, industrial and political. For when doctrinaire Tory measures have been beaten back we shall have the responsibility of showing to the country that, together, we are capable of working out an effective approach for dealing with problems that confront, not this country alone, but every modern industrial society. A policy for full employment based on stability of values and the protection of those within our com­munity least able to help themselves.This eluded us before because in 1964 we came to office in the middle of urgent and immediate problems which never gave us the time and the opportunity to work out the necessary approach. Now we have the time and together we must use it to find a way. It is not a question of formal declarations or treaties. It is a question rather of expressing our common purpose.That cannot be made explicit until, between us, we can set out a climate in which that purpose can alone operate. And it is to define and fashion that climate as well as to agree on our mutual responsibilities, that the future work and co-operation of this Movement must be directed.And putting back the clock in industrial relations is matched by the second part of the strategy, a reversion to the law of ruthless profit-seeking in industry, regardless of national or regional priorities.The law of the market, which recognises only profit, however earned, the balance-sheet to be paramount, ignoring the economic or social claims of employment, of export, of the development of Britain\u2019s productive resources.If the policies they have decided to follow had been adopted by us, the Upper Clyde would not have been saved.Cammell Laird\u2019s - now busy with new orders - would have closed; there would have been no British-owned computer industry, and the last section of the indigenous British motor-car industry would before long have passed into American ownership.We are told that investment grants are to go, investment allowances are to take their place - rewarding those that have profits to show, denying new industries and firms, however enterprising, who need a start.This is not economic policy. It is economic abdication. The assertion of Government, of community responsibility, whether for the strength of our economy or the welfare of our people, is to give place to a new concentration of power, where the take-over bidder, the financial entrepreneur holds sway, regardless of what is produced, regardless of the decay of proud regions, the welfare of their workers, the opportunities for their children.And the third element in their strategy is the re-shaping of Government social expendi­ture, not on new priorities, but on the old priorities; on which until this year, all parties had turned their backs.If a phrase was coined that I regret it was \u2018Yesterday\u2019s Men.\u2019 Why did we have to use that flattery? Yesterday is modernity compared with those who now seek their inspiration in the golden days before World War One - golden for some. Selsdon Man, gagged and muted throughout the election, has now become Selsdon Minister. Remember how we warned that these men would take us back - in the social services back to pre-Beveridge; back in housing to pre-Wheatley; back in health to pre-Bevan. When I warned that they would seek to introduce the concept of first-and second-class status within the Health Service - the test being ability to pay - I was indignantly contradicted by Mr. Heath.I warn them that if they lay their hands on all that has been built up by the British people, by this Movement, then whatever their mask of cold indifference and doctrinaire arrogance, the fight we shall put up by day and by night against their legislation will make even the battles they had to fight to get the Rent Act through seem mild by comparison.We all of us in this Party, in this Movement, have the right to make that warning explicit. We are proud of the achievements of the first post-war Labour Government in creating in those years of unparalleled difficulty, the Welfare State, the Health Service, that great advance in education, and low rent housing.We are proud of the record of countless members of local authorities over a generation, bringing to the legislation passed by Parliament the warmth, humanity and compassion of people nurtured in socialism and social ideals.We are proud of our record over the past six years, when once again we did not allow crippling economic difficulties to daunt us, of the years in which we almost doubled the provision for our social services, health, housing, education and the attack on poverty.It is because of what the Labour Govern­ment achieved that over this past year - indeed this was one of the great themes of the last Conference - all of us recognised and stressed that more and more must be done for the forgotten members of our society. The men­tally handicapped, including very particularly the mentally handicapped children. The problem of shelter and care in old age, the creation of a real equality of opportunity in education, not only at 11 but at 18. So much had been done, so much more still remained to do. For the first time we had been able to create an economic base on which we could build.I warn this Conference, as earlier I sought to warn the country, what irresponsible Tory financial promises must mean for our great national social services, and the essential local services dependent upon national provision. They are failing to get even a fraction of the expenditure cuts they had said would be so easy. That is why I must warn at once about the danger of Tory action this autumn to cut back the real value of Government provision for all the wide range of local social services.The biennial Rate Support Grant has to be determined before the end of the year and secure Parliamentary approval. Of small importance that the record provision made in 1968 was attacked by Mr. Heath as being too small, when he thought there were votes in such an attack - that implied pledge goes the way of all the rest.Now we shall have the Conservative Government blindly swinging their axe. The more severely they cut down necessary provision, then the more will local authorities, at a time when so many are Conservative-led, be tempted to cut and slash essential services to avoid still further loading the rates over and above what will be forced upon them by declared Conservative policies.And it is as these Councils balance essen­tially inadequate central finance with their desire to keep rates as low as possible that the temptation will be upon them, a temptation they are not the men to resist, to economise and pare on all those items of local government expenditure which are the characteristic of a civilised society - what they no doubt will call the frills - what we consider the means to a better and fairer Britain.The irresponsible promises of the Tories have brought upon them, and upon Britain, the problems I have described.And this applies with equal force to the policies for Southern Africa. Recall how this began. Sir Alec told the press his firm decision, our embargo on arms for South Africa would be revoked. But when he was confronted by us in Parliament it was a different story. All he was doing was consulting the Common­wealth. There has been no decision. There would be no decision before Parliament resumed in the autumn.But then there was the strange case of Mr. Heath. He refused to publish the message he had sent to the Commonwealth, of which, for greater accuracy, I had obtained a copy. However, the Prime Minister of Canada pub­lished his own reply in which he referred to Mr. Heath's message as a \u2018decision.\u2019 Nothing like dealing honestly and directly with Parlia­ment, the press and the public, not to mention the Commonwealth.We warned him over the Springbok tour, over his policies for South Africa and Rhodesia. We warned him that his policies would endanger any hopes of a rational policy on equal community relations, regardless of race or colour. Those warnings were con­temptuously ignored.It is my clear duty this morning, not to repeat them, but to reinforce them by saying what the policy of the next Government will be.It is important that, in default of the present Government, someone must assert that, in these matters, Britain stands and always will stand on the side of the eternal decencies.If the Conservatives, for whatever reason - be it an unwillingness to reverse the instant, ideological government of Sir Alec Douglas-Home, be it the pressures of the Monday Club, the Powellites - if they decide to spurn the Commonwealth, indeed to risk its very existence, by a decision to sell arms to South Africa, then whatever contracts they may sign will be repudiated by an incoming Labour Government at the next Election. Any ship­ments arising from them will be embargoed. And let me warn them about any manoeuvrings designed to tie our hands. We have seen before how they were able to turn a commercial agreement into an enforceable international treaty. If for ideological reasons they clothe these indefensible contracts with the enforce­ability of a treaty, then let them know that a Labour Government will accept no treaty which is in conflict with the decision of the United Nations, our membership of which, our commitment to whose decisions, were themselves enshrined in a treaty which we have regarded and always will regard as bind­ing on the individual decisions of Government. I hope that this will help Mr. Heath, despite himself, to be able to attend a full meeting of the Commonwealth in Singapore next January. But should he ignore these warnings, I want to make this appeal to our Common­wealth friends.I know how you feel on this issue. You feel as we do.You know that this is a matter not of a few millions on the balance sheet.That recognising this and knowing how the heart of Britain really beats on this question, that you do not leave the Commonwealth, which I believe to be one of the greatest forces not only for international co-operation but for international decision in the years ahead. Bite on the Tory bit and realise that there will again be a Britain with a different conception of Commonwealth leadership.Rhodesia too.I recall the equivocation of the Tory leader­ship over the years since U.D.I. Not that there were even votes in it, but the Tory leadership had to move very close to appease­ment of a racialist regime in order to keep within their ranks the racialist extremists who never fail to assert their power when they recognise that they are faced with a leadership lacking in moral fibre on these fundamental matters of principle.Again the future of the Commonwealth is at stake, a derisory consideration perhaps, when with a Parliamentary majority of thirty, they are facing the hard-liners of the Monday Club.They have said, it is on the record, that there will be no agreement on a legal independence except on the basis of the five prin­ciples which we laid down. All Parties in this country are committed to them: History will not forgive, nor shall we tolerate a settlement based on the racialist principles of the police-state, now near-fascist regime in Rhodesia.But, Mr. Chairman, the overseas issue which will dominate the life and work of this parliament, will be the decision that has to be taken about Britain\u2019s application to join the European Economic Community. A decision which has to be taken when the Brussels negotiations reach a point where Parliament and the country can measure and assess the advantages and the costs.This is not the time for decision.Last year at Conference I pointed out that Britain\u2019s application had been made, approved by Parliament, approved by Conference, three years ago. Few, if any, were proposing a reversal of that decision. The question was, what terms for entry.The main change since last year has been the physical opening of the negotiations, though there have also been changes and developments within the Community itself which will have an important bearing on the terms of Britain\u2019s entry. It is too early to judge what the terms will be.I have not changed my view, although I respect the view of many here who think differently, that providing we can get the right terms, entry will be advantageous for Britain. A country which depends as much as Britain for our exports to world markets must face the fact that the three principal markets into which we trade are for one reason and another being more and more rigged and systematised and certainly not to our advantage.The North American market, in which these past two years has seen such great success for British exports, is becoming more and more subject to a fever of protectionism against which it was our duty to warn suc­cessive Presidents. I have small doubt that these warnings have been repeated by those who now have the responsibility.The Commonwealth.Some of us on entering office had high hopes that we could reverse the downward trend in trade within the Commonwealth, and at Commonwealth Conference after Confer­ence I sought to establish meetings of trade Ministers and by other means to get agree­ment on means to increase Commonwealth trade.But we have to face the fact here that some of our biggest Commonwealth trading partners are more and more integrating their economies with those of their neighbours, Australia with Japan and the countries of South-East Asia; Canada more and more with her neighbour, and also with the Caribbean and South America; we have had disappointments in Commonwealth countries in Africa and a growing number of these have been making their own arrangements with the European Common Market.And that third great area, the vast European market, is the subject of tight and cohesive trading rules which are made by others, with no British participation. The problem here is not only the rules of that increasingly inte­grated community. There is a problem, too, of the growth of the large multi-national com­pany or trust whose interests and loyalties transcend national boundaries, and who make their own rules. The European Corporation is becoming a reality even if so many of the Europe-wide companies, in motors, in com­puters, in electronics, are in fact American dominated and controlled.It is to face this challenge that we have seen the growth of the huge mergers in British industry with economic and industrial and social consequences which we have not yet fully learned how to meet - another great question on the agenda of our future work.If the terms which emerge from the nego­tiations are such as to impose a crippling and unacceptable burden on our balance of pay­ments and our social structure, I should be the first to say that these terms must be rejected. But we have to recognise that the right terms would give us a greater power of participation in the decisions which will in­creasingly dominate world industry.Last year I said that Britain\u2019s growing strength meant that if the terms were right we need not fear the sharper competition which entry would mean; that we could indeed benefit from the new opportunities British industry would have.But equally, I said that if the terms were wrong, we had by our own efforts, our own restraint, our own self-discipline, created for ourselves the strength to stand on our own feet outside the Community.I believe that is still true, though we shall watch anxiously how far the irresponsible men now in power in this country fritter away that strength by pursuing false economic objectives and by their policy of dividing - where we did so much to unite - our nation.Unlike the situation eight years ago, had it been a Labour Government which secured entry into the Common Market in the present negotiations, it would not have been out of crippling weakness but out of confident strength. That strength must not now be dissipated.But if our warnings about this fall on deaf ears there is one argument we will not accept - we heard it before - that, whatever the terms, we have to go in because we are too weak to stay out.Between 1964 and 1970 the Labour Govern­ment brought Britain through to a position of economic strength. But the political effects of the very measures we had to use have denied to us - for a time - the opportunity to follow through. The opportunity to use that strength we had created, to intensify and accelerate the creation of a better and fairer Britain.For how often have all of us said that economic strength is not an end in itself. It is a means, but a necessary means, to the realisation of everything this Movement stands for. That was the message seven years ago at Scarborough. The message that Socialism must be used to harness, control, humanise, civilise the speed of the new technological revolution. The Scarborough programme for modernising and reorganising industry, and providing for those who suffered through change, was becoming a reality under the Labour Government, forced through against those who, while not resisting change, de­manded that the direction and force of that change should be dictated by private interests, for private ends.If the Labour Government had not been pushing the Scarborough programme through, this country by now would have slipped out of the mainstream of technological and econ­omic advance with all the harmful and social consequences this neglect and abdication would have involved. But if Scarborough was right and necessary for its time, we must recognise that time has moved forward and that Britain must move forward with it. There are new problems now, and tomorrow will bring other problems of whose scope and nature we can only be partly aware. The Socialism of the Labour Party possesses the only approach to match and conquer those problems. We must begin planning now within this Party to create the apparatus which will make that approach a reality.For our experience of the Scarborough pro­gramme has taught us this. First, that the sheer implications of economic and social change imposed by the speed of modern science and industrial technique are such that their planning and control need to be not less wide than we attempted, but wider. That the planning cannot be related to the arbitrary lifetime of a single Parliament only. That we have to have our vision of the Britain of the nineteen-eighties and \u2019nineties to be able to plan the measures of the \u2019seventies.And the second lesson is this. The very facts I have just mentioned about the aggregation of power in vast national and international economic groupings underline the need for a continued assertion of the protection of the increasingly helpless individual against the demands of increasingly ruthless and remote economic, power.Man has to work, in order to consume. He is not a free being simply because society gives him more alternative ways of spending the money he earns, if he becomes less free in how he earns it. Man does not live by the monthly index of retail sales alone.But, and this is the third challenge to modern society, to industrial frustrations are added a wider dimension, going far beyond the dictates of the production-line. The dimension of man in his environment. And here I do not mean only the social costs of technical advance, the pollution of the air and water, and the countryside.The problem of the environment is psycho­logical as well as physical. You can pollute a man\u2019s soul, a child\u2019s dreams, just as you can poison the water and the air around him, if every decision affecting his future is taken by more and more remote, less and less account­able beings. And if technological advance dic­tates that more and more decisions are taken, whether in public or private enterprise, at stages further and further from the point where the work is done, then a modern conception of Government means a greater, not a smaller, degree of concern and protection for the man and woman at the point where the work is done.Government\u2019s task, Parliament\u2019s task, is not only to ensure the accountability of economic decisions: it is to ensure that those affected by these decisions are first consulted and then safeguarded. Three months have dramatised the essential difference between a Labour Government and its successors. The Labour Government insisted that if the coal, industry had to suffer from technological change, the men affected must be given protection and economic security. As a matter of course we brought a Bill before Parliament last June to continue that protection. After three months of vacillation and hesitancy, and despite the urgent insistence of all of us, that Bill has not yet been reintroduced, nor solid assurances given that in the form we laid down, it will be.When a shipyard was in danger of closure under the Tories, the Tory Minister\u2019s message was: \u2018You\u2019re out on your own.\u2019 Palmer\u2019s Yard closed this weekend. But the challenge goes far beyond the loss of work and security. Those who seek to deal with the problems of modern industry by repression and appeals to law and order fail to get at the underlying frustration. Frustration for the individual.When we hear learned and self-righteous individuals who have forgotten even what it was to be young, condemning modern youth, they fail to understand the frustration of young, people lost or trapped in the blind alleys of modern industrial society. Or students who, questioning the basis of the system of indus­trial recruitment or the big brother dossiers, will fight any attempt to transform a free university into an adjunct of industrialism. It is frightened men, and men out of touch, who seek to fight the student frustration by repression alone, without understanding.It\u2019s a frightened and unthinking act, not a confident act, that is inspired by the belief that you can deal with our student problem by sending a sick student out of the country. Law, yes. Order, yes, but these are comple­ments to, not a substitute for attacking the conditions which give rise to the problem. The break-out in advanced but uncaring societies of black power, as men condemned for gener­ations to helotry on no basis other than the colour of their skin, turn to violence - and are exploited by others who can turn violence to their own ends.There are other frustrations too. The frus­trations of working men and women on the factory floor, who see vast changes taking place around them but are scarcely able to influence the forces which dictate the course of their lives. The frustration of office workers and technicians who feel that big power-blocs are elbowing them aside, so that they must cling on to their living standards by their finger­tips.It is for Labour to reunite these sections of the community. It is for us to strengthen the power of the community and make it relevant to the needs of the new decade.The worker is hostile to the student, grumb­ling that his income tax goes to pay for their demonstrations. The rumbling against immigrants goes on, wherever social conditions create tensions. We must condemn violent demonstrations. We must condemn with all the vehemence in our power the manifesta­tions of Powellism. It is not so much that the Powellites have exploited fear and hatred, or even that they have created fear and hatred in order to exploit them. They were exploiting a vacuum. They were taking up a cause - how­ever venomous that cause - because there were so many who, due to the conditions in which they worked, the conditions in which they lived, felt that they had no one to give them a lead, no one with whom they could identify. But we must not make the mistake of dis­carding as beneath our notice the human beings involved in these confrontations. Ugly emotions are the outcome of false hostilities created by social conditions it is our duty to transform.We must convince all these groups - factory workers, office workers, technicians, immigrants, students, that their interests are not in conflict but in common, and can be served only by their combining together to support Labour's implementation of Socialist policies.In the explanations offered last June we became familiar with the word \u2018volatility.\u2019 It wasn\u2019t volatility in the sense of something flashy and insubstantial. It was closer to cynicism, in the case of tens of thousands of our fellow citizens, sullenness, a feeling that political battles had nothing for them. A Parliamentary colleague has told me of a block of old and substantial municipal flats in his constituency, where the total poll was thirty per cent. You\u2019re all the same, he was told, whoever\u2019s in power - and they might have meant in Parliament, they might have meant in the Council - they haven\u2019t fixed my drain, or got rid of the damp.The task of our Socialism is to make Parlia­ment a reality to people who feel that nobody cares. This of itself is a condemnation of a new Government which is resolved - if irresolute on all else - to narrow the area of Parliamentary concern, whether in an economic system which leaves the vital decisions to the irresponsible and the unaccountable, or in social affairs where matters of social concern are to become primarily matters of personal provision, regardless of the power to provide.It is for us in this Movement to challenge that negativism, and to provide the answer to it. To show that man need not be a dwarf in the shadow of his own means of livelihood. To prove that Parliament and local democracy can be made relevant to people\u2019s lives - work­ing lives, family lives - through a Socialism which connects their lives with the mechanisms which dominate them and the decisions which determine them.The Conservatives say that \u2018You\u2019re out on your own.\u2019 That Government must contract and withdraw, only holding the ring while the giant corporations make decisions in their own interests. They call this individualism. But it is the death of individualism.The individual identity, the rights of a man and his family can only be restored and enhanced if individuals join together to con­trol the apparatus they have created.This is Socialism. This is why, if Socialism had never been thought of before, it would now have to be invented. This is why the Socialism of the Labour Party is more relevant and more needed now than ever before.We are now at the start of a Parliament - a Parliament in which the electorate have decided that we are to carry out the role of Opposition.We shall do our job, and do it vigorously. But while we must always be a party of protest, the last six years have proved that we are now also a party of Government.We must begin preparing now for the day when the people of Britain decide that they want to take the Government of the country back into their own hands.This Conference is that beginning.

aVThe Parlia­mentary Session on which I have the grim duty of reporting to Conference today covers a period, only 16 months since the Labour Government lost power, such as we have not seen in this generation.For the first time since the 30\u2019s, it is anger, it is fear that dominate the nation\u2019s life. Anger that the men who climbed to office with a pledge to reduce unemployment at a stroke, have, by their actions, their coldly, calculated policies, headed Britain back again towards the unemployment of the 30\u2019s. Nearly a million are in the queue for an inadequate and dwindling number of jobs. Millions more are wondering when the axe will fall on them. Millions in regions where there has been no unemployment for 30 years. Millions of workers who, unless they are over 45, have never known unemployment for themselves or their mates. Not industrial workers only; thousands of white-collar workers, super­visors, staff, design or development teams, salesmen, have suddenly learnt to fear, and many, many more fear to learn; learn what it means for them and their families when everything they have taken for granted - their home, their standard of living, their car, their holidays - are suddenly at risk, and commitments which did not seem burdensome when the monthly salary cheque was coming in, now become overwhelming.Last month\u2019s official figures showed 929,121 registered as unemployed. In fact, an under­statement. Thousands of men have been prematurely retired by their employers to avoid or reduce redundancies; tens of thousands, especially women workers, have simply withdrawn from the labour market. Over the past year, the numbers employed have fallen far faster, even than the numbers unemployed have risen. The numbers out of work, seeking work, failing to find work, are in real terms now well over a million.The number of men registered as out of work, not temporarily stopped but totally unemployed, stands at 5.2 per cent, far above any figure which has been accepted at any time, by any political party, since the war, since the nation resolved never again to return to the dismal and divided 30\u2019s. Worse, this figure wins for Britain the accolade of being top of the league for unemployment among the industrial nations of the world. Proud of that, Mr. Heath?Apart from the South East, no region of Britain shows an unemployment rate for male workers - men, boys, school-leavers \u2011 below 4.2 per cent. Scotland, Wales, the North, the West Midlands, the North-West are over 6 per cent. Regions which have not known unemployment in this generation now have unemployment rates which would have earned development area status under the Labour Government.There are regions, wide areas, more and more towns having more than 10 per cent of their men out of work; what I saw on the street corners at Clydebank is becoming more and more the symbol of our older industrial towns.The development areas, to which the Labour Government brought help, to which the Labour Government brought hope, are now faced with intolerable levels of unemployment. Refused help, denied hope - the direct consequence of doctrinaire Tory decisions.Graduate unemployment is the worst since pre-war days, and we are told it will get worse in the years ahead.But what we condemn most of all as the first-fruits of Tory rule is their treatment of school-leavers. School-leavers without jobs - 34,500 this September. And this figure is, as we all know, a gross underestimate. Un­wanted youth - and as the 15-year olds turn in frustration from the Labour Exchange, can\u2019t you see the pompous and the pundits preparing and polishing their pontifications about juvenile crime two and three years hence? We warned Mr. Heath that his invoca­tion of the law and order issue after Selsdon would perish in the divisive social tensions of Conservative policy. And eighteen months after, all he has to offer to 35,000 of our young people is the realisation that at the very moment when they seek to leave school to venture into the wider world, there is no place for them in the Tory market economy.That over and above those for whom there are no jobs at all there are many who have worked for their technical and scholastic qualifications in what they thought was a land of opportunity - and now they can find no jobs to match those qualifications.Is this the spirit in which they were en­couraged to meet the challenge of a competi­tive world, where Britain will survive and prosper - inside the Market, outside the Market - only to the extent that every one of our younger citizens is encouraged to develop his talents, and given the chance to use them?Not a Tory but realises that there is more unemployment to come this winter. If only there was one of them who showed he cared.We have seen Mr. Robert Carr expressing his surprise at the figures he was announcing and seeking to excuse a state of affairs for which he and his colleagues bear the unique responsibility. The other day I heard his speech when he opened a training centre to add to the pool of skilled unemployed by training bus drivers as tool room operators, while unemployed tool room operators queue up at the Exchanges for jobs driving buses. His one contribution to the unemployment problem, and I charge you not to discount it as a statistical achievement, has been to per­fect arrangements with the German Govern­ment for Britain\u2019s unemployed craftsmen to sign on to work for German employers.Mr. John Davies, who, if I can paraphrase Lloyd George\u2019s critics, brings to the conduct of the Government\u2019s industrial responsibilities all the qualities of a pettifogging Welsh accountant without the redeeming quality of a Welshman\u2019s compassion, blames it all on tea breaks. Were there no tea-breaks when Mr. Heath blithely promised that he would reduce unemployment at a stroke? But Mr. Davies could perhaps be excused. After all he\u2019d made his undeniable contribution to the jobs crisis. He found a job for the Treasurer of the Tory Party in Scotland; he appointed him Chairman of the wreckage of Upper Clyde Shipbuilders, the firm which, in accordance with long-planned Tory policy, Mr. Davies and his colleagues had butchered.Less excusable was the ineffable voice that breathed from Sir John Eden speaking in Sheffield - 4 per cent unemployed - 9,700 men, 5.4 per cent, unemployed and 4,500 jobs threatened in a steel closure.\u2018There is an enormous obsession,\u2019 he pro­claimed, \u2018with unemployment. It is all too easy to talk oneself into a position of gloom and despondency.\u2019 Enormous obsession with unemployment? I wish the Government shared it. Will they never learn? Do they not realise that for the man who is unemployed, for his wife as she shops to make limited ends meet, for his anxious family, the unemploy­ment percentage is not a statistic; it\u2019s not 3.6 per cent seasonally corrected, or 8 or 10 per cent. It is, for him, for them, 100 per cent.The redundancy fund we created to cushion men who inescapably lose their jobs through the process of technological change is un­necessarily facing bankruptcy because of the vast numbers who have been thrown out of work, not by technology but by Toryism.They admit they have no answer. Sir Keith Joseph, speaking in Macclesfield, said, \u2018I have to tell you that jobs in this country depend on joining Europe.\u2019 Could not Mr. Heath draw Sir Keith\u2019s attention to the words of Mr. John Davies a few weeks ago, expressing pessimism about the early years of entry into Europe - and his forecast of a short-term appreciable down-turn in exports? And that must mean in jobs. If they can\u2019t co-ordinate their policies, you\u2019d think that at least they\u2019d co-ordinate their alibis.Then we had Mr. Anthony Barber - in July - telling us that his panic mini-maxi-mini Budget measures would show results within two months.Carr, Davies, Eden, Joseph, Barber. But what of the man who presides, ruthlessly presides, over this tragedy that we are seeing played out?The million unemployed are the legatees of his deliberate testament.For his policy is based on an obsession with a free market policy. It is to be noted that in this obsession there is one exception: the free market he stubbornly pursues excludes one element - collective bargaining. For the Tory free market cannot work unless the freedom he proclaims is denied to the workers. They decided to destroy what civilised men had accepted for a generation and replace it by a state of war. He decided on taking office that he would use the weapon of unemployment against the unions, when the nation was strong enough for sustained expansion and the achievement of full employment.And in pursuance of this free market obsession we saw the calculated destruction of the Prices and Incomes Board, the action we warned would be as bad for employment as for prices.We saw their doctrinaire dismantling of the I.R.C. - the Industrial Reorganisation Corporation - and of the Industrial Expansion Act, both desperately needed for industrial modernisation and the fight against unemploy­ment. Even forward-looking men in the City of London and industry knew that this was a death-blow to industrial expansion.We saw their scrapping of investment grants, an essential weapon in getting new factories built and jobs created.All over the country, businessmen are blaming the slump in investment on this wilful decision by the Conservative Govern­ment.The stubborn refusal, in one Budget or mini-Budget after another, to accept our demands for more rapid expansion. Each time they told us the pick-up in industry was beginning. Each time they were badly wrong.Their successive acts of spite against key industries, forcing into bankruptcy firms absolutely strategic in our fight for full employment.This is Conservatism in action. Action mocking the words of Conservatism in prospect, the words of Mr. Edward Heath as Leader of the Opposition. Just two years ago, on 9 September, 1969, these were his words:We cannot tolerate the waste of human and economic resources brought about by their uneven use in different parts of the country. We refuse to condemn large parts of the Kingdom to slow decline and decay, to dereliction and to persistent unemployment in pursuit of old-fangled nineteenth century doctrines of laissez-faire.What he has tolerated is something the nation has refused to tolerate since the days of the 30\u2019s, the remorseless increase in un­employment month by month - 350,000 since the General Election.I could not have believed, his hearers could not have believed, that faced with the pros­pect of a million unemployed his calculated policies had brought about, a British Prime Minister in the 70\u2019s could make frozen indifference, in the face of human suffering, the hallmark of his style of Government. (Applause) Or that, as he tours the country, on the Common Market, his achievements had been to preside over an industrial situa­tion, where, to quote the Economist news­paper, British manufacturing industry was working at 65 to 70 per cent of capacity.This obsession with the free market doctrine has made Conservative promises on prices as much of a deception as their pledges over unemployment.Last October, on TV, I asked you to list the prices you were then paying, and put them behind the clock on the mantelpiece. Take them out today, and you\u2019ll think you\u2019re reading the Dead Sea Scrolls. (Laughter and Applause.)Every housewife knows how prices are rising, and what the Tory record has been in such a short time. Small wonder her fear for the standard of living of her family; small wonder her fears about Mr. Heath\u2019s plans for her future and that of her family.Here was the man who had the effrontery to try to frighten the housewives of Britain by warning them that if the Labour Govern­ment were returned to office in June 1970, they would have to face price increases on everything they bought. Bread - he tried to frighten them with the bogey of a three shilling loaf. Now we have read forecasts of a 15 pence, three shilling loaf, as the direct result of his own import levies, the Tory food taxes we warned the country they would introduce.He importuned them with talk of cutting down on the family\u2019s weekly joint, forced to buy cheaper, smaller cuts of meat. In the year following his pleadings, beef prices rose by 22.5 per cent, by over four new pence in the pound. And if he couldn\u2019t get his cut off the joint this way, this ardent suitor pressed his cause with eggs. \u2018Standard eggs from the supermarket, instead of large ones.\u2019 Eggs are today 14 per cent, over three new pence, higher than a year ago. And we are told that present Tory agricultural policies will lead to lower production, higher prices, as month succeeds month - even a famine is threatened.But, he said of the housewives, \u2018we will fight on their side. We are determined to put the brakes on price rises.\u2019He preached on rates, pontificated on fares, and perorated on the cost of running a car.Rates - the biggest increase millions of householders have ever known.Fares - here was a scare that misfired - he tried to frighten them by telling of a shilling minimum fare; within two months of his taking office, in August, 1970, the Tory G.L.C. and his Government achieved this for London Underground at a stroke, and last week we read that at the next stroke the minimum was likely to go up to 2 shillings - ten pence.This is not all. The housewife\u2019s choice he offered you - announced since I reached Brighton - is full fares, no cheap fares, for children in the rush-hour. But when else are they supposed to go to school? Even Mrs. Thatcher hasn\u2019t announced night-shift in the schools yet. Has he any conception of what this means for our families, for the worries it means for everyone who is concerned with balancing the household budget?As for cars, increase after increase in petrol and garage charges and now the PR men of the insurance trade are conditioning you for the second major increases in car insurance since the Tory Party took power.And, scarcely credible to recall, he even tried to frighten the housewife about the money she has to take out of her purse every week to pay for school meals. One of his Government\u2019s first acts was to announce that school meals would go up by 15 new pence per week per child to 60 pence now, and later to 70 new pence per week, for every child. A million fewer children taking school meals, and how many more subjected to Mrs. Thatcher's class-room inquisition?And - you won\u2019t credit this - Mr. Heath, when he sought the housewives\u2019 votes, even referred to school milk. A Government which rushed to hand out nearly £40 a week in tax relief to the £20,000 a year man, decides, in defiance of the school doctors and everyone who knows and cares about children\u2019s health, to stop free milk to the seven year olds.Labour councillors trying to discharge the human obligations they felt to supply milk in the schools for which they carried respon­sibility found the whole power of the State arrayed against them. The smack of firm Government was invoked, and Selsdon Woman herself gloried in brandishing the meanest little Bill Parliament has seen since the war, a Bill whose effect was to impose pains and penalties on any who presumed to make milk available to young children.Of course, there\u2019s always Mr. James Prior to season the Tory record with levity. Apples scarce? Buy peaches. Meat dear? You can always shoot a pigeon. (Laughter) He was the first to crack the Tory sick joke that we must rely on competition to bring prices down.And he never gives up. He was the first Minister to turn Queen\u2019s evidence when he went on the BBC to say that Mr. Heath didn\u2019t expect anyone to take him seriously with his election-eve pledge on prices. Now he\u2019s done it again. Traders cheated over decimalisation, he now tells us. But it had been his Government which - to create that free market of theirs - had instantly scrapped the Consumer Council, who stood ready to watch consumer interests on and after Decimal Day. Labour had decided to use the machinery of price controls which we had created against anyone who exploited the public through decimalisation. But to make doubly sure that in a free market there was no nonsense about interfering with traders\u2019 rights to charge what they liked, this Govern­ment scrapped all that machinery on taking office.What does their free market philosophy mean, for instance, in housing? What has it meant for young people, newly-married, or with a growing family, who want to buy a house? House prices this year are rising by 10 to 15 per cent per annum, the greatest increase in prices ever recorded. And to build a house you need land. So land profiteers were set free. And on 9 September, the Financial Times with the headline, \u2018Soaring land prices shake house building recovery,\u2019 asserts, \u2018In some areas land prices for private housing have risen 15 pet cent in the last four months alone, compared with a national average of only 2 per cent in 1970.\u2019And the young couple in the queue for a Council house, and every family living in a Council house. From next April the rent of every house goes up 50 new pence, 10 shillings a week, and that is only a beginning - from all over the country reports are coming in showing that the full working out of the Tory plan will mean doubling Council house rents. And as with school milk, the law will be drawn so tight that Labour councillors who have given a lifetime of service for the housing of the people will be powerless to do anything about it.There is just one price increase which causes me concern, and I know that this is shared by everyone here.It\u2019s the price of newsprint. It has risen inordinately under the Conservative Government. And honest Conservative newspaper proprietors, bursting to maintain their traditional neutrality in political reporting as between the Conservative Government and their Labour predecessors, are finding diffi­culty with space. I ask you, as a compassionate Conference, to spare a passing tear, for, let\u2019s say, the Daily Mail. On 21 May, 1970, just after the General Election began, the Govern­ment announced the Retail Price Index, with an increase mainly due to blighted potatoes, rates, and rent increases imposed by the then Tory-controlled Councils, of 2.1 points, 1.5 per cent.Properly outraged, the Mail exposed this news in acres upon acres of cheap newsprint, Labour Government newsprint. Thus\u2026 I\u2019ve obtained a black-market copy.Now this May, exactly a year later - though I notice the Tories always announce cost of living figures on a Saturday morning, when they hope you\u2019re not looking - the Retail Price Index rose, not 2.1 points, but 3.2 points, not 1.5 per cent, but 2.1 per cent. You can imagine the editorial conferences, the frenzied transatlantic telephone messages as editors fought to secure more newsprint in order to provide the same coverage for a Tory price-rise of 2.1 per cent, as, in the first week of the General Election, they had devoted to a 1.5 per cent price-rise under a Labour Government. And - you can imagine their disappointment - the newsprint barons, the Director of Cash-Flow Analysis at Associated Newspapers, issued their ukase, as to the amount of newsprint available. Imagine the mortification of those pillars of journalistic integrity, when Tory newsprint prices dictated that the whole story had to be confined to this, on page 9. Lest I be sus­pected of giving an exclusive commercial to the Daily Mail I have to record that the same anguished suffering marked those who earn their bread on the Daily Express. Calls to the Canadian newsprint producers. In their desperation, communication was established with the other world - Lord Beaverbrook was called on his special hot line. All in vain, he could not help. And strong men in the Express office laid aside their quills and wept.I ask you in your compassion to spare a thought for these frustrated Conservative newspaper proprietors, so anxious to main­tain their political objectivity.For it still goes on. For example, a fort­night ago, honest journalists on one of the papers I am commending sought space for a story which read that there had been, I quote, \u2018a rise of only 5.65 per cent so far this year,\u2019 and in May-August (when prices are usually stable), \u2018a mere\u2019 - they said \u2013 \u2018a mere 1.37 per cent.\u2019 Well, I\u2019m glad to say the story was printed. But there just wasn\u2019t enough news\u2011print to say that in the same months of last year prices rose not 5.65 per cent but 4.4 per cent.And that is the end of my brief commercial.But I have glad tidings for Fleet Street. I am prepared to arrange through that impartial organisation, Aims of Industry, who served the nation for a brief period in the Spring of 1970, at great cost and sacrifice, with that single-minded educational campaign - as they were claiming last week - to inform the nation that private enterprise was the best guarantee of low prices. Recluses as they are, they were totally ignorant of the fact that a General Election was taking place at the time. When the Conservatives were restricted by election law, the impartial non-political organisation flooded press and poster head­ings with their great campaign on prices. It stopped around mid-June. Now I understand they haven\u2019t been running a poster campaign since, even though there hasn\u2019t been an election. But I know that you and I can ask them with confidence to provide the news­print, at whatever cost, to help Fleet Street to run a series from 14 to 18 June, 1970 - after I\u2019d got the newspaper strike over - proving beyond doubt how Mr. Heath, no matter how many strokes he had to have, would bring prices down. And I\u2019d like all those who, at great personal cost and inconvenience excavated the prices of 1970, should now set out - on every poster site in the country - prices then, 1970; prices now, 1971. I know this appeal will not go in vain.The housewives who trusted Mr. Heath have been betrayed. And now he asks them to believe that entry into the European Common Market will not mean an un­acceptable further increase in prices. If by that he means that Conservative policies - especially food levies - are designed to bring British prices up to the indefensible levels in the market, that is one thing. But this he denies. So he bows out - conscious that the would-be Casanova appealing to the house­wives in June, 1970, whom they were so ready then to believe, is no longer credited, he invoked, in this very week, a new Don Juan, incredibly Mr. Geoffrey Rippon, to renew the seduction. Prices will rise a half per cent a year, he says. Do not trust him, gentle maiden. (Laughter and applause).Conference yesterday took a clear and unequivocal decision about the party attitude to entry into Europe on the humiliating Conservative terms.This is the decision of the Labour Party, the Labour Movement. The Parliamentary Labour Party, a fortnight hence, has to take its decision about how Labour members vote in the Parliamentary division on 28 October.Conference does not dictate that decision, but every Labour member before he votes in the Parliamentary Party meeting will give full weight to this Conference decision, as also to the views of his constituency.I am not going to go over yesterday\u2019s arguments. The decision has been taken - and put beyond all argument and all doubt.We have not apologised and we do not apologise for the fact that on an issue so fundamental to the future of this country this democratic Movement has been deeply divided; nor do I apologise for my call for a great debate within this Party, within this Movement. The Conservative Party is divided no less deeply \u2013 the difference is that in the debate within the Conservative Party, any who hold views opposed to that of the leadership have been subjected to all the pressures, direct pressures, constituency pressures, of which the Chief Whip of Suez is a past master. Labour, Conservative, Liberals - the whole country has divided on this issue.But now that we here have taken the decision, I have the right, I have the duty, to enjoin this Movement now to close ranks. I respect those who have, all along, argued that this country\u2019s destiny lies within Europe; just as I respect those who have argued all along that Britain should not join on any terms. And certainly no less I respect those who, following declared Party policy, in the Com­mons, in Conference after Conference, could see advantage in entering the E.E.C. on the right terms, but who have decided that they cannot endorse the terms that the Conserva­tive Government fell over themselves to accept, which we believe can only mean crippling Britain\u2019s strength.And it was on that basis that Conference yesterday took its decision. And Conference having decided, all those whatever part they have played, whatever views they have accepted, must now join as one, as members of a Movement greater than any of us, to fight as never before against the cynicism of this essentially backward-looking Govern­ment.I call for a united Party. What has divided us is an important policy issue, not an article of faith. I reject reprisals. I do not believe in recriminations. I do believe in a united Party which evaluates and evokes the talents of each member, on the basis of the part he can play in the future in this Socialist Movement of ours. (Applause)In taking leave of yesterday\u2019s arguments, there are just one or two things I want to say.The first relates to the Government\u2019s un­scrupulous and improper use of the taxpayers\u2019 money for a political purpose. A great and democratic debate is one thing. To rig that debate, however unsuccessfully, by the use of public money on an issue which Parliament has not yet decided is indefensible and, I believe, unprecedented. Previous Govern­ments have had the long-standing ground-rules outlined to them and have accepted them; told that the expenditure of Govern­ment money for a political - or even educa­tional - campaign when the principle at stake still awaits determination by Parliament is inadmissible.Yet Conservative Ministers have not scrupled to breach the long-standing rules. They have admitted to the House of Com­mons that their propaganda campaign advocating those terms, together with blatantly political supporting arguments, through the Post Office, and in other ways, had cost £647,550 up to 27 July.They have gone further. They had admitted in Parliament handing over to the Conserva­tive Party machine 837,910 copies of the propagandist short version of their White Paper - together with 5,074 and 3,180 copies respectively to the Labour and Liberal Parties. We sent them back.The 837,910 copies they supplied to the Conservatives on the basis, it was said, of one for each member of the Party, cost over £25,000 to the tax-payer. And at that very time they were railroading through the House the legislation which laid down that any Labour Councillor involved in a Council decision to supply free milk to seven-year-olds was liable to be surcharged for the whole of the expenditure.The second thing is to emphasise a point made yesterday. The Resolution called for a general election on this issue. Mr. Heath committed himself in the Election to the proposition that a Conservative Government would not go forward into Europe against the wishes of the British people. In the circum­stances of October, 1971, this can only mean a general election.In default of that he must expect no help, no aid, no support from any Labour Member of Parliament in getting through Parliament the necessary instruments and legislation, on which he has refused to seek the views of the British people in a general election. (Applause)And as our great debate nears its end, there are clear issues on which none of us here can be divided from each other, but where we all are fundamentally divided from Mr. Heath and his Government. Britain is finished, is his argument. It has been the central theme of Mr. Heath\u2019s archdiaconal intonations, as week by week he has campaigned widely first in Bexley, then in Bexley, and finally with a great flourish in Bexley, and with diminishing acceptance, in favour of the doctrine that the man who, in June, 1970, knew all the answers to Britain\u2019s problems, now says there is no answer, unless you join a particular com­mercial set-up in Europe.He negotiated from the strength we be­queathed to him. Last year I warned this Conference that there was one argument we would never accept - that, whatever the terms, we have to go in because we cannot solve our own problems without doing so. But that is precisely what the Conservative Government are arguing today - the same escapist doctrine they peddled in 1962.All of us here reject this defeatism about Britain, about the British people. I reject, too, the Conservative argument that while you can undermine Britain\u2019s industrial strength by this obsession about creating a free market, a European policy is based on accepting with­out question any terms dictated to us by an autarkic, high-priced, agricultural and food cartel for joining a rigged market in Europe.We reject the growing suggestions for joining a European nuclear deterrent. We have warned time and time, again against such a divisive policy, utterly destructive as it must be of any hopes of easing tension between East and West.This is a bad time to appeal to the Con­servatives about East-West relations, though the Macclesfield election is now over.The trouble about this Conservative Government is they\u2019re always seeking for a virility symbol - and always at someone else\u2019s expense, whether it\u2019s the shipbuilders of Upper Clyde, or a world that stands to gain so much from Willy Brandt\u2019s Ostpolitik.Because of the way the Conservatives have conducted it, this has been a costly debate because it has meant the subordination of every British interest to it, as long as it lasts. The utter subordination of every essential British interest to the Conservative Whips\u2019 tally of Common Market votes.The House of Commons recently debated Northern Ireland. The official Opposition vote against Government policy, and Mr. Heath\u2019s self-appointed role as P.P.S. to Mr. .Faulkner, was not withheld, but deferred until the Queen\u2019s Speech in November. Then it will certainly be registered unless Mr. Heath has answered the questions he evaded last month, particularly the questions I put about internment.And unless he provides, too, clear evidence that it is his policy to assert, as I have demanded, the clear paramountcy of the Imperial Parliament at Westminster over Stormont, over every issue that involves human rights - the deployment of British troops in near-intolerable conditions.And the open-ended financial contributions of the British taxpayer to pay for the conse­quences of what the British Government lamely defends but does not have real powers to control.But this is not all.A fortnight ago there was a devastating analysis in the Sunday Times of the internment operation leading to the conclusion that, and I quote:British parliamentarians anxious to pull British troops clear of this ancient morass will first need to ask how the Heath Govern­ment stumbled so deep into it. Last week\u2019s signing of internment orders on no fewer than 219 IRA suspects gave the clue. Partly out of sloth, partly out of barrenness of ideas, partly out of a care that nothing should make waves for the Market boat, the Government\u2019s prime concern has been to keep the Stormont system in being at almost any cost; and that has meant agree­ing to virtually anything the Northern Ireland Premier of the moment might ask as the means to keeping his followers\u2019 hands from his throat.For eight Ulster Unionists - who have asserted their threat in a day\u2019s provocative abstentions on domestic issues - are not to be discounted when the Common Market tally is counted.And is not this true of other issues as vital to Britain\u2019s place in the world?The protracted negotiations on Rhodesia have been clearly designed for the Tory Conference next week and the Commons and Lords\u2019 votes on the Southern Rhodesia Order. While there will be no announcement on a sell-out before the Commons votes on Europe, hopes will be raised, and one or two more sheep may be persuaded to tread the Europe Lobby.Security is tight, but the Financial Times hinted very clearly, three weeks ago, at a settlement based on an African majority \u2018in a few decades.\u2019The Labour Government refused - and this Labour Party will always refuse - to contemplate any settlement that did not fully honour the six principles we laid down.And the first principle laid down is the requirement of unimpeded progress to majority rule.If rumour, and the Financial Times, are right, Mr. Smith appears to have found a formula capable of persuading the British Government to accept his repeated demand \u2018not in his life-time.\u2019 When we said it must be related not to clock or calendar, we still asserted it must be in measurable time, in 10 to 15 years: clock time, calendar time - not geological time.And any such settlement, based on the present Rhodesian racialist so-called constitution, will be totally resisted by the British Labour Party, inside and outside Parliament. (Applause) It is intolerable that these questions, vital equally to British influence in the Commonwealth and the world, should be related to the vulgar timetable of Conservative Party Conference or the cynical arithmetic of the vote on Europe.It is our duty to oppose, and no less to expose, the realities of Conservative economic policy, its consequences in human terms, the cynicism of their broken promises on prices and consumer standards, as it is to bring home to our people the subordination of vital British and world interests to an obsessive determination to get into the Common Market on any terms.And that stubborn determination, and the national preoccupation with it over these past months, has distracted the country and distracted our Party from the basic problems which should be our concern. The basic prob­lems whose solution must now become the prime aim of the Labour Party\u2019s forward planning, ready for Government after the next election.On health - the new priority we accepted but did not have the chance to make a reality - the priority for mental health, among the young and the old, as claimant imperatives.The priority of the environment, as last year I stressed the unspoken problem, of psychological pollution - for you can pollute a man\u2019s soul, a child\u2019s dreams, just as you can poison the water and the air around him, if every decision affecting his future is taken by more and more remote, less and less accountable beings.Priorities in education, too - and, as Tony Crosland has rightly urged, in housing. The priorities of the 60\u2019s cannot command the 70\u2019s, and the Tory priorities still less. We have a hard job of work to do, and imme­diately and urgently, and we shall need to listen to all those who are labouring in the same vineyard. Shelter, the Society for the Mentally Handicapped, the Child Poverty Action Group. Their objectives are our objectives. In Government it will be our task to work Shelter and the other protest groups out of a job.And central to all this is the problem we learnt at so dear a price - you can have all the best social objectives and the most clearly thought-out policies for obtaining these objectives in the greatest detail and clarity. But at the end of the day, within the society you live in, you will need the full co-operation of each section of the community to be able to pursue the right economic policies. Without this you will be willing the end without providing the means. The National Executive Committee have placed before this Conference our first thoughts in the Conference Docu­ment on economic strategy, unemployment and growth, which we shall be debating tomorrow. It does not provide all the answers, but what it does do is to provide the questions to the answers, and clear guidance to Con­ference on how these questions will have to be answered. Few countries have solved the problem of how to reconcile higher production, higher real incomes, and strong balance of payments at the same time. For Britain this means strongly increasing investment.During six years Labour succeeded in transforming the biggest balance of payments deficit in 150 years of history into the biggest surplus. (Applause)Our condemnation of Mr. Heath and the Tory Government he leads is that they have refused to use that strength to make Britain a better place to live in - with full employment, and rising standards in private expenditure and social expenditure.We never regarded economic strength as an end in itself - for us it was the means to a better quality of life for our people, and for the creation of a socially just, a Socialist, society in Britain. A socially-just society based on mutual co-operation means this. It means the achievement of a policy which holds infla­tion in check while ensuring full employment and higher real incomes. It means increasing real incomes both by rising family wages and by a rising social wage, both of them.When we came to power in 1964 we had, ready worked out, policies which would go far towards curing our social ills. But, because the facts had been concealed from the nation, we had not realised the magnitude of the economic problem we were to be left with, how it would dominate our lives and, for many years, almost every act of Government. We did not realise how much longer it would take for our policies to be effective.And we did not have a prior agreement between the incoming Government and the wider Labour Movement on our mutual responsibilities one to another.With such an agreement, whatever the difficulties, we would have been in an immeasurably stronger position and the inter­national brotherhood of money-makers would have found it difficult to penetrate the joint front of Trade Unions and Labour Govern­ment working together.This is not a problem for Britain alone, even if Conservative divisive politics in Britain have driven it further and further from realisation.It is a problem which now dominates the life of every advanced industrial country.Behind the world currency crisis this is the dominant problem. At an industrial relations conference in New York last May I tried to lay down the conditions of a solution, namely,\u2026 a voluntary compact between Government and industry - both sides of industry - in which the Government can go forward boldly with economic policies necessary to increase production, knowing that this need not lead to inflation so long as it could count on industrial co-operation and restraint.This is a reality we all recognise as funda­mental to the future. When we, as we are pledged, assert the repeal of the Conservative Government\u2019s legalistic, inhuman and funda­mentally unworkable Industrial Relations Act, we are pledged equally to discussions between the political and industrial wings of our Movement on the voluntary means of strengthening industrial relations, and elimi­nating the causes of industrial tension.It means more. Last year at Conference I said that before long we should have to get together to work out a mutually agreed policy. I said \u2018the time is not yet\u2019 - the trade union movement had a difficult confrontation to face. And I know how difficult it is for them to think in these terms when they are facing the day-to-day problems and the day-to-day injustices of the free market economy. Of course we recognise that their first respon­sibility is to defend their members in the problems created by this free market economy. But if we as a Labour Government are to get rid of these injustices, we have to begin now to reach an understanding.A year ago the time was \u2018not yet\u2019 - this year we must accept that the meetings must soon begin. Those of us on both sides charged with this responsibility will fail Conference, and still more the millions whom we represent as delegates, if we are not soon meeting and working out the conditions of that essential mutual compact between us. This means Party and Trade Unions working together, speaking as one. We have not always succeeded in this. If we are to succeed, if we are to make a reality of the Socialist society which is, and always has been, our common objective, it means not only that the Party in Opposition and in Government must under­stand the problems of the Unions and their members. It means equally that the Unions must accept the economic realities and under­stand the political responsibilities we face in Government.For, as we have learnt, there are not only trade union members, there are their wives. And if the harsh realities of Conservative Government have driven them into a common determination to get rid of the Tories, we have to use that determination to forge a common policy, Party and unions, to ensure that higher wages are reconciled with stable prices, that we do not set the worker as producer, the worker as consumer, at one another\u2019s throat, that they are one family. Again, and here the Document we debate tomorrow charts the way, we have to estab­lish the parameters of our policy for extending public ownership.Let one thing be clear. The Conservatives fall over themselves to hand over public assets to provide profits for their friends.Where they pillage, we will restore.In making their petty calculations let them realise that every publicly-owned asset the Conservatives sell off to their friends will be restored to the public and every speculator who enters the field, attracted by quick profits, will burn his fingers. They have been warned. (Applause)But to restore the status quo is not, of itself, advance.It\u2019s a sad thought that so much of the legis­lation of the first two years of the next Labour Government will be of an anti-vandalistic character - but it will be carried through simultaneously with measures to extend the area of public ownership, as the N.E.C. document makes clear.Just as - if we are to attack our endemic problem of declining investment - we shall re­assert the principle of industrial intervention.We shall establish a State Holding Agency on the lines of the I.R.C. - but writ large this time, and with a clearer power to ensure that where society invests in private industry, society will stake a claim in the profits.Just as we shall re-enact the Industrial Expansion Act, the Shipbuilding Industry Act, and the investment grant system for industrial regeneration and regional regenera­tion alike.This Conference begins, and next year\u2019s will carry forward, the Movement\u2019s preparations of the policies the incoming Labour Govern­ment will carry through.We are proud of what the Labour Government of 1964-70 achieved, in the face of what our opponents left us with, and their con­tinuing irresponsibility in the face of all we had to do.We are proud that we made so much pro­gress in mobilising the resources of Britain, for Britain as a nation, for the people of Britain as a community, and for those who needed our help abroad.Now we have seen all we sought to achieve put sharply into reverse with a Government seeking not the welfare of a people but a system of society characterised by the smart young men of the unit trusts, in a land fit for profiteers and speculators to live in.For, as we have seen, the free market philosophy has meant the devaluation of the family, of its standard of living, its security, the well-being of young and old.Consider it: free milk abolished; school dinners dearer; the threat to abolish children\u2019s half-fares; and the dole for the school-leavers. What have they got against children? (Laughter).For the young married couples wanting to buy their own home: rocketing prices placing a new house ever beyond their grasp.For the average family in Britain which rents a home, a future of soaring rents, beginning in April for Council tenants.For the middle-income families too; higher health charges, fares, the insurance stamp and the rest have ensured that the gain from direct tax cuts has been more than wiped out by the loss through indirect tax increases.And all this does not take into account that scandalous rise in food and other prices since the Tories came to power.For the old, pensions totally inadequate to meet living costs; last month\u2019s belated increase already nearly wiped out by Tory inflation.It is more than just a truism to call our nation a family, because a stable society is a family composed of families.Place the individual family under strain and stress and you impose those strains and stresses upon society.This is what we have to fight. And we shall not fight it by speeches in Conference; or on the multi-tasselled fringe of Conference, by resolutions, or amendments or card votes.This Movement must now unite. Still more it must fight as it has never fought before - not just against the consequences of Tory rule, but against the whole basis of Tory policy, a policy based on a doctrine which is essentially evil.That is why I am calling this Movement, now, to fight back and to fight back as one people, against all that we have condemned this week, and those who created it.First, I call on all my colleagues in the Parliamentary Party to unite, spearhead the attack on the Conservatives on the wide, exposed front of Tory policy and administration. We have no room for passengers or faint-hearts. It has been said many times at our Conferences, but it is as true now as ever.There is not one Labour Member of Parlia­ment who could have been elected by his own efforts. He is where he is because of the efforts and dedication of thousands upon thousands of those represented by delegates here today. And he is elected to be in his place and to do the job he was sent to do.Reading about this Conference you would think it\u2019s only about one thing. How X or Y or Z is going to vote on 28 October. Con­ference has declared its voice on that by \u2018inviting\u2019 members to follow its decision.But 28 October is not an end but a be­ginning. And the whole Parliamentary Party will fight against the mass of consequential legislation, main legislation, subordinate legislation, statutory instruments, Orders in Council which the Government will endeavour to force through.I cannot imagine a single Labour Member who, faced with this legislation, will not be in the lobbies against the Government. Every bill, every clause, every order will lay down the conditions under which every family in Britain will live, work, shop for its needs, sell its labour, for years, generations to come. And that same spirit must inspire the fight against every measure the Tories rely on to fashion Britain along the lines their selfish philosophy requires.Second, I call on this Movement through the constituency parties to carry this fight to the people. Not in local or by-elections only, but all the year round. Educate, teach, argue, organise. Get rid of our reliance on exclusive and select groups. Reach outwards. In every constituency create an integrated relationship with the trade unions and their members. We want an active political/industrial fighting organisation in every city and town, every constituency, every ward and village. Fight back there and feed back here.Third, I call on our trade union members to ensure that what we are seeking by consul­tation and comradeship at national level becomes equally a reality at local level. There is a Tory legend that we don\u2019t need an electoral organisation because we\u2019ve organised the factories. We need both, and above all I want to see our industrial movement, through branches, lodges, factories and workplaces, part of our local Labour democracy.Fourth, I call on our councillors to recognise that they are members of one move­ment. To that small minority, described 16 years ago in the Wilson Report, whose active electioneering occurs once every three years - and they are a minority - I offer you the luxury of otium cum dignitate - the dignity and respect of a leisured, but early, retirement. But to the majority, preoccupied as they must be by local problems, remember that the immediate battleground in the fight against Tory social policies lies in the council chamber, the education, health, housing committees.When the Tories took control of the councils in the late 60\u2019s they set up a high command in Central Office to enlist their local representatives in a co-ordinated fight against the Labour Government.I do not ask this; we believe in local democracy. But we have the right and the duty to co-ordinate. As a first step, I propose to call to London the leaders of all the major Labour local authorities to work out together our strategy.After that, the leaders of Labour groups in the other major boroughs. More effective regional organisation must be established for the smaller councils. Parliamentary Labour Party, Constituency Parties, Trade Unions, Councillors - all united, as never before. This Movement is arrayed against power, not popular, but the power of wealth and privilege, the power of the press and P.R.; an insolent power, asserted now as it has not been in our lifetime for the perpetuation of economic power.This Movement was created by humble men, proud men, who in their generation fought a more powerful and cruel - though not a more arrogant - establishment, and fought it because they dreamed of a better world. We, who exist only through the heritage which was their gift to us, are here to express our resolve to fight back against a vulgar establishment, effete in all save their ability to manipulate the levers of power.To fight with one asset greater by far than all they control, the power of people who care, who care enough to go forward from here, united, militant, determined to insist that those who create the wealth and influence of this nation, shall inherit that wealth, and, inheriting it, use it to create a greater Britain than we have ever known.

aVMr. Chairman, Fellow Delegates, before I come to my main report to Conference there are three immediate issues to which I feel I must give priority.The first is the deepening tragedy in Northern Ireland. After the Darlington Conference we seem further than ever from a peaceful, democratic settlement, and even the Government have deferred making their own proposals for another three months. In these past weeks the situation has degenerated, and in both communities there is a real fear of civil war, with British troops perhaps caught in the crossfire.Against all the odds, we have to prove that violence will produce nothing but the seeds of future violence. Violence will never produce a united Ireland. All it can do is to destroy Ireland. It is not only that the democratic process is on trial. Democracy in our country is staked in a desperate race between the rule of reason and the rule of the gunman - on both sides now. Time is not on our side. Time has turned traitor.We put forward our proposals last Novem­ber. After months of delay the Government decided to put forward theirs. They included, as we had urged, a phased programme to end internment, and the transfer of security from Stormont to Westminster. When the Northern Ireland Government rejected these proposals, direct rule from Westminster was imposed. We supported that decision. Neither the Government nor we had sought direct rule, but we felt in honour bound to support the Government because direct rule had been forced on them by their acceptance of our conditions for a settlement. Regardless of any other political considerations we have supported their actions and we have supported the Army in the performance of a task with which no modern army has ever been charged by a democratic Government.But now we face deadlock, irreconcilable deadlock. In two years, more than 150 soldiers have lost their lives. My own constituency - and this is true of so many others here - has shared in this suffering. I have just written to a tragic mother, a constituent, who lost her 18-year-old son in an ambush. Now she is widowed by the subsequent suicide of the father. This tragedy is not in a far-away country of which we know nothing. It is here; and there is no escape for us.I fear a reaction which is growing, a demand that Britain withdraws her armed forces, a demand that, as too many are saying, \u2018Let them cut one another\u2019s throats.\u2019 This is understandable. It is not the answer.But - and on this I cannot remain silent - must our troops be subject to a virtually uncontrolled gun-law? On April 6, 1971, 18 months ago, in the anxious debate which followed the deposition of Major Chichester-Clark and the accession of Mr. Faulkner, I demanded that all gun licences be withdrawn, subject to a minimum issue for self-defence in remote areas, including the border. I demanded that, these apart, the holding of private weapons be no longer tolerated in Northern Ireland. (Applause) There are upwards of 100,000 licensed weapons in Northern Ireland, and God alone knows how many illegal ones.I now warn Mr. Heath. The possession of private arms is not an inalienable human right. Public opinion in Britain will not for long tolerate the continued presence of British troops, unless firm action is taken to make illegal the holding of private arms. (Applause)Add to that what is the law in our own country. Political uniforms must be banned - on both sides. (Applause)Second, I call now - after all these lost months - or all-party talks with an open agenda. And on that agenda we shall again table our fifteen-point programme, as other parties will table their proposals. There will be no solution which does not provide for consideration, not only in the North, but on a tripartite basis between the parties of West­minster, Belfast and Dublin of our proposals for common action to consider the implica­tions of a move spread over fifteen years to a United Ireland, based on consent, with the enactment and guarantee of full civic rights, and with full provision and protection of the religious, political, economic and social interests of all communities, majority and minority, in Northern Ireland and the wider Ireland. (Applause)The second issue is Uganda, which was debated yesterday. We have pledged to the Government our support for their policy on the Uganda Asians, and for their reaction to the obscenity of Uganda\u2019s military dictator.Looking back a little further, I could have wished that Downing Street had not accepted with such evident satisfaction the military coup which deposed President Obote in January 1971. (Applause) But then that occurred during Milton Obote\u2019s return from the Commonwealth Conference in Singapore, where he had had the effrontery to oppose Mr. Heath\u2019s policy of arms for South Africa. (Applause) Mr. Heath cast his bread upon the waters and it was returned in the un­pleasing shape of General Amin.But in this situation, as our front bench spokesman made clear as soon as Mr. Rippon had returned from Kampala, we accept the implications of the obligation which successive British Governments have accepted. Holders of British passports have the right, if excluded from their home country, to residence here. We shall support the Government in their implementation of a policy which was theirs and ours. We shall support them too - as the N.E.C. statement has made clear - in every step necessary to prevent a still further con­centration on areas whose social resources, in the widest sense, are strained to the utmost; in the longest possible phasing in time; and the widest possible distribution by area; and in the provision of maximum financial aid for the areas affected.The Government will have our support in Parliament. I am aware of the thunderings from one part of Wolverhampton, which will be treated with the contempt I have always accorded them. (Applause) Mr. Heath has his Party problems; this is not one of ours. Powell without responsibility; the prerogative of the Enoch throughout the ages. (Laughter) So let Mr. Heath deal with him. After all, 15 of his Parliamentary seats in the Midlands - 30 on a division, more than his overall majority - he owes to Mr. Powell. You should be here next week. (Laughter)We have been ready to support the Govern­ment on these two issues, but we have not been able to do so on Rhodesia. For Mr. Heath was committed to surrender the interests of this country, and our deeper, wider moral responsibilities to the majority in Rhodesia, to surrender all that to the dictates of his right wing, to which he has been too prone, throughout his leadership, to bow the knee. We condemned the unacceptable terms of his Salisbury surrender as soon as they were published, and then the results of the test of the fifth principle - acceptability to the people of Rhodesia as a whole confirmed our condem­nation, as it confirmed the rightness of our action in insisting on all the principles we laid down. Mr. Heath should tell his conference here next week that the Smith-Home agreement is dead. He should stop his Government\u2019s equivocation that it rests on the table \u2018until it is accepted.\u2019 For he knows that in Rhodesia that phrase means \u2018until every articulate leader of African opinion is behind bars.\u2019I now move the Parliamentary Report for the second session of this Parliament - thanks to Mr. Heath, the Gagged Parliament.Just as in the first session legislation centred on such obsessional Tory preoccupations as school milk and the Industrial Relations Act, so this one has seen Mr. Heath\u2019s railroading of the Housing Finance Bill, the Scottish Housing Finance Bill, and - a measure without precedent in the centuries since autocracy yielded place to democracy - the totally anti-constitutional, anti-democratic European Communities Bill. (Applause) All of these three under guillotine, of course. It has become a routine instrument of Mr. Heath\u2019s style of Government.Last Thursday, Mr. Heath, in Nottingham, referring to the need for a policy against inflation, said this: \u2018It is what the whole country longs for.\u2019 He went on: \u2018The people of this country have had enough of inflation.\u2019 \u2018The people of this country have had enough\u2019 period. We have it on the authority of, of all people, the architect of the inflation which the British people are suffering.He spoke, he said, \u2018as the Government elected to represent the whole nation.\u2019 The whole nation.Two years ago, on the day he formed a Government, he pledged himself in these words: \u2018Our purpose is not to divide but to unite and where there are differences to bring about reconciliation and to create one nation.\u2019That pledge he has deliberately broken, and that is why the. British people \u2018have had enough.\u2019Whatever contradictions and policy-re­versals we have seen without shame, without a blush, on one thing Mr. Heath has shown utter consistency, and let us not here rob him of his laurels. He has shown utter and syste­matic consistency in the breach of the solemn pledges, without which the Conservatives would never have become the Government. (Applause) His pledge on prices - on which, and on which alone, he won the election - has been so utterly dishonoured that the British people as a whole can form only one judge­ment. It is not that his policies have led to a regime of price inflation in total contradiction to his pledges. That could have been dis­missed as incompetence.But what the British people now realise is that all his pledges on prices and the cost of living were made by a man who knew when he made them that they could not be honoured. (Applause) So it is not a question of in­competence - it is a question of deliberate, calculated deceit. (Applause) And that, even more than incompetence, has been the dis­tinguishing, continuing feature equally of his Government.Mr. Heath will go down in history with this unique achievement. He has proved all the experts wrong, because for generations classical wisdom has taught that if you have inflation you do not have unemployment. We have been taught if you have unemployment - enough unemployment - you will end in­flation. He presides today over a system of economic society where we have record inflation and record post- war unemployment at one and the same time. Rising prices, rising living costs - rising now at a yet faster rate - and registered unemployment still close to the million mark, real unemployment substantially above the million. In the forecast we read in the paper this morning by an authoritative body, unemployment may rise to a million and a quarter next February.Now, faced with this inflation, he is appeal­ing to both sides of industry to bail him out. What last week he offered the nation amounted to a total confession of failure. They are not only an abject admission that his election promises were a fraud, they are a confession that his policies over two years have been totally misdirected - his policies of fighting inflation by deliberately raising prices, and acting on incomes by deliberately staged confrontations with the trade unions.Last Tuesday was not a step forward; it was an acknowledgement of defeat - designed to draw a veil over all that Heath and the whole Selsdon package stand for, abrasive, petulant, divisive.By August, after 26 months in office, the cost of living under the Conservatives has risen by 18½ per cent; that means in old money the £ has lost three shillings of its value, in just over two years. We recall with contempt Mr. Heath\u2019s election scare that the sixpence minimum fare after three more years of Labour would be a shilling. The G:L.C. put it up to one shilling in two months. Under two years of the Tories some of those minimum fares are now replaced by a two shilling, ten pence minimum. We recall more with pity than with contempt the complacency of Mr. James Prior, the Food Minister, over all these food prices. Last year we had the scandal of cattle exports to Europe. At the height of the crisis at the beginning of June he blandly told Parliament that this should be only a temporary situation; it would soon pass with the home killings. That has not been the case. And now we are told that we must expect still higher beef prices in the future. It is a sign of the times when the Daily Mirror and the Daily Express are singing in close harmony. The Daily Mirror shopping clock on Saturday was up to a new record; up 23½ pence in the £ from November 1971. The Daily Express shopping list on the same day was up 27 pence in the £ since January 1971. If those two agree it must be right.Mr. Heath now talks as though inflation was uncovered at Chequers a week ago. Mr. Heath has been promoting inflation by a series of deliberate actions from the moment he became Prime Minister. He scrapped controls on prices. He scrapped the Prices and Incomes Board. He scrapped the Consumer Council. He scrapped Labour\u2019s Rent Control Acts. He introduced his own Act, the Housing Finance Act, to increase rents. He restored the Corn Laws. He introduced the food levies to force food prices up. He fell over himself to negotiate terms in Europe which will force all our food prices up to intolerable levels. (Applause) And just in case anything was left out by any chance, he enacted the Value Added Tax.All this time he was blaming increased prices on the trade union movement. And so we had the policy of the pitched battles and the set piece confrontations. I will not remind you of all of them. But, well, there was the dust­men and the other local authority manual workers. Edward\u2019s finest hour. He fought them on the beaches, on the hills, on the refuse heaps and the sewage farms, until our cities were reeking with the stink of rotting garbage. (Applause) The delicate perfume of the better tomorrow. (Applause) And he lost. Then we had the electricity workers, where Wilberforce snatched a defeat for him on the morrow of his highly publicised victory. Then there were the postmen. Ah, triumph was sweet; the bully had conquered the weak. And nothing would ever be the same again. You would see them all, miners, railway workers, engineers, dockers, bow the knee at his command.Two years ago at his Blackpool victory conference he claimed \u2018We were returned to office to change the course of history of this nation. Nothing less\u2026 It will not happen overnight. It may be there will be no day that you can mark on the calendar and say \u201cThat was Freedom Day.\u201d\u2019 So until he names the day let us now measure the industrial con­sequences of Mr. Edward Heath. In five years eight months of the Labour Government 24,045,000 man days were lost through industrial disputes. Too many we all agree. And we and the T.U. C. were working out means to reduce that toll. But in two years and two months of Mr. Heath, up to the end of August, against our 24,045,000 his Government has cost the country 42,665,000 man days lost through industrial stoppages. And in the eight months of this year alone he has lost 19,000,000 days, almost as many as the Labour Government\u2019s toll over close on six years. (Applause)And this year he has thrown a new spanner into the mechanism of industrial relations - ­N.I.R.C. Even a Morecambe and Wise send-up of the British legal system could never have produced a script in which the Secretary of State for Employment could solemnly submit to the Court, to N.I.R.C., that he had reason to think that the railwaymen of Britain did not agree with Sid Greene, Ray Buckton and Percy Goldrick, without having to produce evidence, either to the Court or to Parliament. And when the railwaymen of Britain gave their answer, 6 to 1, we had his considered judgement on the Industrial Relations Act, N.I.R.C., and he said - yes, yes, he actually, said this \u2013 \u2018All my recent evidence is that the legislation is succeeding beyond expectation in its first aim: to concentrate industry\u2019s mind on improving industrial relations.\u2019Had the Employment Secretary been Master of the Titanic - his last radio message would no doubt have been to the effect that he had succeeded in his main purpose of drawing attention to the study of Atlantic Meteorology and the problems of marine engineering. (Applause)But other references to the Court have thrown up a different kind of ignorance. What could that Court know of the anxieties of dockland in the face of the harsh and brutal technological change which has hit this industry as deeply as any other industry in Britain. Experienced trade union leaders here know about them. Many delegates in this hall know about them. Those of us who represent dockland seats in Parliament know about them. All of us know how formidable were the problems with which Jack Jones and Lord Aldington were faced. In the very week when the Jones-Aldington Report provided, a statesmanlike basis for peace in the docks - that Report was rejected by the Dockers\u2019 Delegate Conference, and it was rejected because of their anger at the gaoling of their fellow-dockers. There would have been, in my view, no dockers\u2019 strike but for the provocative and irrelevant intervention of the Industrial Relations Act and the National Industrial Relations Court. (Applause)But that is not all. On both the occasions when they were saved by the Official Solicitor the Government had a clear duty to act, and they were powerless to do so. A Government should never manoeuvre itself into the position that when it needs to act, and the interests of the country demand that it should act, that it is impotent, immobile, deprived of the power to act. That is the mark not of a Government, it is the mark of abdication, of impotence. When Britain elects its Government it does not intend that that Government, facing acute national emergency, especially if that is caused by its own doctrinaire actions, that that Government should be dependent on a mysterious legal functionary. Any more than it should have been the case, and it was the case, that the whole future of Rolls Royce and 50,000 workers depended not on a decision of the British Government at the end of the day but the maverick vote of a senator in Washing­ton, who fortunately voted the right way.N.I.R.C., industrial confrontations are the essence of the Conservatism of the seventies - of this Government, and above all of the Prime Minister. Ignorance - of industry and of people - a monastic unconcern, a monu­mental preoccupation only with Europe.But that is not all. The new style of Government he promised us here at Blackpool two years ago is its fatal facility for dividing this nation. Mr. Heath presides over a sick Government, which if it lasts much longer will start infecting the nation with its sickness. (Applause) It is the fault not of Britain, but of those who currently control Britain\u2019s destiny, that that is the image which is presented abroad.On the day he became Prime Minister, he pledged himself to create a united nation. A united nation. In education? Mrs. Margaret Thatcher\u2019s addiction to the veto in the face of opposition even from some Conservative authorities, has stopped the progress to equality of educational opportunity which just over two years ago appeared to be assured and accepted. In Mr. Heath\u2019s 1970 election manifesto he gave this pledge on behalf of a future Conservative Government.These were his words in the manifesto:\u2018On many issues, particularly in education and housing\u2019 \u2013 yes \u2013 \u2018Particularly in education and housing, they (the Labour Government) have deliberately overridden the views of elected councillors. We think it wrong that the balance of power between central and local Government should have been distorted, and we will redress the balance and increase the independence of local authorities.\u2019 (Laughter)That is what he said.But a Tory minority can sabotage the wishes of a whole community in the matter of equality of opportunity with ministerial blessing today. A few days ago there was a report that 64 per cent of the nation\u2019s children are still subject to some form of 11 plus selection. That would not have been the case today if Ted Short\u2019s comprehensive education Bill, going through Parliament in 1970, had been carried through. But freedom for local authorities? When Labour councillors were threatened with all the pains and penalties La Belle Dame Sans Merci could devise for them over school milk, including loss of civic rights if they presumed to discharge their responsibilities to the children of their areas by providing school milk to seven-year-olds?A united nation in old age. Dick Crossman\u2019s Superannuation Bill would have achieved this. Sir Keith Joseph\u2019s Bill is deliberately designed to perpetuate two nations in old age - favoured ones in private pension scheme; and seven millions outside private pension schemes condemned to permanent poverty.Labour in Parliament, the T.U.C., the National Council of Labour have fought without remission for justice for the pensioner. 75p - 15s. - is all he can offer, at a time of accelerating price increases in a society characterised by class-based tax remissions, and the emancipation of the land and property profiteer. All he can offer - 75p - in a society where to him that hath shall be given, a society where the favoured are not the creators of the nation\u2019s wealth, or the past creators of the nation\u2019s wealth, but the possessors of the nation\u2019s wealth.And now, his latest destructive blow against the \u2018one nation\u2019 philosophy, the pinnacle of his achievement. This week, even as we met in Blackpool, the Housing Finance Act came into force. Whom the gods wish to destroy, they first make mad - by persuading them to invite the trade unions to enter into discussions about inflation, and then to slap the unions and their members in the face with a calculated increase in the rents of millions of families. (Applause)It is not only council house and new town rents. Labour, within months of taking office in 1964, repealed the previous Tory Rent Act and restored control of private rents. Mr. Heath\u2019s Act will mean that private tenants, no less than council tenants, will now have to pay more. When Mr. Heath says \u2018Fair rents\u2019 he means higher rents. And to encourage the alternative of home ownership they have succeeded in raising the cost of an average house by a rate of 45 per cent since they came into office. Though if you live in the Eastern region it has risen by 58 per cent - this is existing houses - where there is no element of increased cost of building. In the Southern region it has risen by 67 per cent and in the South-East by 71 per cent. In the first half of this year the average price of a new house was rising at an annual rate of 34 per cent, and of an existing house by 36 per cent.Now these cases, the Housing. Finance Bill and the Scottish Housing Finance Bill, like the Industrial Relations Bill and the European Communities Bill, were railroaded through Parliament by gagging debate.That is not, of course, all they have in common. Just as the Industrial Relations Actwas drafted so as to close the door to industrial democracy, and the European Communities Bill was drafted so as to deny the exercise of Parliamentary democracy, so the Housing  Finance Acts are proofed against any possible exercise of local democracy. I quoted Mr. Heath\u2019s manifesto pledge to the local authorities. That is not all he said. In the election campaign he had this to say as well. I quote him. These are his words out of his mouth:The most urgent reform of local government is, to get the Government spanner out of the works. Under Labour there can never be real reform of local government for they will always seek to use their powers to bend the local authorities to their will. It will be for a Conservative Government to restore to the local elector and the local councillor the freedom of action he needs to make life better for himself and his fellow citizens and to control his own destiny and that of his community.All this he said. This is what he won votes on.How was that promised freedom given reality? By watertight statutory provisions, by the denial of local responsibility, by the threats of surcharges, by the deprivation of civic rights, and rights as a citizen, and if all that fails the imposition on an elected author­ity of Mr. Heath\u2019s housing commissars, who have taxing powers as well. The Tories have wrecked; on all these things the Tories have wrecked. We will rebuild. The Labour Party on its return to power will take urgent action.Industrial relations; we have said we will sweep away the Industrial Relations Act. (Applause) The Joint Committee of the Labour Party and the T.U.C. have agreed on the procedures on the timing and the precise provisions which will be required, and to do this we shall have an unequivocal mandate. With the Act, N.I.R.C. and all its costly infrastructure will be consigned to oblivion and that talented judge redeployed to more productive work. (Applause)Education; we shall by law remove the tyranny and indignity of the 11-plus (Applause) and, as Ted Short made clear a few days ago in his speech about privilege, our priority will be to ensure a fair start in life for those children who have been held back in their earliest formative years by family circumstances, by bad housing and by family poverty.On housing, I repeat what was said yesterday; we shall repeal the Housing Finance Act and the Scottish Housing Finance Act. We shall introduce new and comprehensive housing legislation and Labour\u2019s Programme for Britain sets out the line on which we are of working, added to by the discussions yesterday. The improvement grant racket will be of dealt with, so will property speculation and the scandal of empty premises. Under the Tories, Centre Point would be likely to be scheduled as an ancient monument before it is either occupied at reasonable rents or paying penal rates for non-use. Above all, we shall have a social policy for the land, and to this I will come later. (Applause)           There can be no road to national agreement, national unity, on a policy adequate for dealing with inflation and unemployment except on a basis of social justice. Mr. Heath, after two years\u2019 presidency of the inflationary society, is now groping his way forward in the darkness with nought to guide him but  the flickering light of his P.R. advisers,  because he refuses to create the conditions in which a national effort to fight inflation can be forthcoming. He asks for sacrifices but he must know that the first sacrifices must be those of a blinkered and selfish Conservative ideology which stands in the way of a national approach by the whole community.Today I challenge Mr. Heath because I am going to set out the conditions - the conditions which must be guaranteed by any government of any party with the real will to unite the nation in an attack on inflation and unemployment.Mr. Heath asks, nay, demands, a tight curb on increases in wages and salaries and offers in return to seek a limit on rising prices in the shops, on all the burdens which fall on an average family. But Mr. Heath knows that he cannot guarantee to hold prices to an increase of just 5 per cent over the next year. He cannot hold them to 5 per cent. He knows that food prices are rising at a rapid rate. His policies have been designed to this end and those policies at least are working. He knows - even Mr. Prior must have told him - what is in store for the prices of meat, for bread, for bacon, for coffee and other foods. He knows how his June devaluation is increasing the price of food and raw materials. The C.B.I. know that they cannot provide any binding undertaking which will set the price in the supermarkets. The CBI can use their influence over the price of a wide range of manufactured goods and components. But even a successful policy holding down the manufactured goods wholesale price index - even total success in keeping down the price of ball bearings and biros will not of itself hold prices down in the High Street, and to pretend otherwise is to offer the British people a false prospectus. Mr. Heath sets his limit for wage increases when he knows he cannot deliver on prices in the High Street, and he cannot deliver because his free market policies, his food levies - and above all his European Policies - and his V.A.T. - have already set the price pattern for the months, perhaps even for the years, ahead.Of course, it is popular to proclaim a policy aimed at restraining prices. It will be when he once again has to confess failure that reality will set in.There is no doubt that if Canute had produced a grandiose plan for a sea wall implanted in shifting sands his courtiers would have dutifully cheered. No doubt his people would have cheered - cheered, that is, until the sea seeped in, and through, and round, and the whole edifice crashed in ruins.Mr. Heath\u2019s new sea wall against the tide of inflation is already hailed as a triumph of civil engineering - until it is built. (Laughter) Until a spring tide of rising prices, rents, rates, created by Mr. Heath\u2019s own policies, swollen by his tidal bore from Europe, comes, silent, flooding in the main.Mr. Heath knows he cannot deliver on prices. But I think he knows also the conditions of any comprehensive policy. I told him actually what they were. In the Parliamentary debate on devaluation last June, and in the debate on industrial relations in early July, I told him the minimum conditions of success in the meetings he had set in hand with the T.U.C. and the C.B.I. \u2013 \u2018The T.U.C. pro­posals for a threshold, price-related wage arrangement; Government exercised control of strategic prices, and of the remuneration of top people, as well as of rents and dividends, the restoration of the Consumer Council, the repeal of food levies, the dropping of the Housing Finance Acts; the control of land prices and property speculation, the repeal or the sterilising of the Industrial Relations Act, and a moratorium on the value added tax.\u2019I told him all that - (Laughter) - and I told him that in the House in two debates in a week and the whole Parliamentary Labour Party - yes, the whole Parliamentary Labour Party - voted for it.When Mr. Heath now seeks to involve public opinion in favour of his £2 a week policy, he has a duty to say exactly what this will mean as a result of his Government\u2019s policies. He has a duty to say what a £2 pay rise would mean for workers caught in the poverty trap.The Financial Times last Thursday quoted U.S.D.A.W.\u2019s calculations about lower paid workers - a married man, earning £18, with one child and living in a council house, with rent and rates responsibilities of £5.90 a week, would actually be 39p worse off with a £2 pay rise. If he was earning £23 he would only gain 11p from the £25 he would then be getting, while if he had two children and was on £19 and that was raised to £21 he would be 20p worse off.For any Government, in any democracy, the first condition of success is a. sufficient degree of trust between the Government and those to whom the appeal is made. (Applause) Mr. Heath, for his part, has forfeited any claim to such trust.So what are the conditions for a viable policy to fight inflation? I will list them, those which I feel are the right answer in this or a similar crisis situation. There must be effective safeguards to ensure that shop prices and all other prices and charges affecting the cost of living are held to the required amount. Local authority and new town rents must be kept within the permitted price limit. When Mr. Heath in Parliament was lauding the C.B.I. 5 per cent restraint policy, I asked him if he would guarantee to keep council rents within the 5 per cent limit over the next year. He refused to give any promise, but when we pressed him he gave us his calculations. He said, \u2018No, they are going to go up by 7 per cent,\u2019 but that was an average for local authority tenants and private tenants who come rather later into the picture; on our calculations the likely figure is somewhere between 13 and 14 per cent net. So Mr. Heath must act to stop the operations of the Housing Finance Acts if he wants to make this appeal. (Applause)The same limit must apply to rents charged by private landlords for the duration. Rates, over the nation as a whole, must also be held within the prescribed limit, and for this purpose make full use of the powers granted \u2013 Labour\u2019s domestic rate subsidy legislation.Next, speculation in land and property deals. For the duration of any incomes proposals, all capital gains from land and property over the permitted level must be subject to an excess profits levy; though the owner-occupier\u2019s residence would be exempt from these arrangements. (Applause)Incomes and price restraint must be accompanied by dividend restraint. To pre­vent the retention of undistributed dividends for future distributions an appropriate proportion of retained profits should be put into the National Workers\u2019 Capital Fund proposed in \u2018Labour\u2019s Programme for Britain.\u2019 (Applause)There must be no discrimination against the public sector in wages and salaries. (Prolonged applause) Public sector price increases, including fares, must be held down to the limit set, and for this purpose, as we have repeatedly demanded, appropriate ad­justments must be made in the financial relations between Government and public industry. Action must be taken on V.A.T.; action must be taken to increase pensions substantially above their present intentions. (Applause)These are some of the necessary conditions of a crisis anti-inflationary programme such as Mr. Heath has been driven into talking about, but we have to look to a broader and more lasting solution.Mr. Heath makes an appeal for rigorous restrictions in wages, yet next week in this hall he will be boasting about the tax cuts he has made over the last two years. He says now, \u2018Not more than £2 a week for anybody,\u2019 \u2018Not more than £2 a week increase,\u2019 and that is subject to deductions, if an hour is taken off the working week. For a worker on the near average pay of say £1,500 a year, £2 a week more. But an executive or professional man on £15,000 a year has already received through the budget a reduction of £1,500 a year by a cut in his taxes, and that means he receives now an increase in take-home pay of £30 per week, without a penny increase in his earnings. If he borrows from his bank for, say, the stock exchange or land speculation, the interest on his borrowing is now once again charged against income, reducing his tax liability.Executives in industry can get a large supplementary bonus in stock options; family income now once again can be divided by excluding the children of wealthy families from the family tax computation, so that the total tax paid by the family is reduced. A man living on unearned income with £20,000 a year will gain £1,652 in increased spending money, and that is over £30 a week.Now, there can be no lasting understanding, and I am looking now to the broader problems of the future, not Mr. Heath\u2019s crisis, there can be no lasting understanding between Government and labour unless and until such policies are halted and reversed. Mr. Heath\u2019s statement has given \u2018Labour\u2019s Programme for Britain\u2019 a new impetus, and has still greater relevance, because in its economic, as in its social policies, it provides the means to the socially just community which alone can provide the power base for a policy against inflation and against unemployment, and against the social evils of modern urban society. If I pick out just one which is relevant to this kind of society, in which we can have an all-community understanding, it must be the subject of land. This lasting solution must cover the problem of land. We pay respect to Lord Silkin\u2019s valiant, if complex efforts in 1947. If the Conservative Govern­ment had not rejected it when they came back into office in 1951, we should not have seen the land and the property boom of the \u201950s and \u201960s on which we, in part, fought the election of 1964. I believe the Land Com­mission, our Land Commission, was the most comprehensive attack on the problems so far attempted; it was beginning to work, and prices were falling in the later months of our government, but this was too late, and the reason was the inadequate zoning of land for development which the Commission could take into public ownership.Well, we have all thought again, and it is no secret. There are never leaks from the Executive, as you know, but at least it does not seem to be a secret that I proposed to the National Executive last May that there was no solution to this problem without taking into public ownership all the land required in this century for urban development, (Applause.) and at existing use values. Conference went on record yesterday in support of this.In my view, and this we must all consider when we come to work out the details, land required for urban development alone may not be enough. Delegates for rural constitu­encies here will confirm the existence of a racket in agricultural land. There are different explanations: a hedge against inflation; a stake in the country; the advantage of favourable estate duties on agricultural property; or a desire that the higher farm prices which the Common Market will bring must accrue in higher rents to those who make money by owning farm land rather than those who earn money by working farm land.Whatever the reasons, land which is unlikely ever to get planning permission is now escalating in value. I recently read a responsible Conservative newspaper which said that any young man with farming experience who wanted to buy his own farm and set up on his own account should either have recently inherited a large fortune from a deceased relative or should win the pools. (Laughter)There is another factor. When the Government panicked on rising unemployment they pumped money into the economy. Their much vaunted tax concessions owe nothing to the economies in public expenditure they said would be so easy. Public expenditure had risen at a record rate. Tax handouts and no less bank lending increasing in recent months at an annual rate of 30 per cent went not into a jobs boom: it went partly, of course into an imports boom, but an inordinately high proportion of the new money went into land and property.It is elementary economics that while money going into capital can increase to supply fixtures and equipment, while money going into jobs can increase the demand for labour, money pumped into the purchase of the scarce commodity of land cannot create more land, it can only increase its price.In human terms, it means a heavy burden on those who are trying to buy a house. There is not a delegate here who does not know someone - son, daughter, neighbour - who has not been gazumped out of the house for which they have painfully saved by what is ultimately the effects of land price inflation.And in social terms, too, we have the other side of the Tory medal. I quote that impartial social observer and anthropologist, M. William Hickey of the Daily Express (Laughter) on Saturday, May 6, under the headline \u2018What a Swell Party Year This Is.\u2019 He went on: \u2018As shares soar and land prices boom, the rich in Britain suddenly realise they can actually afford to enjoy themselves for the first time in years.\u2019 (Laughter) Look what we did. \u2018I can,\u2019 he says, \u2018safely forecast the most sparkling profusion of parties and entertainments for many a season.\u2019 He proceeds to list some of the more spectacular, but I am not going to give them publicity. Such is the kingdom of Heath. (Laughter and applause.) And in that kingdom, you know, there are going to be some glamorous coming out parties on £2 a week! (Laughter and applause)Mr. Heath, of course, smoothly blamed every price increase on unions and wages. I challenged him, without any reply so far - we may hear it next week - to explain how the doubling in a year, or not much more than a year, of the price of a house built in the 1890s is due to wages. I want him to explain this. I want him to take the case of the house in Hammersmith that we heard about recently from the leader of the council, which ex­changed hands 12 times in a year, or more. Twelve times it had been empty - All the time it had been empty, but each time going up in price. I do not see - perhaps he can tell me - how this could be due to wages, because I think a posthumous increase in the wages of a long-dead London building craftsman is difficult to sustain. (Laughter)As for the increase in farm land prices, even he can hardly blame that on the farm workers\u2019 wages of £16.20 per week. (Applause)But the escalation of land prices is a cancer of our Tory society. Our policy is simple. Values created not by private merit but by the development of the community belong not in part but in whole to the community which created them, and so it must be, and that will be our policy. And, as we learned, equally we must assert the rights of the community equally to the minerals under our soil. It is a reflection on all of us that we know so little about the wealth on which we are sitting. We cannot leave this to private enterprise. Environmental considerations alone require that the State, and only the State, should decide the balance as between the mineral development and the safeguarding of our natural heritage. (Applause)I have gone on longer than I meant. I want to finish with this.Mr. Heath\u2019s crisis cannot be solved within the rigidities of his policy and his prejudices. The nation has known for a year, and he has at last been compelled to concede, that there is a crisis. What he refuses to recognise is that this is a continuing crisis now for Britain. Whatever short-term experiments may be tried it is a continuing crisis which requires a fundamental and lasting understanding be­tween Government and the creators of the nation\u2019s wealth. This is a crisis that any government now in Britain will have to face. Mr. Heath cannot, and will not, take the broader economic and social measures to resolve this crisis. He has had his opportunity. Two years ago it was here in Blackpool that he told the country how he intended to use it, and now his failure is apparent even to him.But what we here must realise is that the events of last week have created a new challenge to this Movement. It is a challenge that I believe this Conference is preparing to meet, because what happened last week means now that the Labour Movement, and only the Labour Movement, can deal with this situation. (Applause) Mr. Heath knows that. His snarling at the trade union movement now gives place to more dulcet wooing tones, because he is looking to the unions to find a way out for him. Whatever his intention I can say this, I hope. Mr. Heath has now given a new impetus in the talks between Labour\u2019s leadership and the leadership of the Trades Union Congress. It will be the desire of this Conference this week to make clear its hope and determination that that accord will be real and effective. Whatever short-term amelioration of this crisis may be possible, whatever poultices may be applied or who applies, them, the continuing crisis now is not going to be relieved except - it is not going to be resolved, above all, except - by a general election. (Applause) This may not be what Mr. Heath is seeking. He hopes, I think, to seek to avoid it. But among his advisers are those who would want him to negotiate with the unions by preparing to blame them for any breakdown; to follow in fact the posture of the Japanese war lords who, while negotiating for peace, were planning Pearl Harbour.We here are united in the belief that the British people should now have the right to decide in a general election. We said that in our resolution last year, the resolution on the Common Market, calling on him to submit the Market and all its other policies to the arbitrament of the British people.So, a general election on Europe, yes - we have all called for that - but, still more, on the measures needed to restore the strength of Britain to play our full part in the world whatever happens in Europe. When the election comes is not for us, here to decide. But the very nature of the crisis Mr. Heath has inflicted upon Britain throws upon this Conference a responsibility some of us might not have foreseen even a week ago.The responsibility which this Movement now has to assume is not going to be an easy one. The task we are going to have to face, perhaps very soon, perhaps later, is growing week by week. We have now to speed our preparations for a crisis whose nature and depth Mr. Heath has concealed from the nation and which we shall have to resolve.I believe that delegates came to this conference with a deeper sense of underlying unity than we have known for many years. (Cries of \u2018Hear, Hear\u2019 and applause) And there will be no-one now who will seek to imperil that unity in the face of the challenge, of the opportunity above all, presented to us and the challenge facing this nation.I believe that when we go from here we shall go with that unity strengthened, but not only that, we shall go with the backing of the whole Labour Movement and that backing will sustain us in all we have to do (Standing ovation.)

aVMr. Chairman, I beg to move the Parliamentary Report. This has been a session of great intensity covering the mounting and increasingly obvious demoralisation of the Government.The total reversal of incomes policy; Stages I and II of the Government\u2019s statu­tory prices and incomes shambles; the collapse of the Government's economic policies; the breakdown of the Government\u2019s housing policy.There have been the almost endless Northern Ireland debates; the debates on the Common Market, as month by month we have reaped the bitter fruits of the. Government\u2019s entry terms. But what we have been concerned with is not related to these islands only. Yesterday I called on this conference to accept a new dimension in internal policies. If we are really to dare to accept the measures necessary to create one nation, one community, one family, this cannot be inward looking, nationalistic, xenophobic, whether we are inward looking within our own coasts or inward looking within a West European campus.In these past three years we have seen the horizons of this country not expanding, but shrinking; a Prime Minister who re­fuses to attempt to give a lead to a Com­monwealth and only seems to be fidgeting in his chair to get away; a Foreign Secretary incapable of peering beyond his vision of a reconstructed concert of Europe. Let it at least be said in defence of Metternich that the Holy Alliance itself was never under French patronage. A Government insensi­tive and protocolaire about the brutalities of Chile\u2019s counter-revolution; a Govern­ment whose view of the open seas to the West of us is limited to the thought that they provide a means of shipping military jets via the United States to a Spain that denies freedom to her own people and seeks to enslave the people of Gibraltar.We censored a few weeks ago the Govern­ment over the Mozambique massacres and their wining and dining of the Portuguese dictator. We have been proved right. We have restated the role of Britain in the world fight for freedom. A century ago that fight was in Europe. Today it is in Africa and the wider third world, and we have welcomed to this Conference repre­sentatives of those who are leading the fight for freedom in Africa and elsewhere. (Applause)If a century ago Palmerston, Gladstone and Disraeli could see that Britain\u2019s interest meant a breach with the ancient empires and the support of national revolutionaries in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal, can­not the present rulers of this country see that not only the moral future of Britain but its real interests are bound up with the support of freedom movements in Southern Africa? There may be African freedom fighters who would appear incon­gruous in a Belgravian drawing room, but I guess Garibaldi and Kossuth did not bath twice a day either.Our debates that we have had on the state of the nation, on prices and incomes policy - the Government have rejected all the advice the Labour movement has given them: our own debate here a year ago, the TUC\u2019s warnings. We warned - both of us - that unless they tackled prices, unless they countermanded the rent increases for which they had legislated and which this week hit the council tenant yet again, unless they helped the lower paid, unless they lifted the standard of living of the pen­sioners, unless they included within their freeze and in Stage II protection for the owner-occupier, unless they brought all these requirements into their policy, their proposals would fail: fail because they were unworkable, unworkable because they were fundamentally unjust.But when last November, in defiance of a score of categorical election pledges, Mr. Heath proclaimed a total statutory incomes freeze he did not deal with food prices. It was a total wage freeze but not a freeze on rents, a total salary freeze but not a freeze on mortgage interest rates. He did not increase pensions, but he increased the burden on the lower-paid. His achievement \u2013 his first achievement - was to create anomalies affecting some of our most poorly rewarded industries and services - the farm-workers, local authority manual workers, gas workers, civil servants and others.He rejected the Parliamentary Labour Party\u2019s demands for action to protect these groups. He preferred to await the report of a Pay Board which had not been set up, under a Statute that had not been intro­duced into Parliament and which, when it was established, would not be answerable to Parliament.A year after our warnings here, we now have a report from the Pay Board unconvincingly putting forward useless proposals which are not even sustained by its thin argument. The fact is that those who were prejudiced by the Government\u2019s action a year ago have not caught up and never will. The fact is that he has repudiated all the principles of fair dealing between one group and another.He has breached a long-standing arrangement of comparability between one sector of public industry and another - gas and electricity, for example. He has repudiated a principle accepted by successive Governments since 1957 about the comparability of civil servants\u2019 salaries and wages with those of the rest of industry. He has gone further: he has prostituted the position of the Head of the Civil Service, long regarded as the protector of the rights of the Civil Service, by involving him in the devising and enforcement of the Government\u2019s policy, and requiring him to communicate to public employees the breach of policies previously agreed. He has in fact rejected the principle which a year ago I demanded he must insist upon - no discrimination against the public sector.Now even the CBI are in revolt. Exports are being frustrated; delivery dates dishonoured, because of a famine in the over­heated areas of the country of both skilled and less skilled labour. For private em­ployers now, it is every man for himself. Some of them are unable to get labour, and to meet delivery dates they are bidding up wages and salaries by every device legal and illegal, while other employers are reacting in the same way to hold the labour they have. Outside the manual field, at any rate, there have never been so many creations of new titles, new grades, new and honorific job specifications, as we have seen in this great campaign by employers to beat the pay policy.But for the farm worker and the miners, the steel workers and the textile worker, the railwayman and the post office worker, there are no bogus titles.And we have seen the deadly effect on our essential services, seen the police in London and other big cities, and those who drive the buses, and the students, on the hospital service, and last week we even read of a famine of linen supplies for hospitals be­cause of a shortage of labour in the laun­dries. And even while we have been here in Blackpool, employers honourably seeking to implement agreements they have entered into with their workers, agreements related to new patterns of productivity, are now appealing, in vain, to the Government to allow them to honour their undertakings. It is Cornish Clay one day, it is British Leyland the next. But Mr. Heath and his colleagues insist on accumulating the grapes of wrath and dishonouring agreements and dividing the British people.Let us tell him, whatever may be said from this platform next week, you cannot solve the problems of inflation with a public relations exercise; still less can you solve it by appointing a Cabinet Minister, Sir Geoffrey (Alibi) Howe, to camp outside the BBC \u2013 \u2018Today\u2019; \u2018The World at One,\u2019 \u2018PM\u2019 and \u2018Tonight\u2019 - as an apologist for an indefensible policy. (Applause)For the first time in the history of this movement, the Labour Party - the National Executive Committee and the Parliamentary Party - and the Trade Union Congress - have reached agreement on a categorical programme for fighting inflation.We have set out the measures which in our view must be taken as a minimum programme if we are to secure a policy for fighting rising prices and rising rents.Action to control prices, where it counts, w here the housewife does her shopping.Direct action to deal with essential foods, using food subsidies.A freeze on all council house and new town rents.Action, such as I called for yesterday, to control the London capital market and freeze market interest rates.A crisis tax on land and property specula­tion.An adequate pension increase now.A declaration that in the next Budget provocative and divisive tax concessions to the wealthy are to be reversed, and the proceeds used to help the less well off.The country has rejected the Govern­ment\u2019s excuses. And no wonder.This Government, elected on a pledge to reduce prices, in fact came into office determined to force up prices. This was made clear by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in September, 1970. He called for higher prices then, in order to secure higher profits, in order to secure higher investment. We have had the higher prices. We have had the higher profits - record profits. But investment is still lagging sadly behind the level of 1970.We know with what determination the Government set out to increase food prices with their food levies. Again, let us not under-rate their successes in forcing up food prices. After all no-one in this country can now be in any doubt about the effect on the price levels, now and so far as he is con­cerned, forever more of the humiliating terms Mr. Heath accepted from M. Pompi­dou in May 1971. (Applause)But what this Government have con­spired with Europe to ensure is that when prices come down again, as they do from time to time, they won\u2019t come down in Britain.Even the Beaverbrook Evening Standard told us in August: \u2018the traditional British breakfast could soon become a meal of the past because of escalating prices for bacon and eggs. And now the cost of cereals is going up.\u2019 And that was after its stable mate had confessed what every housewife knows: that for millions of families the roast beef of old England has disappeared from the Sunday table.To complete the trilogy, we have from the same source - Beaverbrook Newspapers - the confession that beef prices will never come down to anything like traditional levels because of the British Government\u2019s acquiescence in recent decisions of the Common Market.Mr. Heath has not only gone along with rising prices stroke after stroke after stroke; he has built in a ratchet to ensure that once risen they stay risen.The Government\u2019s inflationary policy is one, but only one, of the reasons for Britain\u2019s economic crisis. The other is their headlong rush into creating a free market, a free market in name, but one where every­thing which affects the concerns of the financial interests they serve is rigged before you start.The consequences we know only too well. Prices in peace time rising faster even than in wartime. The national debt in peace time rising even more than in wartime. We remember in Election week 1970 his scare story that a Labour Government would have to introduce a wage freeze and would devalue sterling within three years. He did both and did it in two years. Now his devaluation means that the £ abroad has plummeted by 20 per cent.He has not in fact received the same treatment as happened on an earlier occa­sion. In fact it was all quite cheery. The Daily Express had the headline, \u2018£ Floating. Proud,\u2019 \u2018Holidaymakers told \u201cGet your pounds changed here.\u201d\u2019 The story began, \u2018The £ bravely floated to freedom last night.\u2019 Like a brick, as it turned out. (Laughter and applause).Now, as each dismal set of trade figures follows another, we see Mr. Peter Walker rushing to the studio, or the nearest mobile broadcasting car, to proclaim them as a triumph of the Government\u2019s policies.But we remember a few days before the election of 1970, when the monthly trade figures were published - a very small deficit - Mr. Heath deliberately falsified their message. He was inevitably successful in orchestrating a great Press and broadcast­ing lamentation at the impending collapse of the economy. We were in fact in surplus, and our balance of payments was soaring to a £1,000 million surplus on the plus side.But month after month this year we have seen trade deficits of £150 millions and above. In June they published the worst ever figure - a deficit of £209 million in a month; an average deficit for the preceding three months of over £150 million. Where were the screaming headline writers of June 1970? (Applause) Perhaps it was the news-­print shortage. (Laughter) One great London evening newspaper printed a perfunctory statement in the bottom right hand corner of the front page, referring the reader to page 50 of the City section if he cared to read all about it. In later editions it disappeared altogether from the front page.After the trade figures had been pub­lished, the other great London evening newspaper produced an afternoon edition with a main headline across seven columns: EXCLUSIVE \u2018Soccer Star Marriage shock\u2019 - (Laughter and Applause) - A London striker\u2019s \u2018Wife goes home to Mum.\u2019 This I can assert with confidence, recalling our experience of Mr. Heath conducting the mighty press orchestra of June 1970, if there had been trade figures in that month such as those he has achieved three years later, they would have been trumpeted abroad across all the columns there are. Even if the wives of every footballer in the First Division, the Second Division (Laughter), the Third Division and the Fourth Division, the Scottish First Division, the Scottish Second Division, the Central League, the Southern League, the Lan­cashire Combination, (Laughter), the Isthmian League, the Spartan League, the Athenian League, indeed the entire football Combination had all collectively gone home to their mums.What, month by month, is destroying the last vestiges of confidence Mr. Heath still enjoys, even among his own friends in industry and the City, is the growing realisation that the Conservative Party, at home and abroad, after all their boasts, has become tainted as the Party of unsound finance and clipped money. And all the country is given is that repetitive speech about growth.Growth? A stretch of jungle, a foetid swamp, are certainly not deficient in growth; an unweeded garden \u2018"things rank and gross in nature possess it merely.\u2019But Mr. Heath has achieved a distorted growth by the unique prescription of applying fertilisers to the weeds and Para­quat to the fruit and flowers. (Applause and Laughter)In no area of our society have we seen the consequence of hard-line Tory policies and distorted growth more clearly than in housing. Reports are coming in from all over the country of the breakdown in other public building programmes. Hospital building in several parts of the country delayed by a year or more. Schools held back, shrunk in size, or not even started.It is ludicrous, not least after all the pledges about the place of housing in the \u2018Better Tomorrow,\u2019 that the city of Shef­field should now be totally precluded from building by the Government\u2019s actions. Other cities are still maintaining some sort of a programme, but the unreal yardstick controls mean that even those authorities that are doing some building are in many cases being forced into building broiler estates with no room to breathe. With broiler estates, you can always be sure that the Liberals will be there to rifle the nests.The Government are in fact using their yardsticks to cut back public expenditure on housing without having the guts to tell Parliament or the country. They have not cut the programme; they are simply mak­ing it impossible to achieve. The coward\u2019s way out.In the private sector, to the shortage and chaos, as I said yesterday, they are adding the financial anarchy. It is ridiculous, and essentially divisive that the cost of paying for Dunromin should depend on manoeuvr­ings in the Euro-dollar market. This is not all.I said yesterday that in my view the finance of housing should become a national responsibility. But one thing is urgent as soon as Labour comes into office, even while this major financial reorgani­sation is taking shape. A short sharp Bill should go through Parliament cancelling the built-in escalation of rents for council tenants and for private tenants. (Applause)That is the first step towards the repeal of the Housing Finance Act. We will draw its teeth before we cut its throat.That is why when we look at these things in the public sector we find a mere­tricious vulgarity in Mr. Heath\u2019s \u2018You\u2019ve never had materialism so good\u2019 speech. There is little that is surprising in the fact that there are now more colour television sets or dish washers than there were three years ago. Each decade sees an increase in the purchase of the products of technolo­gical advance. I should be very surprised if in 1933, when there were three million unemployed, there were not very many more radio sets than in. 1930.But we have to lift our eyes above the sales figures of an over-advertised society.There are other values, and they are neglected by the kind of Government Britain has got and the kind of people they exist to promote.Is the Admass profession capable of ex­pressing - still less satisfying - the real desires of average parents, their hopes for them­selves, their dreams for their children?Is it not possible, if they were asked and if society were to respond to their answers, that they are more concerned with getting a good school for their children? That they would give higher priority for the demo­lition of a Victorian barracks of a school and its replacement by a school worthy of their new generation? Might it not be that they would measure their family\u2019s standard of living not by consumer goods but by the chance their children would have the size of the classes they will attend? For as Ted Short reminded us last year education de­privation and inequality begins not at 11+, or even at 5+, but in the years before the child is 5.Are not working mothers more concerned to have adequate nursery facilities for looking after their children during working hours? Are not so many of our people concerned that they should not have to bring up their children in homes whose structure and amenities are a blot on our civilisation?Is this age not guilty today of building slums which shortly will take their place? Is not our system of society guilty when we build a Fort Yardstick to take its place beside slums inherited from the past? Would not our people give much more to live in a home where children could sleep in quiet, not subject to the roaring and belching of a juggernaut society, or the ever-demanding requirements of nocturnal jets?Would not our old people prefer to live the retirement they have earned in better amenities than so many of them get, rather than hear on radios or TV about the material symbols of a society from which they are so largely excluded? Would not all - young and old - yearn for greater access to green fields and open space in the countryside? Or when they go down to the sea or the river to have some confidence that their day or their week or their fort­night is not ruined by the pollution of modern society?These are the ideas so many of our people have in mind when they think or dream of the luxuries which could exist in that narrow margin between outgoings and income, and to achieve those dreams is not only a question of the organisation of in­dustry and finance and the extension of public enterprise we were talking about yesterday. It is still more a question of the values which inspire our society.We must be prepared to dare to produce the policies, to venture upon the measures that will make a reality of the freedom of choice, the degree of involvement, the right of a voice in all the major decisions affect­ing the life of the individual and the individual family - the Edinburgh theme.But the challenge which faces us lies not merely in widening the area of individual choice but in providing a means both in industry and in society generally to create a more responsible society. Responsibility not conferred from above.Conference now has come to terms with the implications of the programme I presented yesterday. Above all, in education. Because it is about education that we are in fact speaking.We in the Labour Party reject the idea that education is simply to train techno­logical lobby fodder, or to instil into our children the particular degree of smartness required to compete in a commercial rat race.We have always said that education must be for the fuller appreciation of life and an ability to appreciate the riches of this and of past civilisations.But that is not all. We are talking about citizenship. What I asserted in my Edin­burgh series of speeches was the need for individual citizens, individual families, to be brought more and more close to the decisions which affect their lives.But the programme that this Conference clearly accepted yesterday adds a new dimen­sion to the educational challenge. Yesterday, I put before you a massive programme, on behalf of the National Executive Committee, for bringing the land, the minerals and great sectors of industry into social owner­ship.To do that will be meaningless unless all our people are identified in the wider responsibilities that will pass from boardrooms that are not accountable to the national interest, to a new system which is accountable to the nation through an elected Parliament.The 19th century educational revolution was designed to produce a middle-class elite for meeting the requirements of the new Establishment at home and in the Empire.The educational revolution in the 20th century was based certainly upon the ideals of great educationalists and teachers, but in its higher reaches it is still far too greatly concentrated on meeting the requirements of a predominantly commercial society.A century ago Tennyson said, \u2018We are not spinners all.\u2019 Today we are not com­puter programmers all either, and none of us accept an educational system designed mainly to feed the requirements of a society orientated on profits and marketing and capital gains.But above all we have got to ensure that our system of education is directed not to the creation of school-leavers who will be so involved in the rat race that they never begin to live until they are too old to enjoy it. We have to end the artificial system under which education ceases for the majority of our people one day in one July; their past school life and their con­tinuing education must be part of the same process.In Blackpool six months ago I rejected the argument which suggested that there is any defined ordinance that every newborn child should be automatically assigned to either the officer class or the operative class in industry and in our wider society.That is why any programme for industrial democracy must provide for an obligation on the employer, public or private, to enable every employee to have continuing education, with compulsory facilities for day release not only in vocational training but in all forms of study which he wishes to follow so that he can play his full part in industry and in all the wider calls of citizenship.The Victorians said \u2018We must educate our masters\u2019 and they produced a Daily Mail. But in the context of yesterday\u2019s debate those responsible for decision making in industry will come increasingly from those who are working in industry and they must have facilities for continuing educa­tion and must have them more abundantly.Including the Open University, created by the Labour Government, which has now been acknowledged by the world\u2019s leading educational authorities as the greatest advance in education in this or any other country in the world in this century. (Applause) Although the then Conservative leadership said they would destroy it when they came into office, even they are now applauding its foundation and taking pride in it. Pride too in the fact that other countries all over the world are emulating it or improving our balance of payments by buying our teaching material.I now want to come to this. This Con­ference at Blackpool is the second in the autumn series of Party Conferences.There was another at Southport. Immediately afterwards I learned from the press that Mr. Thorpe, following the distinguished precedent of Mr. Grimond 10 years after Orpington, was already preparing his dis­positions for the day following the next General Election.I am not opposed to innocent amusement provided he does not take himself seriously. (Laughter) After the next election he and his little band will have the same freedom to vote for the Tory Opposition that they exploited to the full when the Labour Government (Applause) was surviving with a majority of two in the autumn of 1965.The claim that the Liberals now have clear policies on the great issues of the day is shaken a little if one studies their record in this Parliament, a record no less maverick than that of the years after 1964.On the Industrial Relations Act, on which the next Parliament is going to take a clear decision, they voted for the second reading and against the third reading. On the issues which reduced Britain to a state of industrial chaos in the summer of 1972 they voted, when the bill was going through, in favour of the cooling-off period; but on the provision for the strike ballot they abstained. On the important vote on the code of industrial practice under the bill, three Liberals voted for it and three abstained, or had other engagements.On the Second Reading of the EEC Bill five Liberals voted with the Government and one against, in a division which gave the Government a majority of eight.On our call for a general election so that the people could decide before Britain entered the Market, all the Liberals voted with the Government against us and against community politics by the British people. (Applause)On the vote for a referendum before entry three voted for it and three against. There was no clear Party line, though two of the recent Liberal by-election victors in Rochdale and Sutton and Cheam decided they would get more votes be falling over themselves to adopt our policy for a referen­dum before a final decision was taken.Their voting record on VAT is even more difficult to fathom. In any case, their vote for the Market decided the issue. On prides and incomes, on which the next Parliament must have a clear view, they supported the Government in every vote on all aspects of Stage I and Stage II. In our censure on the Government for the treatment of hospital and ancillary workers and other lower paid groups, the Liberals voted with the Government. They are, we understand, campaigning for a national minimum wage though there is some confusion about whether this should be £24 or £25 a week. But when they had the opportunity to vote for lower paid workers, they trooped obediently through the Conservative Lobby against them. (Applause) The press build-up to our conference here this year is reminiscent of what hap­pened exactly eight years ago. When we met here in Blackpool then, you would have thought from the build-up that one issue dominated the Conference, namely, what my response would be to Mr. Grimond\u2019s offer to keep the Labour Govern­ment in office as long as it dropped its programme in favour of whatever the Liberal programme happened to be at any particular moment of time. (Laughter) I rejected this out of hand. We then had a majority of two, and the Speaker\u2019s seat was vacant.Now there are ancestral voices heralding a new alignment of political forces. With all the authority of a twice-defeated Conservative candidate, the. Editor of The Times is thundering out his canonicals.As a first step - and what has happened to the public opinion polls we had at the last Conference? Are they showing something different? (Laughter) As a first step, he and his fellow manipulators dream of an election result in which the Liberal Party holds the balance in a newly elected Par­liament. This, they pray, will lead to a situ­ation which would mean a permanent majority for the Conservatives by the creation of a new Liberal Party out of the ashes of the Labour Party. They are wast­ing their time. This Party is not for burning. (Applause)Let this be clear: as long as I am Leader of this Party, Labour will not enter into any coalition with any other Party, Liberal or Conservative or anyone else. (Prolonged applause)As long as I am Leader of this Party there will be no electoral treaty, no political alliance, no understanding, no deal, no arrangement, no fix, neither will there be any secret deal or secret discus­sions. Whatever the results of the election, a Labour Government will go forward boldly on its policy, challenging any manoeuverers to make their position clear in vote after vote. On land, on housing, on industrial relations, on education and on the rest of this programme that we shall be carrying out. If, as they never dared to do between 1964 and 1966, they make it impossible for us to implement that pro­gramme, then the issue will be taken openly back to the people of this country for a final decision. (Applause) And let the danger light upon those who thought they could exercise an electorally unearned control over a constitutional government. That is that and will remain that. But one conclusion follows. If there are those of undefined political allegiance who devoutly wish to see a coalition, they must understand that the only coalition possible is a coalition of the two Tory Parties, the Conservative Tory Party and the Liberal Tory Party. (Applause) So let everyone recognise, a vote for the Liberals is a vote for a Tory dominated coalition. (Applause)Now finally, from the dreams of South­port back to the realities of this Conference. I do mean this Conference. In recent weeks, visiting constituency parties, I have stressed the good fortune of those who have been chosen by their Constituency Parties to represent them at this Conference. Their Parties have paid the pooled fare. I told them that they would get good value - two for the price of one. For one pooled fare they would get two Conferences - the one we have been attending this week, the other we read about next morning. (Laughter and Applause)I have to confess that I understated the contrast between them. I ought to have realised what was going to happen a few days ago when I read those fanciful accounts of the transactions of the NEC over the 25 companies - no relation to reality whatever.If there is one thing some of our Fleet Street friends cannot stand, it is a successful and united Conference. They are having a bad time. They began to prepare for their new line, as we see this morning, before we even met. The Editor of The Times had a leading article about the screaming nightmares to which he appeared to be subject about Marxists under the bed.Following that leading article, another is now a front runner for the Aims of Industry prize for independent journalism. (Laughter) Should you in fact have missed it I should like just to lint before you to give you a chance of savouring yesterday\u2019s Daily Express report of our Conference. It began like this:'THE SCENE, at first glance, in the Winter Gardens, Blackpool, might well have resembled Moscow\u2019s Palace of Congresses in Stalin\u2019s time.'(Laughter)'All those massive crystal chandeliers under the gilded stucco ceiling, with its coats of arms and dancing cherubs, and | below, those serried ranks of grim-looking delegates'(Laughter)'in their square-cut lounge suits \u2013 not a smile between them \u2013 at the opening of the Labour Conference.'Then he goes on:'Not forgetting the few women kept firmly in their place, so it seemed, well at the back.'(Laughter)'And, on the presidium \u2013 sorry, platform \u2013 the same grimness, the same authoritarian aspect.'Around all was the colour red as the basic theme of the affair.  Red plush seats.  Red draped platform.  Red back-grounded slogan, \u201cLabour Leads to a Better Britain.\u201d'And red costumes worn by MPs Mrs Barbara Castle, Miss Joan Lestor and Mrs Lena Jeger.Small wonder the smile of expectancy on the face of the Tass man on the Press table.'(Laughter and applause)'Small wonder the approving clouds of Georgian tobacco smoke from certain sections of the diplomatic enclosure.'This reference to red costumes - let us get this out of the way first, shall we? It is a very dated phrase of the fifties. I do not know who thought that one up. It really is a tribute to my lady colleagues\u2019 sartorial conservatism - they always wear red on Conference Mondays! And then that smile of expectancy on the face of the Tass man on the Press table. Has anyone ever seen a Tass man smile? And that egregious tobacco. What was it \u2013 \u2018Small wonder the approving clouds of Georgian tobacco smoke from certain sections of the diplo­matic enclosure.\u2019 Speaking as one who is rapidly becoming an authority on tobacco, I have never learned how to make clouds of tobacco smoke approving. But if this is possible, I suppose next week in this hall it will be Rhodesian tobacco curling upwards in satisfaction. (Laughter and Applause)Then the Express lists a diplomatic gazette of ambassadors and ministers attending this Conference. And, I do not like to mention this, even an accusation that you, Mr. Chairman, in your opening speech, were plagiarising Leonid Brezhnev.I hope the Diplomatic Corps, not only East European, but the whole range of Excellencies from the South African to the Portuguese will know with what sinister interpretations the Daily Express must now greet their attendance at the Conservative Conference next week.Seriously though: no wonder the Express is losing circulation. If they, and others, printed the football results with the same accuracy they devote to our Proceedings here, not only would Huddersfield Town be the top of the First Division (Laughter), but no-one would buy their paper.But let us face it, in 28 years the Tories have not changed; 1945, Clem Atlee was the Gestapo; 1973, I am the KGB (Laughter), and the ideals underlying this Conference are to be disinterred from the archives of the Marx-Engels Institute. I thank them very much for that.You, Mr. Chairman, sought them in the words of Robert Blatchford.I could go back earlier to another im­peccably democratic source, to the words of a statesman - who more than a century ago, fought for democracy and. indeed, died for democracy. And I want to sum up what I think this conference is about by quoting Abraham Lincoln, and this is what he said:'In the early days of the world, the Almighty said to the first of our race \u2018in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread\u2019; and since then, if we accept the light and the air of heaven, no good thing has been, or can be enjoyed by us, without having first cost labour. And, inasmuch as most good things are produced by labour, it follows that all such things of right belong to those whose labour has pro­duced them. But it has so happened in all ages of the world, that some have laboured, and others have, without labour, enjoyed a large proportion of the fruits. This is wrong, and should not continue. To secure to each labourer the whole product of his labour, or as nearly as possible, is a most worthy object of any good government.'That, Mr. Chairman, is the message of this Conference, of this Party, to the people of Britain and to the world.

aVMr. Chairman, Fellow Delegates, I present to Conference the report of the Parlia­mentary Labour Party. This must be the first time in the history of our Party that the Parlia­mentary Report presented by the Leader spreads over not one, or two, but three Parliaments.It covers the last dying months of the Con­servative majority Parliament (June 1970 to February 1974); the Parliament of minorities elected last February - the shortest Parliament in our history since 1886 - and now the Parlia­ment elected for five years, with a Labour majority. (Applause)It has been a long 13 months, an historic 13 months, since Conference last met at Blackpool.Those months spanned the greatest trade crisis of all time, not only for this country but for the whole of the industrialised world; the greatest industrial tragedy - unnecessary, utterly futile - in this country for nearly 50 years; and two General Elections which have transformed an outlook of despair into a prospect of hope for our country.The Tories ran away from Government last February, but they ran away only just in time. Had they stayed any longer, disaster might have been inescapable.You know, I am proud of our record in that short Parliament - not only of the good we have done but of the harm we have undone - beginning with the repeal of the Industrial Relations Act and the Housing Finance Acts and the scrapping of so many other measures by which the Tories had damaged the harmony and unity of our people. Despite the difficulties of that short Parlia­ment, despite a minority situation exploited in the division lobbies by our opponents with great bravery once they were sure that the holiday period prevented me from calling an immediate General Election - despite all these things - we moved faster to carry out the policies on which we had been elected than any Government since the War, not excluding the Attlee Govern­ment of 1945.But not fast enough, apparently, for some. I was interested to read on the tape machine yesterday morning - at 8.17 a.m., 73 minutes before Conference began - a forecast of widespread attacks you were going to make upon the Government because, among other reasons, and I quote \u2018the Manifesto on which the Election was won has not yet been implemented.\u2019 (Laughter)Well, I know we are quick workers, but it is only six weeks since we were elected. For once, I think I have the right to plead for a little more time.The key to our success in October was that we were seen to be carrying out the pledges we gave to the people in February - pledges which were part of the programme on which the Party as a whole had worked so hard in the years of Opposition, the programme which produced the finest manifestos ever put before the electors of this country. (Applause)But what October, the fourth election victory in less than ten years, means is this: that the Labour Party is now the natural patty of Government, not the natural party of Opposi­tion. (Applause)Assuming that. this Parliament lasts its full course - and I do not see any reason why it should not, still less do I see any sign of a credible opposition to it - then of the 15 years from October 1964 to October 1979 Labour will have been in power for close on 11 years.Today, this week, we have to examine - as the Parliamentary Labour Party has been doing since the election - the implications, the challenges and the responsibilities of having a Party no longer of Opposition only, no longer of protest only, but a Party of Government.But let not that be taken by any of us, Cabinet or other party workers, Members of Parliament or local authority representatives, as meaning that we are no long a Party of protest. Were any of us to do so, then our position as a Party of power would wither at the roots, and it would deserve to do so. Labour is a Party of protest in Government as well as in Opposition. There is no one else. Protest against inequality, injustice, waste, the abuse of power, anti-democratic forces at home and abroad.Should the Party abandon its posture of protest or its ability to make that protest effective within the democratic processes of the Party, then there is no future for us. And worse, no future for Britain.I say this with a greater confidence because within our great national democracy I see displayed no qualifications for meaningful protest on the Opposition benches of the House of Commons. The principal Opposition party has become a territorial rump: rejected by Scotland, rejected by Wales, rejected by our main industrial and urban areas north of the Trent; they are now a regional party. (Applause)It was because the nation remembered in October the Tory years leading up to last February. We had a Tory Government presid­ing over a Britain with the largest trade deficit in her history, a devastating trade deficit, four times greater than the one they left us in 1964 - the one we resolved.And that deficit last autumn had accumulated before we felt - almost before we began to feel - the full impact of the oil price increases. It was a Britain where industrial growth had stopped.Where prices were out of control.Where Government-induced speculation was rampant, as house and land and commodity prices soared to all-time record levels.Where, just before they lurched into the State of Emergency and the three-day week, their leader was proclaiming to the Institute of Directors last November that the only prob­lems Britain faced were \u2018the problems of success.\u2019Today, with a Labour Government, now that the fight-back for Britain\u2019s recovery is under way, it would appear that the Conservative Party consider they have a vested interest in national disaster, in talking Britain down, in exulting only when they perceive some event, some report, some statistics which can be turned to their own political advantage.I regret seeing a once great and historic party now presenting an image of nothing so much as that well-known, down-at-heel, sandwich board character who parades down city streets proclaiming, \u2018Prepare to Meet Thy Doom.\u2019Well, it\u2019s a living. It has the advantage that no one can prove him wrong. (Laughter) Or right, either. But at least the sandwich man - I am talking about the trained one - does main­tain a day-to-day consistency. There is no record of anyone in that particular profession losing his credibility by proclaiming: \u2018the world ends tomorrow, but I\u2019ll see you get 9½ % mortgages by Christmas.\u2019 (Laughter)Mr. Chairman, having said that, I do not propose to spend any more words on the Con­servative Party. There are more important things this morning for us to discuss.For this is the Conference where we accept, as the nation clearly wants us to accept, the obligation of being the Party of Government.We have the duty to act responsibly, to tell the nation the facts, and what in our view must be done if the unparalleled problems and crises this country now faces are to be overcome, conquered, challenged, converted into oppor­tunity.We have been elected on the policies that we have proclaimed with total clarity in two Manifestos within a single year.We were elected because our record, even as a minority Government, in turning those pledges into reality, impressed all our people, and many others who had not traditionally supported Labour. We were elected, also, I think, because the country judged, setting one team of men and women against another, that we were the better team, the more experienced, the more compassionate and understanding.Above all, I believe we were elected because the people of Britain recognised the nature and depth of the challenge we face as a nation.They realise that the going from now on will be tougher than we have known in this genera­tion. They recognise that this national challenge can be met not by confrontation and divisive conflict, but only by comradeship and co-opera­tion and care and concern.Our mandate is to ensure that as the going gets tougher and tougher up the hill - as it will - that, in the words of the old Socialist story about the stage-coach going up-hill, the order must go out to the nation \u2026 \u2018Everybody who is able-bodied, regardless of rank or class, gets out and shoves. But if there are any among us who are unable to play their part through illness, age, infancy or disability, they, and they alone, are free to ride.\u2019Let it be absolutely clear: the problems we face are not what the Conservatives called \u2018the problems of success.\u2019 At home our industries have, for far too long, suffered from under­investment - in new and modern machinery, in the necessary expansion of the growth sectors of our economy.In the world at large the balance of economic power has fundamentally changed almost before our eyes, particularly the balance of power between those who produce the raw materials of the industrialised world, and those who import and consume them.In some respects, this was long overdue; the advanced industrial world had benefited at the expense of the primary producers.But the change that has occurred with so much rapidity has created great inequality between developing countries. Some of them - oil producers, producers of copper and other raw materials - are receiving an uncovenanted benefit. Their balance of payments, their national income and the income of their pro­ducers have been greatly expanded.But the other developing countries, the countries without the right raw materials, the countries of what is now known as the Fourth World - they have not only gained nothing from the commodity boom, they are actually crippled by all that this means in terms of further burdens on their already unbalanced trade and payments.The standard of living of their people, already, abysmally low, falls even further, as they have to pay more for the raw materials they need and for their food.For when the price of oil soared so astrono­mically it not only hit the powerful trading nations of Europe, of America and Japan. Still harder, it hit those Fourth World countries already facing famine, deprivation, disease, premature death, and natural disasters, flood and drought.For Britain, what the economic crisis means is that oil alone has added an extra £2,500 million on our import bill every year. That is a surcharge of over £2 a week - £2 a week every week - upon every household in this country.From there we start, and that oil increase came on top of a trade deficit which already approached £2,500 million in 1973. It came when prices were already soaring, in some cases forced upwards by deliberate Conserva­tive Government action. Inflation was not created by the oil crisis; it was aggravated by it to an unprecedented degree.A year ago, as the country was moved into that disastrous confrontation with the miners, the political battle about inflation was to some extent an argument about wages and prices: which was the causal factor, wages forcing up prices, or prices forcing up wages? Since then, more and more it has been acknowledged that at that time it was prices which gave the twist to the inflationary spiral, with wages, statutorily controlled though they were, struggling to keep pace.That was why we insisted, in Opposition, not only on stricter price controls of manufactured goods, but on much more effective action to deal with the main items entering into an ordinary family\u2019s budget - above all, food prices and housing. That was why we demanded, in the February election, the introduction of food subsidies on the main essentials.That was why we fought so bitterly against the so-called prices policy of the Conservative Government. That was why we reversed the Conservative housing policy which, so far from controlling the cost of housing, insisted with the force of law that reluctant local authorities must force up the rents of 5 million families - to say nothing of the action taken against those living in private rented homes.Think how much more the cost of living of the average family since last February would have risen had we not so acted on food prices and housing.But, just as we emphasised a year ago that it was prices and rents that were forcing up wage claims, so we warned even then - as we have warned in the two Elections - that as world prices other than oil began to moderate, the inflationary threat here in Britain would come more and more not from external prices but from our own incomes and wages.In public and private industry now, it is wage costs which threaten to provide a new infla­tionary twist.There are some - perhaps even within our own movement - who are tempted to ask, \u2018Why all this fuss about inflation: why, if we cannot control it, don\u2019t we relax and enjoy it?\u2019The short answer is that inflation is the enemy of everything we believe in, in this movement.By its very nature, it is above all the enemy of democratic socialism, of everyone who seeks greater equality, full employment, and social justice.When the Labour Party and the TUC met to hammer out the terms of its joint document, \u2018Economic Policy and the Cost of Living\u2019 - the Social Contract - we agreed from the outset that inflation is fundamentally arbitrary and unfair - a divisive redistribution of wealth and income.It is a redistribution not according to any Socialist principles we recognise and pursue. Indeed, inflation can, and so often does, benefit the rich at the expense of the poor, because only those with power and financial resources can acquire and manipulate the kind of assets which actually increase in value with inflation.The less well-off have no such protection from the remorseless squeeze which inflation puts on the cost of feeding and clothing a family, or on the value of a small nest-egg of savings, or on the millions, mainly the old, who are living on fixed incomes.But inflation is not only capricious and inequitable in terms of redistribution of our national wealth and income. Inflation is the father and mother of unemployment for our people, and of insecurity for their families.It is an illusion to believe that big money wage settlements protect you from rising prices. They make them rise faster. It is an illusion to believe that they are an instrument for maintaining social justice; on the contrary, they destroy social justice.It is an illusion to believe that they protect you from the loss of a job. They make that loss more likely.Inflation means that those who are concerned with the social wage, the family protection provided by the social services, those who are battling to create a decent social system, all these are fighting a losing battle because of inflation.The Welfare State, on which the post-war Labour Government set Britain\u2019s course, has provided, in terms of health, housing, educa­tion, and social security, benefits which are spread throughout the land and through the whole social scale.Socialists have always preached that a civilised society can be judged above all by the social provision that it makes for the least favoured of our people, the standard of living it provides for those least able to help them­selves.I am proud to have appointed Britain\u2019s first ever Minister for the Disabled, whose social work through the Chronically Sick and Dis­abled Persons\u2019 Act years ago had already begun to help millions of families and individuals. Everything Alf Morris and his chief, Barbara Castle, and her team, are trying to do in the whole field of social services is undermined by the threat of inflation, as are education and the people\u2019s housing.The social services, including the health service, are more labour intensive than almost any other sector of our national life. Wage and salary costs are a very high proportion of total costs.The Social Contract means a fair division of our national resources, the fair sharing of sacrifices. It is not a scramble in which the big battalions, the powerful and wealthy, on both sides of industry, or in finance, or in any sector of the community, can exercise their power in order to get an unfair advantage.No one should seek to take wealth for themselves which they have not earned, because that wealth will have been put into the national pool by somebody who did work.For example, during the Stock Exchange panic in August, there were weevils at work, happily making money, out of shares that never belonged to them. The Sunday Times referred to a week of \u2018pure senselessness in the stock market\u2019 and went on \u2018Bear selling was an important influence last week; men selling shares they do not own to drive the price down so that they can buy them back cheaper a few days later. Well-known merchant banks were at it. And so was at least one syndicate of stockbrokers, of the speculative sort most of us thought were wiped out.\u2019A day or two later, we read that someone had spread the rumour that a million ICI shares were going to he loaded on to the market and destroy the value. It was untrue and proved to be untrue, but somebody hoped to make a packet, and if they had it would have come from someone else\u2019s sweat and skill and hard work, because these activities were creating and producing nothing.Using power and ingenuity to avoid taxes also means that other members of the national family are worse off; and it has to be made up by higher taxes or reduced provision for the social services.When, by selling shares overnight and buying them back the next morning to establish tax losses - the so-called \u2018bed and breakfast\u2019 fiddle - jobbers and brokers make a packet for themselves and the Exchequer is deprived of future tax revenue, it is an abuse of a fair society.One big company was recently reported as scheming one of these bed and breakfast operations - a £30 million deal overnight. Just a couple of \u2019phone calls. A loss to the Revenue. An additional burden on other taxpayers, people much less well off. I wish it was always so easy for us in Government when money is desperately needed for a really worthwhile cause, like cars for the disabled.The big battalions may feel they can protect themselves. They can. In the short-term but at a cost to those with less bargaining muscle. Ultimately, it would be at a heavy cost to themselves.After all our experience in the previous Labour Governments - and the experience of democratic countries - I do not believe that in a democracy statutory control of wages can work for very long. And it cannot work twice. In no time at all you are having to deal with more problems than you ever solved by the statute.And most of the problems we are facing today on the incomes front are an inheritance from Stage 1 and Stage 2 and Stage 3. Anomalies created by those rigid bureaucratic formulae. Members of our community who had been ignored for years - and for whom we are extending belated social justice - the nurses, the postal workers, workers in metropolitan transport services and, very soon, the teachers. And when our critics in politics, or press - and some of them are the same people - ponti­ficate about the wage rate or the earnings index, let them calculate how much of the increase they complain of represents the cost, the belated cost, of providing for those who had been left behind, and also the costs of the thresholds given statutory power a year ago.But, Mr Chairman, if the law of the big battalions operates, it could break the Social Contract. Let there be no doubt about that. Then the only choices facing a democratic Government are grave: either deflationary measures involving a reduction in public expenditure, which means cutting the social wage, or an increase in taxation, taxation which, if it meant direct taxation, would be a straight cut in take-home pay, or, if it was by means of indirect taxation, would mean a cut in the purchasing power of the pay that was taken home. And both these remedies would result in unemployment for our people.None of us, Mr Chairman, joined this Party, devoted our lives to this Party, to make it the Party of unemployment. We reject that solution, emphatically, decisively, once and for all.But in rejecting it, every one of us carries the responsibility for ensuring that the Social Contract does succeed. Everyone of us. At work, in our constituency parties, in the trade unions.It is a Contract between Government and people. All the people. It is a Contract under which this Government has pledged itself, as no other Government in British history has pledged itself, to the promotion of social and economic justice in Britain. Social and economic justice between the people and between the regions of our country.It is a policy for social and economic equality. But it is a policy with obligations, with responsibilities as well as rewards. You cannot pick and choose. It is not a policy from which you can extract the parts you like and reject the parts you do not.I believe all the British people, whether they like this Government or not, want to see Britain emerge strong and healthy from its present troubles. They all want to know what they can do to help speed the day of a new strength for Britain. What they can all do is to join with us, with the Government, the Party, the TUC, and make certain that the Social Contract succeeds.Mr Chairman, in the February election, in the months which followed right up to the October election - and since - we have never for one moment disguised from our people that we cannot expect any measurable increase in the average standards of living for two years or more ahead. Yes, of course, there is the proverbial light at the end of the tunnel, when North Sea oil, on the basis of public participa­tion, begins to improve our balance of pay­ments, personal standards of living and the social wage.But what we cannot afford to do is to mort­gage that North Sea income before we have it. For too long, complacent British governments encouraged our people to live on the investment of past decades, living on our fathers and prejudicing the future of our children. Time and again governments have not been prepared to set aside, out of current production, the seed corn for the investment of the future.It is a charge against both major parties that, taking the whole period since the war, as well as in the years of depression before that, we have failed to invest adequately in strengthening our industrial capital and competitiveness.We must not, in the years ahead, so load the burden on to the future that those vast treasures around our shores, first of the North Sea and then in the Celtic Seas, are mortgaged before they are ever brought to shore.Out of its current earnings, the nation must provide for investment in the future. Investment is not for us, not for the nation just a matter of stocks and shares. Investment is new factories, and the services those factories need; investment is new pits to exploit the vast new seams of coal that have been discovered; it is new steelworks. It is public investment and it is private investment. It, and it alone, can provide new jobs and secure our people\u2019s prosperity.If we fail to tackle this problem of investment, then failure can become endemic, and fatal to all our hopes for the nation we hand on to our children.The policies on which we were elected, the Manifestos of February and October, provide the best hope of a real drive for productive investment in British industry for a generation. For the conventional financial wisdom has failed the nation.The Conservative solution was simple and, in its simplicity, totally ineffective.The Conservative solution was based first on a reduction in taxation on wealthier people, so that with less pressure on their standard of living, they would save and invest more. Some­times they invested and sometimes they didn\u2019t. When they did, their idea of investment was not to finance the production of new machine tools or factories, but to buy shares which gave the hope of the greatest profit, not those which strengthened the industrial base of the economy.But the second part of the Conservative policy, of course, was that panic financial spree of the previous Government, the ending of capital controls and the release of money through the Bank of England\u2019s \u2018Competition and Credit Controls\u2019 Paper of May 1971.The hope was no doubt that, combined with the tax remissions, the money would flow into industrial investment. But instead some was invested in property in Europe - it has not done very well, some of it - a large proportion flowed into property speculation at home which has now gone wrong and which, more than any other factor, has created the current Doomsday psychosis in the City. Particularly in the banking and insurance sectors.And throughout the years of that policy, manufacturing industry was the Cinderella, neglected by investors and badly hit by rocket­ing interest rates.So reduced taxation on wealthier people, the printing of money which led to that massive misdirection of investment capital - these failed. But not only these. When Britain entered the Common Market on those futile terms so lightly entered into by our predecessors, this was widely hailed as providing a sure and guaranteed incentive to the biggest spate of investment in this century.At the annual Guildhall speech in 1971 my predecessor said, I quote:'The prospect of free access to the European market, combined with a revival of demand at home, cries out for a Major programme of investment in industrial expansion and modernisation... Let industry now take the long-term view of our future in Europe. We now have the chance to bring about the regeneration and re-equipping of British industry. We must make ourselves the most modern country in the Community.'That was Mr. Heath in 1971.Two and a half years later when we took office, industrial investment was still below the 1970 peak attained and bequeathed to them when we left office.My main message to Conference today is this: that the future of this country, of the standard of living of our people, perhaps of democracy itself, depend upon the effort we put into investment in industry, public and private.This is not a new problem.My favourite quotation - I have even put it on the title page of a book I wrote not long ago - is from the last ever speech that Aneurin Bevan made in the House of Commons before he was taken ill, the speech of 3 November 1959.\u2018There is,\u2019 he said,'one important problem facing representa­tive parliamentary government in the whole of the world where it exists. It is being asked to solve a problem which so far it has failed to solve: that is, how to reconcile parliamen­tary popularity with sound economic plan­ning.'And he went on,'I would describe the central problem falling upon representative government in the Western world as how to persuade the people to forego immediate satisfactions in order to build up the economic resources of the country\u2026 How can we persuade the ordinary man and woman that it is worth­while making sacrifices in their immediate standards or foregoing substantial rising standards to extend fixed capital equipment throughout the country?'That was Aneurin Bevan in 1959. Fifteen years later - and we paid the price of what he was forecasting in 1970 - the problem has so far remained unsolved.Mr. Chairman, you and other colleagues have made clear how faithfully the Labour Govern­ment has adhered to the Manifesto we pub­lished in February, even in a minority Parlia­ment, and how clearly also the legislative programme for the first session of the new Parliament, set out in the Queen\u2019s Speech, follows the main priorities of the October Manifesto. What I think many delegates even will be surprised to note is how much of that programme, put before the nation for a five-year Parliament, is in our programme for implementation in the first year of this Parliament. Our social priorities, public participation in North Sea oil, public ownership of land, aircraft and shipbuilding and a host of other measures. This session.And our electoral success, I believe, is owed not just to our faithfulness over those six or seven months in carrying out our Manifesto, but to the relevance and breadth of the policies set out in the Manifesto. And this, in its turn, is a tribute to the work which thousands of our people, in consultation with every affiliated organization, every constituency, the Parlia­mentary Labour Party, the Executive, under­took in those Opposition years.I believe that our Manifesto - and that means our Parliamentary and Government programme - is the answer to Nye Bevan\u2019s insis­tence on sound economic planning providing the industrial investment we need and on which we are acting as a matter of urgency.I do not intend to deal in these closing minutes with the economic and financial inheritance of last March, or what has been done to deal with the problem in, now three successive Budgets. But the Chancellor in last month\u2019s Budget made clear that in his deter­mination first - this is one of his difficulties he said - in his determination first to improve the cash position of industrial companies, and then to improve industrial investment, he was inhibited, the Government was inhibited, because he had to act by generalised measures without the more selective measures that were required.As the economists would say, he could only act in a macro sense, when micro and selective measures were also needed. And in his Budget speech the Chancellor stressed in particular, as I stress again today, the relevance of the National Enterprise Board and of Planning Agreements with the major industrial com­panies; and the purpose being to ensure com­pliance with national objectives, particularly investment, prices, productivity, regional em­ployment, exports and import saving, product development, industrial relations and con­sumers\u2019 interests. It is all in the book, or it is in the White Paper and it will soon be in the legislation.The economic establishment represented by our opponents inside and outside Parliament continue to demonstrate their economic illi­teracy by their ideological attacks on the National Enterprise Board. But we have seen it all before. The Industrial Reorganization Corporation of 1966 was resisted as few measures have been resisted in the post-war world by those very same opponents, the Con­servative Party and the Conservative Press. By 1970 the IRC was acclaimed as a great advance in economic institutions, to the point where even Mr. John Davies recommended its con­tinuation, in 1970, only to be met by a doctri­naire decision at a higher level requiring him to introduce repealing legislation. How often even the Conservatives have wished that IRC had remained in existence.We are therefore reinstituting IRC as one of the roles of the National Enterprise Board. A Cabinet Committee under my Chairmanship last week approved final instructions to Parliamentary draftsmen for the drafting of the Bill which I hope will be before Parliament early in the New Year and which Tony Benn will carry through Parliament with the united support of the Parliamentary Labour Party. (Applause) This measure enables the Government to pro­mote Planning Agreements and to establish the National Enterprise Board.This is what I have been leading up to all this last half hour. It is in this, I believe, that we have found the right approach - which for a generation we failed to find - to the problem of securing enough investment and investment where it is most needed in the form in which it is needed.This is a new - I do not think people have recognised this yet, including a lot of our own people - and selective instrument for creating and financing investment where more gener­alised financial policies of the kind I have described have failed. And where goes state money for investment goes also public account­ability and an appropriate public share in the equity.In place of hit-or-miss financial measures such as we had from 1972 to 1973, based on vague hopes that somehow finance that has been created will find its way by some magic process into buildings and machinery and research and development - in place of all that, we shall inject public money, case by case, and plant by plant, where it is needed for exports or modernisation and to create new jobs in the regions.Some of it will go inevitably to save essential firms and industries in danger of collapse in the free-for-all jungle that we inherited. Some of it will go to firms which have no difficulty about survival but can survive only at the expense of expansion, or by postponing essential modernisations or by ruthlessly cutting down essential means of production. Some of it will go to create new ventures, on the basis of joint partnership with Government.All of it will go on the basis which other democratic countries have followed, that where there flows the regenerative public capital there goes with it a corresponding degree of public ownership and control. (Applause)Good Socialist doctrine, yes; it is good capitalist doctrine too. When the City of London puts its money in, it usually wants a corresponding say in the business, in the profits of the business, and in the control of the business.The life-giving investment British industry needs, and of which it has been so long starved, will, I believe, do more than anything else - except success in the battle against inflation itself - to overcome the crisis we are facing.In doing this we shall make industry more vigorous, more profitable, more up-to-date and competitive, more able to benefit from the introduction of a greater measure of industrial democracy and worker participation than we have ever previously sought to create in this country.This is the real answer to the cacophony of ignorance and malevolence of our opponents and the ideology masquerading as economic theory.They say that public money invested in industrial assets, for the purpose of modernising those assets, is a charge on the taxpayer, or that economic stability will be endangered by borrowing. But we are warned daily that industrialists are scaling down their investment intentions, and that there will be a drying up of private borrowing anyway.Those who argue in this way are, in fact, pre-Keynes, pre-John Maynard Keynes. While we have moved on from Keynes, vintage 1936, our opponents argue as though he never even existed. He said when private investment plans are inadequate there must be public investment to secure full employment. What he had in mind was public works, roads, sewage and drainage.That is why I claim the National Enterprise Board is the biggest leap forward in economic thinking, as well as in economic policy, since the war. For where private investment falls away, or even if it is not falling is on a scale far too small to ensure a high level of employ­ment and modernisation, when that is the posi­tion public investment is enlisted.Investment, not to produce goods which our customers do not want or cannot afford, but to make the goods with which we can pay our way in the world and modernise Britain.This is where we move the nation forward by a whole generation in our thinking and in our policy. And public investment, in deference to the late John Maynard Keynes, is to be mobilised, not to turn engineers into road workers, or for constructing drainage and sewage, but specifically directed in terms of the machinery, the plant, the research and develop­ment we so urgently need for the regeneration of British industry and the creation of a sharper cutting edge in the markets of the world,So, Mr. Chairman, at the outset of this Parliament the Labour Government, carrying as I believe the confidence of the nation, embarks on the greatest task any Government has faced in this country, certainly in peace time.For a year or two, I repeat, unable to hold out any hope of a general increase in living standards, but determined to ensure that sacrifices shall be fairly shared, and the burdens borne by the broadest backs.A Government determined that we shall no longer try to live on the production made by previous generation, and still less to mortgage the future which we want our people and our children to enjoy in full measure, as the treasures around our shores begin to raise our living standards.A Government determined to ensure that the social income, the social wage, shall rise within the priorities we have set, priorities related to, but limited by, the increase in our production we are asking from our people.A Government determined, even at a time when the increase in resources is constricted by external action, constricted as never before in the post-war world, on a clearly directed in­jection of investment into productive industry, to under-write our export drive and our industrial expansion alike, and not merely determined but now ready with the machinery through the National Enterprise Board, the Planning Agreements, and the rest of our policy, to make it a reality.Mr. Chairman, we have a five-year Parliament ahead of us. Five years of challenge. Five years of Labour Government, with the regeneration of British industry at the heart of its programme.It is a programme for the regeneration of Britain.It involves restraints and sacrifices.It means discipline and hard work through­out, in better times as well as in tough times.It means everybody, all of us in Government, in the Party, and throughout the nation, striving to make sure that the Social Contract works.But just as the burdens and sacrifices will be shared at the beginning, when the going is hard, so the future benefits will be shared with fairness and social justice among all our people. Shared according to socialist principles. Only a Labour Government can, and only this Labour Government - with your support - will carry those principles into action.When next year I again present the Parlia­mentary Report to Conference you will see that we will have gone further, further than anyone - anyone in the October election, further perhaps than anyone here in this hall this week - would have expected in turning into reality in one single year so much of the policy laid down in our Manifesto. (Prolonged applause)

aVI present the Parliamentary Report, a report on the implementation of the Manifesto we put to the people in the election of February 1974, and the one on which we fought the October election a year ago.The word \u2018Manifesto\u2019 is constantly heard these days, and that is right. No new Party grouping, over the whole spectrum of Party thinking, now considers itself respectable if it does not include the word \u2018Manifesto\u2019 in its title.We are all Manifesto custodians now. Never has there been such unity in the history of the Party in supporting the Manifesto - or such diversity in its interpretation. (Laughter)As Leader of the majority group in Parlia­ment, the MPs elected by your efforts and by a groundswell of national opinion last year, I have from 4 March, 1974 onwards regarded myself as a full-time, one-man Manifesto group. (Laugh­ter)The Parliamentary Report gives solid back­ing to my claim that no previous Prime Minister - no Labour Prime Minister and certainly no Conservative - has been able to present a record of a Government which has carried through so much of its Manifesto, by legislative and executive action in so short a time.In the four and a half months in which the House was sitting during the Short Parliament of last year, 35 Bills became law, and I ask you to bear with me for a moment while I list them.We passed the Trade Union and Labour Rela­tions Act which repealed the 1971 Industrial Relations Act, preserved and extended existing unfair dismissals provisions and extended trade union immunities; the Health and Safety at Work Act setting up the Health and Safety Commission; the Prices Act which abolished the Pay Board, provided £500 millions for food subsidies on key essential foodstuffs and strengthened the Price Code; we ended the sticky labels racket by prohibiting upward re-pricing of goods already on the shelves in the shops, and we restricted the frequency of implementation of price increases. In the National Insurance Act 1974 we fulfilled the Manifesto pledge to raise pensions to £10 for a single person and £16 for a couple; the Finance Act introduced major changes to eliminate tax dodgers. The Rent Act gave security of tenure to those in furnished accommodation. We doubled the Regional Employment Premium which Labour had introduced in 1967 and which the Conservatives were committed to abolish.That was the Short Parliament. With a minor­ity Labour Government. (Applause)Now the Manifesto on which we went to the country a year ago.First, Bills which have already been placed on the Statute Book in the terms of the Manifesto:Child Benefit, creating a new scheme of child credits; those are on the Statute Book; Finance (No. 1) introducing the Capital Transfer Tax; Finance (No. 2) tackling the lump; the Housing Rents and Subsidies Act, replacing the Tory Rent Act with a new financial system for public sector housing; the Offshore Petroleum Development (Scotland) Act nationalising land for oil construction sites; the Oil Taxation Act, fulfilling the Manifesto proposals for taxation of oil companies\u2019 profits on the North Sea; Pen­sioners\u2019 Payments; the Referendum Act fulfil­ling our pledge to give the British people the final say on membership of the EEC; the Social Sec­urity Benefits Act maintaining the real value of pensions and creating the new non-contributory invalidity benefit, invalid care allowances to help those families with disabled members, and increased family allowances; the Social Security Pensions Act totally reforming the whole system of state superannuation, and introducing the mobility allowance for the disabled. All those are on the Statute Book. I thought I would men­tion them just in case you might have forgotten any of them. (Applause)Now the Bills introduced, but not through all their Parliamentary stages:The Community Land Bill, providing for the public ownership of development land; the Employment Protection Bill providing new rights for workers at work; the Industry Bill turning into legislative form the White Paper on which we fought the election, creating the National Enter­prise Board and the system of Planning Agreements; the Petroleum and Submarine Pipelines Bill creating the British National Oil Corpora­tion and providing new powers of control over the pace of depletion and for the provision of pipelines; the Scottish Development Agency and Welsh Development Agency legislation establishing these two important new institu­tions in Scotland and Wales; the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Amendment) Bill remov­ing unacceptable Lords amendments forced into the previous year\u2019s Act in the conditions of our then minority Government; the socially re­distributive budgets of November and April; the Sex Discrimination Bill asserting new rights for women and creating the Equal Opportunities Commission. All these measures are before Parliament now.I clearly cannot anticipate the Queen\u2019s Speech opening the second session of this Parlia­ment, but a commitment has been given to the re-introduction of the Bill already published to take the aircraft and shipbuilding industries into public ownership; work is advanced - in some cases involving the drafting of the necessary legislation - on:Devolution; ending the 11-plus; abolishing agricultural tied cottages; the Development Land Tax; the transfer of New Town housing assets to local authorities; liberalising official secrets legislation; introducing an independent element into the procedure of complaints against the police; and a Race Relations Bill, to strengthen the existing legislation protecting minorities.Work is also going on on legislation to phase out pay beds; to bring the ports into public ownership; to create the Co-operative Development Agency; on weights and measures legislation to provide for unit pricing.Our outline proposals for a wealth tax have been published, and are being studied by a Par­liamentary Select Committee in advance of the introduction of legislation.The Government has announced its policy in respect of our pledge on industrial democracy and is setting up an enquiry to prepare the way for legislation.That is a breathtaking list. It is a record of which the whole Party should be proud. But it is too easily forgotten, as many of our Party mem­bers may already have forgotten it.It is a record made possible only by Ministers working full-time, MPs working full-time, and above all the Whips working full-time, all of them long into the night.But it is made possible by something else too. The Manifesto we are fulfilling provided the best programme on which this Party has ever fought a General Election.And that programme itself was made possible only by the fact that its preparation, in those Opposition years, was one which involved the whole Party, constituencies, affiliated organisations, the NEC and its sub-committees, and the 1973 Conference which spent the whole week on \u2018Labour\u2019s Programme,\u2019 in readiness for the preparation of the Manifesto which was agreed three months after that Conference, in accor­dance with Clause 5 of our Constitution, by the Executive and the then Shadow Cabinet.This legislative achievement, representing over half of our five-year programme commitments in the first twelve Parliamentary months since March 1974 (and it should be three\u2011quarters implemented by next year\u2019s Conference) is enormous by any standards, historical or international.Everyone in this Conference can be more than a little proud, as I have the right to be proud, as we recognise how much your Ministers have achieved in such a short period of time and in the most difficult economic climate for over 40 years.It is not just a question of quantity, of scores of bills and hundreds of clauses sweated through in days of committees and long nights in Parlia­ment itself.This record of pledges fulfilled is rooted in the philosophy and beliefs of the Labour Move­ment. It was constructed in consultation with MPs, trade unions and representatives of the Party in the country. And it reflects those themes and priorities which the Party estab­lished in opposition and which we believe are the ones which should now most concern a Labour Government. Let us take, for example, our industrial relations policy under Michael Foot which has replaced conflict with co-operation and, as we promised in the election campaigns, has healed the unnecessary wounds inflicted by the Tories on industry and, in so doing, has reunited the nation. From the repeal of the Industrial Relations Act, to our new Employ­ment Protection Bill. The Health and Safety at Work Commission. The ACAS which has been playing such a positive role in ending disputes.Just pause for a moment to contrast this wise and constructive attack on the problems of industrial relations with what we saw in the early 1970s. Cast your minds back: the then Conservative Cabinet - yes, all of it, not just those who are now on the Tory backbenches - approach­ing the sensitive and intricate system of human relations in industry with all the sense of purpose and sublime delicacy of a mob of football hooligans approaching a mainline railway sta­tion.It seems almost impossible to believe now, that so recently, the T& G were mulcted for £50,000 by an Order of the Court; to recall those bailiffs skulking round the back door of an Urban District Council in Durham to seize an AUEW investment.Or the expensive farce of a railway ballot when a Minister of the Crown was required by his legalistic-minded colleagues to spend public money printing and distributing ballot forms to 170,000 railwaymen for the purpose of asking them to give an answer to a totally convoluted question which in plain terms simply sought to inquire whether, after due consideration, they agreed with their General Secretary. They did, in the event, agree by 6 to 1.Or to recall without disbelief that a Cabinet, to the chagrin of the then Secretary of State for Employment, actually sat in Downing Street, duly pooling their collective Cabinet ignorance of the coalmining industry and the coalmining community to reach a decision - already decided by the Courts of the land 70 years earlier - on the question whether time spent by mineworkers bathing off the coal dust was or was not properly to be regarded as taking place in their employers\u2019 time. But all this did happen, and less than two years ago. It all seems like a different age. Neolithic.Our budgetary and social policies, have been governed by the pursuit of greater economic and social equality which has always been an ideal and objective of this Party. Redistribution of income. Restoration to the people of the wealth from land development; control of, and a fair share of the profits of, the oil beneath the North Sea.In the tax field, ending the loopholes in the taxes on wealth by the introduction of the Capi­tal Transfer Tax. Our proposals for wealth tax and our strong action against the lump.Major resources have been devoted to the expansion of the social services. These reflect our concern for the pensioner. Concern for the disabled and the under-privileged. The one-parent family. The long-term sick. The widow.Perhaps most dramatic, the Sex Discrimina­tion Bill which will come into force before the end of the year. Its radical proposals are in advance of anything in the world and will ensure equality of opportunity in all aspects of em­ployment, education, housing, services and facilities. This means that that half of our popu­lation will no longer be treated as second class citizens.Nor will they be paid as second class citizens. By the end of this year the Equal Pay legislation carried into law by the Labour Government in the late Sixties becomes 100 per cent effective. (Applause)But above all we have placed concern about housing, about building homes and protecting tenants in every section of our society, top of our list of priorities.Housing finance based on reflecting and cov­ering rising costs, tempered by the recognition of housing as a primary social service, and emphat­ically rejecting the Conservative 1971 doctrine that municipal housing should be a means of making a profit out of the tenants, for the municipal budget.These are the human, socialist values which underlie the legalistic titles of our Parliamentary legislation. Conference will see that we have kept faith with those values.Another thing: three weeks ago the Cabinet and National Executive met together to review what had been achieved, and to identify our priorities and to discuss the nation\u2019s most pres­sing problems - above all, inflation and unem­ployment.You did not read much about that meeting. It was entirely harmonious and constructive.But I felt it right on that occasion in giving my Parliamentary Report to the NEC to go beyond the Government\u2019s achievements in legislation and economic and social policies and to refer to Britain's role in world affairs.We all remember, and anyone studying the records of the NEC, and of Conference since the war, might estimate that the NEC has prob­ably spent 60 per cent of the time it devotes to policy discussions, and Conference 40 per cent, on overseas affairs.In some years these discussions were directed towards a very friendly and always constructive criticism of the Labour Government of the day. In other years, long years of opposition, we were trying to shape Party attitudes about what we thought the then ruling Conservative Govern­ment should be doing in foreign affairs.The fact that there have been less deep and fundamental arguments about overseas affairs in the last 18 months of Labour Government is not a reason for ignoring foreign affairs this week.On the contrary, what I can point to is a record of achievement and influence in significant areas of world affairs which I believe to have been unparalleled by any Government, Labour or Conservative, at any time since the war - and indeed long before that.Let us take, first, relations with the United States. I know that not everyone here is equally enthusiastic on this subject, though during the Referendum campaign I thought I detected a new-found insistence in certain quarters - unexpected quarters - that we must do nothing to endanger our transatlantic relations. I am sure this enthusiasm was not a passing phenomenon. (Laughter)What I was able to tell the Executive three weeks ago was that relations between Britain and the United States are now closer, are now more constructive, both in political and economic issues, than at any time in the political life of most of us. And that judgment is not mine - it comes from American leaders.Over the years we have had many debates about relations with the Soviet Union and other East European countries. The situation in 1975 has been described as \u2018historic.\u2019 Not my phrase - it is that of one of the top Soviet leaders during my visit last February.The Commonwealth. Anyone who was pre­sent at the meeting of 35 Commonwealth Heads of Government in Jamaica last May would have concluded - as my Commonwealth colleagues did - that Britain\u2019s relations with the Com­monwealth, again both political and economic, had never been better in our history.This is partly because Rhodesia no longer divides the Commonwealth. Tragically it divides only the African parties within Rhodesia, to the immense satisfaction of the white regime.It is also because South Africa does not divide us. The Commonwealth was torn apart a few months after Labour lost office in 1970 by the Conservatives\u2019 insistence on supplying arms to South Africa.On taking office in 1974, as in 1964, I gave immediate instructions that arms to South Africa should be stopped forthwith. (Applause) The arrangements to end the Simonstown Agreement followed soon after. And your Gov­ernment it was that declared the South African presence in Namibia to be unlawful and called upon them to withdraw.Again with Europe. Following renegotiation, the Government gave the people the final right to decide, as we had promised in our Manifesto.The people decided.And the way we conducted the campaign - particularly the then much-criticised \u2018agree­ment to differ,\u2019 within the Cabinet, within the Executive - fulfilled my very confident predic­tion at the time, which many doubted, that the Party would come out of that campaign not weaker but stronger, not divided but more united.That is what happened. The issue was settled by the people themselves and it has now been virtually accepted.The argument is over.We are using our influence, Jim Callaghan at the Council of Ministers, both of us at the regu­lar Summits, not only to assert British economic interests and those of a wider Europe but on political matters too. Remember it was the Commonwealth Prime Ministers who recorded - on their own initiative, not mine - that \u2018British membership of the Community was of value in encouraging the Community to be more outward looking towards the rest of the world.\u2019Take one issue - Portugal. The Communi­ty\u2019s joint decisions, at Council of Ministers and Heads of Government level, our Declaration offering aid to Portugal on the basis of the resto­ration of pluralistic democracy, and only on that basis. Our decision to approach Eastern European powers at Helsinki to assert the right of freedom, democracy and socialism in Portugal.This was supplemented by the emergency meeting in Stockholm last month of Socialist Prime Ministers and other leaders, followed by the meeting I convened earlier this month in London of Socialist Prime Ministers.Conference should not underrate the part Bri­tain\u2019s Labour Government has played in what we hope will be a lasting, peaceful, democratic, socialist settlement. Nor should it underrate the contribution of this week\u2019s Conference to his­tory, in what was said here and what was done here, yesterday, on Spain.Relations with America; with the Soviet Union; relations with the Commonwealth; rela­tions with Europe, particularly directed towards democracy in Europe.That was my report to the National Executive three weeks ago.Following that report I felt justified in asking my colleagues, some with 30 years in Parlia­ment, some with a record of political activity going back well before the War, if they could recall a time, and if they could to name the year, when relations with the United States were bet­ter.If they could recall a time, and name the year, when relations with the Soviet Union were bet­ter.If they could recall a time when relations with the Commonwealth were better.If they could recall a time when relations with Europe were better.Still more, could anyone name some halcyon period when relations with America, with the Soviet Union, with the Commonwealth and with Europe were better than now - and all at the same time? Not one such era was recalled by my very experienced colleagues on behalf of Her Majes­ty\u2019s Government; not one year was nominated.In twenty-two years on the Executive this was the first time that we could record a measurable period of absolute silence on the Executive. (Laughter and applause)Today, to this Conference, I put the same thought - is there anyone here, however long their apprenticeship and work in the Labour Movement, who can answer those questions, who can name a comparable period? You do not need to answer now. Take your time, I will give you notice of the question and you can let me know. There are many reasons why I can make this claim, but you cannot exclude as a major one the conduct of our foreign and commonwealth affairs by Jim Callaghan and his team, nor the remarkable and widely-acclaimed record of our two successive Ministers for Overseas Development at a time of great financial string­ency.But not only in the political aspects of world affairs, but in advancing those ideals in world economic relationships which have inspired Socialists, and so often illumined the work of Conference.The proposals, for example, which I tabled at the Jamaica Commonwealth Conference represented the biggest international economic initiative ever put forward by a Prime Minister of this country.It incorporated ideas frequently debated here, ideas which were incorporated by some of us in War on Want 23 years ago, which led to the creation of the \u2018War on Want\u2019 Organisation. But they were recognised by Commonwealth leaders last May as relevant to the acute prob­lems facing the Third World today. The old division between advanced industrialised, importing countries and developing countries, which are primary producers, food and raw mat­erial exporting countries, a division which has been revolutionised by the economic cataclysms of the past two years.The increased cost of oil - now increased again - the increased cost of many raw materi­als and food have certainly hit advanced coun­tries such as Britain and other European and North American countries. But how much more has it hit developing countries? Developing countries fall into two general groups: the new rich, or potentially rich, who have gained from the higher oil and com­modity prices, and the rest - right down to some already on the very margin of starvation who have suddenly found themselves forced to pay vastly increased amounts for their oil, their oil-based fertilisers, their feeding stuffs, their raw materials and their agricultural implements. The old poor and the starving within the world are now the new very poor.Our proposals, therefore, calling for stabilisa­tion not only of commodity prices, but of stabilising developing countries\u2019 earnings from their exports, were deliberately directed to this problem.More than that, they recognised the deep and undeniable desire by Third World countries to get a fair division of the world\u2019s resources and prosperity.In my initiative I made it clear, and I quote: \u2018the British Government fully accept that the relationship, the balance, between the rich and poor countries of the world is wrong and must be remedied. That is the principle on which my proposals rest: that the wealth of the world must be redistributed in favour of the poverty stricken and the starving. This means a new deal in world economics, in trade between nations and the terms of that trade.\u2019I called for the recognition of the \u2018inter­dependence\u2019 of producers and consumers. I said that, especially in the General Agreement we proposed, there was a need to \u2018lay heavy emphasis on the special needs of the poorest countries.\u2019Now that initiative was given a warm wind by my fellow Commonwealth Heads of Govern­ment in Jamaica. It was warmly welcomed - welcomed indeed as being directly designed to achieve some of the principal aims of those many Third World countries there calling for a New Economic Order.The report of the Commonwealth Experts\u2019 Group on those proposals and others played an important part in the special session of the UN General Assembly earlier this month.Our proposals were welcomed by the US Government immediately after Jamaica. They were reflected in the decisions of the Council of Foreign Ministers of the European Community on 22 July. Now they go forward for further action by the UNCTAD Conference in Nairobi next spring.I remember previous Party Conferences 20 and more years ago, when some of us put for­ward some of these ideas, when there was great enthusiasm for them in this Party, qualified by a feeling that this was never going to happen under what proved to be 13 years of Tory Government; and that when we looked at the reac­tionary attitudes of the Parliaments and Governments in power in so many advanced coun­tries, there was a bit of cynicism, a feeling all this would remain a pious Socialist vision, a blue­print, never likely to become a reality.But now those ideas are the policy of this Government, widely acclaimed in advanced and developing countries alike and occupying the centre of the stage for the world economic discussions of the next few months.The issues this Conference faces, above all, are inflation and unemployment. I am not today going to apportion the blame for successive phases of inflation. Whether it be the Tory free-for-all under Barber or the oil price rise or the rapid growth in pay settlements or the decline in the exchange rate - or all of then.But inflation is our great enemy. The threat to our objectives and ideals. It is inflation which has stopped us re-expanding the economy and getting rid of unemployment. In this sense infla­tion is the father and mother of unemployment.We are in, and we all recognise this, for a harsh winter. The toughest part lies ahead. We have to face up to the consequences of the situa­tion in which we and the world find ourselves. The worst world recession since the thirties. Our inflation more than twice that of our com­petitors. Because of this and the five-fold oil price increase, we spent abroad last year 14 pence in the pound more than we earned abroad. Less this year - a great narrowing of the gap - but still a formidable total and a serious addition to our already heavy overseas debt.The country recognises, and the world recog­nises, the Labour Government\u2019s determination to conquer the problem of inflation.The Conservatives kept telling us that either we had to have a legally binding incomes policy or we had to abandon ourselves to the free mar­ket, to the rigours of monetary control and the dismantling of our social services, including housing.On this they agreed there was no middle way. The only thing they were incapable of seeing was the only sensible course in a modern democracy: the course of agreement and consent.While our opponents pursued their barren alternatives, with increasingly tedious repeti­tion, we were in the process of reaching an his­toric agreement with the TUC. The policy was based on consent, endorsed by the trade union movement, and overwhelmingly accepted by the country.The months immediately ahead, I have said, are going to be hard. But this tough period, so far from providing an excuse for relaxing our attack on inflation, is itself a reason for pressing it home. It would be fatal to relax now - fatal to this country, this Government, this Movement. This is the only means, this is the one way only, by which we can bring unemployment down as the world recession gives way to expansion; the only means to moving forward to full employment.And the way forward now is to build on our negotiations with the TUC and all sides of industry. This will inevitably be a constantly develop­ing relationship in which not just the TUC but trade unions and management will become more involved in the fight against inflation and the wider management of our economy.Reflation cannot start before we are certain that inflation is stopping.The Government last week announced our measures for dealing with the immediate threat of increased unemployment this winter and especially to deal with the problem the school leavers of 1975 are facing.The steps we have introduced are direct, immediate, relevant. They will not sustain any further growth of inflation. They will not involve any lasting increase to local government or to national government expenditure, other than specific help to industrial investment, restruc­turing and modernisation. They are directed to fulfilling social objectives, for example in urban renewal and other urgent programmes; they are directed to providing not only jobs but training, by apprenticeships and in other ways, for our young people. These are emergency measures for the period immediately ahead. The way we must drive towards full employment, once inflation is dealt with, will require different methods, and every one of us knows that one of the biggest long-term problems we have had to face for a generation past has been the total inadequacy of new capi­tal investment. The amount of our annual national dividend ploughed back into capital investment for the future. And not merely the amount, but the quality of that investment.But that is not all.We have been getting less out of the invest­ment we have made. Over the last 20 years, for every extra unit of output that we have obtained in this country from a given amount of investment, France and Italy have gained half as much again, Japan twice as much and West Germany well over two and a half times as much.And we cannot get the benefit of increased investment in industries or firms if strikes are to condemn the equipment to idleness, or if over-­manning cancels out the gains from the new investment. But more than that. If we spend our time arguing how to work less and spend more we shall end up having to work more and being able to spend less. Our policy for industry was set out a year ago in the White Paper \u2018The Regeneration of British Industry,\u2019 on which we fought the October Election and on which the legislation on the National Enterprise Board and Planning Agreements now before Parliament is based.What we promised in that White Paper we have carried through.I repeat, Britain\u2019s failure is that we have con­stantly not invested enough throughout the post-war period. But particularly not invested where we need it most: in the markets that are expanding, on which future jobs depend. We have to make the products for which there is a demand both at home and abroad. For this, it is not enough just to invest in our traditional indus­tries. We have to be ready to support new initiatives and to seize opportunities. And this is the importance of the NEB and the direct sup­port now given by the Government to industry.The urgent action which we had to take to deal with areas of industrial and social policy neg­lected by the Tories caused us to increase the real volume of public expenditure by nearly 8 per cent in the first year of this Government.It was a catching-up exercise to reverse three-and-a-half years of increasing inequality, and to provide the help that we promised, as a priority, to those in greatest need.But the very speed and determination with which we acted means we are close to the limit now, and for some time ahead, for public expen­diture as compared with take-home incomes.The Chancellor has made it clear that he rejects panic cuts in public expenditure this winter. Indeed, as I have said, we have increased the funds for training and short-term work to meet social and industrial priorities. But in the regular reviews which we undertake each year of the programme, into the period when full employment and high industrial activ­ity may cause production problems, in the reviews we have to make, up to five years ahead, long after the immediate recession will have ended, we shall make sure that our expenditure is strictly related to our priorities. Once those decisions on priorities are taken - and they will not be easy decisions - our methods of control will ensure that spending is strictly controlled within the objectives we have chosen. Faced with these vast economic problems, I propose to reflect the political realities of this country by sparing only a very few moments to refer to her Majesty\u2019s Official Opposition. Not personalities, of course. Every time I look at the anonymous characters who from time to time rise from the Opposition Front Bench, I can discern there no more than the occasional retreads (Laughter), relieving the otherwise drab landscape of the failed young Conser­vatives of a succession of non-vintage years. (Laughter) I bet not one delegate in fifty at this Confer­ence, not one in a hundred at next week\u2019s Tory Conference, not one in ten of our skilled and omniscient press correspondents, could name the top 12 Conservative spokesmen on major subjects, without access to the reference books. (Laughter)So I will not deal with personalities, but policies, and clearly that will not take long either. (Laughter)On none of the major questions of our time have they put forward an alternative economic, social or, for that matter, foreign policy. We have not heard from the Shadow Foreign Secretary. The deep divisions on almost every issue which we now know to have dominated the life of their 3½ years in Government, have persisted, deepened and become articulate.The country knows the depth of their scarcely disguised divisions. Half of the last Tory Cabinet could not run fast enough to dissociate from the policies they agreed with when they were in government - policies on which, let us remind them, they so strongly fought the two general elections in 1974.But on the major issues of 1975, the Labour Government\u2019s attack on inflation, both on the White Paper and the legislation, on these we have had this summer a humiliating spectacle across the floor of the House. The Opposition timidly moving an ineffective and totally unspecific form of words by way of amendment. Then, when the moment of decision came - twice, in successive weeks, first the vote on whether to accept or reject the White Paper, and, a week later, whether to accept or reject the legislation - Her Majesty\u2019s Opposition collec­tively sat on their collective hands. Nothing to say. Nowhere to go. No alternative. No gui­dance to their own people, still less to the country.In fact, all we get, week in week out, is their reiteration of their demands for swingeing cuts in public expenditure, by which they mean, of course, social expenditure.But what they still have not learned is you cannot demand massive expenditure cuts with­out committing yourself to devastating decisions on policy, including some of the main spending programmes of the last Conservative Govern­ment. As the Conservative Party now hurdles backwards - and it is a very difficult athletic feat (laughter) - as it now hurdles backwards over two centuries to Adam Smith, let me remind them of the words of the now discarded Disraeli, in the House of Commons:Mere abstract and declaratory opinions in favour of reduction and retrenchment are of no use whatsoever. I have so often maintained it in this House that I am almost ashamed to repeat it, but unfortunately it is not a principle which has yet sufficiently entered into public opinion - expenditure depends on policy.That was Disraeli, 1862. But more. The Con­servative Party are, in fact, committed to vast increases in public expenditure.They voted against the cuts of £600 million in defence which the Government announced. This means they must obviously want to add £600 million to the Government\u2019s expenditure. They opposed us when we cancelled Maplin. They opposed us when we stopped work on the Channel Tunnel. This was the Party which last October sought a meretricious electoral bonus by their promise of 9½ per cent  mortgages -  and, what is more, by Christmas, at a cost of £180 million. The Building Societies\u2019 own estimate was £300 million.Let our people not forget that their means of paying for this electoral bribe was their carefully prepared plan - never, fortunately, put into effect - to confine local authority houses, and no doubt new town houses, to particular limited social groups, ghettoes for the old, the sick, the disabled and handicapped. That was their poli­cy. To pay for increased defence expenditure, for Maplin, the Channel Tunnel, 9½ per cent mortgages and the abolition of domestic rates, they would have to reduce the social services and all other Government expenditure by many thousands of millions of pounds even to get back to where they started from.Ask them to be specific, ask them what they would cut, and their only reply is: \u2018slash or abolish the housing subsidies and abolish the food subsidies.\u2019They are specifically committed to increasing the cost of the shopping basket by 76p per week to an average family, 46p to a pensioner. They are specifically committed to forcing up housing rents to undreamed-of figures. Their answer to inflation and rising prices is to put a surcharge on the shopping basket of every family and a further surcharge on the rents of millions of households. The basic needs of every family are shelter and food, and the Tories\u2019 sole prescription for tackling inflation is to put up the cost of both. At last they have told us why. I want you to mark this. The Party which a century ago Dis­raeli committed to the doctrine of \u2018One Nation\u2019 is now proclaiming across the world their resentment at what they regard as \u2018the rich becoming poorer and the poor becoming richer.\u2019They talk about class politics. Who is it now who is insisting on introducing class policies into England\u2019s green and pleasant land? For 18 months we have challenged them to produce an alternative economic policy - apart from put­ting up food prices and rents. In Parliament, in the country, we have had no answer. Now the message has been flashed to the people of Britain, even if it has had to be bounced off a transatlantic satellite. The politi­cal philosophy of a once great Party has now been asserted. Not a claim to unite the nation, but a policy to divide it.We have been told, on impeccable and unde­niable authority, that the pursuit of inequality for its own sake is now to become an end in itself. It is now to become the altar, the deity, before which they seek to prostrate themselves - and the country.The hard-faced doctrine - proclaimed last week - is that to get taxation down we have got to cut spending on the social wage - now £20 for every family in Britain.What is this social wage? It is the Health Ser­vice, the kids\u2019 education, the people\u2019s housing, the help for those in greatest need, including the unprecedented provision we have made for the disabled and those least able to help themselves.That is their social philosophy. Their economic policy, at least, is more specific. After two months\u2019 lucubrations their Shadow Chan­cellor has emerged into the light and suddenly announced their fiscal policy: a demand for immediate changes in the tax laws to enable us to keep three distinguished pop groups safely within the three-mile limit. (Laughter)Your Government, with I believe a great swell of public support going far beyond our own Party, has taken and is taking the action neces­sary not only to bring Britain through the world crisis, but also to create, in the words of last year\u2019s Manifesto, \u2018a fairer, more democratic and more socially just society.\u2019Recent years have seen a great change in the role of this Party. After spending the greater part of our 75 years of history in Opposition, from being the Party of protest we have now become the natural Party of Government in this country. (Applause) Given that this present Parliament runs its full term, then, of the 15 years from October 1964 to October 1979, we shall have been in office for nearly 11½ of them.And let us have the humility to recognise that this is so not because of the merits of any of us, but because of those in the Party nationally and locally, to the trade union movement and the co-operative movement, who, over 75 years, in a vastly more daunting and difficult political environment, fought on with that unconquerable optimism that \u2018these things shall be.\u2019It is now our task to see that these things shall be. And, as the Party of Government, we have to ensure that simply because we are the Party of Government we are still able to fulfil the role of protest. All of us. Ministers, Members of Par­liament, constituency parties, affiliated organisations, Executive, Conference, the wider Party.All those who have reason to protest should recognise our Party as the natural voice to express that protest; for there is none other.That is why I want to stress today the respon­sibilities falling on this Party, and every member of it, in the new historic role we now occupy and will continue to occupy for the foreseeable future. I have spoken of the role of the whole Party in creating and preparing the policy which this Government is carrying out.What I call for now is nothing less than the regeneration of the Party in this role, the regeneration of the Party on the basis of mutual toler­ance and respect.We have an unprecedented national consen­sus, the trade union movement, Party and Government.At national level we have given the lead. We need the stimulus of support and constructive criticism from the Movement throughout the country.What is appalling is that so many of our Con­stituency parties, particularly in safe seats, are so small in number and in some cases so unre­presentative.This was a fact which was emphasised in the Wilson Report on Party Organisation debated at Conference 20 years ago this week, together with the specific proposals we put forward for creating mass membership. This has not hap­pened. We drew attention then to parties, particularly in safe Labour seats, deliberately kept small for the purpose of concentrating power and local authority seats in small cliques. This has not ended.But there is also the fact of some Labour seats, not always strong Labour seats, where there is great public support for the Party, but where membership is kept abysmally low mainly because those who would wish to join in the Party work come once, come twice and, feeling unwelcome, come no more.This Party needs to protect itself against the activities of small groups of inflexible political persuasion, extreme so-called left and (Applause) in a few cases extreme so-called moderates, (Applause) having in common only their arrogant dogmatism. These groups, equally the multichromatic coalitionist fringe or groups specifically formed to fight other maraud­ing groups, these are not what this Party is about. (Applause) Infestation of this kind thrives only, and can thrive only, in minuscule local parties.We have all talked at one time or another about City sharks who lie in wait until they can make a take-over bid for some small company which has some rich asset or large liquid funds. But in our democracy, in our Party or any other, there is no richer asset than a seat with a five-figure majority. As Socialists we should do all in our power to control and sublimate pre­datory instincts in all situations.However, this happens, whether through lazi­ness and apathy or by infiltration, often mig­ratory infiltration - what in Yorkshire we used to call \u2018comers-in\u2019 (Laughter) - the result can too easily be groups of little exclusivities insist­ing on a monopoly of doctrine, thriving on noisy debate reflecting some esoteric theory which has nothing in common with a century of the politi­cal idealism and purpose of this Movement. Because what has proved possible is a take-over bid for a 20,000 majority seat based on an incur­sion of little more than a dozen.Nor does the answer lie in the formation of the kind of anti-party group which has been disporting itself in Blackpool this weekend (Applause) leaking, as is their wont, their smears to an ever-ready Tory press. We have seen them at it before, a coup executed a few weeks before the last February election, a coup designed not to help the Labour Party, a coup designed to make it impossible for some of us to carry on.The success of this Government depends on two things. First, the participation of the whole Movement in our programme and our Manifes­tos as in these recent years. Second, a determined Government, a determined Parliamen­tary Labour Party, such as we have today with well over 300 Labour members, there with the backing of 11.5 million Labour voters.Can anyone in a broad democratic movement such as ours assert the claim that a man or a woman elected by 25,000 Labour voters one week, should be given his cards the following week by a small group of 50, who in themselves represent only 1 in 500 of the Labour voters who elected him and who, only last year recommend­ed such a man to the electorate? (Applause) We need bigger membership, a membership fully representative of our people. Even a Party with a thousand members might embody only 1 in 25 or 1 in 30 of those who voted Labour.At local level - I make this appeal - while the record of some unions is good - we need much more popular trade union identification not only by the fact of affiliation but by active work and influence. (Applause)I am expressing here, of course, a personal view, as Leader of the Party. But it is based on a little experience, of having, for my sins, chaired the Organisation Committee of the National Executive for longer than anyone else since the War.But there is another consideration. I have led this Party, so far, for 12½ years in unpre­cedented and difficult times for all of us.During those 12½ years \u2013 and this is without precedent - I challenge anyone to dispute this - not one of the near 600 Labour Members of Parliament who have served in Parliament over these years has had the Party Whip withdrawn. I am proud of that. I am proud, too, that almost my first act on being elected Leader was to insist, against a more than resistant Shadow Cabinet, that the Whip be restored to six Mem­bers of Parliament, one of whom is now in the Cabinet. He replied to the economic debate yes­terday, with the full acclamation of Conference. (Applause)I therefore have the right to ask who are these self-appointed Samurai who seek to assert a power of political life and death which the lead­ership of this Party and the Whips\u2019 Office and the Organisation Sub-Committee of the Labour Party have not in modern times sought to assert. (Interruption) I did, not ask anyone to identify themselves; it was a rhetorical question. (Laughter and Applause)As a Party we are committed to real industrial democracy. What we say should take place in industry, we cannot deny to our own Party members.We demand more participation; if we mean what we say then democracy means the full participation of every Labour member in the biggest decision a constituency Party is asked to make - the decision who shall, or who shall not, rep­resent them in Parliament.Still more, when a candidate has received the stamp of electoral support, extremely grave cause is required, and the fullest participation of party democracy is needed, if the electorate is to be denied the right to re-elect him as an endorsed Labour candidate.Our strength lies not in enforced uniformity of Party doctrine. It is based on tolerance, and argument, on the ferment of political ideas and political passion - not regimentation. I do not want to lead a Party of zombies.For those who arrogantly seek to impose their doctrine, other than by the democratic machinery of the Party or the Party institutions, including the Parliamentary Labour Party, would, if they succeeded, strike a great blow not only against our Movement, but against democ­racy in this country. What we are seeing is not the means of creat­ing democracy and socialism. The strength, the support, the stimulus, the democratic criteria, the Executive, the Conference, the Government need in a democratic Party can only come from Constituency organisations much more rep­resentative of those who vote and those who work for Labour victory.I call then for the regeneration of our Party, as a requisite to the regeneration of our country. Active, lively discussion in all our constituent organisations, national and local, political and industrial, acting not only as a stimulus and spur to Government, and Government\u2019s keenest cri­tic, but as a source of fresh ideas for the Man­ifesto we shall all before long be involved in - when this Parliament has spent its course.Let none forget that \u2018Labour's Programme, 1973,\u2019 which provided so rich a quarry of mater­ial for our Manifestos was projected not for one Parliament only but for the years ahead in this decade and the next. The Manifesto on which we fought last year\u2019s elections, put before the country a programme for one Parliament, for five years. I understand, indeed I welcome, the impatience of so many in the Party who are disappointed that we have not in fifteen months carried through to the last dot and comma, everything we promised the British people as our programme for a whole Parliament - not to mention those who are just disappointed that we have not carried the whole 15-year programme through in 15 months.But it is not too early now, in the light of our experiences, to be testing and developing that 15-year programme for the years ahead.Conference knows that on the four occasions when I have received the commission to form a government, those appointed have joined together at a service of dedication in the Crypt Chapel in the Palace of Westminster.Taking the service some years ago - nine years ago - Lord Soper, one of our Socialist peers, expressed the spirit of dedication in words which have now been embodied in suc­cessive services and which will be invoked again as each successive Government is formed. I do not think any words are more appropriate to express the ideals of this Movement as we celeb­rate the 75 years of Socialist endeavour and achievement. This is what he asked:Grant us a vision of our land, fair as it might be;A land of righteousness where none shall wrong his neighbour;A land of plenty where evil and poverty shall be done away;A land of brotherhood where all success shall be founded on service, and honour shall be given to excellence alone;A land of peace, where order shall not rest on force, but on the love of all for the common life and weal;Bless our efforts to make the vision a living reality;Inspire and strengthen each one of us that we may give time, thought and sacrifice to speed the day of its coming.At this grave testing time for our nation, I shall be content that we be all judged not only by those whose trusteeship we keep - the British nation - but by history, and judged by what we together, each of us, contribute to turning that ideal into a reality. (A standing ovation)

aVMr. Chair­man, comrades it is indeed an honour to stand before you today as Leader of our Party and to present to you the report of the Parliamentary Labour Party.My first words must be a tribute to the man who led us for 13 years, in good times and in bad, never faltering and never losing heart. He led us into five elections and he won four of them. Now he has decided to retire from the Leadership, but not from active public life - unchallenged and finally undefeated. The Conservatives never could master him. Indeed, to tell the truth, I think the National Executive gave him much more trouble than the Tories ever did! But quite apart from his well-known qualities as an out­standing Party Leader and a long-to-be­-remembered Prime Minister, countless rank and file members in our Movement, whose names will never hit the headlines, know him for his personal kindliness, for his complete lack of self-importance and for his generosity. He is, in the true sense of the word, a \u2018comrade.\u2019 I hardly know which of his many achievements will rank highest. But if he were asked - and I have not asked him - I have a suspicion that he would place among the things he really values his success in overcoming opposition and doubts and carrying through to a permanent place in our educational system, the Open University.All of us in public life, whether it be ward secretary or Prime Minister, know that we can­not do our best work unless we have the con­tinuous, unfailing support and understanding of our wives. Any tribute to Harold would be incomplete without us expressing our affection to Mary also. Harold and Mary, Conference salutes you both. (Applause)This annual report, I am bound to warn you, will miss his whiplash and his wit. All I can do is to follow his electoral example and lead you to victory in four elections out of the next five. (Applause) All aspirants to the Party Leadership, look out.There now exists a broad framework of toler­ance and comradeship in the Party. Differences of opinion, strongly held, there will be and they will be passionately argued this week. But in a democratic socialist party there is no monopoly of revealed truth. Each of us knows that he has something to learn from the others.Let me start by expressing my sincere appreciation - and I ask Conference to do so too - to my ministerial and parliamentary col­leagues for their unflagging hard work during the last year. It has been a tough year. For long months we governed without an overall par­liamentary majority. Sometimes we had to rely on colleagues who should have been in hospital or at home in bed, who risked their health to be Present in the House of Commons to see that Labour\u2019s programme was carried through. And you know that it has been carried through. Take this Session\u2019s Parliamentary Bills: ship­building nationalisation; aircraft nationalisation; tied cottages; comprehensive education; pay beds; all these are straight out of the Manifesto. All were opposed line by line by the Tories, all were fought for in the House of Commons by the Parliamentary Labour Party. Sometimes I think those who ask us to stick to the Manifesto are a little selective in their reading of what it con­tains. It was a collective and united effort, but let me thank the two men who had the final respon­sibility of making sure that the members were always - or at least, almost always - in the right place at the right time, the two Chief Whips, Bob Mellish and Michael Cocks. (Applause)Comrades, there is a line of poetry which is a good line for socialists, even if it was not intended to be:A man\u2019s reach should exceed his graspOr what\u2019s a Heaven for?While our Conference will constantly reach towards new territory it gives us also a chance to put into perspective what we have done. I ask you all to read the outstanding check list that was reproduced in Labour Weekly a few weeks ago. The remarkable thing is not what we have failed to do, but how much has been carried out before we have reached even the half-way stage of this Parliament.Nor were we elected on a false or a fake per­spective. Let me remind those who wish us to stick to the Manifesto what its opening words were: \u2018Britain faces its most dangerous crisis since the war. The Manifesto went on to describe the worst world recession since the 1930\u2019s, the five-fold increase in oil prices, an ever-narrowing industrial base and a level of economic performance which had been in steady decline, compared with our major competitors, for almost a generation. It is all there to read \u2013 \u2018the most danger­ous crisis since the war.\u2019We followed a government whose failure to understand the trade unions led them into con­flict and confrontation, and which inevitably crashed in the chaos of the three-day working week. Labour was elected to heal that terrible wound which Tory obstinacy had inflicted on the nation: to replace conflict by partnership, confrontation by co-operation. We knew this was the only way for the country. The British people knew it. Our critics at home and our friends abroad knew it. Even the Tories in their own hearts knew it. There is no better way. So we repealed the Industrial Relations Act. We passed into law the new Trade Union and Labour Relations Act. We put on the statute book an Act to protect employment. We passed an Act to safeguard health and safety at work. We have established the new Advisory, Concili­ation and Arbitration Service for both sides of industry to use. Taken together these measures have given us a framework for industrial rela­tions which has enabled us to rebuild confidence between the trade unions and the Government. It has served Britain well. Consider the improvement in relations on the workshop floor. The number of days lost through industrial dis­putes this year is the lowest for any comparable period since 1967. And the number of disputes is lower than at any time since 1953. That should be the headline news; that is what the world should be hearing about Britain.At a time when our foreign competitors and, even more important, our customers are ready to believe the worst, I say to the world that this Government has created an industrial framework based on voluntary methods that can serve as a model to anyone throughout the rest of the world. It should be used; we cannot afford not to do so.But industrial relations is not just a matter of avoiding strikes, important though that is. That is a negative approach. Britain\u2019s present economic position demands a positive approach: a new spirit of co-operation in indus­try, yes, co-operation between employers and trade unionists, changes of attitude on both sides. As I go around - and I do this a lot more these days than I used to - I find more and more active trade unionists, not theoreticians, but active trade unionists on the shop floor, recog­nising that they share a joint responsibility in their place of work. The ordinary worker is get­ting more and more outspoken in his opposition to the small bands of disrupters in industry. Where management is enlightened it, too, sees the need to change its attitude. \u2018Theirs not to reason why\u2019 is no more a recipe for industrial success than it was for military.Now we look for further progress on two fronts. First, the Government is awaiting the report of the Bullock Committee on Industrial Democracy. When I visited the Federal Repub­lic of Germany a little earlier this year, Chancel­lor Helmut Schmidt arranged a meeting which I could attend between members of the Bullock Committee which included some delegates to this conference - notably Jack Jones and Clive Jenkins, as well as David Lea of the TUC and others - and their German opposite numbers who already have 25 years\u2019 experience of worker participation. The Bullock Committee will reach its own conclusions and present them to the Government. But I want to say that I came away from that meeting with the German Chancellor and the representatives of German employers and German workers convinced that the introduction of a system of industrial demo­cracy into British industry must be given high priority by the Government when the Bullock Committee has reported. (Applause)Second, we should like to see much faster progress on the question of Planning Agree­ments. So far there is a marked reluctance on industry\u2019s part, on management\u2019s part, to enter into Planning Agreements. Perhaps it is a reflec­tion of the \u2018theirs but to do and die\u2019 mentality that I have referred to. Some people - I have heard it expressed here - would like to see these agreements made compulsory. I am always a little dubious about the long-term success of shot-gun marriages. We have to convince the management of our larger firms and industries that Planning Agreements are in their interests too: that they will be a major factor in encouraging the productivity and efficiency so vitally needed. Our offer of co-operation extends to industry also.It is not by accident that I decided to begin this report by discussing the Government\u2019s attitude to industrial relations and industrial co­operation. Nor have I done so just to show what a hash the Conservative Government made of it. I start with this because until there is agreement on the place of the human being in our industrial society, we shall push and pull at the economic levers in vain. We have expected too much from the economic mechanisms and we have, paid insufficient attention to the most important component of all - the human element.The worker\u2019s relationship with his tools, his integration with his working environment, is the most important unresolved problem in our com­plex industrial society today. We have a people who are better educated, better informed, who have escaped from the deference of my youth and who now look to Government, to employers and to the trade unions to provide a framework and an environment that befits their higher status.This Conference decided again yesterday, two and a half years after our election, that there is still no better way forward than the Social Contract to give life to this concept. That is as true for the employers as it is for the workers. Does any employer nowadays assert, if he ever did, that he preferred the days of Tory confrontation? Does anyone believe that unem­ployment will be brought down faster under the Tories? Does anyone think that with their sorry record of conflict the Tories could have halved the inflation rate over the last rate? Does anyone know what Tory economic policy really is? Do they advocate incomes policy or a free-for-all? Which is it - either, neither or both? No-one knows. Does anyone know whether the Tories would reflate or deflate? They talk of cutting Government spending. Does anyone know what more they would cut? Have they told us? They talk of cutting taxes. Whose taxes? Perhaps we can guess, but have they told us? Do we know? Would the tax cuts be larger or smaller than the spending cuts? Would the budget deficit be larger or smaller; does anyone know? Does any­one know how they will work with the trade union movement? Do they want to return to the conflicts of 1973, or do they now say \u2013 \u2018We too will work the Social Contract.\u2019 No-one knows. But how can a Tory Party even offer a Social Contract to the trade unions when it is pledged to the social policies and inequalities which strike at the, roots of our own movement? No. The Social Contract stands confirmed yesterday for the next three years because there is no other way, and it demands complete co-operation between the Party, the Government and the unions.When I say there is no other way, that does not mean that it is going to be quick or easy. That has been promised before. It is neither. Britain has lived for too long on borrowed time, borrowed money, borrowed ideas. We live in too troubled a world to be able to promise that in a matter of months, or even in a couple of years, that we shall enter the promised land. The route is long and hard. But the long march has at last begun, and I hope to lead you at least some part of the way, with the Social Contract and our industrial strategy as our guide.For too long, perhaps ever since the war, we postponed facing up to fundamental choices and fundamental changes in our society and in our economy. That is what I mean when I say we have been living on borrowed time. For too long this country - all of us, yes, this Conference too - has been ready to settle for borrowing money abroad to maintain our standards of life, instead of grappling with the fundamental problems of British industry. Governments of both parties have failed to ignite the fires of industrial growth in the ways that countries with very different political and economic philosophies have done. Take Germany; France, Japan - different countries, different philosophies. We are, as you know, still borrowing money. But this time we are not borrowing - if the Government con­tinues on its present course - to pay for yet another short-lived consumer boom of the kind which used to buy success at the polls - or so we were told - but which never bought success in the world\u2019s markets or at the work place. We are borrowing now partly to pay for our huge investment in the North Sea. We are borrowing, too, because other industrial nations volunteer credits, so that our strategy and our proposals for regenerating British industry need not be thwarted by short-term speculative movements of sterling balances - a load we have still been unable to shed. We are determined that this borrowing will be used to act and to press on with the task of rebuilding a regenerated manufactur­ing industry. This time we are not going for a consumer boom on borrowed money: we are going to invest it in our future.The cosy world we were told would go on for ever, where full employment would be guaran­teed by a stroke of the Chancellor\u2019s pen, cutting taxes, deficit spending, that cosy world is gone. Yesterday delegates pointed to the first sorry fruits: a high rate of unemployment. The rate of unemployment today - there is no need for me to say this to you - cannot be justified on any grounds, least of all the human dignity of those involved. But Mr. Chairman and comrades, I did not become a member of our Party, still less did I become the Leader of our Party, to pro­pound shallow analyses and false remedies for fundamental economic and social problems.When we reject unemployment as an economic instrument - as we do - and when we reject also superficial remedies, as socialists must, then we must ask ourselves unflinchingly what is the cause of high unemployment. Quite simply and unequivocally, it is caused by paying ourselves more than the value of what we produce. There are no scapegoats. This is as true in a mixed economy under a Labour Government as it is under capitalism or under communism. It is an absolute fact of life which no Government, be it left or right, can alter. Of course in Eastern Europe you cannot price yourself out of your job, because you cannot withdraw your labour. So those Governments can at least guarantee the appearance of full employment. But that is not the democratic way.We used to think that you could spend your way out of a recession, and increase employ­ment by cutting taxes and boosting Government spending. I tell you in all candour that that option no longer exists, and that in so far as it ever did exist, it only worked on each occasion since the war by injecting a bigger dose of infla­tion into the economy, followed by a higher level of unemployment as the next step. Higher inflation followed by higher unemployment. We have just escaped from the highest rate of inflation this country has known; we have not yet escaped from the consequences: high unemployment.That is the history of the last 20 years. Each time we did this the twin evils of unemployment and inflation have hit hardest those least able to stand them. Not those with the strongest bargaining power, no, it has not hit those. It has hit the poor, the old and the sick. We have strug­gled, as a Party, to try to maintain their stan­dards, and indeed to improve them, against the strength of the free collective bargaining power that we have seen exerted as some people have tried to maintain their standards against this economic policy.Now we must get back to fundamentals. First, overcoming unemployment now unambiguously depends on our labour costs being at least com­parable with those of our major competitors. Second, we can only become competitive by having the right kind of investment at the right kind of level, and by significantly improving the productivity of both labour and capital. Third, we will fail - and I say this to those who have been pressing about public expenditure, to which I will come back - if we think we can buy our way out by printing what Denis Healey calls \u2018confetti money\u2019 to pay ourselves more than we produce. I do not care what economic system we live in - at least, I do care very much - but the moral I want to draw is this that whatever system we live under these fundamentals are at the heart of the standard of life of the people of the country concerned, and we ignore them at our peril. They are also at the heart of the Social Contract and of our industrial strategy.Britain is now at a watershed. We have the chance to make real and fundamental choices about priorities which are absolutely necessary to achieve a growing and prosperous manufac­turing industry, with all the advantages and easements that can follow.Let me be quite clear. If we did not possess the Social Contract and an industrial strategy that has been agreed between the Government and employers and trade unions, with all the socialist measures that are involved in that Contract and in the industrial strategy, if we did not possess this we would have no chance of forging a pow­erful British economy in the next decade. But we are getting co-operation on these issues.The Manifesto was right when it said that the first priority of the Labour Government must be a determined attack on inflation. That remains; we have halved it in the last twelve months but we must do more yet. The Government\u2019s objec­tive must be to reach inflation rates comparable with those of our major competitors by the end of next year. We are already getting there.The regeneration of British industry has begun. The National Enterprise Board is in place and is in business. The Industry Act is working. The detailed examination of the 39 main sectors of British industry by employers and trade unions together has produced agreed reports on what is needed in each sector in the matter of new plant, new machinery, better use of existing plant, proper design, innovation, good marketing, after-sales services, increased training and skilled manpower to avoid bottle­necks. We know what needs to be done. Industry knows what needs to be done. Will both sides of industry now go through with it? If so, then we are at the beginning of a new era that will expand our so-far dwindling manufacturing base.Let me add one more thing about how to get a strong manufacturing sector of industry. Hold on to your seats. The willingness of industry to invest in new plant and machinery requires, of course, that we overcome inflation, but also that industry is left with sufficient funds and has suf­ficient confidence to make the new investments. When I say they must have sufficient funds, I mean they must he able to earn a surplus and that is a euphemism for saying they must be able to make a profit. (Applause)Whether you call it a surplus or a profit, it is necessary for a healthy industrial system, whether it operates in a socialist economy, a mixed economy or a capitalist economy. If industry cannot retain and generate sufficient funds as a result of its operations, and replace old plant and machinery, then you will whistle in vain for the investment and we shall continue to slide downhill. These are elementary facts of life. They are known to every trade unionist. Who would they sooner go and negotiate with when they want an increase in pay: a firm that is bankrupt or a firm that is doing well and generat­ing a good surplus?The primary concern of our industrial strategy and our economic policy for the next three years is quite simple. The strategy and the priority is to create more wealth, and to do it with the agree­ment and the support of the trade union move­ment. Our social policy is concerned with the distribution of wealth. These two aspects of pol­icy should not be regarded as being in conflict, nor should we put them in conflict with each other. They must be harmonised. The wealth must be created before it is distributed. This is where I believe a misunderstanding, or perhaps something worse, has arisen between the Gov­ernment and the Party, on the question of public expenditure.You know we have not been creating wealth as fast as we have been distributing it. Over the last three years you know that our domestic product has risen by 2 per cent and the increase in our public expenditure, including central and local government, has increased by 18 per cent. We have made shift to meet this, yes, by higher taxation at some points, borrowing from abroad and, worst of all, by printing money. Now we have to get back into balance again. Of course it cannot be done in twelve months. Our creditors understand this. Those with whom we discuss these matters in other countries understand this, because the disruption would be too great for the social system to bear. But it would be folly to continue to borrow at the present rate of £10 billion a year, even if we could find the lenders - and we are not always very polite to them. Whatever we do in the short term, the only long-term cure for unemployment is to create a healthy manufacturing industry that will hold its own overseas, and in doing so it will then certainly be able to retain its grip on the domestic market. It is by a healthy and expanding manu­facturing industry that we shall be able, in due course, to resume the growth and improvement of our social services and also create the jobs that are necessary if we are to reach what we all desperately require: our full employment targets.Like everyone in the Labour Movement, I believe in a high level of public expenditure. But I part company with those who believe we can rely indefinitely on foreign borrowing to provide for greater social expenditure, a better welfare service, better hospitals, better education, the renewal of our inner cities and so on. In the end these things, comrades, are only provided by our own efforts.Of course a Labour Government must not, and will not, stand by and do nothing about unemployment except wait for this agreed indus­trial strategy to succeed. As regards the matter of selective import controls, which was raised yesterday by a number of delegates, let me say that whether to introduce them or not has very little to do with socialist philosophy. It is a mat­ter of calculating where we get the biggest advantage. After all, I grew up in the days when import controls were the remedy of the Conservative Government. So it has nothing to do with socialism. It is a question of where we get the best advantage. Already various ways, of controlling imports exist in a number of fields. We shall continue to examine them case by case and I am already publicly committed to discuss the particular problem of Japanese imports with the European heads of State when we meet at The Hague in November. There will be a constant dialogue, I promise you, between the TUC and the CBI, the Government and the Party on this matter and action will be taken where it can be shown that it is to our net advantage. There is no philosophical block of any sort about that.Mr. Chairman and comrades, in recent weeks, as some of you know, I have visited the North-East. I have been to Glasgow; I have been to Merseyside; I have been to the West Midlands. I have listened to some pretty straight talking about unemployment. I accept the criti­cism but I say in reply that there are no soft options, nor will a generation of decline in British industry be reversed by gimmicks. That is why, in asking for the Movement\u2019s support for our present industrial strategy, I ask for more than your loyalty. That can be eroded. Indeed I can understand the circumstances in which it is. What the Government needs - what we all need - is your understanding and the conviction that will follow that understanding. Then let there be a determination to go out into the workshop, to go to the streets, to be on the doorsteps and to explain with passion to others why this is the only way for our Movement and for our country. We have a duty to fight for it. If we follow it in the end we shall save not only our Party, not only our Government. We shall save our coun­try.Mr. Chairman, while our policy is working through, we have embarked on a succession of schemes aimed at alleviating unemployment wherever and whenever we can do so within the context of the overall strategy. In particular I emphasise, as Albert Booth and other delegates did yesterday, the need to try to alleviate the problem of youth unemployment. Unemploy­ment at any age is unacceptable but for a school-leaver it is especially demoralising, and those who leave at the minimum age of 16 need special help. Talking to educators, as I have done, and to employers who take on the school leavers, it has been put to me very strongly by both that there is still a real lack of contact between them. The machinery exists to provide this; it should be used in a more urgent and positive way. Two-way communication between schools\u2019 careers advisers and employers must be a con­tinuous process, with full co-operation on both sides. The importance of hard thinking about this difficult transition that our young people make from the world of school to the world of work cannot be exaggerated. Much has been done and is now being done through the work experience programme and the great increase in the number of places provided for vocational training. There was a shaft of light last week with the fall in the number of unemployed young peo­ple. We expect this trend to continue. In addi­tion, the Job Creation Programme, the Tempor­ary Employment Subsidy, the remarkable increase in places for training, the Work Experi­ence Programme which came into force on Sep­tember 21, the Youth Employment Subsidy which comes into operation on October 1 are all helping to alleviate a serious problem. Then last Thursday Albert Booth announced the job release scheme in assisted areas, to begin on January 1 next, which will open up new em­ployment opportunities for younger unemployed people seeking work. There is to be a tax-free allowance of £23 per week to full-time men and women in assisted areas who retire and who are within a year of their respective minimum pen­sionable ages.We shall continue with these efforts. We shall continue to seek out, with the co-operation of the unions and others, effective means of trying to reduce unemployment by selective action, taking special account of the position of young people. The wide variety of selective measures which we have now brought in will help about half a million of those without jobs in this period of exceptionally high unemployment. Travelling around the country, I have been much encour­aged to hear from teachers, from social workers, from the young people themselves and from employers that they value these measures as a very real contribution to the alleviation of this problem. But I repeat that none of these meas­ures, however worthwhile, are a substitute for a thriving economy generating full employment.We are, we always have been, we remain a Party of social reform, and far more needs to be done to prepare young people for the time when they leave school. There should be much closer co-operation between employers and schools, and employers could do more to make their requirements known to teachers. Heads of schools could extend their sphere of interest to obtaining and acting upon the advice of local firms about their requirements. Firms could provide practical help of various kinds to local schools, and so discover how they could make better use of the actual and potential skills of school leavers. Personnel officers in industry could ask teachers to appraise their training techniques in industry. Co-operation in these ways would help industrial and commercial training to flow naturally from the last years at school. Some schools, perhaps many, need to give their careers departments more serious attention than they have done.I am concerned at the gap that exists at many levels between education and industry today, not only at this level but at other levels too. Let us begin by helping our young people to fit themselves for life in their work, as well as in their leisure. Let us also, may I say in passing, take note and take account of the anxiety amongst parents at some aspects of the education of their children. I have been in a number of schools which have impressed me deeply by their inno­vation and their experiment. There are new ways of learning that were unknown to us, vou­ched for by the teachers. This is good. But let me emphasise that the greatest gifts a teacher can give to a child are the basic tools of learning and a desire for knowledge. A literate and numerate child has the key to open the door of learning and the key to the freedom of the mind.Let me turn to another aspect of our modern society: freedom. Democratic socialists em­phasise that a fundamental aspect of freedom is the freedom of minorities within our society. Freedom from discrimination. There can be no equivocation, and there is none in the Labour Movement, on racial matters. We must oppose all forms of racial discrimination in this country and fight the messages of hatred which are designed to divide people from each other. (Applause) The Party has taken up the chal­lenge. We shall fight, we shall continue in the way in which we have begun on this matter. Once he or she has been accepted for settlement in our country every newcomer has the same rights and obligations as everyone else. We wish them to make as real a contribution to the coun­try as other immigrants have done throughout our long history, and the new Race Relations Bill currently before Parliament aims to help them do that. As to the numbers who come here, I have never wavered from the view that in a small and highly-populated country there is a limit to the number of immigrants we can absorb. Therefore strict control over immigration is necessary, subject to honouring our commit­ments, and Britain will do that.Next, a word about devolution, an important constitutional development which we will dis­cuss later this morning and to which Michael Foot will reply. Will you allow me to say how deeply I appreciate the support of Michael who, in the interests of the unity of our Movement and our Party, has put aside his personal feelings in order to help our Party and the Government. The debate on devolution will go on - it is going on now - but it cannot continue indefinitely without being brought to a conclusion. There­fore we shall ask Parliament next Session to enact the necessary legislation so that our pro­posals will be on the Statute Book in the course of 1977. Parliament has plenty of time to debate the Bill, but Parliament owes it to the people of Scotland and Wales to reach a definite and a favourable conclusion on the matter. (Applause) At the end of the process Parliament must be able to offer the people of Scotland, and of Wales, a real and substantial measure of control over their own affairs within the overall framework of the United Kingdom. What we will not create is a half-way house to separation, to which the vast majority of the people in these islands are totally and completely opposed. (Applause)I have been around a long time, some of you will think too long. My political instinct tells me that the successful implementation of devolution offers us, as a whole, the best way of keeping the United Kingdom united, while at the same time enhancing the vigour of national diversity within these islands. I know that these proposals have raised questions in the minds of our local author­ity members in the English regions. Yes, we shall look at those with some care. I know some of them arise because of the disillusionment with the expensive and bureaucratic local govern­ment structure foisted on us by the last Tory administration. (Applause)As to the continuing tragedy of Northern Ire­land, I am sure that the whole Conference would like me to express our heartfelt thanks and admi­ration to Merlyn Rees for the way he has carried out his responsibilities during 2½ years. (Applause) Roy Mason has now inherited this awesome task. He will carry to the hard-pressed people of Northern Ireland the same message: that the Government will use its best endeavours to put an end to the violence and to achieve a political solution there. Let me repeat - because some things have to be said time after time after time - that there will be no economic and no political withdrawal. The situation has been improved by stopping the use of detention in Northern Ireland. What is now needed is a rigorous determination by everyone that the rule of law shall prevail there and that no one shall be exempt. In that the Government needs the full co-operation of all the people themselves. This has recently been illustrated by the spontaneous Women\u2019s Peace Movement, which I welcome. (Applause) Let us not forget in this forum another group which has maintained a consistent non-sectarian stand throughout all these difficult years. I refer to the Northern Ireland trade unions. (Applause) We make clear once again to the men of violence that we are not to be intimi­dated into abandoning our duty to all the people of the Province.Without pre-empting our debate next Thurs­day, I should like to mention briefly some recent developments in Southern Africa. The announcement on Friday evening by Mr. Smith of his acceptance of the principle of majority rule within the two-year time scale that I laid down on March 22 last, could be an historic turning point in the future of the sub-continent. For Bri­tain a solution in Rhodesia on the basis of major­ity rule is a debt of honour. For Africa, without it, there is a constant threat to peace and to stability. I should like to put on record my thanks to Secretary Kissinger for his charac­teristic and remarkable contribution to recent developments. (Applause) Without the decisive intervention of the United States there would not have been this turnabout in the attitude of Mr. Smith.In the last few days I have been in contact with the four African Presidents who have them­selves made a remarkable contribution to the search for a peaceful settlement: Their response to Mr. Smith\u2019s broadcast last Friday has been a tough one. That is not surprising, considering the history and considering the suspicion that arises from the history. But the prize within our grasp is an interim government with a black majority and majority rule within two years. That must be preferable to an increasingly viol­ent armed struggle in which thousands of inno­cent men and women on both sides would lose their lives. The Labour Government wants to see an interim government set up rapidly, say within four to six weeks. We will play a full and active part in promoting such an end. The meet­ing to negotiate the interim government need not necessarily be held in Salisbury or elsewhere in Rhodesia. The Foreign Secretary, Tony Cros­land, is prepared to back the convening of negotiations in any place convenient to the par­ties concerned. But the essential ingredient is the rapid establishment of the interim govern­ment. Once that has happened there will be no going back. The die will then be cast. There will be difficulties in the months ahead, but if the forthcoming negotiations can be brought to a successful conclusion, then Britain will at long last have discharged her last colonial responsibil­ity in Africa with honour.The borders of our Movement\u2019s concern have never been drawn at Dover. When the Govern­ment is attacked about cuts in public expendi­ture at a time of great economic difficulty, let me remind Conference of what has not so far been mentioned; that the Government left untouched our aid programme to the poorer countries. We have in no way withdrawn from any of our responsibilities to them. (Applause) We still take upon ourselves the task of assisting those who are burdened, the two-thirds of mankind who are burdened by poverty, ignorance and disease.I regret that some of the momentum of the dialogue that was opened up by Harold Wilson at the Commonwealth Prime Ministers\u2019 Confer­ence has been lost for the time being. I believe this will not persist. We will do all in our power to ensure that the response of the industrialised world in the north/south dialogue is a construc­tive one.We shall also use our influence to promote a more constructive dialogue in East/West rela­tions, in the search for increased international security. Incidentally, we should not assume that we are alone in our troubles. Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union have their economic problems too. We wish to see an expansion of economic activity in East/West trade. I do not accept the arguments of those who say that such a growth will serve only to assist the expansion of Soviet armed strength. There is no doubt that the Soviet Union has built substantial armed forces but nevertheless our analysis is, and this is accepted by a great many people outside this country, that the develop­ment of economic relations can increasingly involve the Soviet Union in a more stable and beneficial relationship with the West which it will not be in their interest to disturb. This is the policy of detente, and as signatories to the Hel­sinki agreement we regard it as essential that its implications should be accepted in all the fields of economic relations, cultural exchanges and human relations as well. We have in common with the Soviet Union the desire to avoid the horrors of war. We proceed on the assumption that the Soviet Union is in earnest in its wish to improve relations between states - I emphasise the word \u2018states\u2019 - even though, as their own statements have told us, the ideological struggle will continue between parties. Let there be no doubt about their intentions on that.Finally, let me turn to our domestic Party affairs. In the media I am often dubbed a Party man. Indeed, it seems that to be loyal to your party is the worst possible thing the media can say about you. I accept the description as an accolade. I am only too well aware that the strength of this Government rests on the Party. Without the Party none of us would hold the office we do. That is why I want the closest possible relationship between Party and Gov­ernment. But it must be based on a mutual respect and a recognition of each other\u2019s respon­sibilities.To tell the truth, I believe the relationship which has grown up between the TUC and the Government in the past two and a half years has developed faster than the relationship between the Government and the National Executive Committee. (Applause) This should not be so. It is not of my seeking. Every member of the Cabinet, every member of the Government knows that he shares the responsibility to estab­lish close relations with the National Executive Committee and its study groups, as well as with the Parliamentary Party itself. I do not want to retreat behind the stock defence that \u2018the Gov­ernment must govern,\u2019 if that becomes a polite way of telling the Party to go to hell. But the NEC must remember, too, that they are respon­sible. Yes, they are responsible for their statements and their resolutions. But the Govern­ment is accountable for its actions and that is the difference between us. (Applause) We are accountable in a parliamentary democracy to Parliament. Parliamentary candidates who offer themselves to the electorate on the basis that they are willing to suspend their judgment in favour of extra-parliamentary bodies, whoever they may be, will receive short shrift from the electorate. Of course Members of Parliament must be sensitive to the views of their general management committees. I tell you that they are. I know that, from what they say to me about the attitudes of their own GMCs. There is a two-way traffic between the two. Of course they are influenced. But Parliament has to take deci­sions by their votes; that is where they are responsible.There are many aspects of our Party demo­cracy that could be looked at with advantage. Is the Party really satisfied with a youth movement which has only half the branches it had ten years ago, and which is increasingly dominated by a single brand of socialist sectarianism? (Applause)Could not the National Executive Committee itself reflect the Party better, if it included local government representatives and perhaps rep­resentatives of the regional councils?(Applause) I also draw the Party\u2019s attention to a new factor creeping into the Party, which I warn against - namely those elements who misuse the word \u2018socialist\u2019 and who seek to infiltrate our party and use it for their own ends. (Applause) They are almost always recognisable by their jargon and by their intolerance. They are as much the enemy of the Tribune Group as they are of the Manifesto Group, or even of the great majority of us who do not happen to belong to either but are simply ordinary members of the Party. The main bulwark against this infiltration is a strong and active membership in every constituency, for these people represent only a small group. But I do suggest to the National Executive Committee that they could do well to examine these activities, see what is going on and report back to the Party.I raise these matters, not because I am on a witch-hunt but because I want the Government and the Party to work closely together. To do that the Party must be strong and representative.Much good work has already been done. I very much welcome \u2018Labour\u2019s Programme 1976.\u2019 It has involved the work of hundreds of volunteers, as well as members of the NEC and our hard-working staff at Transport House. I am sure that neither they, nor you, will expect the Government, dealing as we have to with the day-to-day realities of the situation to simply swallow whole and undigested the 147 pages of \u2018Labour\u2019s Programme 1976.\u2019 A dialogue will be necessary and it will not just be carried on by monthly resolutions, or a steady stream of press releases from the National Executive Sub-Committees. To be successful it will require mutual respect, mutual trust, a recognition of our differing roles and our separate respon­sibilities. That is my desire and it is in that spirit that I invite the National Executive to join us in planning ahead. If we can approach it in this way the Government will be more sensitive to the Party's wishes and the Party\u2019s deliberations will have a sharper cutting edge from being more closely involved in the realities of decision-making.We began as a Party of protest. We must never lose that, never forget it. There are many ills and many evils in the condition of our society that have still to be remedied. But we are more; we are now a Party of Government, a Party which has put many of the aspirations of the pioneers on the statute book, as the law of our land.I conclude my Report. Inevitably it has dealt with many varied issues and problems, some of them I regret to say in not as detailed a way as I should have liked. But Derek Gladwin said to me last night \u2018Keep it as short as you can.\u2019 What I would like to emerge from it is that the Government is willing to tell the people the truth, willing to consult with the Party, willing to work with the trade unions and with the people to solve our national problems. That is the philosophy of the Social Contract. Do not listen to the faint-hearted. Have confidence. The Labour Movement has the responsibility. Now let it prove that it has the maturity to lead our country and our Party to a new future. (Applause)

aVMadam Chairman and comrades, I present the Report of the Parliamentary Labour Party - a Party which has placed 42 Acts of Parliament on the Statute Book during the last twelve months but which does not command a majority in the House of Commons. Nevertheless, these important reforms include such matters as the new Coal Industry Act - the most important Act passed for that industry since the original nationalisation Act of 1947. It is an Act which gives a firm industrial foundation to underpin the mining industry for the future and will help and assist the welfare and livelihoods of thousands of miners in this country, who have always been close to the heart of the Labour movement; the Nationalisation of Shipbuilding and Aircraft which, as a delegate reminded us yesterday, has reprieved thousands of jobs in a shipbuilding industry which is suffering in every country from the world economic depression.And how often year after year, have we heard the delegate from the Agricultural Workers\u2019 Union coming to that rostrum to demand the abolition of the agricultural tied cottage. With the passing of the Rent Agriculture Act of 1976, the Labour Government consigned the agricul­tural tied cottage once and for all to the dustbin of history.Then there is the Social Security Act, which in addition to providing higher benefits for pen­sions, sickness, maternity and injury, all of which become payable next month, has now given the Labour Government authority to begin paying from 17th November an entirely new benefit of £10.50 per week to those married women who, through ill health, are incapable of carrying out their normal household duties. 40,000 women will benefit.When I hear some say that last Spring we should have cut and run when we faced that fateful vote of confidence, my reply to them is that it would have been worth keeping our Labour Government in power if we had done nothing more during the year than put those four Acts into operation. But of course much more has been done, and there is much more for a Labour Party in power still to do. Quite apart from the issues raised in yesterday\u2019s economic debate, to which I shall return later, the agricul­tural debate - one of the best debates that I have heard on this subject in this Conference for many a year - demonstrated the Labour Party\u2019s commitment and interest to the people of our rural areas as well as in our industrial cities. We are one nation. Let me say to those who spoke in that debate that the whole of Conference was influenced by what they said - and I will cer­tainly use such influence as I have to ensure that the Government will make a positive contribu­tion to the study group that Conference agreed to establish yesterday.Let me say one other thing about yesterday\u2019s debates - perhaps for the benefit of the com­mentators. Don\u2019t let the outside world make any mistake about the nature of our debates, or about the nature of the criticisms that will be uttered this week. Let every one of those com­mentators understand that whatever else may be said, this Conference wants to maintain - and will work wholeheartedly to maintain - a Labour Government securely in office with the power to carry out our policies.Yes, it was a hard year. I thank the Leader of the House, Michael Foot; the Chief Whip and the Whips\u2019 Office for the hard work that they put in to sustain our minority Government in power. It is not easy, you know. Sometimes I think, when I hear speakers at the rostrum, that I won­der what they would really think it was like if they came down and recognised the difficulties that the managers of Government business have, week after week, trying to steer issues that we care passionately about through a House of Commons where we are in a minority. I thank them both very sincerely for their support.I thank, too, the Parliamentary Labour Party. It was their loyalty and - let me add - their constructive criticism that gave the Government the support it needed to carry on.As a minority Government we lost some Bills and we had others amended. The balance sheet was on the right side. But the Parliamentary agreement with the Liberal Party gave the coun­try and the Government a period of political stability that will enable our policies to begin to bring results and enables us to begin to plan on something more tangible and substantial than a day-to-day existence.The arrangement with the Liberals was reached on a basis which respected the basic integrity of the two Parties. I place on record my appreciation of the spirit in which Mr Steel has conducted affairs with the Lord President and with myself under this agreement. There is no misunderstanding between us. At the next elec­tion - ah! the next election. Perhaps I ought to make clear that I agree wholeheartedly with Denis Healey\u2019s comments on the next election - both the authorised version and the revised version. He is quite right. The election will come next year - or if it does not come then, it will come the year after. I guarantee it. At any rate, whenever it comes, the Labour Party will fight as an independent party with our own program­me, and we shall seek an outright majority from the electors at the polls.Until then, the Parliamentary Labour Party will continue the fight against the most reactio­nary Conservative leadership seen in the House of Commons since the end of the First World War. The Tory Party has insatiable craving for power. To them it is a God-given right to be sought without scruple. When they are in Opposition and it is denied them, the mask slips. At present they can see nothing but their own short-term self-interest. They lash out in all directions. Their attitude is that the national interest is always put into suspense when a Labour Government is in power.I deeply regret that at this delicate moment the Leader of the Opposition should give the impres­sion that the Rhodesian leader, Mr Smith, could somehow expect a different approach if ever there was a Conservative Government. (Applause) Such nudges and winks may keep the stone-age warriors on her own back benches quiet; but it is an irresponsible deception of the white Rhodesians that could lead them further along the road to disaster.After months of careful, quiet and patient pre­paration, in close co-operation with the United States and with the backing of the international community and our European partners, includ­ing the front-line Presidents, the Government has launched a new initiative on Rhodesia: an initiative with no less an objective than an inde­pendent and non-racial Zimbabwe under major­ity rule in 1978. I will not go into detail today about that initiative. But I want to make one thing clear: it is based on and motivated by only one British interest - the interest in seeing an orderly and peaceful transfer to majority rule in Rhodesia, with a secure future for both black and white people. Those who see in it some plot of British imperialism are chasing shadows. If there are imperialists on the continent of Africa, they are certainly not British. We are seeking honourably to discharge our final obligation, not to recapture the long-lost glories of Empire, and I am sure that the Conference will wish David Owen success in the difficult task he has under­taken.But, Madam Chairman, you better than any­one know that our search for racial peace and harmony in Southern Africa will seem shallow and hypocritical if we cannot mirror such a tolerance here in Britain. I recently read some words about South Africa in which the author said:'It is the only society of which I have know­ledge where no private virtue, no public worth, no intellectual or physical gifts can redeem you throughout your life from the inferiority brought about by an accident of birth for which you have no responsibility.'Conference, I am sure, agrees wholeheartedly with Arnold Goodman about that.We in the Labour movement - let the country know it - reject the philosophy of inferiority from the cradle to the grave whether it be in South Africa or in Britain. (Applause) The time is long overdue to speak out. Let us not equivo­cate on this issue. There can be no carefully weighed electoral calculations to be met by cloudy phrases. We are opposed to racialism. We are opposed to discrimination. We will do all in our power to ensure that every citizen in this country, irrespective of race or creed, enjoys equality of opportunity and equality of protec­tion under the law. On this we cannot com­promise.Inflation and unemployment have always been exploited by extremists. Groups who are easily identifiable have always been vulnerable at such times. The Jews in the Thirties have been replaced by the blacks in the Seventies. History tells us that the persecution of the minority is only the first step. That is followed by attacks on the trade unions, on the press, on free speech, and so on democracy itself. Let no one be in any doubt about the true nature of those who wrap their poisonous doctrines in our national flag.But they will not be beaten by self-appointed private armies enacting a re-run of history on the streets of our major cities. Political violence, from whatever motives or whatever quarter, will be stopped. Those who claim that it is the proper response to racialism are no friends of democ­racy or of workers - black or white. The police have difficult judgments to make in these mat­ters, and I am determined that they should not be made the scapegoat when they try to hold the ring in some of these difficult situations. They will have the full support of the Government in carrying out their functions in this regard. The people of this country do not accept that there is an absolute right for anybody to conduct himself in any way he chooses regardless of any serious inconvenience or even harm to his fellow citi­zens that his or her actions might cause.Madam Chairman, you will recall that last year, because of the daunting problems then fac­ing us, many pundits were ready to write us off both as a Government and as a nation. One wrote that I had made my first report but I would not be here to make a second. Well, I am here for the second - and the third, and the fourth, and the fifth, and however long you want me. They underestimated the toughness and the reaction of the British people when they recognise and know the facts.This year the background to our debates is the welcome fact that we have managed a turn-round in Britain\u2019s financial prospects - I emphasise the word financial - which gives us the best chance since the end of the war to break out from the pattern of national retreat and decline, and to begin to move forward.This has been assisted - I cannot say it often enough, and our colleagues know that I mean it - by the co-operation of the trade unions and their members, whose acceptance of moderate wage ceilings has helped so substantially to bring down the level of inflation. Now we need a united Labour movement, both to propound our own policies and to expose the sham and the cynicism of the so-called Tory alternative. Take prices, for example. We are asked to keep them down. We were asked yesterday again. The defeat of inflation remains the Government\u2019s number one priority. But what has been the Tory contribution to that fight? They opposed the Price Commission Bill. They opposed food sub­sidies. They have attacked the Consumer Advice Centres, they have attacked us for defending the British consumer in the Common Agricultural Policy renegotiations, and they have called in their Policy Statement, The Right Approach, for an agricultural policy based on \u2018an end to artificially low prices which depress investment.\u2019That is their policy: an end to food subsidies; an end to mechanisms which protect or advise the consumer; an end to defending the consumer in CAP negotiations and a policy of ending \u2018artificially low prices\u2019 in foodstuffs. That is the real­ity of their prices policy. The challenge to our movement is to expose them for the frauds they are: the party that printed confetti money; the party that deliberately allowed the money sup­ply to run out of control, and which was finally ejected from office with a massive balance of payments deficit - which we picked up - and with inflation stoked up in the pipeline that choked both-economic growth and new invest­ment.Expose the double talk of people like Geof­frey Howe, who warns the Government not to stimulate the economy and in the next breath laments the absence of growth in manufacturing industry and investment. Remind people who it was in the middle of the 1974 election who suddenly promised to reduce the mortgage rate to 9½ per cent. Well, we are not only keeping our promises - we are keeping hers as well. The mortgage rate has come down to 9½ per cent. But it has been done not as an election gimmick, but the hard and honest way.But don\u2019t just expose their past misdeeds. Remind people of their plans for the future. Expose the reactionary elitism of an education policy under the joint control of Rhodes Boyson and St John-Stevas, the heavenly twins. One wants to cut the school-leaving age. The other wants more privilege in education - a perfect combination of Wackford Squeers and Bertie Wooster. (Laughter)Labour needs a vigorous and active Party - a Party strong in membership to overcome the Tory challenge. We also need a united Party. I shall continue to work to achieve that end.In recent times an issue that has weakened our unity has been the dissension over our member­ship of the Common Market. Conference will know that I have suggested to the NEC - and they have accepted - that after we have all listened to the debates on the Common Market this week, Ministers from the Cabinet and rep­resentatives from the NEC should meet in the autumn to see how we can work out a pro­gramme of radical reform as full members of an evolving European Community. By so doing, the Labour Party will once again be the only major political party to whom the British people can look for the prospect of changing those fea­tures of Community membership which cause dissatisfaction, whilst at the same time working for the development of the Community and the growing unity of the people of Europe.An issue where we have also endeavoured to meet genuine concern is in our approach to devolution. I have recently returned from a visit to Scotland - a visit, may I say, on which I was refreshed by the warmth of my welcome and the vigour of the comrades I met. I came away once more convinced that we would be missing an historic opportunity if we did not respond to the genuine desire for a measure of devolution. The Tories have gone back on their promises. The SNP see devolution as the first step on the way to a narrow, nationalistic independence. Labour and only Labour offers what the majority of Scots have called for - a greater say and greater control over their own affairs within a United Kingdom. (Applause) So we shall bring forward the Bill in the next Session. We shall also bring forward a timetable that will make sure that the Bills can be properly considered and a conclu­sion reached. The least the Scottish and Welsh people have a right to expect is that Parliament should reach a conclusion, so that, by means of a referendum held after the Bills have been pas­sed, it will be for the people themselves to decide, in Wales and Scotland, whether they wish devolution to go ahead. For these reasons, when the Bills and the timetable are presented to Parliament in the next Session, the Cabinet will expect them to be fully supported by every member of the Parliamentary Labour Party.At the next election we shall have to carry conviction on the central issues of prices and jobs. There are one-and-a-half million reasons why unemployment is at the heart of our con­cerns, and of the concern of the debate yester­day. Everyone of us, whatever degree of responsibility he may hold, hates unemployment and what it does to the men, women and young people affected by it. No member of this Party would even consent to use the plight of the unemployed or accept a permanent high level of unemployment as an economic regulator. But nor must we cheat the unemployed, or this Con­ference, by pretending that there are quick, easy solutions which will give everyone work. If, there were, we would have used them.In this decade, unemployment has become endemic throughout the industrialised world. But although it is a world problem which will require world solutions, the Government have taken a wide range of actions to try and alleviate the impact. I hope you will bear with me if I spend just a few minutes describing some of those actions, because I think they should be placed on the record.Since April 1975 we have made about £900 million available for special employment and training measures which will help almost 800,000 people. In June, Albert Booth announced a new £160 million Youth Opportunities Programme which will give up to 230,000 unemployed young people a chance of work experience or training each year. This programme is the largest of its kind in Europe. By September 1978, the number being helped will have doubled. It is our objec­tive - an ambitious objective - to meet a pro­gramme by April 1979 that every school leaver unemployed will be offered a place under this programme.Two new plans to provide temporary jobs for adults were also announced, as well as the extension of the Youth Employment Subsidy, and an additional 10,000 places in further education. The Job Release Scheme, which began last November to allow those in their final year to retire early and give up their jobs to unemployed people, was extended to 31 March, 1978.We have extended the Temporary Employ­ment Subsidy until 31 March, 1978, by which time it will have helped to protect 460,000 jobs - nearly half-a-million - and the new Small Firms Employment Subsidy will give for an experi­mental six months £20 per week for each new full-time job created in small manufacturing firms in Special Development Areas. There is also under way an expansion of the Training Opportunities Scheme and Government support for 41,500 additional training places for appren­tices and technicians in industry. I thank the engineering unions and I thank Hugh Scanlon for the work they have done in that particular matter.We have also taken far more action than is generally acknowledged or recognised to protect our most sensitive industries from unfair com­petition. Quotas have been introduced covering three quarters of our imports of textiles and clo­thing from low-cost suppliers, and a considera­bly higher proportion in the case of the countries which constitute the main threat. We have taken action to protect the footwear industry from unfair competition, imposed quotas on the imports of black and white television sets from Taiwan and South Korea, negotiated restraints on imports of Japanese colour sets, steel, cars, pottery and a number of other goods. Altogether, the range of voluntary restraint understandings which we have with Japan at industry or Community level covers between a quarter and a third of our total imports from Japan and includes all the sensitive sectors. We have also speeded up anti-dumping procedures, with the result that in the last 12 months we have taken action in nearly 40 cases of alleged dump­ing.I want to make clear that import controls are not a cure-all either for Britain\u2019s problems or those of the world. Britain lives by trade more than most countries. If every country tried to solve its problems by reverting to protection, our analysis shows that Britain would suffer more than most. That is why the Government will continue to work for sustained growth in our own economy, and throughout the world. But we must intervene to stop unfair competition and we will intervene to prevent industries with a viable future going to the wall.Last week the final step was taken to order the Drax B power station. Drax B is significant, not only in itself and for the work it will give, but because it is the first of a new series of power stations that the nationalised electricity industry will need to build from now until the mid-1980s, and this will have massive implications for more secure jobs, more secure employment in the boiler-making, turbo-generating and coal indus­tries.The newly nationalised shipbuilding industry has been assisted by the allocation of £65 million to the Shipbuilding Intervention Fund to help our own yards win orders which might otherwise go to foreign yards. I would like to take this opportunity of saying to Conference that during the weekend I have been in communication with the Chairman of the Polish Council of Ministers following my official meeting with him last December in London. I raised this question then and told him that if they wanted to build ships we ought to be able to help them to do it. In the light of the messages that we have exchanged this weekend, I can tell Conference - and through Conference the shipbuilding workers of this country - that there is now every prospect that a major contract will be concluded this month for the sale of 24 ships that will provide about 8,000 man years of work in British shipyards and their supplying industries. (Applause)The construction industry is particularly dependent upon public expenditure, and unem­ployment has suffered as a result of our expendi­ture reductions last year. It has suffered too much, despite the two separate injections of £100 million since then. I do not want to antici­pate decisions that the Government have yet to reach, but in my view in any stimulus that may be applied this year the construction industry stands high on the list for serious consideration. (Applause)Regional development grants, the advanced factory programme, record investment by British Steel and more money for the National Enterprise Board and the Scottish and Welsh Development Agencies have all been used in the battle to create jobs.The recent decision of the Ford Motor Com­pany to make its next major European invest­ment here in Britain gives the lie to those pes­simists who go abroad and talk the country down. There was a long period of negotiations. Eric Varley and his Ministry conducted a lot of them. There was a good team effort. I came in at a fairly late stage and I saw high-level officials. Then I saw Henry Ford and I invited him to come and have a talk with me. When I discussed this matter with him, I knew that nearly every other country in Europe was going all out to win this plant. Why? Not only because it would bring new technology, but because of the ripple effect that such an important investment has on other industries, on employment and other potential overseas investors. It is without doubt the most important new overseas investment for many a year.Henry Ford told me that Ford\u2019s asked for two things if they came here: first, good quality in the product and second, continuous working. I said that the Government\u2019s industrial strategy aims to do just that, with - for the first time in our history -  Government, management and work­ers planning together measures to improve the international competitiveness of our key indus­tries. In other words, produce the right goods at the right time, at the right price and of the right quality, and there is nothing this country cannot do.In the motor car industry, as in all other indus­tries, all sides must co-operate in order to meet this challenge, for that is the only way we shall sell our products overseas as well as holding our share of the domestic market. And that applies to Leylands as well as to everybody else. Success here will be the best possible form of job creation.I detected yesterday, I thought, some feeling that perhaps the financial success of the last year ought to be discounted. Don\u2019t do that. It is a financial success, as I emphasised at the beginning. We have not had industrial success yet. But you cannot get industrial success unless you have confidence in Britain\u2019s industrial future, based on a strong currency, record reserves, a surplus in the balance of trade, falling interest rates, a falling inflation rate and rapidly increasing proceeds from North Sea oil. Do not under­rate this financial success. It gives us a firm foundation on which we must now start to build our economic future. We have brought the coun­try through the bad times: now let us carry it forward into the better times.But don\u2019t let\u2019s overlook the enemies that still lie ahead which, if left unvanquished, could still destroy the prospects of prosperity. Take infla­tion. Industry and the public services have both got their part to play in this fight. Inflation will only continue downwards if employers behave responsibly about price increases and wage and salary earners are content with moderate wage increases. Let me repeat. A ten per cent increase in national earnings means a lower rate of infla­tion in 1978 than this country has enjoyed for many years. More than ten per cent means that inflation will start to go up again. I was going to say that you cannot alter the laws of arithmetic. But you can in one way. If a money supply policy as fierce as that advocated by Keith Joseph were adopted, this might enable inflation to be checked, despite high wage settlements, but only at the cost of unemployment soaring way beyond the levels of the 1930s.So to those who tell me, \u2018No way will the country accept ten per cent,\u2019 I reply, \u2018Then no way will you stop prices or unemployment going up again.\u2019 Let me remind you that a number of nationalised industries have already undertaken that any increases in prices that they may be forced to make will be limited to the increases in inflation. So to that extent we have got the future in our own hands. As regards prices in the private sector, now that we have the Price Commission Act we shall use it rigorously in order to ensure that no irresponsible increases take place that will lead to excessive profits.In my past life I have been a negotiator - a trade union negotiator. And every negotiator knows that if the first wage settlements in the current round start well above ten per cent, that will set the pattern for the whole year. It is as plain as a pikestaff that the level of wages enters into export prices. If one goes up the other will, and the end of that road is that Britain becomes uncompetitive once more, export orders are lost to other countries and unemployment will grow. I shall do all I can to prevent Britain from follow­ing that road - though I recognise that there are limits to what the Government can do, which makes it all the more imperative that we win the battle for public support.I recognise that many trade union leaders are under great pressure from their members. So is the Government. The pressure on you is to claim high wages. The pressure on the Govern­ment is to keep down inflation and high prices - ask your wives. But we share one thing in com­mon. Neither of us is seeking confrontation with the other. We must therefore help each other. The Government is already doing its part. Since August there is more money in the pay packets through tax cuts. Interest rates are going down. The home borrower has had his mortgage cut three times this year. And now, during the com­ing months, as Denis Healey said yesterday, the Cabinet will be looking, again at the levels of taxation to get the right balance.The average man always has a grumble about tax deductions, but he also wants proper hospi­tal treatment when he is ill. He wants to be cared for when he is elderly and have proper public services. That is why we need to get the balance right. I listened to the Chancellor carefully yes­terday for any crumbs that I could pick up - he says that it now seems that we can take further action this autumn - further action to reduce taxes, and further measures in line with our strategy will be taken again next year depending on the situation as it develops between now and then. This should help to lessen the pressure on the wages front and I ask all those responsible for negotiations to take it into their calculations. We are not fighting each other: we are fighting on the same side to get the best results we can for all the people of this country - and that includes the millions of trade unionists.The Government pledges that it will adhere to a policy of going for a rate of growth that will not jeopardise our inflation prospects and a rate of growth that can be sustained. To do so is the best way - no, the only way - to preserve the jobs of our people and, at a time of high unemploy­ment, to improve the real standards of our people. Comrades, there are no short cuts. But there is a road ahead. In the end the people will decide. Meantime I say to both sides of industry, \u2018Please don\u2019t support us with general expressions of good will and kind words, and then undermine us through unjustified wage increases or price increases. Either back us or sack us.\u2019This country has got to make the choice, and I have made mine. We have come so far together that we cannot falter now. Our opponents and some newspapers decry public spending as though it was something indecent. But never let us cease to spell out what public spending really is - decent pensions, good hospitals, modern schools, well planned cities, well maintained roads, the National Health Service, unemploy­ment pay - the whole structure of our system of social security. That is public expenditure.If education, health, pensions and the rest are to be bought in the market place by the highest bidder, then the few will enjoy the good life. Yes, I suppose we could go back to the Vic­torian levels of taxation that some people would like. If we do so our people will go back also to the Victorian levels of health care, housing, education and social benefits. Even today our society has much to do to give all our citizens the basic decencies of civilised life. For we are grappling with great problems in the industrialised world which in a changing situation has not discovered the signposts, as Tony Benn said yesterday, that will lead it forward towards the goals of full employment, high investment and a good growth rate.Of one thing there is no doubt: we must be guided by an approach to industrial relations based on co-operation, not on confrontation. Industrial relations are human relations. They flourish best on a basis of mutual understanding, mutual respect and mutual recognition of rights and responsibilities. The Tory Party has made a major contribution in recent months to mutual understanding in Sir Keith Joseph\u2019s intemperate and ill-advised condemnation of the impartial inquiry into the Grunwick dispute. (Applause) Though let me add that I exempt the Leader of the Opposition at once from the charge of having made any serious contribution to thought on industrial matters, whether on Weekend World or anywhere else. (Applause)In contrast, the Labour Government has worked out in consultation with the Trades Union Congress and placed on the Statute Book a framework of industrial relations which will stand the nation in good stead. If there are flaws in the legislation we will examine them, whether on the issues of trade union recognition or of picketing. We should not be afraid to look at any of these. Albert Booth will begin consultations on these matters in due course, when certain cases have been decided in the appropriate place.The next 20 years will be totally unlike any­thing that this country has seen since it first moved to become an industrial power 200 years ago. The oil riches beneath the North Sea prop­erly used can transform our economic future in a way inconceivable even ten years ago. How that wealth is to be used, the philosophy behind its distribution, will have a substantial effect on the kind of country and the kind of society that our children will inherit. The gross value of oil resources over £200,000 million - go on putting noughts on and you still won\u2019t get to the end. Production in the 1980s is in the order of 100-120 million tonnes a year. A balance of payments benefit rising to more than 5 per cent of our Gross National Product. Government revenue from oil and gas rising to some £4,000 million a year in the early 1980s. We have not yet absorbed the opportunities that these startling statistics offer us, if we use this new found wealth in a way which is both sensible and reasonable.In a matter as important as this the Govern­ment should not decide what is to be done with­out proper debate and discussion. I have asked as a first step both the Chancellor and the Secretary of State for Energy to produce and publish a paper setting out our objectives towards the end of this year. As a nation we can now begin to lift our eyes and see a brighter horizon. We can plan now for the years beyond the next election, for the Bri­tain of the 1980s, when we must use our present opportunities to become the master of events and never again to be their slave. It is our responsibility as democratic socialists to do that, to plan ahead and follow our vision to use these material resources to achieve a better society. This is our opportunity. But it is still only an opportunity - an opportunity which we can take or miss. The oil will not flow for ever, perhaps for not more than 30 years, and while it flows it will not solve our basic problems. It will be no permanent solution if we blow all the pro­ceeds on immediate consumption while our industry is left without adequate investment or nothing is done to replace the oil with alternative energy supplies for the next century. It is our job, our task, our responsibility to get the right balance between investment in our industry, better social services and paying off our debts. But I can say straight away what is, in my view, our first priority. That must be to modernise British industry so that our workers, by the end of the 1980s, will have the plant and machinery to compete on equal terms with the best in the world. The Government must take whatever action is necessary to achieve that. It is the only way to ensure full employment.'There is one other important factor. The polit­ical parties will be likely to make their choices differently - very differently - on this matter. The difference between us and our Tory oppo­nents will continue to show. We shall insist that the main benefits of oil continue to be for Britain and not for the multinational oil companies. (Applause) Reinvestment of the revenues for more jobs in the future, and not just a quick, greedy, boom-and-bust. Redistributing the pro­ceeds to all sections of our community, and not just a Tory bonanza for the privileged few. Socialist principles of redistribution. One more reason why it is important in these coming years, for the future of all the British people, to have a Labour Government. To let everybody share - future generations as well as this generation; Wales and England as well as Scotland. We do not believe, as our opponents do, that market forces alone will allocate those resources cor­rectly. All history is against that view. Democratic socialists embrace the idea of freedom. We care for it passionately. But we do not limit its definition. We also seek for people freedom of a quality which our opponents seem unable to comprehend, which, unless they have a vivid imagination, those who have not been denied this freedom find it difficult to appreciate: the freedom which comes from being brought up in a decent home of your own and a healthy environment; the freedom which comes from being educated in a modern, well-equipped school, having adequate training and a job dur­ing your working life, being cared for in sickness and being able to look forward to a secure old age. The society where these things are a right to every citizen and not simply auctioned to the highest bidder grants the greatest extension of our historic freedom - namely, the freedom of every man and woman to develop to its limits their own potential qualities. (Applause)I suppose in the Labour movement there are probably more active workers who know from personal experience what the denial or the grant­ing of those freedoms really means. The Next Three Years and into the Eighties - the docu­ment that was moved yesterday - sums it up like this:We reject the idea that there is a choice to be made between a more equal, just and compassionate society and, one with greater economic efficiency. The two go hand in hand.Comrades, we know that we have a big job of political education on our hands. The Tories have always been skilled at packaging their pro­ducts. But we can take strength from the fact that our democracy has regularly seen through and rejected the Tories\u2019 selfish brand of politics. Let us determine at this Conference now to offer our people a vision of society more inspiring and more worthwhile. Our creed is as old as this century but as modern as tomorrow. For the pioneers who launched this movement their aspirations must have seemed but a distant dream. Many of their dreams have been fulfilled. They have become realities, thanks to succes­sive Labour Governments.It has been a turbulent century of bitter wars and uneasy peace. Mankind is still haunted not only by the threat of war and self-destruction, but still by the age-old curses of poverty, hunger and disease. For all our successes in the last three quarters of a century the agenda before us is still formidable. But so it was for the early pioneers. To those young people searching for a political star to guide them, I commend the belief that service to their fellow men and women is a wider horizon than self-interest; that true liberty is best assured where society as a whole accepts responsibility for guaranteeing each and every citizen a certain quality of life.That is our task. That is what we say to our people. It is for us, overcoming our doubts, unit­ing despite our differences, to go out and commit the British people, convince the British people, that this is our future - the future of a civilised democratic society that can be a great influence in the rest of the world, and of which we can be proud to say that in our generation we helped to form. (Applause)

aVMadam Chairman, comrades, thank you very much. I present the Parliamentary Report for the past year. It has been 12 months of real achieve­ment. I am able to report on behalf of the Parliamentary Party - and I thank them for their work, and I thank especially the Whips for their work during the last year - I am able to report, what I think everybody knows, namely, that there has been an improvement during the last 12 months in the nation\u2019s standard of living. There has been an improvement in our provision of care for those in need. There has been further progress in improving our financial position with other countries, further progress in carrying out our programme and an improved standing for Britain throughout the world. To say that is not to say that we have finished. We have hardly started. But it is as well that these things should be put on record. We shall shortly embark on the last session of Parliament - this Parliament - and therefore it is a suitable moment to look back and see where we came in. In those dark and candlelit days of the last weeks of the Conserva­tive Government, the question that was being posed was: \u2018Is Britain governable?\u2019 In our 1974 manifesto we gave the reply, and I quote: \u2018Labour does not go along with the prophets of doom. Give us your backing over the difficult two or three years ahead. We shall get back on the right course. We have confidence in the British people.\u2019 \u2018Give us two or three years,\u2019 we said, \u2018and we shall get back on the right course.\u2019 The people did, and we have.But why was there such gloom about Britain\u2019s prospects at home and abroad in those days? I give you the answer in two words - runaway inflation. Week after week, month after month, prices zoomed up, wages chased after them. Indeed, wages, you may recall, were indexed in order that they should keep up with the cost of living. Both wages and prices still went on going up, and the Tory Chancellor of the Exchequer printed pound notes by the trunkful in order to keep pace with the increase in wages that was being paid out, and in order to keep pace with the rising prices. Inflation threatened to submerge not only our personal standards and our family living standards - it threatened our very institu­tions. And at the end, nobody was a penny piece better off. Most people were worse off.So we rejected it - we rejected the pessimism that underlay that approach. We entered into arrangements with the trade unions before the Labour Government was elected which gave us a firm foundation on which to build. We did not under-rate in that manifesto the significance, or the difficulty, or the magnitude of the job that we had to do. Indeed, let me remind you what the opening words of the election manifesto were:\u2018Britain faces its most dangerous crisis since the war.\u2019 The words were sombre, they were true. And that, Madam Chairman and fellow delegates, is the pit from which we have escaped and to which we do not intend to return.Today nobody denies that the Labour Gov­ernment and the people, working together in partnership, have confounded the pessimists. There is no room for complacency - we could slip back into an inflationary situation, and, Madam Chairman, it is the Government\u2019s responsibility to prevent that - and I call on everybody, we need support from everyone as we do so.The ultimate test of a Labour Government is how far it fulfils the needs of those who put their trust in it. As long as there is a family without a home, as long as there is a man or woman without a job, as long as there is a patient waiting for a hospital bed, or someone who suffers from dis­crimination because of his colour or because of his race, or because of his creed, then our Gov­ernment has work to do. It is in that spirit of challenge that I invite you to look forward to the next five years of Labour Government. This Conference comes at one of the most crucial moments in Labour\u2019s history. Not for the first time, a Labour Government has cleared up the chaos left by the Tories. The difference this time is that we have also been able to begin the pro­cess of improving the condition of our people. The importance of securing another term of office for the Labour Government is that for once we will not have to waste the first three years clearing up behind the Tories. So now it is for the Cabinet and the National Executive Committee to prepare a decisive and relevant programme to put to the people. Work has been going on for some months on this in joint sub­committees between the two bodies. And last Friday the National Executive Committee agreed at my suggestion that this work should be intensified so that we will be ready with a full programme Our purpose as a party will be to present a bold, creative, socialist challenge to all those forces that perpetuate injustice, class divi­sion, racial bigotry and poverty, and so injure the true freedom of the individual to develop his qualities to the full.In the next Parliament, how will we set about it? First let me quote to you the underlying thought in the document Into the Eighties, which was agreed by you yesterday, although not much discussed. It says: \u2018We reject the notion that we must choose between a stronger economy and a fairer, more just society. The two can and must go hand in hand.\u2019That is where Labour stands. We totally reject the harsh doctrines derived from the 19th cen­tury to which the present Conservative leader­ship has now reverted one hundred years late - doctrines that give a low place to fairness and justice, doctrines that defend the rights of the strong and neglect the needs of the weak. I put before you, and I put before the people of our country four necessary conditions for the next Labour Government\u2019s success. First, that we do not throw away the gains of recent years. Next, that we use the benefits of North Sea oil wisely to adapt and to modernise our society and our industry, to provide new jobs and steady growth. And that means -and let us stand on this when we go to the people - that we do not intend to blow the proceeds of North Sea oil in an election orgy of tax bribes. Third, Britain must become even more productive to match up to some of our principal competitors, including the Germans. Fourth, we must be ready for big industrial change, whilst at the same time the Labour Government safeguards our people from the ill-effects of that change. The present inter­national economic climate necessitates large-scale Government programmes of job creation, co-operation with private industry and industrial and social reform. Today\u2019s serious unemploy­ment problems are caused by world recession, by inflation and by competition from newly developed industries in the Third World. Tomorrow\u2019s employment will depend on our response to unprecedented technical change, as was referred to yesterday during our debates - a rate of change that seems to be ever more rapid, and we must move fast to keep up. Refer­ence was made to the micro-processor revolu­tion which is beginning to make many of our long-established mechanical processes hopelessly out of date. Thousands of tasks, both simple and complicated, will vanish. The next Labour Government must respond boldly and with imagination. A Government that turned its back on these developments would impoverish its people. Instead, we must harness them to produce cheaper and better products, to gener­ate extra demand, and thereby to build extra jobs. This is the important role for the industrial strategy, now three years old. It involves a part­nership between Government, the National Enterprise Board, the nationalised industries, private industry and the trade unions, to carry Britain to the forefront of this new industrial revolution.Nothing illustrates better the relevance of the present Tory leadership than their attitude to the industrial strategy. They sneer at it. They try and block active Government intervention and partnership. They vote against measures that protect jobs. They begrudge money spent to ease the burden of unemployment. In a time of such rapid change, comrades, I say to you that the Tories are as out of place as a penny-farthing on a motorway, and they are just as dangerous. Sir Keith Joseph\u2019s way would turn whole regions of our country into industrial wastelands. Recent events, or more accurately, non-events have smoked out the Tory Party. We now know how they intend to misrepresent these problems of unemployment, as well as a number of other issues, when the General Election comes. Now we have to use, as Michael Foot said yesterday, the next period to expose the hollowness that enables their advertising agents to use the tele­vision and cinema screens to proclaim that they will increase Government spending on pensions, on defence, on housing - anything you like, you name it - and at the same time that they will cut taxes.Some of our opponents do not seem to be very happy because we are exercising our constitutional right to carry this Parliament into a fifth session. They seem to espouse a new constitu­tional theory, that General Elections should be called to suit copy deadlines of advertising agen­cies. (Applause) I hold a different view. Elec­tions are best held when a Government has com­pleted the full phase of its work. The country can then make a proper judgment both on the Government\u2019s record and on its plans for the future. It might be argued - indeed it was argued - that we had reached such a stage this autumn, a year before Parliament\u2019s life expired. It is certainly true that we have achieved a most remarkable turn-around in the country\u2019s fortunes. But pro­gress under a Labour Government is never good news to our opponents. Their attitude is summed up by the Daily Mail on the day that that paper had decided - and announced - that I was going to call a General Election, and indeed that even the date was known. They said: \u2018James Callaghan, the greatest fixer of them all, is now engaged in his biggest fix ever, the rigging of a temporary economic boom designed to win for him the forthcoming General Election.\u2019Notice the technique. Do not deny the success - you cannot, it is too obvious. So present it as something temporary. Present it as something rigged. Present it as something dishonest. Well, they are wrong. Our success is genuine, it is real and we shall use all our strength to make it last­ing.I said in my broadcast on that day that I could see, difficulties looming ahead. Well, I was not wrong, was I? (Laughter and Applause) I am a better forecaster than some of the economic astrologers. But what I also felt, and felt genuinely and sincerely, was that I would prefer a Labour Government to see it through, and if we run into bad weather, it is more important than ever for our people that there should be a Labour Government to protect them. (Applause)That brings me to the question of prices and pay. Let us start with prices, because keeping prices down is what Government intervention in pay policy is about. The Government continues its attack on rising prices on three fronts. The first is a vigorous Price Commission, with pow­ers to investigate prices and profit margins, and powers to recommend the Minister of Prices and Consumer Protection to order a price freeze, which he can then decide to introduce. We pro­pose to step up this attack on prices. The next Labour Government will further strengthen the powers of the Price Commission if it is shown that they are needed. And let us advertise much more how the nationalised industries have helped during recent years. Gas prices will have remained at the same level for two years, tele­phone charges for more than three years. And I say now that it looks - and Sid Weighell made his contribution yesterday - as though next year\u2019s increase in railway fares will be signifi­cantly lower than this year\u2019s increase. Our thanks go to the management and to the unions in these nationalised industries.Next, we have continued, and we will do so, to batter away at the excesses of the Common Market\u2019s Agricultural Policy. (Applause) This was designed to protect the producer and not the consumer, and our objective is to change that, and our colleagues in the Common Market must know that. (Applause) The financial burdens on the housewives, whether they live in Bonn or Paris or London, grow every year. Indeed, some of the founding members of the Community are beginning to protest at the excessive cost. This year, thanks to the stubborn work of John Silkin, we secured the lowest price increases ever. (Applause) Milk, beef, pork and bacon had the lowest price increases since Britain joined. That was a good start, but there is a lot further to go. At the last meeting of the Heads of Government of the Common Market countries held in Brem­en last July, two other heads of Government out of the nine joined me in calling for changes - that is, three of us now. All nine countries then agreed to ask the Commission to bring proposals before us to reduce expenditure, especially on unwanted surpluses, at our next meeting. We shall want to know in December how far they have got, but I can assure you that the Govern­ment will not let this issue rest until we get the changes that are necessary to put the CAP on to a healthy footing. Let me say, too, that the Common Fisheries Policy, in its present form, just will not do. (Applause)Now I come to yesterday\u2019s debate. I think we will all agree about this, that there is no more knowledgeable or authoritative forum in the United Kingdom to discuss the issues that were talked about yesterday. I believe that it has a wealth of experience, it embraces a wealth of interest that cannot be equalled in any other political or other forum throughout Britain. We have got to argue the matter out ourselves, because if we cannot solve it, I do not believe there is any other group in the country that can. When I hear yesterday\u2019s debate, when I hear the difference of opinion that was expressed, who else is going to resolve it, if we do not? Of course the unions would work with the Conservatives, but can you see that kind of dialogue going in the Conservative Party? Of course not. We know it could not. So we have the responsibility, and there is a responsibility upon Government, upon Party and upon the unions, and I think it is a responsibility that is generally accepted.One feature struck me as I listened to every speech yesterday afternoon - and if it doesn\u2019t sound masochistic - in a detached way, I en­joyed them. (Laughter) As one foreign visitor - one of our socialist colleagues from abroad - said to me: \u2018Where else would you get such a depth of debate, such a clash of view, without personal venom, conducted at that kind of level?\u2019 Where else? I think it was a lesson in democracy yesterday. (Applause)One of the features - and I think you will agree with me - about yesterday\u2019s debate on economic policy was the concentration on pay. Apart from Denis Healey\u2019s speech, there were some scattered references to inflation, but that was all. The great emphasis was on pay policy, was it not? Well, I understand that. But the beginning of pay policy for the Government is not - to use Clive Jenkins\u2019 words - to intro­duce artificial curbs on people\u2019s increases in pay. The beginning for the Government is not that. The beginning for the Government is: how do we keep inflation down? That is where we start from, and therefore the beginning of our consideration of these matters is: how do we live up to the undertaking that we all entered into a year ago - more than that - that we would get inflation down into single figures and keep it there? Yes, it was facing us more starkly then than it is now. It was closer to our recollection. It was within our experience. It is a measure of the success that the Government, the trade unions and the people of this country have had, that it is now further back in our consciousness, that we talked more about pay and less about inflation. The Tory spokesman said at that time that we could not get inflation down into single figures and that if we got it there for a month, it would go up again. Well, Denis will correct me if I am wrong - afterwards, please, Denis (Laughter) - but I think I am right in saying that it has been there now since last April. And he has forecast - and I put the responsibility on him - that it will stay there for at least another six months. That is 12 months and it is the result of the policies we have followed.This year\u2019s pay increases, as we were reminded, have exceeded the figure that the Government thought would keep it down into single figures. This year\u2019s pay increases have exceeded that. It is having an effect. But as was pointed out yesterday, because of other circum­stances that I have always acknowledged - the influence of the level of the pound sterling, the influence, obviously, of the cost of the products you have to import in order to feed into your manufactures - these have helped us. Adven­titiously, but they have helped us to sustain and restrain the more adverse impact that otherwise there would have been on the cost of living index, if we had relied on wages alone because, as we pointed out, we did not stick to the 10 per cent.Now I want to put this to you. The Govern­ment\u2019s best assessment this year - and we have to make these assessments like everybody else - is that earnings over 5 per cent are likely - I will not say \u2018certain,\u2019 because once again we do not know what the adventitious factors will be - but increases in earnings over 5 per cent are likely to carry inflation back into double figures. It is 8 per cent now. You can get into double figures of earnings over 5 per cent.This is the Government\u2019s preoccupation, and I say with respect to everyone who spoke yes­terday that I got no guidance from Conference on how you would expect the Government to react to that situation. This is very important, because we all have to take decisions. The trade unions have got to take their decisions, the Gov­ernment has got to take its decision. We said in the White Paper that we think 5 per cent is an ambitious target. This may seem an ambitious target, we said, 5 per cent. Well, we were right, were we not? (Laughter) But, in many of our competitor countries, settlements have been at or below this level. Yes, that is true. I certainly do not want to say anything about current indus­trial disputes, but I think I am entitled to point this out. In Germany, the Metalworkers\u2019 Union made a settlement last April for all the metal­workers in the Federal Republic, which included the German motor-car Ford workers. And it was 5 per cent - 5 per cent. Now, I draw no com­parisons. I leave others to do that. But what I do ask is that those who are going to bargain responsibly should take into account not only the domestic situation, but the competitive situ­ation, too. I recognise and acknowledge that the German rate of inflation was below the British rate of inflation - 8 per cent here, 4 per cent or thereabouts in Germany. So the German worker will be better off with his 5 per cent than we would be with our 5 per cent. But what is the objective of this? It is to get ourselves into a position where our workers can have the same standard of life as the German workers, without inflation. That is the objective. (Applause)I do not want to go on paying tribute to them, but I really sincerely believe in the sincerity of the trade union movement. I believe them when they say that they intend to bargain responsibly during the, next 12 months. I always have believed in that. But unfortunately there is no agreed arithmetic definition of the word \u2018respon­sible\u2019 when you are making pay claims. Indeed, I have never yet known a union put in a pay claim that it thought was irresponsible. So I repeat my question - the question that the Government faces. Supposing that all these responsible pay claims in the end add up to inflation moving back into double figures, with all that implies. What then? You heard the delegate yesterday telling me: \u2018If inflation goes back into double figures, we shall demand full compensation.\u2019 Yes, just like you did in 1973 and 1974, and we had to call a halt. We all agreed we had to call a halt. But supposing inflation does go back into double figures - what then? Do we desert our determi­nation to keep down inflation? Does the Government stand by paralysed and watch helpless­ly? No. It is the Government\u2019s inescapable responsibility to keep down inflation, not against anybody, but in the interests of the whole of the people of this country. (Applause)I would like just to make this clear. If yester­day\u2019s decision resulted in a weakening of the impulse that pay policy has had in helping to keep inflation in single figures - not doing it on its own - and, if as a result, inflation starts to move up, then the Government will take offset­ting action to keep inflation down through monetary and fiscal measures. That is our responsibility. It is necessary that the country should know that the Government accepts that responsibility and that we shall not seek to evade it, and no one can relieve us of it. These alterna­tive measures that we shall then have to take will be taken. I still rely upon the trade union move­ment as far as they can possibly go. I have never asked the trade union movement to separate themselves from their followers. I have never said that a trade union leader can lead his people in a voluntary free trade union movement - I am not talking about those behind the iron curtain - where they do not want to go. That is why I have always said that incomes policy depends on acquiescence - it depends upon support. We have failed this year. The Government has failed. We have not got it.So I still look to you, all of you, to make the maximum contribution that lies within your power. You have a job of education to do with your members, just as we have with the country as a whole. The alternatives that we shall take will have an impact, you know. I should not say alternatives - I hope they will be additions. I hope pay policy will still have a part to play through the responsible level of the settlements. They will have an impact, for example, if the Chancellor decides, in order to keep inflation down, that he is not going to permit the monetary supply to increase at the level that it would have increased at otherwise. That will have an impact on companies\u2019 liquidity - indirect, not obvious - but it will be there. It will have an impact on the level of wages they can pay. It will have an impact on the number of employees they can take on their books, or keep on their books. I do not want to follow this path - I do not think anybody else does. But until you tell me: \u2018Go back on your policy of keeping down infla­tion,\u2019 I regard that as totally - totally - my responsibility and that of the Government. If you tell me that is not so, then I understand - I shall understand. But I do not believe that is our view. The Secretary of the Transport and General Workers\u2019 Union said yesterday: \u2018We undertake to help the Government to keep down inflation.\u2019 I understand - I accept and I am ready to see how we can carry that further.What next, therefore? We have been left with these decisions. I have indicated the path that the Government will continue to follow, for we cannot leave it there. I took note of what was said - no, not what was said - I took note of the passionate feeling of the Conference about low-paid workers yesterday. I ought to point out that although you may not regard it as satisfactory, the White. Paper - and I am sure you all know it by heart - made provision, though probably not satisfactorily, in respect of low-paid workers. It is not enough perhaps, but it does make provision. There is nobody sitting here - not even me sitting here, as one newspaper said this morning, lonely and forlorn. I must say I felt at some stages yesterday like the old Scotsman who died and went up to heaven and as he got to the pearly gates he was met by St Peter. He thought he had been pretty good in life and St Peter reeled off a whole set of sins and said: \u2018You are condemned to outer darkness.\u2019 And the old Scotsman said: \u2018I didna ken that I had sinned.\u2019 St Peter replied: \u2018Well you ken the noo.\u2019 (Laughter)Well, all right, I ken the noo. (Laughter) (Applause) Now look, how are we going to help the low-paid workers and prevent that from feed­ing all the way through the wages structure? I am talking practical trade union negotiating, and we all know what we are talking about. How do we do that? How do we prevent it feeding through and at the same time keep inflation down to single figures? Help me do it. Do not just throw all the responsibility on the shoulders of the Cabinet and say: \u2018That is your job - you go ahead and do it.\u2019 We have got to have some assistance, you know, or flexibility. Is it to be one way? There is a whole paragraph on flexibil­ity in the White Paper, in the most perfect Treas­ury English. It could not be better phrased. Is flexibility to be one way? Yes, I am in favour of flexibility, that is what we said. Is it to be one way? I always thought it meant you went two ways. Well, how do we get there?I would like to make absolutely clear that just as Into the Eighties said, when talking about low pay in paragraph 43:'We do, however, believe that there must be each year a thorough discussion with the trade union movement so that there is a broad understanding in this as in other areas of our national economic life.'We said in the White Paper rather similar words:'It\u2019s the Government's view that the coun­try should aim at a long-term approach, in which collective bargaining is based each year on a broad agreement, with a view to keeping inflation under control in the following 12 months.'Well, we have not done it this year. But I do suggest that I am very - not only ready, but anxious - to take up with the trade unions, if they wish to do so at any time, the longer-term approach to this problem to see how we are going to avoid in future the difficulties that have arisen during the course of the current year. We all have our responsibilities to fulfil. But I do not believe - and I hope you will pardon me for saying this so dogmatically - that when you are asking, and we accept that the Government must control the economy in order to try and get back to full employment, that we must not use whatever means we can in the economy to se­cure our social ends. I do not believe, and I do not think you believe, that wages can be left out of that calculation as though it is something that does not affect it. So let us have some more talks about it, by all means. I would welcome any approach - indeed, I am ready to make an approach myself - if the unions care to take it up, to see where we move from here.I think the position is plain. The Government will carry out its inescapable obligation to pre­vent inflation by whatever means are at hand to it, relying as much as we can upon the responsi­bility of the trade unions and upon our fixed policy, which I will try to interpret as easily as possible within the limits that are laid down in the White Paper. We are ready for long-term, or indeed short-term discussions, but we must find a better way to resolve the issue of pay levels. The power of the organised worker in society today demands that we do. We heard them yes­terday - Sid Weighell promising that Joe can dig the coal, but he will not move it. Oxygen work­ers, who are the next on the list, will be able to take out much of Britain\u2019s industry over a matter of weeks. The power workers can shut off our lights. The sewage workers can stop work, too, with all the consequences. Yes, society today is so organised that every individual group almost has the power to disrupt it. How is their power to be channelled into constructive channels? That is a question for the Government, but it is a question for the trade union movement, too, and I hope that we can begin to talk about it.Now I will move on, because I still have some things to say and I hope you will bear with me for a little while longer, because that - if you do not mind - was just a parenthesis in the speech. (Applause) Let me return to a most important and significant question that concerned Conference so deeply yesterday. That was how to reduce the high level of unemployment - a level that has been the scourge of the industrialised world - especially, as somebody pointed out, since the oil price rises of 1973. Our Government has devised new measures on an unprecedented scale to reduce the impact. Over a million indi­vidual men, women and young people have benefited from special Government schemes, like the temporary employment subsidy, the Youth Opportunities Programme and others. As a result, unemployment in Britain is hundreds of thousands lower than it would otherwise have been. Yet week by week in the House of Commons we have listened to Conservative Mem­bers attacking these job schemes. They know that if their attacks on our schemes had been successful, hundreds of thousands would have been added to those people who are out of work.The Government\u2019s programme for giving assistance to the unemployed, although it has not met our objectives, has no equal in the West­ern industrialised world. We still have to find jobs, as was pointed out yesterday, not only for those out of work, but for the 170,000 extra every year coming on to the workforce - a daunting task.Let me outline to Conference some of the initiatives we shall take to restore full employ­ment. I will go into some detail on this, because I think it is something that cuts at the heart of our movement.The young: By next Easter, every young per­son leaving school this year - and how thankful I was to see in the August and September unem­ployment figures the number of young people who were gaining jobs - including the physically and mentally handicapped, will either have the offer of a job, or be offered a training place or work experience. (Applause) As soon as we can, we intend to offer all 16-18-year-olds at work the opportunity to continue in relevant education and training. And Shirley Williams proposes to publish our proposals on that in the form of a White Paper during the next session.On work training, we have, as you know, fos­tered the biggest training system by Govern­ment, and by aids to industry, in our history. We intend to sustain and expand this, and in the case of small firms, in addition to the measures we have already taken, we intend to extend the Small Firms\u2019 Employment Subsidy next year to encourage growth and job prospects in this very important and growing area of the economy.The National Enterprise Board was set up in the teeth of opposition from the Conservative Party. Along with the Welsh Development Agency and the Scottish Development Agency, it has become a major force at the very heart of our economy - in motor vehicles, computers, machine tools, aero engines, engineering and electronics. The NEB is a lynchpin in firms with a combined total of 300,000 jobs. We intend to strengthen the financial resources of those bodies and expand their key role in the national industrial strategy. They will use their powers wherever necessary to improve industrial per­formance and therefore to safeguard jobs. We shall encourage the NEB to increase the scope of its regional boards in the north and north- west. It is rapidly acquiring a reputation for bold initia­tives in the industrial sector. It demonstrates the practical relevance of our philosophy of inter­vention and partnership in industry.On shorter hours, we have listened to the advice that has been offered, and I think we should respond in this way. We ought to be in the forefront of discussions within the European Community. Our aim would be to try to secure agreement to progressively reducing the work­ing week throughout Europe during the 1980s. Such a move needs international co-ordination, if we are to remain competitive. It cannot now be used as a means to earn extra overtime, and indeed people said they would not use it in that way.Now I come to a group that perhaps has not had as much attention paid to it as it should have had - the long-term unemployed. This is a group that has been concerning us very much. Over 300,000 have been out of work for 12 months or more. The majority of them are will­ing and ready to work, but through no fault of their own they cannot find a job. Every single one of them I regard as a standing reproach against us all. It is our major priority to over­come this problem. I spoke about plans to give every school-leaver an opportunity. Now we intend to try something that is even more dif­ficult - namely, to begin the preparation of a similar scheme for the long-term unemployed. It will have to be introduced, it will take time to work out, so as to avoid disappointing hopes. We would propose to introduce it during the lifetime of the next Labour Government, and I am asking the ministers most closely concerned - Albert Booth and others, like Eric Varley - and the agencies to undertake, as a matter of urgency, the studies necessary for a practical scheme, with the objective of offering to all the long-term unemployed an assurance of help to each of them. For every one of them the aim would be to guarantee an offer either of a job, or of an opportunity of new training, or of retraining. In this way, if we could succeed, we would dras­tically reduce involuntary long-term unemploy­ment, and as far as possible put a time limit on joblessness. That is our aim, and I put that to Conference now.I have referred to the need for Government intervention and for protection for the worker in the coming period of great industrial technologi­cal change. I have also referred to the conditions necessary if we are to keep that success that we have achieved. All these are essential for our material progress. But then I want to ask the question: what kind of society are we working for? Perhaps you will allow me, in the last few minutes of my speech to spend some time on this. What kind of society is democratic socialism about? It goes without saying that we want a peaceful and prosperous society. But we also stand for a caring society, a society that responds to the needs of its people, a society that is untainted by racial, colour or any other form of bigotry, a society that enables people to play a full part in the control of their own affairs. On this last point, we in the Labour Party seek a genuine democracy, social as well as political. First, we need greater participation by the citizen. We live in an age - and part of the debate yesterday showed this - where the old certainties are being challenged, where the experts, the bureaucrats, and even the politi­cians find their answers only partly acceptable or not wholly satisfying. We need a new basis for authority, and there will be no sounder guide than the words of R H Tawney, which Joan Lestor quoted in her Chairman's address yes­terday - namely that authority \u2018must rest upon consent.\u2019 Joan, I picked it up as you said it - it is a good text. The informed, active agreement of the individual citizen will certainly be sounder than the notions of the gentlemen in Whitehall, or even - dare I say it? - of the editors in Fleet Street.One of the new phenomena of modern politics has been the rapid growth of what I call single-issue pressure groups, usually formed by con­cerned people, deeply devoted to a cause which they press vigorously. The devotion and effort that they expend reveals clearly to me that there is a source of democratic strength that we have not yet fully tapped, and to which we should respond. Our society will be healthier if we can find means of channelling this energy into new forms of participation. It will also ensure - and I think this is sometimes overlooked by these groups - that they are concerned not only with their own work, but with the consequences that their pressures have on other aspects of public policy. That is why. I believe that in politics as a whole it is necessary to embrace all these indi­vidual issues. I would like to divert the energies of some of the single-issue pressure groups into the general political field. The Labour Government is moving forward in this field. Let me give you five examples of increased participation, all of which are controversial, all of which we hope to carry forward in the coming session of Parlia­ment.One, we intend to legislate to give employees in industry the right to more information about their firm\u2019s affairs, about their investment plans and other matters of importance. We want employees to have a bigger share in the taking of decisions that affect their well-being, and perhaps their very jobs. It will be up to the em­ployees themselves, under our legislation, to see that that happens.Two, the referendum on devolution, intended to give the people of Scotland and Wales a chance to express their views on whether they wish to have a greater voice in their own national affairs.Three, at a different but still important level, we shall legislate to give parents and teachers more influence in the way their schools are run.Four, we will legislate in the next session to give tenants living in council houses greater con­trol over their own homes. We want to foster a greater sense of responsibility and a feeling of pride in them. (Applause) Five - controversial, but I know you will support it - subject to the recommendations of the Royal Commission on the Health Service, which we hope to receive during the next year, we intend to undo much of the damage caused by the Tory reorganisation. (Applause) We want to make the management of the Health Service more responsive to the patients and to the dedi­cated people at all levels who work in the ser­vice.Our aim in all these matters - and this is part of the kind of society towards which I want to see us moving - is a society in which everyone who wishes can feel that they can play a part, and do play a part, in the decisions that mould and shape their lives, that they do not feel that they are ciphers whose future is being decided for them by people who are supposed to know better.Next, I hope we can give a deeper meaning to this participation by reasserting the traditional values of those who founded our Movement. I do not wish to dramatise the changes that have taken place. There are countless examples of individual kindliness, selflessness and caring. We all know them. Yet we do seem to have lost - do we not? - a certain amount of consideration for one, another. Modern society, as I was saying earlier, is now so interdependent and organised that it is fatally easy to disrupt it. When there is a dispute, how often is it the innocent person caught in the middle who suf­fers most? That was not the attitude of the pioneers, nor is it the attitude of a society that calls itself caring and considerate. We have a responsibility, as a movement, to find a better way for resolving disputes than invoking anar­chy to make our point.Another issue of deep concern to our people, in which standards have slipped, is in the matter of crime, violence and vandalism. I look forward to the discussion we shall have on Thursday afternoon. I am very glad the Conference Arrangements Committee has put it in. The statement we shall consider then, which I believe is already before you, emphasises that the Government has provided and will continue to provide full resources and support to all those responsible for crime prevention, but it will remind us, too, that every citizen has his part to play. The nature of crime, the causes of crime, depend to a large extent upon the values that society lives by, and in determining the attitudes of the young, the example of their parents is paramount. (Applause)Next, let us place more emphasis on our belief that democratic socialism is about quality as well as equality. Let us take housing as an example of what I mean. I could have chosen three or four. Indeed, to tell you the truth, I did choose three or four, but you are lucky, you are only going to get one. (Laughter) Take housing. There is much to be proud of in our post-war housing record, but if we are honest, we must admit that in our eager­ness to remove old evils, some new ones were created. We could all name developments built with pride two decades ago which are now them­selves slums. In our eagerness for the grand design we should also remember that we are building for people, for families, for com­munities. In the old terraced streets there was a sense of warmth and community feeling, what­ever their shortcomings. The daughter lived close to her elderly parents, the grandparents were around when the children came home from school, the neighbours were ready to assist in times of trouble. All this helped to create a real community. We have to get back to this. Too much of it was lost in the redevelopment schemes of the 50s and 60s. (Applause)On the doorstep, every councillor and every canvasser hears the problems of council tenants: \u2018It\u2019s taken them six months to come round and fix the tap.\u2019 \u2018I want to move nearer my elderly mother, but I can\u2019t get a transfer.\u2019 \u2018The lift\u2019s gone wrong again.\u2019 Week after week we sit and we hear these complaints. Today we must stress that we are not just concerned about the number of houses that are built, but about the quality also, about the type of community we live in, to satisfy the needs of those who live in them. As democratic socialists we do care, we must care about these things, and we must do our best to get them right. (Applause) Quite apart from the position of the home-owner, which we have assisted, I believe that the Tenants\u2019 Charter is not only important in itself, but it also helps to raise the quality of living. We intend to introduce this new charter, which will extend the rights and freedoms of council tenants, the right of a council tenant to security, the freedom of a ten­ant to improve his own flat or home and to get improvement grants when he does it - like the owner-occupier. (Applause) Let the individual tenant decide if he wants a new kitchen. Let him have a choice of colour for his front door. Let the tenants be involved in running their estates, so that they suit their needs. These are for them, for their lives. They are not just there for the con­venience of town hall officials. This is what we are about. (Applause)I must say just one word about devolution. I have been asked when Scotland and Wales will be able to vote. The Government proposes that this historic decision should be submitted to the people of Scotland and Wales at the earliest poss­ible date after the coming into force of the new electoral rolls in February 1979. The exact date will be fixed - and deliberately fixed - so as to let as many people as possible vote on a live register, so that we can get a full indication of the way people think.Madam Chairman, I am sorry to have taken so long. Let me now sum up what I think is our approach and what is my approach. We do not want to win support as a Labour Government that will be presenting itself to the people. We do not want to win support on the basis of fear. We are the party of hope. Yet I think we have every right to assert that Britain would be a cruder, a more unjust, a more selfish society if Tory val­ues were to prevail. (Applause) In and out of office, they are the consistent champions of privilege, and of the strong, and of the wealthy. Let them succumb, if they wish, to the tempta­tion to make scapegoats, to pick on minorities, including racial minorities. Let Labour have none of it. Our commitment as a Party is to a harmonious, peaceful and united society, and that is absolute. (Applause) At home, we shall face the future with confidence, but in no mood of complacency, as I hope what I have said illus­trates. The British people know that the nation is capable of much, much more. Ours is not a tired nation with a past and no future. Our best days lie ahead. There are energies to be released, talents to be channelled. We are one of the world\u2019s few industrial powers self-sufficient in energy and with vast reservoirs of talent. We encourage these talents not only so that the indi­viduals concerned can make the best use of them for their own reward, but out of concern for their neighbours, too. We deny, I repeat, that there is some choice to be made between an efficient Britain and a caring one. They go together. And Labour\u2019s call - the last call that I make to you now, as we go into the year ahead - is this. We wish to unite everybody in our nation under our banner - young and old, black and white, English, Scots, Welsh, Irish, everybody who shares our beliefs. We invite them to unite under our banner, to join us in building a new and better Britain, in which our traditional values, our democratic socialist beliefs, will uphold the challenge that Britain will face in the next decade. Ours is a message of hope for the 1980s, based on a record of promises kept, and in due course we shall submit ourselves with confidence to the British people. (Applause)

aVMr. Chairman, I know you were correct in your rul­ing a minute ago about, I think, the delegate from Thanet who wanted to move a motion of no confidence, but he should not feel too lonely in that, there are a lot of other people who want to do the same. He will get his chance, I am sure, in due course. There is no reason why special privileges in this Party of ours should be afforded to any one person to do a job that other people want to do.This Parliamentary report is divided into two parts. First of all, the period up to 3rd May, when we were the Labour Government, and, second­ly, the period since then. And I want to deal first, and clearly, with the part of the record that runs from the date of the last Conference up till 3rd May. I also want to review in general what hap­pened in the period of the Labour Government from 1974 to 1979 in order that we can all examine as fairly and as dispassionately as pos­sible how true is the charge that the Labour Government and the Parliamentary Labour Party failed to carry out the Manifesto or ignored the policies put forward by Conference and by the National Executive Committee. I wish to put the record straight. No one need think that the Parliamentary Labour Party, or myself, comes here in any apologetic mood this morning about our work from \u201974 to \u201979. (Applause) We not only carried out much of the Manifesto, we carried out much of it without a majority in Parliament. (Applause)Let me remind you of some of the matters. You asked that North Sea oil should be brought under public ownership and control: we did it, and now the Tories are fooling around trying to dispose of it. You asked that the Price Commis­sion should be set up: it was, and consumers were saved hundreds of millions of pounds in higher prices and now the Tories are abolishing it. You asked that there should be a National Enterprise Board to stimulate British industry with new capital, new management and now the Tories are fettering it. You asked for Scottish and Welsh Development Agencies: they were set up. Ask Scotland and Wales. They safeguarded old jobs, they developed new jobs, they built new factories and now the Tories are reducing the resources that were devoted to them.Reference has been made to the Employment Protection Act. Was that not worthwhile, giving greater security to men and women in jobs and now the Tories are seriously weakening and undermining it. The aircraft industry, the ship­building industry, both nationalised and nationalised with a majority of one - and now the Tories are trying to sell them or shut them down. I say to Conference, with the benefit of 34 years\u2019 experience in Parliament - and there are now only a dozen of us who are left from that great 1945 victory - I say to you that those two Acts of Parliament got through by the Parliamen­tary Labour Party represented a vast parliamen­tary effort by every member that compares in intensity and in devotion, because of the fierce­ness of the Tory opposition, because of our slen­der majority, that intensity of effort compares with any Act that was put through by the \u201945 to \u201951 Government when they had a majority of 100. (Applause) We only had a majority of one.Women\u2019s rights were established more firmly by legislation; legislation against discrimination against women in employment and in housing and now the Tories are undermining those rights. The improvement of the real standard of life for the pensioner by linking their pension increases to wage earners\u2019 pay increases - not worthwhile? Well, the Tories think it was; they are now abandoning it and every pensioner will suffer as a result. Eighty-three per cent of chil­dren at the end of our period of office in com­prehensive schools, and now the Tories are try­ing to reverse that.And what about the other achievements? Legislation for a new Race Relations Act. The effective ending of the agricultural tied cottage. New benefits for the disabled. The highest number of doctors and nurses ever; 45,000 more nurses when we left office than when we came in; 5,800 more doctors. The largest number of teachers ever. Is that not Socialism in action? And so I could go on. (Applause) The Devolu­tion Bills, the Mobility Allowances for the dis­abled, the child allowances, invalid in-care, and I have left out a score of others.The Chairman yesterday gave a list of some of the things we did not do, and I readily acknowledge that this is so. But, if we are going to have a balance sheet, let us have both sides of it. (Applause) Indeed, he could have added a cou­ple. He could have said we did not introduce a Freedom of Information Bill, and we did not, although we tried to make more information available. He could have said that we did not introduce a Wealth Tax, that we introduced a Capital Transfer Tax. He would have been right and he knows, and we all know, the reasons for some of these difficulties. But I claim, and I claim without apology, I claim proudly, that any fair-minded member of the Party who looks at the balance sheet reads a fine record of Manifesto achievements carried out by a minority Government. (Applause) Every constituency delegate and every trade unionist is entitled to be proud of it, and, indeed, you were proud of it when you went on the doorsteps before May 3rd.The Government\u2019s troubles and differences, especially with the National Executive Commit­tee, came over some aspects of economic policy. That is where the troubles were. Let me remind you, therefore, what the position was when the Labour Government began office. Let me remind you what the Manifesto said. The most serious statement in the Manifesto of 1974, which was the backcloth to everything we had to undertake, was that - and here I quote - Bri­tain faces its most dangerous crisis since the war for years. I need not remind you of that back­ground: the three-day week, the balance of pay­ments deficit, rapidly increasing inflation, money supply out of control. Harold Wilson came to this Conference just after the General Election of 1974 and he said to you, at the very beginning of the 1974 Government, that Britain would have to wait for improvements in our standard of life for at least two years or more. You applauded him, and it was true. And then, last year, the improvement came. He said two years or more, perhaps a year out, but the improve­ment came and last year the Chancellor, Denis Healey, was able to say that there had been the biggest improvement in the previous months, in the previous twelve months, in our standard of life for many years, and it was true. And we met the difficulties and thanks to the co-operation of the trade union movement we overcame them. But way back in \u201974, and that is where we start from, you know, on this record, it was inflation that was the overriding preoccupation of the nation. To the housewives it was undermining their daily lives, it was making long-term economic decisions about new jobs and new investment almost impossible and the policies that we followed, with full co-operation, were successful in reducing the inflation, the major problem that the country felt.So, when we met a year ago we were reporting that the rate of increase had gone down from 25 per cent a year to under 8 per cent a year; nearly double again now. And we had an objective agreed with the trade unions to try and bring it even lower to 5 per cent or thereabouts. And we achieved what we did when we got to the lowest figure of 7.4 per cent a year ago because of the close co-operation, because we worked out agreements between the Government and the trade union movement on the broad ranges of social and economic policies, including the yearly level of earnings.Last autumn was the worst testing time, as those who were here a year ago and remember the dates will recall. But I was very sorry to hear repeated in authoritative quarters yesterday in this Conference, the myth repeated that the Labour Government took no notice of our Con­ference discussion last year on pay. That is sim­ply untrue and Michael Foot gave the real account in his great speech yesterday afternoon. (Applause) If there is still any slight dubiety remaining let me then underline and comment on one or two of the things he said.This time a year ago, presenting this very report, I undertook, in the light of the discussion we had had on the Monday afternoon, that we would make arrangements for further talks. Those talks, Mr Chairman, were actually arranged whilst delegates were sitting in this Conference, during Conference week. They actually began on the Tuesday after Conference - that is to say, as it were, Tuesday of next week. And they began between representatives of the General Council and Labour Ministers. How can it be said we took no notice? There was a series of meetings that went on for three weeks. Intensive negotiations took place. Has it all been forgotten? At the end of it we reached a new agreement between the representatives of the trade union movement and the Labour Ministers.When the Ministers came to me, I put it on the Cabinet Agenda on Thursday, November 9, five weeks after the last Conference, and the Labour Cabinet on that morning agreed that new understanding. That was what I did in the way of responding to the Conference discussions. Do not let anybody dare say we did nothing about it. (Applause) It was a great blow to me personally, and to the Government, when the news reached us on November 14 - six weeks after Confer­ence - that opinion was equally divided in the TUC and so the agreement could not come into effect. I offer no criticism of that. These approaches were made in good faith. The dis­cussions took place in good faith. It was not possible to reach an agreement, but do not let anybody say we did not try. We tried our damn­edest and we nearly succeeded. (Applause)I have always taken the view that unless there is agreement with the trade unions a Labour Government cannot, in the long run, survive. And four months later we fell. I cannot say I saw it coming in the actual way it did, but I knew that there was little hope, once that second major effort had broken down. So, what I have said supplements the account that Michael gave yesterday. Let the myth be destroyed once and for all, that after last year\u2019s Conference we took no notice of what was said.The lesson I draw is the lesson I have always drawn, consistently uttered and tried to follow, that a Labour Government\u2019s economic policy will only succeed when we work in close con­junction with the Trades Union Congress. If I thought our present Prime Minister would listen to me, I would offer a word of advice to her, that as soon as she ends her arms length hostility to the trade unions, the better it will be for this country. Let her swallow her prejudices about this.We all know the consequences of last winter\u2019s breakdown. We are going to live, the people of this country, with a Tory Government this wint­er. David Basnett in ten minutes yesterday gave a devastating exposure of the effect of Tory Party policies, the Government\u2019s policies, and I do not intend to take your time by repeating it this morning. Every delegate knows where their policies are leading. Every trade unionist is already feeling it. Every local councillor is aware of it and the public are becoming conscious of it. This winter the housewife, the wage earner, the industrialist will live with a rate of inflation that has been doubled; industry starved of cash; more bankruptcies; even higher unemployment, and an international forecast that in 1980 Tory Britain will have a higher rate of inflation and the lowest rate of economic activity of any industrialised country in the world. Put that up against those 48-sheet posters that we saw displayed on every hoarding during the General Election \u2013 \u2018Don\u2019t just hope for a better life,\u2019 they said, \u2018Vote for one.\u2019 I wonder how many of the people who took that slogan seriously now repent and regret that they did.Mr Chairman, I have every faith that our Labour Party will win the next election, but it will not be enough to win it by default. I think we will all agree about that. It will not be enough to win it just because people are disillusioned with the Conservatives. If we do, we shall be back in the same trouble that we were in last time. We must make sure that the next Labour Govern­ment starts with a clear mandate and agreement of what it will do, and that means that we should now embark - and I know we intend to do so - on a period of lively discussion and argument. I have no objection to that. I have taken part in many of them in my time. I dare say I will con­tinue to do so. There is nothing new in it. There has always been intense discussion in this Party. We are a Party of protest as well as being a Party of government and there is a genuine reason for the present discussion. Perhaps some people have different motives, I do not know. I am not here to attack peoples\u2019 motives, but there is a genuine reason why we should have this discus­sion and try to be willing to learn the lessons from our defeat.There are many delegates, good delegates to our General Management Committees, many trade unionists who are genuinely concerned because of the way in which the Labour Government\u2019s efforts finally came to an end. So, there is widespread agreement on the need for a full inquiry and we must examine carefully the argument that is put forward. I do not wholly accept it myself, but it is put forward and it must be examined - that it was the structural relationships between the various parts of the Party, especially the Parliamentary Labour Party and the National Executive Committee and the Con­ference, which were the cause of our defeat. Yes, let us examine it.I heard the Chairman yesterday say he was not looking for new policies, he wanted existing policies to be implemented, but, as every dele­gate knows, there is a world of difference bet­ween us passing a Resolution at this Conference and facing the task of translating that into legislation and action by a Labour Government. (Applause) There is nothing new about this prob­lem. Our old friend, Manny Shinwell, was telling me on Sunday that he himself raised the issue, before he got into Parliament when he was a young delegate at a Conference in the early part of the 20th century, 1907 I believe, 60 or 70 years ago; he said he was given a severe ticking-off. He was told there could be no outside interference with the Parliamentary Labour Party. Since then, the issue has been raised from time to time. The last time I can trace there was a serious debate in the Conference about it was in 1960, when the independence of the Parliamentary Party was once again affirmed. But now 20 or more years have gone by since 1960. There is no reason, when you are convinced of the strength of your case, why you should not be willing to sit down and examine the matter again, no reason at all; let everybody do so. Labour Members of Parliament and a Labour Government - and I state this as a principle before we begin the dis­cussion - are bound, both in duty and in consci­ence, to pay the closest attention to what Con­ference decides and any Member of Parliament who did not accept that obligation would not be worthy of his responsibilities.The General Secretary said yesterday in words that I wrote down at the time that it was the duty of the Parliamentary Party - I quote \u2013 \u2018to take serious note of those policies.\u2019 Is that what is being demanded? If it is, then we can have the discussion very easily. Or, is it more? I agree that that is the duty and the conscious responsibility of the Parliamentary Party to do that and every one of us must take it seriously, and I believe that in general we try to do so. But I affirm the independence of the Parliamentary Party and of the Labour Government - at the end of the day they must take the decisions, they are responsible. They have the responsibility of facing the electorate. They have the responsibil­ity of arguing for their policies before they can be elected, not by Conference but by the people of this country. I say to you that this Conference will settle nothing today if it passes the resolutions that are on the Agenda that Members of Parliament should have no part in deciding the Manifesto on which they fight except, yes, they will be consulted, they will be asked about it, and that the decisions should be left solely to the National Executive Committee - well, that is the decision you are being asked to take today. That is the one. And the situation, even if the Motions were passed, would not endure. A Labour Government would always be faced with the practical problems that do not obtrude them­selves when we are passing Resolutions at Con­ference.Now, this has a relation in some way, you know, to this question of reselection. I have not joined in this debate so far on reselection of Members - (Laughter) - no, as a matter of fact, I have not. It is one on which I have kept quiet. But, you know, it has got a bearing on it. Perhaps I have not played as much part as I should have done because, who knows how interested I shall be in ten years\u2019 time. But what I have noticed - and here I place my experience before Conference - is that over the many years that I have been in Parliament that Members of Parliament have become more independently minded than they were when I first entered. They want to play a greater part in checking Government. We had trouble in the last Parliament with some of our own Members who sat on the Select Com­mittees because they wanted to go against the policy of the Government, and my colleagues will remember it, but they were sitting on a Select Committee and they said, \u2018We are inde­pendently minded; we want to reach our own conclusions,\u2019 and they did, and we are seeing further evidence of this change in the attitude of Members of Parliament of all parties, not just the Labour Party, of all parties - the Conservatives are moving in the same direction - by the setting up of these 12 departmental committees that are going to monitor and check on the work of Ministers in 12 separate departments.And another change. Being a Member of Par­liament is becoming much more of a full-time occupation for Members than it was when I first entered the House. That is something that you should applaud. I do not take all the arguments that are put forward on this mandatory business about the consequences that are going to follow. I do not believe it is going to have too much effect on the security of sitting Members of Par­liament. It may have some effect in a small number of cases, but I think in the great majority of cases it will not have that effect because in the overwhelming majority where there is a sitting Member of Parliament he has a good relationship with his General Management Committee. That is the truth of the matter and we all know it and those of us who go regularly to our GMCs - and allow me to have a modest boast; I am a delegate from my own ward and branch to my own GMC, as I have been for many years - those of us who go regularly know that Members of Parliament and their GMCs work for the most part very closely in harmony.No, I do not care for it, but we have got the new rule already. That, I think, is a compromise that Members of Parliament thought should be accepted, but this new one that is going much further, in which you are going, apparently, to have a continuous process of reselection in between Parliaments during the lifetime of Parliaments, I think my worry about it would be not the loss of security - I think most Members of Parliament will win the day - but I think it will mean that GMCs will be much more divided; it will make it much easier for carpet-baggers and factions to grow up. It will be up to the Member of Parliament and the GMC to try to settle that sort of thing. (Applause) Having disposed of what I regard as the sec­urity argument, although I accept fully the words of my shop steward, Joe Ashton, that he uttered last year. Let me say to those who advocate it - and I understand that they advocate it on the grounds that it will make Members of Parliament become more responsive  to their constituencies - they had better face the possibility that if Members of Parliament become more responsive to their constituencies they may become less responsive to the Whip in the House of Commons and even to the National Executive Committee. (Applause) If the Parliamentary Labour Party or the National Executive Committee, when it assumes full authority over us all, if it seeks to secure a common line of action, I tell you you have got a second think coming because my view is, and I am looking at this as objectively as I can - my view is that because you are strengthening - (Laughter) - well, I have no vested interest in it, whatever some of the young members may have - my view is that the effect of what you propose to do - and I gather the votes are in the bag, well, good luck to you - but the effect of what you are going to do will be to strengthen local Party control and weaken central Party control.Do not believe that all the constituencies have the same views about policy, especially where there are sitting Members of Parliament. Look, be serious for a moment. We are a party of change, and a party of change by its very nature requires common, concerted action, and such a party should consider very carefully before it fractionalises into 635 pieces. The central thrust that comes from common action, so the result may not be what the movers of these proposals think it may be.I think that if the votes go through, and I understand they are already in the bag, it will throw an even heavier responsibility on that committee of enquiry that we have agreed to set up to look at all these factors and see what you want to do about it. Of course, if any of you want to recall your delegations during the lunchtime and think again, I shall feel this speech has been worthwhile. (Applause) And when the enquiry report comes back, then I hope Conference will consider what I have said and also what the enquiry report itself will say.Now, I am glad that on the question of the Manifesto the National Executive Committee went part way to meet me and others on Sunday by deciding to withdraw their own proposal. That would have been an intolerable proposal, trying to push it through this week without any discussion with the Parliamentary Party and they saw the wisdom, or the unwisdom, of doing that and so they withdrew by a majority. So, they have come some way to meet the objec­tions. But, you know, there are similar resolu­tions on the same subject today which they are ready to accept, so it was a tactical withdrawal and not a strategic withdrawal. What they would have the effect of doing would be that these changes would come into force in 12 months time instead of coming into force immediately.I repeat on this issue, to pass these resolutions will not settle the issue and I assume that is what we want to do. We have to sit down together, the National Executive Committee, the Parliamen­tary Committee and the trades unions and con­sider seriously the nature of the relationship that should exist between us. This is the fundamental issue and I believe, having settled that relation­ship once again, having looked at it and decided what it should be. What is the role of the National Executive? What is the role of the Par­liamentary Party? What is the role of Confer­ence? Having settled that, I believe, you are more likely to get agreement after you have had discussion and these other questions that you are so anxious to vote on today, they will begin to solve themselves automatically because you will have settled the fundamental question. So, first, let us settle by agreement the nature of the relationship between the various parts of the Party, then we can settle for some years to come these questions about election of leaders, con­trol of the Manifesto, reselection, and so on.These questions are important, but it is illogi­cal, in my view, to take the decisions first and then ask a committee of enquiry to look into them afterwards. (Applause) That is why I believe the Trade Union Committee for Labour Victory were right when they asked the Execu­tive to request that these matters should be remitted; not to sweep them under the carpet, not to get rid of them but in order that there should be a proper and serious discussion. Then you will carry people by agreement, because I promise you, in this Party you will not carry them by anything else.The enquiry committee will also have other things to look at; issues like membership and finance and structure and organisation of the Party. I hope they will look at some of the other matters that were raised here yesterday morning in the debate on the result of the General Election. What about the regional pattern of our vot­ing? Why did we do so well in Scotland and yet, as was pointed out by the candidate for New­bury, we won only 11 seats out of 161 in the South of England. We had first class candidates in both areas: what cost us seats in the industrial Midlands? I wonder whether it was because there was no agreement about what the place of the low-paid worker should be against the place of skilled worker? (Applause)Let them inquire into why so many women, especially young women, did not vote for the Party. I can understand young women voting, perhaps, for others rather than me, but I think there may be more fundamental reasons. There was a poll taken during the General Election that, I must say, I found profoundly disturbing. It said - taken in the month of April - it said that the Tory Party was regarded as having more concern for ordinary people than the Labour Party. Well, we know what we think about that, but it is not what we think about ourselves, it is what other people perceive about us. That is the problem.It is the first time in the history of politics in this country that I have known such a result. So, let us all examine ourselves, everybody, and see what reasons we give for these things. After all, everybody wants a Labour Government to suc­ceed; we are all united in that, so let us avoid a lot of internal party-bashing among each other and let us have a bit of Tory-bashing for a change. (Applause)We fought on the slogan that \u2018The Labour Way is the Better Way\u2019 and I challenge anybody in this hall - and everybody agrees with me - to say that that is totally and absolutely accurate. It was the better way. It would have been the better way, and our major task in the next 12 months is to rebuild our action programme, to reorganise and mobilise support against the Government backed by their big money, by their obedient press and by their cynical advertising. Let this Conference, by its decisions, show that our unity is together, that we mount the great fight back our people need - and that they expect from us. We fight for the housewives and for the families, for the pensioners, against the increase in the VAT and the decreases in benefits; for the children and their schooling, for the sick and their proper care; to shield the reg­ions of England and Scotland and Wales against the cutbacks in public expenditure that are so damaging to our society. I challenge the Tories. Let them name any­thing that is as important as a National Health Service in which we can all take pride. Let them name anything that is as important as a fair deal for our pensioners.Let them name anything as important as giv­ing the child the maximum opportunity for its future. Let them name anything as important as giving the young training and skills for the new technology. That is what public spending is about, and a Labour movement must call upon the nation with a united front not to pit prejudice against prejudice, but to fight by strong and hon­est argument, to fight the Conservative assault on essential community services and to fight until we drive home the truth to every man and woman in this country right through the armour plating of Conservative prejudice.How dare the Government tell these groups - the children, the pensioners, the sick - come back in two generations; the money supply is more important than you. (Applause) Conserva­tive idea of values is to stick a price tag on everything. Some things and some values cannot be priced. People do expect community support. They do expect the Government to bring for­ward programmes of action to protect our basic rights. The Government is neglecting that responsibility today and it is our duty to take up the challenge.I do not pretend that every problem can be solved by throwing money at it, but we do know that these problems will not be solved by the undermining of our essential services that is tak­ing place.Mr Chairman, there are many other problems that I would like to discuss but time is going by, so perhaps you will allow me a few more minutes to bring up one or two other matters that I believe to be of importance.Let me begin with the problem of South Africa\u2019s apartheid that has been thrown into promi­nence by the arrival of the South African rugby team here this week. We are against this tour. Ted Rowlands and Dennis Howell together vis­ited the Foreign Office to tell them of our opposi­tion. Then, at the National Executive Committee meeting on Friday, we unanimously agreed a statement condemning the visit. The Tory Sports Minister, Hector Munro, has advised against the visit. Lord Carrington appears to be against the visit. The French Government has banned the tour. The Irish Government has ban­ned the tour and the team is still coming to Bri­tain. The powers are there: why do not the Gov­ernment use them? (Applause) Why do they now show the same ruthlessness in banning this tour as they can show when they dismiss an area health authority or close an old peoples\u2019 home? (Applause)Conference will make clear its views. Change comes in South Africa only when it is put under pressure politically, economically, culturally and in sport.I must also now quickly pass on to the ques­tion of the whole future of Zimbabwe Rhodesia. It will not be enough for the Government to get agreement on a new constitution - an important advance, but not enough. If peace is to come with majority rule and the security of all races - yes, we care about the white people there as well as the black people - if security is to come to all of them and to be guaranteed at the Lancaster House conference, then it must settle other major questions: the structure and powers of the transitional government that will lead to full majority rule; devise the arrangements for supervising the election; arrange the conditions for a cease-fire and agree the main principles which will merge and integrate the armed forces, three armed forces, that are now operating inside and outside that country. These problems are extremely difficult. Many attempts have been made and have failed.There is a prospect of success now. I have spoken personally and privately with all the leaders attending this conference and I say to you that given the follow-up to the initiative that began at the recent Commonwealth Conference, these problems are not insoluble.Mr. Chairman, the Parliamentary Labour Party will be ready to vote for a continuation of sanctions if they cannot be achieved, but we would prefer and will much more welcome our ability to support a just settlement that is agreed on these matters.I speak about Northern Ireland. I do not think that any of us have become inured or insensitive to the continuance of death and violence in Northern Ireland, nor do we forget the long-term impact that living in the midst of it must have on the young minds of those whose childhood is spent in such surroundings - ten years now in which it has been going on. But if anyone had forgotten, surely that powerful and moving plea and appeal by the Pope last weekend would have stirred us all again.During the last General Election, when I was asked questions on this, or, more frequently, shouted at, I said that despite the many attempts made by Merlyn Rees and Roy Mason, and their disappointments in trying to bring the political parties of the province together, a Labour Gov­ernment after the General Election would make a renewed effort. And let me now pay tribute to the work of Merlyn Rees and Roy Mason and to their courage, and, indeed, to all others - (Applause) - and, indeed, to all others who, in the pursuance of their public duty, take their lives in their hands.Well, we tried. I said we would do it. Unfortu­nately, it is not now in our power as a Govern­ment to do it and since the present Government took office we have, up till the moment, seen few signs or clear statements of their political inten­tions. The National Executive Committee has tried in the past to produce a properly thought out policy. We did not find it easy for there are no blueprints waiting for someone to pick up. Quite separately from the efforts by Labour Ministers during the period of the Government, the Executive took its own initiative, set up a special study group which we welcomed, visited Ireland, both North and South, saw representatives from the trade unions and from the political parties, but at the end of the day I have to record - and the Executive Committee has indicated that they wish me to say a word about this - I have to record that we were not able to come forward with an agreed statement. The Execu­tive Committee decided last Friday to talk once again to the parties involved so that we make a new effort to prepare a comprehensive policy. We must work closely with all concerned and it is the duty of the Government itself to make a renewed effort, and I call on them to do so and to consult once again; not only with all the parties but to maintain close contacts with the Govern­ment of Ireland, the Irish Government.I know there are some who hold this view - I heard it many times during the Election cam­paign - that a solution will come when British troops leave Northern Ireland. It is a view that is expressed by American politicians too. But at the present time, both they and the police are playing an indispensable role and it would be irresponsible for our Government, or for this Government, to abdicate its responsibilities for the lives of its citizens. We pay our sincere thanks to our soldiers and to the police, and to all others, for their efforts, which will be made all the more successful with full co-operation from the South. But none of us believes that there can be a military solution in Northern Ireland. We all know that the overwhelming majority of people, both North and South, wish nothing more than to live in peace. If a working agreement could be reached, and this I think is the task to which the Government must now apply itself, if a working agreement could be reached between the politi­cal parties it would enable the people as a whole to share some common ground in the immediate future that lies ahead; it would be the greatest blessing for them.We call on the Government and the Northern Ireland parties to come together for meaningful talks about the future and we, for our part, will continue to support all efforts to reduce the level of violence and to come forward with positive and constructive proposals in due course. Mr. Chairman, I should have liked a discus­sion about the Middle East, where next week I shall be visiting for talks with President Sadat, Prime Minister Begin and King Hussein of Jor­dan. We welcome and we support the peace treaty between Egypt and Israel as an important beginning for a new settlement that will cover a wider area, especially the future of the Palesti­nian people. (Applause) President Sadat and Prime Minister Begin, by their imaginative actions, brought about a potentially more hope­ful situation than we have known since the foun­dation of the State of Israel in the Middle East, and so let me add - especially in view of the attacks that are made on him at the present time - and so, let me add, without the patient deter­mination of President Carter whose great efforts on this part I applaud, this process, I doubt, would have gone so far. But what has been shown, and this is important for all of us - this is not just some issue that is extraneous to us - what has been shown by this peace agreement is that negotiations can yield results in the Middle East and I hope that lesson will not be lost on the Palestinian people or their leaders, whose legitimate desire to choose their own future must be subject only to one main condition, that the final arrangements must not thereby endanger the security of the other states in the area.I hope the Conference will allow me to carry that message in my discussions next week, for we are directly concerned with peace in the Middle East, not only for its own sake, not only for its effects on those who live there, but also a direct concern because of the impact of war in that area on the industrial economies of the West, including our own.Mr. Chairman, I have spent some time on these things because we, in this Party, are the heirs to the Labour Party\u2019s great tradition of internationalism and I wish that Conference could find more time to spend on international affairs. We might then see some of our own policies in a truer perspective, and we might also, incidentally, have a clearer idea of how we appear to the rest of the world. One thing I am certain of, whilst it is true that we have problems that are particular to ourselves, as well as advan­tages, the changing nature of world relationships means that we cannot solve all our problems by ourselves. We must co-operate fully with others. There is one attempt through the European Community.As far as that is concerned, it will continue to be hampered by its wasteful and costly agricul­tural policy, as well as by its institutional arrangements. I said before, and I say again now, that if Britain cannot get a satisfactory new financial settlement then we should announce, this Government should announce, that we will put a net financial ceiling on our contributions, but, having said that, do not throw the baby away with the bath water: Europe shares many problems; our trade unionists know this, they see it every day in their international contacts. Many of the same problems they share with us - steel, textiles, the micro-economic revolution with its effect on jobs, all examples of issues that we will not solve by ourselves but would be better solved by co-operation.The problems of the 1980s are before you. They are almost here now. They are almost upon us, the world. I sum up to you in six or seven words what they will be - employment, pover­ty, the use of resources yes, the Ecology Party may not score many votes but they got to the root of the problem - (Applause) - race and peace. The prospects for peace now are not as good as when we signed the Helsinki Agreement four years ago in 1975, and this movement should be taking note of this and we should be applying our minds to it.All these problems have international dimen­sions. A start has been made in a primitive way to co-ordinate the economic policies of the major industrial nations. A kind of beginning has been made through the North/South dialogue to recon­cile the conflicting needs of the industrial nations, the developing countries and the oil powers, but we in the community of nations are still novices in the art of international survival. Some of the powers can destroy large parts of the world in minutes. Other powers are even now seeking to acquire the same deadly means. Yes, we can all make the world worse in a few moments. But to make the world measurably better will take years or decades. It cannot be right that the world should collectively spend a billion dollars a day on weapons. It cannot be right that 700 millions of our fellow human beings are suffering from malnutrition. It cannot be right that across the world each year 15 mil­lion children die under the age of five and 15 million of these tragedies occur in the poorest countries. It cannot be right that a person\u2019s average lifespan in a poor country is 30 years shorter than in a developed nation. It cannot be right that two-thirds of the people in the poorer nations do not even enjoy fresh drinking water.Here is the challenge for the international community for the rest of this century. Here is the challenge for international socialism. (Applause) Our task is to re-order our priorities and this is why I have ventured to spend so much time on this matter this morning, quite apart from our internal affairs which, although vital are not the only issues in the world. It is vital to re-order our priorities so that every member of the family of man can be liberated from hunger and from disease and the acute hardship that is the lot of so many.We, I am glad to say, in our small way, thanks largely but not wholly to the insistence of Judith Hart in the Cabinet, we increased substantially our international aid and had plans to increase it by 6 per cent a year, the largest increase in our programme of any. Well, it was only a drop in the bucket but it was worth doing and I contrast it with the miserable penuriousness of the present Government, whose first act is to cut what we did. Our task is to do this, because without these basic foundations of human dignity all talk by Western leaders of democracy will sound like humbug to hungry millions of people. If we want our democratic values to triumph, and I do above all, then we must embark upon an interna­tional programme in the 1980s of partnership and sharing that has been unmatched in history. Indeed, if you will forgive the word, what we need is a new international social contract.In the words of Hubert Humphrey, and I will end with this: \u2018Our strength is not to be meas­ured by our military capacity alone, by our industry or by our technology. We will be remembered not for the power of our weapons, but for the power of our compassion and our dedication to human welfare.\u2019 Those were his words and that, Mr Chairman, should be the true face of socialism that this Confer­ence, and we ourselves, should present to our people - (Applause) - and let me add, in this increasingly interdependent world, our compas­sion and our dedication which we should show in our own internal matters, every one of us, whenever we appear, not the arrogance of pow­er. Let us show what socialism really is about when we appear on the television or talk about our rights and what we demand; that is in this increasingly interdependent world our compas­sion and our dedication cannot stop at our own frontiers. That is our task for the 1980s.

aVI am not sure whether that applause was to enable the photographers to get their photos and get out of it, or whether it was a genuine appreciation. I am going to assume it was the second. (Applause)Every succeeding Conference has its own atmosphere, sets its own objectives, and they are all different. Last year, in the face of our defeat, we had a Conference that was basically looking backwards - backwards to what had gone wrong, why we were defeated. A period of self-criticism is healthy. But you know we have got some very strong-minded individuals in this movement of ours. But despite all of them, I believe there is in every Conference a general will that seems to emerge almost unknowingly to set its own objectives. And I believe this Conference is in the process of doing the same thing.Yesterday I listened, as we all did, to some very important and good debates, beginning with the resolutions on the economic situation, moved in forward looking, not backward looking, constructive terms by the General and Municipal Workers and seconded by the National Union of Mineworkers. We listened to one of the best debates on energy that I can recall, to an excellent debate on education, and on transport. I must say I enjoyed the high level of debate and some out­standing speeches - I found myself in agreement with some of them more than with others. But I was confirmed in my view that a general will is emerging and will emerge as the week goes on from this Conference, and it is this: that every­thing that we say and do shall be directed towards achieving a basis of unity and a basis of unity that will develop the thrust that is required to rid our country of a reactionary, hard-faced and incompetent Government, headed by the most self-opinionated Prime Minister since Neville Cham­berlain. (Applause)What is there that can divide us when we have a reactionary Government in power now that can reduce the real value of national insurance be­nefits to the 1930s, or a mean, hard-faced Government that does not even spare the nation\u2019s physically and mentally handicapped children from their penny-pinching economies? And an incompetent Government that cannot even con­trol the supply of money - the instrument which they told us was all that was required to settle our problems and to bring down inflation. We did not believe them then and we have been proved right since.But how different it was all going to be when Mrs Thatcher was campaigning 18 months ago. It was to be a land of tax cuts, where everybody would be in work, either standing on their own feet or somebody else\u2019s. (Laughter) Just like the good old days. Well, 18 months later the good old days look remarkably like the bad old days. Even the tax cuts have turned out to be phoney. The total tax burden on the average family in this country is higher today than it was when Labour left office. As in the 1930s, the depressed areas of industrial devastation have re-emerged in Wales and in Scotland and in the North and on Merse­yside, and this time in the West Midlands. They are to be added to the list. Last time it was the town of Jarrow that symbolised the political ban­kruptcy of the system. This time it is the men and women of Consett. And no one could have heard the delegate speaking yesterday and listened to him without feeling anger and a new determina­tion that the men and women of our country shall not become the pawns of the market-place and the market economy.There is a callousness about the attitude of Mrs Thatcher and Keith Joseph and Geoffrey Howe that compounds the wickedness of their policies. Firms are being made bankrupt, whole sectors of industry like textiles and footwear are closing down, order books are at a low ebb, output is slowing, new investment in plant and machinery is cut back, interest rates have never been higher, over two million men and women are out of work. And the reaction of Thatcher, Joseph and Howe is that what is happening is clean, healthy and will purge us, and we will emerge leaner and fitter. They go on saying it as if it were a matter of pride. It will get worse before it gets better. To them every company that goes to the wall is a sign of economic realism. Every new man or woman on the dole is proof that competition is working, even if they are not.In this new Britain, failure has become success. Rising bankruptcies become the rejuvenation of British industry. According to Mrs Thatcher, an increase in unemployment means that we are still on course. Words that will rank with \u2018let them move house\u2019 for insensitivity. There used to be an advertisement with the caption, \u2018Even her best friends won\u2019t tell her.\u2019 (Laughter) But they are, and telling her loudly and clearly. Even the newly ennobled proprietors and editors of the newspapers are biting the hand that lifted them up. The magisterial Times sums up the Government\u2019s plight with a lofty leading article - well, what else would you expect? - headed \u2018Miles Off Course.\u2019Let us look at the evidence for that. Compare the record of our last 12 months with their first period in office. Employment - not unemploy­ment: when we left office 160,000 more jobs had been created than in the previous 12 months. Now there are 400,000 fewer jobs. Unemployment: with Labour unemployment fell by 90,000 in our last 12 months. Under the Conservatives 600,000 more men and women are out of work in the last 12 months. Job vacancies: 50,000 more in the last 12 months of Labour\u2019s office. 130,000 less in 12 months of Tory office. When we left office there were too many school leavers seeking jobs - 190,000. Now there are over half a million. Interest rates: May 1979, 12 per cent. Under the Conservatives, 16 per cent. Money supply - the totem pole of the Tories: Labour, 12 per cent. Under the Conservatives, 18 per cent. Inflation: 10 per cent when we left office, now over 16 per cent.Take some of the price rises that go into inflation. Gas prices did not rise in the last two years of the Labour Government. Under the pre­sent Government, up by 26 per cent. Coal price increases: 13 per cent in Labour\u2019s last 12 months, 37 per cent under the Tories. Electricity: a 4 per cent increase in Labour\u2019s last year, 100 per cent under the Conservatives. Dental charges: £5 a head, now £8. Prescription charges: 20p, now £1 in December next. School meals: 25p with Labour, now an average of 55p. Mortgage rates: 11¾ per cent with Labour, 15 per cent and an additional £20 a month with the Conservatives. Economic growth: 3 per cent higher in Labour\u2019s last year, 2 per cent lower under the Conservatives. Industrial production: 4 per cent higher with Labour, 9 per cent lower under the Conser­vatives. Manufacturing output: 3 per cent higher with Labour, 5 per cent lower under the Conser­vatives. Private manufacturing investment: 10 per cent higher with Labour in the last 12 months. It will fall this year by 10 per cent under the Conservatives.That is the Tory balance sheet, a record of unrelieved failure. And every company chairman and director who is driven into the bankruptcy court and has to call in the liquidators should send the bill to Saatchi and Saatchi. (Applause) And if anybody wants to ask why we need unity in this movement, it is to ensure that we can reverse that calamitous decline that has taken place since they have been in office. (Applause)Of course I know we got a lot of things wrong. We are not archangels and we never were. Yesterday I heard a delegate advising Conference on how to vote. You may remember him. He came to the rostrum and told us how to vote on all the resolutions, and particularly to beware of the resolution that had been moved by the General and Municipal Workers, seconded by the National Union of Mineworkers, that called for a different strategy. And he asked us to beware of it because he feared the consequences of working out these arrangements between the Party and the trades unions. Beware, he said, or we shall find ourselves in the position we were in before. Friend, there are millions in this country today who would love to be in the position they were in before. (Applause)David Basnett rightly said that the next Labour Government will need to retrieve what he called a crisis situation. And faced with such a situation, we shall need priorities. We must determine those priorities and I have no doubt what they must be.The first priority and our first pledge to our people must be that we shall so organise our affairs that we aim once more at securing a high and stable level of full employment for our peo­ple. That is and must be the top priority. (Applause)Some people have told me that after 16 months of hibernation I have woken up in the last couple of months. (Laughter) Well, I can never get to sleep with that fellow behind me. (Laughter)I tell you what it is. There are fewer of us now. Many of you younger delegates are experiencing for the first time and seeing for the first time what we grew up with in the Thirties, what brought us into the Labour Movement and what, inciden­tally, will mean that we shall die in the Labour Movement and will never leave the Labour Movement. (Applause) However bad a socialist I may be in the eyes, of a great many of our col­leagues, I know why I and many others of my generation were bound to be in the Labour Party. We were determined that the Thirties should not be seen in our lifetime. And as I reach - and draw no conclusions from this - and get near the end of my political life - see what the commen­tators make of that - (Laughter) - but as I see the conditions being repeated once again, the policies being followed once more that we thought we had destroyed forever as the result of the 1930s, I cannot but feel a deep indignation and anger that this generation should be required to go through the things that our generation went through. And I am determined to fight it as hard as I can. (Applause)There are a lot of initiatives that will be needed in this crisis situation that was  referred to by David Basnett and Lawrence Daly - many initiatives, and I cannot outline them all this morning. But this Party has a responsibility for outlining them in detail during the course of the coming week. But more than that, over the next 12 months, in conjunction with the trade union movement, to work out a policy that can be agreed. It must be agreed. I have never seen so much talent as there is burgeoning in the Labour Party at the present time. But you have got to work together. You will not succeed unless you do - all of you. (Applause)But what we need, both urgently and in the longer term, first of all on the international front is joint decisions by the industrial countries to reverse the mistakes they made at Venice, to promote economic growth and employment as the top priority of the world. We need international agreements to stimulate world trade. Tem­porary import controls Moss Evans referred to yesterday - yes, he said temporary: I accept that. I think it is necessary in view of the clamping down on demand that has taken place and the fact that this Government has certainly not done what is necessary to re-stimulate demand. But I emphasise that they cannot be long-term protec­tionist policies. Beggar-my-neighbour policies are no policies for socialists. And I am glad to see that the Transport and General Workers agrees with that. Yes, recycle the huge OPEC oil surp­luses and revenues that they have now got and which they cannot use. They cannot absorb the imports that would ensure the employment in the debtor countries to pay the debts, so they have got to be used in the Third World. And I want to come back to that a little later. Use the North Sea Oil revenues to modernise Britain\u2019s core indus­tries instead of financing unemployment. Lower interest rates and the exchange rates. We must secure an agreement and understanding to keep growth in money incomes, as David Basnett said yesterday, and the growth in productivity in line in order to avoid inflation. That is the purpose of it.We must stimulate more public spending, especially on public and private projects. There are times when public expenditure has got to be controlled. But now is the time to expand it. When Ray Buckton painted the picture yesterday of what is happening to the railway system of our country, how penny-wise pound-foolish can this Government get by keeping down the public sector borrowing requirement to its present level? More resources to the National Enterprise Board at the present time, more money on training and apprenticeships. Stan Orme has pointed out more than once that a whole generation of our young people today are missing the chance of apprenticeships. How can that be replaced? It can be replaced by the Government now. A conservation of energy programme. Those are only some of the things that need immediate attention by the Government. Others are set out in the Liaison Committee\u2019s document.And I say one other thing. Our Party has always been the Party which has used local authority resources as a means of improving the lot of our people in education, in housing and in some aspects of health, trying to build up a decent environment in our cities and our towns. This is a form of practical socialism - municipal social­ism, if you like. But once again we must restore - and we pledge ourselves to restore - to our own local authorities, to our own people who were elected to those authorities, the responsibility for determining how the needs of our people locally are to be met in that direction. (Applause)I would like to move on. The posters around this hall are headed \u2018Peace, Jobs and Freedom.\u2019 And there are no bigger tasks for the world than peace and its security. I would couple with that the relationship between the developing world and the industrialised world. And the world\u2019s leaders must take note of the growing demand for peace throughout the world.During the last 12 months we have seen out­breaks of war and violence in South East Asia and in South West Asia. One war in particular is going on even now. Europe, although it still remains comparatively stable, has seen a heigh­tening of tension. But it is obscene to observe the nations of the world rushing to spend more on armaments, the Western industrialised nations setting a bad example and even the Third World countries following in our footsteps.Overshadowing all this, bad as it is, all these regional disputes, important as they are, in the Middle East, in Latin America, in South West Asia, in Afghanistan, is the dread horror of nuc­lear war, on a scale that would totally transcend the destruction of Hiroshima. The consequences are unimaginable in the destruction of our civil­isation, in lands laid waste and the populations that will be decimated and the survivors deformed.Don\u2019t think that any of us who have had any responsibility for these matters are less caring than those who have not had that direct responsi­bility. I have said before and I repeat again: I do not believe that there is anyone of the generation that fought through the last war, be it Brezhnev, Carter or anyone else, who would release a nuclear weapon. I do not believe it. I have had the advantage of personal talks with all of them. I know the horror. They know the horror. Those of us who are perhaps closest to it know more than anybody else what the consequences could be.But the nature of the problem has changed since that idealistic CND agitation of 20 years ago. Then there were four - at the most five - countries which possessed the nuclear weapon. Now middle-sized industrial countries, even some classed as developing countries, are now possessing themselves of the technology. How do you deal with this? This is one of the two great problems that the world has to face, important for the whole future of mankind.How can Britain\u2019s influence best be used in order to achieve this for all mankind - not just for ourselves but for everybody? There is no one here who would suggest that our policy should just be governed by fear. That is not an argument that I would expect to hear advanced and I do not believe it will be. Fear is a bad counsellor. We want to see not only our own country rid of these weapons but other countries too. And Britain has an important role to play.At the end of last year the situation turned rapidly for the worse by two events. First of all there was the decision of the NATO countries to station Cruise missiles in Europe. That was fol­lowed by the invasion of Afghanistan by the Soviet Union. The consequence of those two actions was that tension became heightened, and I must say I felt more pessimistic than I have felt for a long time. Admittedly the Cruise missiles were to be stationed in Britain and in Germany in three years\u2019 time. But it led the Soviet Union to say, rightly or wrongly - in my view wrongly - that they would not negotiate on a reduction of nuclear weapons in Europe unless this decision by NATO was reversed and therefore three years would elapse and the Cruise missiles would come. I never believed it was right and said so to those who would listen in the Soviet Union. Until NATO had reversed its decision, they said, no negotiations, ignoring the fact that the Soviet Union itself was adding every week one new SS20 with three warheads to its arma­ment, 30 new backfire bombers every year. Well, our own Prime Minister would be one who reacted in the way you would expect. She rattled the sabre, she stepped up the pressure and she called for strong measures. Thank God there were other statesmen in the world who could see the situation a little differently.It was left to Helmut Schmidt, the Chancellor of Germany, a man who had seen war at first hand, to take the initiative on this matter. And by skill and by mediation he has achieved a shift in the Soviet Union\u2019s position that is of profound importance. He went to Moscow, he discussed this matter with Brezhnev last July and he sec­ured, either because Brezhnev was ready to do it or by the force of Schmidt\u2019s own convictions, a change in the Soviet Union\u2019s attitude so that after July Schmidt was told by Brezhnev that he would withdraw that pre-condition. Schmidt then sent Genscher, his Foreign Minister, to Washington to confer with the Americans and President Carter, in the middle of an election. He sent him to see how the United States would respond to the changed Soviet attitude, where the Soviet Union were no longer insisting that Europe should reverse its decision on the Cruise missiles as a precondition to any talks and any negotiations. They have now limited their preconditions to two. One is the ratification of the SALT II agreement, and the second is the desirability of including the forward-based sys­tems in Europe in the negotiations. Both are conditions that should be accepted.President Carter is under great pressure in his own country, fighting art election. Nevertheless, he took a decision for which we should congratu­late and thank him. He took a decision that Mus­kie and Gromyko should meet as they did and he indicated a readiness to initiate and to begin fresh talks. Secretary Muskie and Mr Gromyko met, as you may have read in the newspapers. They cleared the way for new negotiations. Those new negotiations will begin in Geneva on Monday week, on 13 October. These talks are of the greatest significance to the world. They can lead to a new and lower balance between East and West, to limit the arms race in medium range ballistic missile systems in Europe.Some people say to me, \u2018Look, if Britain would give a lead, if only you would take a moral stand on this, you would get a response.\u2019 Com­rades, I know of nothing to justify that assertion. I wish it were true. I would like to think it was true. But look at the record. I recall that shortly after he came to office President Carter renounced the building of the new B1 bomber - one of the most significant weapons that was likely to emerge. Was it followed by any response from the Soviet Union? No. Then we had the proposal to introduce the neutron bomb. That too was dropped. Did it meet with a Soviet response? No.I have recently spoken at length with Chancel­lor Schmidt on these issues. I can only tell you his views, and in my view he is the leading statesman now in Europe on this matter as on so many others. It is his view that not only does the present build-up go far beyond the security needs of the Soviet Union, but that it is the fact that the NATO alliance refusal to reverse its decision to abandon the Cruise missile that has made the Soviet Union come to the conclusion, fearful as they are of the use of this dreadful weapon, that if there is to be serious and mean­ingful negotiation then they must start from the present position. It wasn\u2019t giving up anything that put them in that position. It was because they saw that the Western Alliance\u2019s position was cohesive. That happens to be my view but it is - even more importantly perhaps - the view of the Germans who have at least as deep a concern about this matter as we do. I do not believe that the great Labour Movement is going to say in the face of this, \u2018Stop the world, we want to get off.\u2019 It is surely our task to back to the hilt, seriously, and sincerely, the negotia­tions that will begin on Monday week in Geneva, agreed in the middle of an election campaign by President Carter, and to press our own Prime Minister that she should stop the sabre rattling and join in the effort by others who possess greater insight about these matters than she does. (Applause)Let me repeat our task - the Labour Move­ment\u2019s task. And we have great influence with other parties in Europe and elsewhere. It is not an influence that if we take a view that they think is self-regarding totally that they will follow. They will then say, \u2018What is happening to the British Labour Movement?\u2019 But we have an influence if we put our weight behind these negotiations and if we put our weight behind a search to rid the whole of the peoples of the world of the nuclear weapons, then we have an influence which is out of all proportion to the fact that we are still in opposition. And I beg of you not to weaken the position of anybody in this particular matter. The Germans have as vital an interest - as great or greater an interest - as we have in the growth of this weaponry and there­fore of achieving a new equilibrium at a lower level which itself would lead then to further steps on this path of eventually ridding the world of these dreadful weapons. That is the position of our sister party now fighting an election, and how profoundly all of us must hope that Chancel­lor Schmidt and the SPD win this election in Germany. (Applause)I see that Herr Strauss says that he aims to be the Mrs Thatcher of Germany. Well, we would willingly transfer her at a much lower transfer fee than they paid for Kevin Keegan. (Laughter and applause)But truthfully we cannot wish the German people such harm as that.Let me turn to the other aspect of this prob­lem. The preservation of peace is of vital importance and underlies everything else. But just a word about what is happening with the Third World today. Our movement must take note - and indeed does take note - of the develop­ments that are taking place. The poverty in the world is growing and not diminishing. The Third World is sliding even more deeply into debt because of the oil price increases. World popula­tion - this will affect the younger delegates - is increasing at a faster rate than ever. Four billion people today. By the year 2000, 6.3 billion peo­ple is the best estimate that can be made. Think of the strain that is going to be placed not only on resources, not only on food, not only on energy, but also on the stable political relations that are needed in a world where resources may be get­ting less. Populations of the great cities esti­mated by the year 2000: Cairo, 20 million people; Calcutta, 20-30 million people; Mexico City, 30 million people. Think of the cost. Think of the strain on these developing countries that do not have our infrastructure to build on and ask your­selves what are going to be the political tensions in the world that will arise from that.The problems are beyond the capacity of any one country to solve. There is a need for mutual world interdependence on these issues, not only out of charity - although it fits in with our principles of mutual interdependence. The Brandt Report - another great German - has indicated some steps forward on commodity agreements, access for industrial products, the measures to stimulate economic growth, the relief from indebtedness. We have to put together three things, and we ought to be in the forefront of doing it, as indeed Brandt has taken it up.First, the industrialised world now has vast excess capacity and over 20 million people out of work. Secondly, OPEC has vast oil revenues that they are unable to use and absorb the imports that are represented by those revenues. Thirdly, the Third World has vast needs to relieve poverty and hunger and illiteracy and disease. Surely it is not beyond the wit of man to put those three ideas together and to see how we can work it out. And for socialists it cannot be impossible to achieve that. We do it because it would provide work for the industrialised world. We do it because it would provide the aid and assistance that the developing countries need. We do it because it would ensure that the growing interdependence of the world is recognised. If we had the vision and imagination to do this - and I intend to pledge myself to work for it: I believe it is one of the greatest tasks there is - we should ensure that our growingly vulnerable world has a better chance for new generations.Now let me have one word about constitutional issues. I have offered my own advice and views on this to the Party in my speech at Brecon on July 3 and I need not repeat it now. There\u2019s nothing new about the discussions we have been having. The relationship between the constituency parties and the trade unions, and between the PLP, the National Executive and the Conference, have been discussed on many occasions in the last 75 years. As long ago as 1907 the Conference decided that they would instruct the Parliamen­tary Party to do certain things. Seventy-three years ago - rough lot this Parliamentary Party is, isn\u2019t it? But of course it is experience that has altered the situation, because what experience shows is that policy cannot be laid down. If it is to be successful, it must be agreed, and no amount of constitutional wrangling will produce a solu­tion. A satisfactory relationship between all the elements of the Party and its affiliated bodies such as the trade unions can be achieved subject to one condition, and only one condition. It will be achieved provided that it springs from mutual trust and confidence between the various bodies and personalities. (Applause)The most perfectly devised constitution will not work unless mutual trust is present. And if proposals are conceived because it is believed that some are traitors, that some do not have the will or lack the capacity, if that is the basis of proposals when they are put forward, then they will not be accepted. Now look, we have got to work together. For heaven\u2019s sake, I have emphas­ised this time after time. Proposals that are considered must not be on the basis that you cannot trust some other section of the Party. We are all comrades and we have got to work as comrades and believe in each other\u2019s good faith as com­rades. (Applause)And that mutual confidence is what I want to build up between the federal structure of our Party. It is a federal structure. It is essential. The trade unions and the constituency parties are the principal elements in that structure. They are. Never let it be forgotten, incidentally, that the membership of these two sections largely consists of the same people. But as I see from my vantage point on the National Executive Committee, they are apt to look at their common problems from slightly different angles. So what do we need? We need understanding that the role of each is essen­tial to the health and success of our movement.Hugh Dalton once compared the Labour Movement to a strong, growing tree. Without the trade unions, he said, there would be no roots and no stability, but it is the constituency parties who provide the heavy crop of political fruit. I believe that to be as true now as when he said it 40 years ago. As for the Parliamentary Labour Party, the one thing to which it is bound under the constitu­tion is the election manifesto, because the Par­liamentary Party has to carry it out. They are the people who have to do the job day by day, and that is why, quite simply in one sentence, the Parliamentary Party must be involved and share joint responsibility with the National Executive Committee and why the National Executive Committee in my view - and I say it in all good comradeship - are wrong to try to assume sole responsibility for the preparation of the man­ifesto. (Applause)Having said that, I do not want it to be thought that I believe the constitution is unchangeable or is perfect. It is not. We are an evolving Party. We can change it. But changes have got to be made against a different atmosphere from the present one. We have got to get away from this. For pity\u2019s sake, stop arguing. The public is crying out for unity in order to get rid of the Thatcher Govern­ment. (Applause)Mr Attlee is coming back into favour. He is being quoted by all and sundry. Every time I read an article or hear a speech I hear a quotation from Clem. I must say it only goes to show what hap­pens to us after we are dead. There may be a time when even I shall be cheered by the constituency parties. But in 30 years\u2019 time, not now. I do not ask for it now. (Laughter) But listen to what Clem said, because it is very apposite in my view to the present situation:'Self-criticism is a healthy thing as long as it does not lead to a paralysis of the will. But there is a danger that a party may be so concerned about its own health that it becomes a political valetudinarian incapable of taking an active part in affairs. It may discuss its own internal conditions to such an extent that it disgusts all those with whom it comes in con­tact.' (Applause)Comrades, for the time being we have had enough discussion I think we have all learned lessons from what has happened over the last two or three years. I do not exempt myself from that. I never have done. But I say to you that it is our job this week to look to the future after Thatcherism. We shall need both emergency measures to staunch the bleeding and, a long-term plan. Peo­ple have now seen that Mrs Thatcher\u2019s appeal to self-interest, to private profit, to the free market, is a failure in the modern world. We assert instead that everything depends upon the response which can be drawn from men and women acting for the common good, wherever they work - in indus­try, in local government, in education, in the health services, wherever. As one of the early socialists said - and I want to finish on this theme - we should take to socialism because it is ethi­cally right, otherwise we shall stop short at collectivism.To all of us, to all our colleagues, I say that we must begin with a framework of principle to give unity of purpose and action. The posters on the walls proclaim, \u2018Peace, Jobs and Freedom.\u2019 Let me add two more: \u2018Equality and Fellowship.\u2019 We are discussing all these issues this week. Yes, we believe deeply in freedom. It is as essential as the air we breathe. But we all believe that it is not just freedom as an absence of restraint, but freedom in fellowship, freedom as a positive fulfilment of a man\u2019s or woman\u2019s personality as a member of society.We are all united about this. And what a won­derful team we are when we get together and work together. It far transcends and outshadows anything the Conservatives can put up. But we all believe, everyone of us, that socialism is not just a fixed set of institutions. We are all agreed that it has an ethical basis and an underlying idealism. Sometimes our ideals may seem to conflict. We may conflict with each other. But the ultimate value of our society, to which we must all work, and to which we all want to work, depends on the way we uphold our ideals and - here comes the practical man creeping out - the extent to which those ideas can be applied in practice and realised.Now all my colleagues know that our task is to apply this to the Britain of the Eighties: the workers and the trade unions to seek more control over their lives and the direction of their own industries; women to build on the gains that they have made so far in pursuit of a true partnership and equality; the young in search of a society that will enable them to develop their personalities to the highest level of which they are capable; all of us, whoever we are to rid ourselves of inequality, whether it springs from educational differences, colour and race differences or differences of wealth. As a movement we must guard against becoming a mere agglomeration of sectional interests and pressure groups - many of them worthwhile, many of them utterly worthy in the objectives they seek, but taking only a limited view of society as a whole. Above all we agree, all of us - and this is the unifying factor - that the brotherhood of man was born out of a rejection of the view that a good society can be created from a mass of competing, self-seeking individuals.Comrades, we have won great battles. There is no need for us to be ashamed of what the Labour Movement and Labour Governments have done in recent years. (Applause) Now there are more to win: the battle for industrial regeneration at home, the battle for equality, the battle against world poverty, the battle, above all, for peace. That is our mission for the 1980s. Only the Labour Party can fulfil it. Nobody here, I think, talks any nonsense about centre parties or the rest of it. It\u2019s as dead as a dodo. Mere fluff. (Applause)But you cannot do it divided. You can only do it if you work together. Unite. That is the call for this Conference. Unite. And I call on every one of you to unite to roll back Thatcherism and forward to democratic socialism to save our people and our country. (Applause)

aVChairman and comrades, perhaps you would permit me to start my remarks with one personal recollection. It is 47 years ago that I joined the Labour Party in the city of Liverpool, and just about a year after I joined - or a year and a half - a general election was declared by Mr Stanley Baldwin. I got on the next train from Liverpool to London and I went along to Transport House and I went along to see the then national agent of the party, because I wanted to see whether it was possible to fight in that general election. I said to the national agent: \u2018Have you got any seats left where you haven\u2019t got Labour candidates?\u2019 They showed me the list. The general election was only three weeks off - they did things a bit quicker in those days. (Laughter) They showed me the list. I looked down it carefully and I saw some rather unattractive names, but along with them I saw a reference to the constituency of Monmouth. I said to the national agent: \u2018That\u2019s in Wales, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 (Laughter) I knew that much. I said: \u2018Can\u2019t I go there? Isn\u2019t that a good Labour seat?\u2019 They said: \u2018Well, you know, that\u2019s the country part of Monmouthshire and they\u2019ve also had a bit of a split in the party down there recent­ly. Maybe you can go down and heal it.\u2019 (Laugh­ter) So, you see, I have had quite a lot of practice at the game I am up to. (Applause)I will give you another lesson from the same recollection. The following day we set off on our election campaign, because I went down to Newport that night and was adopted by a properly-organised selection committee, I can assure you. (Laughter) There were only ten people there, but we managed the business very successfully, and we set off the next morning without any loudspeaker, one van and the mes­sage of democratic socialism. We went along to open the campaign with my friend Tom Powell, who was the agent of the Monmouth constituen­cy, and we set up our little stand just by the plinth that some people know in the little town of Usk. There Tom Powell got up to open our cam­paign and he said: \u2018Well, here we are in bloody old Tory Usk.\u2019 That is how he opened our appeal to the people of Monmouth. (Laughter) I learned from him that, even if that is what you feel, there are other ways maybe of successfully saying it. (Laughter) Those two lessons I got from that occasion.Yesterday's debate, I believe, revealed some of these other ways of saying things. Yester­day's debate on economic affairs exposed Gov­ernment policy in the way it ought to be exposed. It showed what we could have been saying and should have been saying effectively and unitedly over the past twelve months. (Applause) Much of it has been said and was said, I underline, by the Labour Opposition in the House of Com­mons, and I reject the charge that the socialist case, the party's case, has not been put there over this period; but we can do it better if we concentrate all our energies on the task. We all know the need to expose this terrible record of crime and folly which mounts every month and day by day. Perhaps it is not properly noticed everywhere that, almost week by week, the col­lapse of the Government\u2019s economic policies causes them to attack our free institutions. They must find scapegoats. So with every economic failure they turn more viciously on the local authorities or the trade unions or the nationalised industries or on the obligation of Parliament itself to provide full employment. I hope to try and illustrate these matters as I pro­ceed.Yesterday showed to the party and to the country, I trust, that we have an alternative strategy, we have an alternative policy. It was presented by Denis Healey, it was replied to by Tony Benn. I fully acknowledge to Tony from this platform the strong part that he has played in the preparation of that alternative strategy and the contribution that he has made to the party. (Applause) I want to see a new Labour Cabinet in which Denis Healey and Tony Benn and a few others - I will mention them too - play leading and honourable parts. I believe it is my duty to try and work for it, and the duty of everybody else. (Applause) Tony said yesterday that he did not want a Cabinet drawn up by the Tory newspap­ers; I fully acknowledge that. I do not know if he would like to see the list I have got. (Laughter) I can show it to him some time. There has been a bit of difficulty about some of these matters from time to time, you know. I have thought occa­sionally of going along to consult my old friend who, I think, is pretty well the best man in the business, Brian Clough. (Laughter) He is pretty good at picking teams, but he has had some difficulties himself recently. I thought at one moment that I might be losing Trevor Francis and John Robertson all in the same season, but I hope we can avoid any such troubles I think that this Conference is going to be a sign to the coun­try that we have.Tony referred yesterday to some of the events that are happening elsewhere this week: black Monday on the Stock Exchange - we do not know whether they have recovered on Tuesday, but there are many places up and down our coun­try that have had black Mondays where they have not had any recovery. (Applause) Black Mondays in Liverpool, black Mondays in Bir­mingham, black Mondays in Manchester, black Mondays in Ebbw Vale, the blackest days we have known in the last 30 or 40 years for our people. This is what we have to face above all other matters. I have only one or two additions to offer to what was said in the debate of this subject yesterday, but I say it in order that we should underline the terrible reality. The whole country knows - ought to know - that the total unemployment is the worst ever recorded. Of course we used to make the comparisons in reg­ions; we still have to do so. Some, like Wales and Scotland and the others, are even harder hit - Merseyside and some of the others - but now we also have to make comparisons in terms of age and sex and colour. The Manpower Services Commission prophesies that - today the figure for long term unemployment is 630,000 out of work for more than a year - and the Manpower Services Commission forecasts more than one million of long-term unemployed under that definition, by the end of 1983. Young people - we had the arguments most passionately and properly put about them in the debate yesterday. The numbers of women unemployed: over the past five years the numbers of women workers without a job have increased twice as fast as the number of jobless men. The figure is up to 900,000 on the register - that means it is well over one million unemployed women in this country today.Every day since the Tories took office, since Mrs Thatcher became prime minister, for every day since then 750 women have been added to the dole queue - every day. As to what has been happening in the figures for coloured workers, the unemployment figures are equally appalling. Unemployment totals, if they continue along this scale for any period, are going to drive deep fissures into our society. What happened in Moss Side, Liverpool and the rest is what we in the Labour party are dedicated to stop, but when I went to Liverpool and walked through the streets of Liverpool to see it with my own eyes, it is a monument to Thatcherism and to our failure in allowing Thatcherism ever to have occurred. (Applause) They tell us it is not their fault. It is all the fault of the world recession and Britain's chronic inefficiency. Well, that is a lie. But even if it were the truth, it is no exoneration. They could still act to reverse the decline. They tell us that they cannot, and that means they will not.The immediate alternative to this unparallel­ed disaster is clear. The Government can step in to get people working again. There is an enorm­ous amount of work which our battered country needs and there are vast armies of people waiting to do it. What is missing is the money which will enable those people to be paid to do the work. It is this which the Tories have set their face against. They will restrict credit; they will not extend it to the private sector or the Govern­ment. Yet it is the expansion of credit which enabled this and every other industrial country in the world to escape from peasant economies. They say that the funds available to finance gov­ernment expansion or industrial expansion do not exist. They apply this principle, for example, to the gas-gathering pipeline in the North Sea. Here is something which would be of enormous benefit to the economy by harnessing North Sea gas cheaply and effectively, but to say that you are going to leave it, as the Government does, to the individual operators, is like telling people that they must each be responsible for building the piece of road outside their own front door. (Applause) The Government is in a unique posi­tion to organise the project, but the Tory obsession about finance, and about public-sector finance in particular, blinds them to such oppor­tunities. If they are so concerned about the short­age of money, why are they encouraging so much money to leave this country by the removal of exchange controls? (Applause) Port­folio and other direct investment is now leaving the country at a rate of £6 billion a year, enough to finance a 50 per cent increase in Government borrowing.Or turn to another project which illustrates the whole abject hopelessness of this Government for our people. President Mitterrand paid a visit to London a few weeks ago. I am sure you would wish me to say from this platform how we send from this great Conference to him and to the socialist party in France every godspeed and good wish for the success of that government. (Applause) There are many issues on which we may have differences and arguments and discus­sions. I promise you we will arrange the meet­ings to do so, but I assure you that we will do everything possible from our party's point of view in the interests of our party and in the interests of theirs and in the interests of Euro­pean socialism as a whole to conduct those discussions in the friendliest and proper comradely spirit. But I was referring to the visit of President Mitterrand to Downing Street.Falling momentarily under the influence of President Mitterrand, Mrs Thatcher agreed to go ahead with the Channel tunnel. Considering the number of jobs and the kind of jobs - steel and all the rest - the idea is certainly to be wel­comed, but we must put to Mrs Thatcher the question she keeps putting so fatuously to us and the nation and, presumably, to her hand-picked, thick-skulled Cabinet: \u2018Where is the money to come from?' Where is the money to come from for the Channel tunnel?\u2019 Is she to print it? No, that would be wicked; she cannot do that. Is she to borrow it? No, that is wicked too. According to her theory, you cannot get it that way. So is she to raise it by more taxes? Of course that is more feasible? Contrary to her election pledges, she happens to have raised taxes in this country higher than ever before in British history. (Applause) As far as I know, she is not proposing to raise the money from extra taxes. So is she to raise the money by cutting somewhere else? That would not help very much either, because wherever she cut, she would be cutting jobs, probably, and not increasing them. So on her theory, which she has told the country and preached to the country with such tireless reiteration, she cannot carry out the promise that she made to President Mitterrand.I suggest she goes along and has another talk with President Mitterrand and ask him where he is going to get the money. He will tell her, I am sure. He will tell her in the best French and then translate it for her. (Laughter) He will say he is going to borrow it. And because he is a persuasive kind of chap, you know, he may add: \u2018Of course it always helps, you know, if you are able to give orders to the bankers instead of taking orders from the bankers.\u2019 (Applause) Of course the money can be borrowed; that is how every such great project in our economic history has been advanced.And if it is sense to build the Channel tunnel that way - or the French tunnel, as some of them may call it - why is it also not sense for the reconstruction of our inner cities, for the improvement of our homes, for the rebuilding of all our shattered industries after another? That is the task on which we have to embark. I am most grateful to President Mitterrand for his visit and for having illustrated this simple matter so well.Let me turn, however, to what happened after he had left, because President Mitterrand\u2019s visit gave us only a temporary respite from the monetarist lunacy. Within a few days she and her Cabinet were back in the old asylum - I will not go through the whole story, there was a very good debate on the subject yesterday, but they are working on the principle that during the next period of Parliament they will introduce an even more ferocious attack on what local authorities are seeking to do to protect our people and an even more ferocious attack on the money they need for the job and also on their rights as demo­cratically elected bodies. I can tell you that some of the most agonising discussions we have had on the National Executive throughout this period are precisely those in which we have seen how our local authorities up and down the coun­try have been driven into the most appalling dilemmas on the subject.My sympathies are on both sides of the ques­tion, I tell you, because I can see how fierce is the argument, how difficult is the problem for those elected on intelligent programmes of community and socialist action, and then finding themselves thwarted by this Government intervention. We must do our best to mobilise all our resources against them, but I say to you one thing in particular, and I hope this will be prop­erly understood, because the latest proposal the Government is making to deal with this situa­tion, as far as I can see, is that there should be a so-called referendum.If, in certain circumstances, the local author­ity wants to go ahead to raise rates - if neces­sary to carry out pledges that they may have made or to protect elementary services in their area - the Government is saying that they are going to have some enforced referendum to decide whether the public supports it or not. You know, there have been referendums - I am not talking about any in this country - elsewhere; the kind of referendum they are talking about sound very much like the kind of plebiscite they used to have in some fascist states - very much like them. Because of course the proposition that would be put to the ratepayers and the peo­ple in different parts of the country under these proposals would be a scandalous proposal. It would not be one that bore any genuine relation to democracy at all. So I say in advance - I have not got the full agreement of either the Shadow Cabinet or the National Executive to this proposal, but it must not deter me - that if they go ahead with any such idea of enforced referen­dum from the central Government on local authorities, the Labour party will boycott. We will have nothing to do with it. (Applause) The boycott will expose the grisly farce of the whole business.All right, if they say that is undemocratic - they have no case for doing so - I will offer them another offer. We will let them have a referendum in one or two places, if they like, on local rates, if we have a referendum on their next Budget. (Applause) If they let us have that one - or on the last one, if they think it was such a good one - they can take their choice, but that is a fair, democratic offer, otherwise I tell them here and now that we will have nothing what­soever to do with such a gross invasion of the rights of local authorities in this country. (Applause) I would wish, if I had time, chairman, to speak also about their grotesque attacks on the public sector, the nationalised industries. There are many such topics on which I would wish to speak, but I do not wish to proceed too long on this occasion. We will have many such opportunities to present them, but I underline afresh that in my judgment what we are living through - it accords very much with what was said in the debates yesterday - is not merely an attack upon our economy, we are living through the most serious attack on our democratic institutions which we have seen for generations. We must mobilise all our strength and intelli­gence and unity in order to resist it.Let me say a few words on some of the topics which seem to have aroused some interest in other parts over these last few months. There was an election for the deputy leader. There was also, as was kindly noticed, a non-election for the leader. (Laughter) I have never been very good at arithmetic, but I have to tell you that my majority was slightly larger than Denis Healey\u2019s. (Laughter) Anyhow, on that reckoning I have every right, I think, to say what I think on the subject. Even if I did not have the right, I would probably still say it. (Laughter) I think we have to acknowledge what has happened and then see how we can make it more effective. I have not the slightest doubt about the decision of this Conference to have an electoral college for the election of the leader and the deputy leader on suitable occasions - occasions that are suitable for the party as well as everybody else I think that on that basis, of course, I am sure it is right that we should accept and acknowledge the whole arrangement to have an electoral college. (Applause)But I do think - and I do not think anyone will dispute it; indeed the chairman at the beginning of his remarks at the beginning of our discus­sions underlined this too - we have to look at the way in which it works. I do think we have got to see how we can improve it. I think we have to look at many of the provisions that were made for the way in which Members of Parliament vote, and others; I think these matters have all got to be examined, but I think we should accept the principle and then see how we can translate it into better effect.Tony, if I can also comment on a remark he made yesterday - and this is in one sense the central question that I am elected as leader of the party to try to solve, that is the balance between the Party Conference and the Parliamentary Par­ty. This is not a new question; it is one that has prevailed in discussion about how the balance should be operated and how it should be con­ducted, right from the very first time when Keir Hardie became the first leader of this party. I accept what Tony said yesterday on this subject; if we can translate that into effect, I accept part­ners - that is what it has got to be. The partner­ship has got to be one in which the Parliamentary Party does not presume the right to dictate to the Party Conference, and the Party Conference does not presume the right to dictate to the Par­liamentary Party. (Applause) They have both got to do it, and in doing it we have to show a spirit of tolerance. I accept what Tony said too. Tony said - and I quote his words, and I lis­tened, as they were addressed especially, I think in a sense to me - He said about the Parliamen­tary Party that he wanted to have: \u2018a better internal democracy so that he is never again told he is there being a \u201cdog licence issued by a prime minister\u201d\u2019...Or, I presume, a leader of the party. I give Tony and everybody else concerned this abso­lute undertaking here and now that no such dog licences for Members of Parliament will be issued by me. Indeed, I can recall the first occa­sion when that was said, because I was in the party meeting when it happened. It was said by Harold Wilson. I occupied a place on the back benches and I protested against that statement then. I have protested against the idea behind it ever since, and will go on protesting against it to my dying day. No dog licences for Members of Parliament. Their right to exercise their own judgment on these matters, their own consci­ence, their own political knowledge and experi­ence - that must be part of our democracy too. I believe that I have a special duty to try and protect that right of free judgment of Members of Parliament because I would not be here if that had not prevailed. (Applause) That applies not merely to me, but it applies, I believe, to the whole range of those who have been elected to office inside the Labour Party, and I believe we can restore that principle. It is not only a question of intimidation suggested by prime ministers or leaders of the party: intimidation can come from other places, too. What we want to see is a proper tolerance established and sustained throughout the party as a whole. (Applause)I would wish, if I had time, to discuss some other matters too. I would like to tell you all the secrets of what happened in the last Labour Cabinet. (Laughter) I have read about them everywhere else. (Laughter) I have my own point of view. You know it is not the case, but I will only do this very briefly now because there is something much more important still that I wish to speak about. It is not a question, usually in Labour Cabinets, of an argument between right and wrong, a clear case and a bad case. Very rarely - I do not say it never happens, but it is very rare. That\u2019s not the way the place works - it is usually one Cabinet Minister who has a very strong view for one reason and may indeed come to the Cabinet meeting equipped with the party manifesto commitment on the matter, and another Cabinet Minister who will also come to the same meeting also equipped with a party manifesto, or even a Conference resolution, because it is not the case that all Conference resolutions throughout the whole history of the Labour party have always been consistent. It is not the case. So there is an argument, and they are very important argu­ments. I do not say that we have never had some bad eggs; of course we have, but the overwhelm­ing majority of those I have seen - I have not been in quite as many Labour Cabinets as Tony has, but I have been in one or two (Applause) - but I say the overwhelming majority of those who come to those Cabinet meetings, according to my experience, are coming there to try to give their contribution for getting the best solution to the problem. That applies to previous Cabinets and, indeed I am sure it will apply to future ones. It is all part, you know, of what Tony argues. Here I fully accept what he says about the abso­lute necessity that we should make our position credible. Of course that is right. We have at this Conference been adding up a whole list of items which we are going to present to the nation: health, education, employment, our great indus­tries that have got to be repaired, our housing policy and the rest. It is going to be a huge total, and quite right, because the pressures come from every quarter of our movement and they explode in Conferences such as this with all the passion and feeling that we have seen at this Conference too.But we have to persuade the nation that we are capable of discriminating between the things we can do first, the things to which we give the highest priority. That is what Aneurin Bevan meant when he talked about the language of priorities being the religion of socialism. We have to choose. You have to choose all the time. Mendes-France says \u2018to govern is to choose\u2019; of course that is correct. But we have to make a lot of the choices now, and one of the choices I say that we have got a long way to go on is to make a better agreement with the trade unions than we have ever had before. Certainly none of the things that we talk of can become credible in any sense unless we have that undertaking and understand­ing with the trade unions. The national economic assessment which we have written into our document, unanimously accepted by the TUC and by this Conference. That assessment, I believe, can be translated into practical action. I hope that before every budget we are going to have the most detailed examination and discus­sions with the trade unions to ensure that we carry out not merely their will, because we shall be representing in Parliament a wider franchise still, but in those discussions we will be translat­ing into action the reality of what we have dis­cussed here. I believe that on that basis we are also going greatly to improve our chances of victory. Indeed there is no other party in the country that can talk on these matters in the way and in the sense of comradeship that we speak with the trade union movement. (Applause) It is the source of the foundation of our movement and it is our great strength here at this Confer­ence, and it will be our great strength to the end of the century and beyond.I will take a few more minutes, if you will permit me, because there is another subject even more important than anything else that we have been discussing. We shall be discussing it again tomorrow in the Conference, but I wish to put my views on the subject to you, the greatest question of all: how to live in peace? How we are to use the influence of the Labour Party, even before we get power, to stop the nuclear arms race. (Applause) Is mankind capable of the imagination and exertion necessary to stop that race, to put it into reverse and to substitute for it a determined, sustained attempt to negotiate our way back to sanity and to safety? This is the supreme question, and we may be at the most critical moment of choice. If this immediate opportunity is lost - by that I mean the discus­sions that have started between Mr Gromyko and Mr Haig from the United States and later of the so-called theatre nuclear weapons in Europe - we may never have another one of equal potentiality. Certainly no one can say with any assurance: \u2018Don\u2019t worry. We will wait. We\u2019ll have a few more years of nuclear rearmament and see what it looks like then.\u2019 I must say that, following my visit to Moscow with Denis and a few others from our party in the House of Com­mons, I do not believe - I repeat what I said when I came back - that anyone who attended those meetings we attended could have come away with a different impression from the one I had. Of course the Soviet leaders want to negotiate. They are ready for it, they are eager for it. Indeed they give every impression that the necessity has now become desperately urgent. If they do speak of the matter in desperation, who can say they are wrong?But what about the others? What about the Americans, the United States government? It is not anti-American, it is no more than a plain statement of fact, that the United States gov­ernment, or some powerful sections of it, have not shown much readiness or eagerness. I give you one quotation:The political problems in Washington are also far from resolved. There\u2019re people in the administration who are profoundly sceptical and who have the power to delay and compli­cate the whole process.Now I have said that, I have no doubt I would be accused of being a Soviet spy, or something of the sort, but those are the words that were printed in The Times on the day that Denis and I returned from Moscow. It was partly at least pressure from some of the United States allies, from many of our socialist allies in Europe, the Western German Government amongst them - it was partly pressure from them that finally persuaded President Reagan to agree on the talks.I understand that there are some in the Foreign Office who take a different view - our own Foreign Office. What have we got to say about them? On the very day that we arrived, before we had even given a report of what we had seen or the talks we had had, they put up some over-ambitious underling in the Foreign Office to say that we had been deceived by the Russians, and to pour cold water on anything that we suggested. It was a very strange out­burst, because, according to the Western case - there is something in it - one of the most serious things that has happened in the arms race over recent years is the stationing of the SS-20s on the other side of Europe in the Soviet Union. Many people in the West have claimed that it is that stationing that has upset the balance. The Russians deny that, but that is part of the argument. They say they were merely rectifying a previous disbalance; of course that is the way the arms race goes.But what we brought back from the Soviet Union - on some other matters too, but more clearly expressed than ever before on this ques­tion - was that the Soviet leaders were saying to us - (they said it to us quite emphatically after we had gone through it in very careful detail): \u2018Yes, we are prepared to reduce the numbers of SS-20s.\u2019 If you are to get to what we want - that is to get them all abolished - of course that is one of the ways in which you have to proceed.But the Foreign Office came out in their denunciation of what we had said with a most extraordinary tale. They said \u2018ah, all this was offered by the Russians and the Soviet leaders way back before December 1979; you have been deceived.\u2019 Well, its very interest­ing, isn\u2019t it? Before December 1979 was before the invasion of Afghanistan, before the decision in the West to go ahead with cruise missiles and the Pershings and the rest, and the Foreign Office says to us that they were offered then a reduction in the SS-20s. Remember that there were many fewer SS-20s at that time, maybe some 50, 60 or 70; there are many more now. If we are ever blown to pieces in these islands, it may be by the SS-20s that it is done, although we shall never probably know if it happens. So you would think that, even in the Foreign Office, they would be interested in the numbers of SS-20s, wouldn\u2019t you, instead of trying to pour cold water on the whole effort that we were seeking to achieve? I wish I had time to elaborate what I believe is the highly dangerous course which the United States government has taken on so many of these questions, particularly in Latin America and El Salvador and the rest. (Applause)Our Government on the great arms question - and so many other things - seems to trail along behind without having any influence whatsoever. We are not prepared in the Labour Party to proceed along those lines at all. I know tomorrow there are the discussions and debates here - very important debates - on the resolutions and the party\u2019s statement on this subject, carrying the proposals, on nuclear disarmament a good deal further. Such proposals command all my sympathy and support. (Applause)But I say also, I am also interested, as every sane man and woman on the face of the planet must be interested, in the possibilities of negotia­tions here and now. I think there could be a chance of getting some agreement between the super powers. I think from what I heard in Moscow that they understand the impossibility of seeking nuclear superiority. I think they also understand the outrage of any ideas of so-called limited nuclear war in Europe. I think there certainly could be an agreement stopping the development of the neutron bomb. I think there could also be considerable advance towards all the ideas of nuclear-free zones. If we could get breakthroughs in the next year or so on some of these questions, the whole prospect for mankind could be altered. Do not let anybody tell me, as some attempt to do, that these are just the ravings of an old nuclear disarmer like myself. Nothing that I have seen persuades me that the CND campaign was wrong; indeed I think it was right. (Applause) There are many moving in our direction along some of these other lines that I have been suggesting too, and there can be a very important convergence between them.I would like in a minute or so to read to you - I apologise for its slight length, but these, as I say, are the most important questions the world has ever had to discuss. I underline that the declara­tion I will read in a moment is that which was passed at the Socialist International in Paris a few days ago. I underline that this declaration represents the views of socialist parties inside NATO and outside NATO, socialist parties in the Common Market and out of the Common Market, so do not let people tell us that if we come out of the Common Market, we cannot have international action with our friends - of course we can. (Applause) Indeed, I think the declaration that I read to you now is one that commands a growing, wide support amongst all democratic socialists in Western Europe. There are still many differences and shades of difference, but if you look at the advance that has been achieved over the past year or so, then I think we can have real hope for the future. This is what they said:'In Europe the objective should be effective reductions and eventual elimination of theatre nuclear forces on both sides. The Socialist International regards as encouraging the resumption of talks between the United States and the Soviet Union, as repeatedly urged by the Socialist International. The negotiations should be resumed without further delay and with a political will to succeed not later than 1983.While opposing the introduction of all new theatre forces in Europe on both sides, the Socialist International also rejects the man­ufacture and deployment of the neutron bomb. In order to provide the negotiations with a constructive starting point, the parties should make an interim agreement on the qual­itative and quantitative restrictions at a level preferably lower than the present one.The parties should not undertake any action anywhere in whatever form which might endanger the outcome of those negotia­tions.'They go on to say further:'The Socialist International welcomes the continuing endeavours aiming at the creation of nuclear free zones, particularly in the Pacific area and in Northern Europe, and regards the already existing nuclear free zone in Latin America as positive example.'I hope to live to see the day when we in this country are part of a nuclear free zone. (Applause)Let me just say, if I may, one further word in conclusion. When I returned, one of those Tory newspapers referred to me, and they referred to Gulliver\u2019s Travels. They made a bit of a mistake there, because I know more about Gulliver\u2019s Travels than the Foreign Office. (Laughter) I can tell you what happened. Gulliver, as far as we know, when he came back from his travels, lived happily ever after for quite a long time, as I propose to do. He also came back very much wiser, indeed probably one of the wisest men who ever put pen to paper, because if you read Gulliver\u2019s Travels properly, you will see it has some most extraordinary things. He came back from his travels in a flaming state of anger, such as I am in now, about what he had seen of the infamies being done in the world. In one sense he saw those infamies expressed in imperialism, one nation trying to subdue another nation, but even beyond that he saw it in terms of war and the infamies of war itself. And you know, wonder of wonders, he also described how the brilliant scientists of those days or the generals of those days, getting together in some military, industrial complex, invented a weapon. A weapon of such power and strength and absurdity that it could only be used by the nation that invented it at the price of their total destruction.It is all in Gulliver\u2019s Travels. We should see that every member of the Foreign Office gets a copy. (Applause) We should see that we are not deterred by anything from the greatest crusade that our Labour movement ever set its hand to. The world is crying out for peace as it has never cried before. I tell you - I hope I am not boast­ing - that I am a peacemonger, an inveterate, incurable peacemonger. (Applause) I ask the support of this whole movement to translate that into action. (Applause)
p151
aVI think the scene which we have just witnessed a few minutes ago must have the effect of making us all feel proud and humble at the same time, and I believe all of us can draw inspiration from what they have said to us.  I take some special encouragement from the political scene.  If my arithmetic is correct \u2013 it usually is except when I rely on advice from Denis Healey \u2013 I have got about 17 years to go before I reach Mrs Coombe\u2019s standards of withdrawal.  (Applause)I know that some latitude is often allowed to those who make the parliamentary report, and I would like to draw upon that tradition, if I may, in order to be able to say something to the party which I hope can be of benefit to us all and help us in the outward struggle that all of us wish to engage in, over these weeks and months ahead in order, to save this country.  So I must start by looking at the scale of the human and industrial tragedy which has befallen our country over recent years.Sometimes the scale of that tragedy is underestimated; sometimes there is an attempt by our opponents to conceal it.  But it is necessary that we should strip aside all the disguises, and tell the country the full truth about it.  Last year the unemployment figures went up by something like 350,000 \u2013 45,000 in the past month.  They go steadily and remorselessly upwards.  Sometimes our politic opponents tell us mendaciously that this is something not so very different from what happened under the Labour government.  But, even so, they were much higher than anyone would have judged to be proper in a civilised society.But something far worse than that has been happening in recent years.  During the period of the Labour government, despite the fact that the unemployment went up, the jobs went up too.  And, curiously, there were more jobs available in 1979 when we left office than ere were when we came in in 1974.  Nothing like that is happening now.  Job destruction has happened on a scale that we have never seen before in our history, and it is happening on a scale which has not been seen in almost any other country of the world.  I am not disguising for a moment the scale of the world economic crisis \u2013 and I will have, of course, something to say about that too \u2013 but the excuses that are made by Mrs Thatcher for what has happened are ones that cannot bear a moment\u2019s examination.She tells us en that similar increases are happening in other countries, and that we can take comfort from the fact that \u2013 in this same period when our unemployment has gone up over 350,000 or so \u2013 it has gone up half a million in West Germany, two million in America and that it has increased in many other parts of the world as well.  And, of course, there is some likeness.  Reaganism is like Thatcherism, and the other way round.  But what she does not seem to appreciate is that both of them cannot be defended, and the combination of the two together is what threatens the world on a scale that we have not known for generations.There is, indeed, an eerie likeness in reading the comments of some of the people in the United States about how their policy is now developing, as if they are surprised about it.  They are following the same tragic policies that she initiated here, and they are having the same tragic results \u2013 although the consequences will be even wider because of the greater economic power and influence of the United States itself.  But to read the people commenting on what is happening in the United States at the moment is almost like seeing an old television programme on the big screen: you cannot understand why the actors do not realise how the story is going to turn out in the end.Thatcherism, Reaganism or monetarism \u2013 whatever you like to call it \u2013 is threatening our world on a scale that we have not known for generations, and in some respects the threat to the world economy is even worse than what we experienced in the Thirties.  This is the seriousness of the situation.Sometimes, true, we disguise from ourselves what may be the consequences of it.  We can see in our own country how Thatcherism and her policies hit the weakest of all, but what is happening on the world scene is even more serious.  Thatcherism, Reaganism, monetarism, the policies of parts of the Western World (I will come to some of those who are seeking to fight against it in a moment) \u2013 are hitting the poorest people in the world, the people from the developing world.  The poorest people in the world are suffering from these Thatcherite policies applied across the world.  And we in the Labour Party must never forget what they are doing, and must always seek to put the argument on that same world scale.But do not let us imagine that in any way absolves the Tories from what they are doing.  What they are doing is to intensify the world crisis that was already prevailing on such a scale.  Indeed, you might say, in one sense, that what we are suffering from now is not so much the slump as the Tory means of recovery from a slump.  And the means that they are applying are intensifying that crisis on a scale that has not been seen for generations.But do not let anybody disguise the fact from us, or seek to conceal it, that here in Britain \u2013 despite our interest in the worldwide international crisis and its scale \u2013 people have suffered even more, and our industrial collapse has been an even bigger collapse.  Since 1979 Britain has lost 9 per cent of its jobs.  Only Spain comes anywhere near, with 6 per cent.  All other industrial countries, except Germany and France, have had increases in jobs over that period, and the loss of those two countries has been less than 1 per cent.  This trend has continued unabated in the latest figures: in the last year for which such estimates are available, Britain continued to lose 3 per cent of its jobs; Spain 2 per cent; Germany and Canada 1 ½ per cent; Italy, France and Sweden 1 per cent; and the United States and Norway 0.5 per cent.  So that though job destruction is massive in many other parts of the world in world slump terms, here it is on a bigger and more massive scale than anything we have seen in this century.And it is not only the jobs that are destroyed in individual places and for the individuals concerned: one industry after another has been misapplied on a scale which almost passes comprehension.For much of the period of the postwar world, as we know \u2013 those who were in the previous governments know \u2013 one of the biggest constraints we have had on expanding our economy has been that of the balance of payments itself, and the fact that we were not able to carry through the policies of expansion that we wanted, because of the deficit.  The oil should have saved us from all that.  But instead this government has squandered the oil.  Instead of using it for the purpose of industrial investment, for providing for the future, for transforming our industrial structure \u2013 they have used it solely to pay for mass unemployment and to conceal for a short period the appalling injuries that they have inflicted on this country.  (Applause)Some of you may remember the famous remark that Aneurin Bevan made at the end of the war; he said that in a country made of coal and surrounded by fish, it took an organising genius to produce a shortage of both at the same time.  This Thatcher government has outdone all the Tory predecessors in the massacre of national assets, and it has taken the genius of Thatcherite economics to ensure that the one western economy self-sufficient in energy has been transformed into the worse industrial wasteland in postwar history\u2026 (Applause)What are they going to do about our oil industry now?  It is barely credible, but when they come back and we meet in parliament \u2013 of course, we will resist it with all our strength \u2013 the next proposition that they have on the agenda for us and the country is that we should sell off our oil to their friends, or maybe even to the country\u2019s enemies \u2013 because nobody knows exactly where it is going to be sold.  (Applause) We will do everything in our power to resist that gross betrayal of the rights of the nation. Or steel.  I agree with the resolution that is on the order paper for this conference, and I understand the shiver of anxiety which is now going through the great steel areas of our country about another great blow to be inflicted on that industry.  I know it because of the part of the world where I came from; but I went up to the North East the other day and, of course, they are shivering with anxiety too that a further blow on top of everything that has happened to steel is going to be inflicted upon them.The Tories do not seem to need a steel industry, but we in the Labour Party and in the next Labour government \u2013 we will need a steel industry, so we must fight to protect it now and to protect the jobs there now.  (Applause) You will never be able to build full employment in Britain, as we are pledged to do, on 12, 11, 10 million tonnes of steel.  We have got to get back to the targets that we had before us a few years ago.  We will need 20 or 25 million tonnes of steel in order to build real full employment in this country. (Applause) We must stop the wreckage of the steel industry now, not only in the interests of the steel workers and all those associated with them, but in the interest of the whole nation.One of the very first tasks which the last Labour government undertook was to establish and introduce and finance and back the Plan for Coal.  It looks as though that is one of the very first tasks we will have to do as a Labour government when we come in again; and certainly we will carry through the Plan for Coal \u2013 bring it up to date, and ensure that we protect one of the most essential sinews of the future industrial strength of this country.But look at how they have wrecked one industry after another.  Look how they have been prepared to accept mass unemployment on a scale we have not known since the war and, indeed, perhaps since before the war.  You would think that that was sufficient; you would think that these were the problems to which they might be applying their minds in the cabinet.  Not at all.  If the reports about their so-called Think Tank are correct, they have chastised us with whips, and all they have done at the recent cabinet meetings is to prepare the scorpions.  What they are proposing to do now, it seems, is \u2013 even to consider it at such a moment as this is an outrage against human decency \u2013 to dismantle the higher educational system of this country at the very moment when the country is going to be crying out for more skill and more brains over the next 10 or 20 years.  (Applause) What they have been considering is the destruction of the system, dropping even the pretence \u2013 because we know that they have already injured it \u2013 of trying to sustain social security provision to keep pace with inflation.We know that they have done everything in their power over the past two or three years to undermine those principles applying to a whole range of members of the public.  But now what they are doing is a larger scheme to dismantle the social security system itself.  And further and beyond that, what they are apparently considering is the dismantlement of the health service itself, and the destruction of the essential socialist principles on which that health service was founded.  Well, we will fight them on all those matters with every power \u2013 in parliament, out of parliament, and everywhere else.  (Applause)I congratulate all those who organised and participated in the day of action on September 22.  I agree with everything that was said in the debate which opened this great conference on Monday on the subject, and I certainly believe that what happened then can be an example and an inspiration to us all.  But what we have to do in that field \u2013 the name of it is low pay.  That is what we have to deal with, and we have got to have a  policy, not only for tackling this government on it, but of ensuring that, when we get the next Labour government, we deal with that problem in perhaps a more ambitious way than we have ever done before.  (Applause)I am not saying that in any derogation of what we attempted before, because I know what we did attempt.  I know that one of the first things we did in 1974 was to proceed with the trade union minimum which we had discussed with the TUC beforehand.  It was some mitigation of the situation; it was a move in the right direction.  But I know also what happened later and the misunderstandings that arose.  I know also of the discussions \u2013 because I participated in them all \u2013 which took place right at the end, and involved the establishment of the Trade Commission and the other comparability studies that were prepared then.  I believe that, if that policy had been followed, this strike need never have occurred and, indeed, the whole of the health service would have been in much better shape on that account.But I am not merely saying that we should revive the Clegg procedure or something comparable to it; I am not merely saying that we should proceed on these lines.  As I have said, in the field of low pay alone, I believe that we have got to use that as the way in which we design a whole new policy for ensuring that we shall avoid such industrial disputes when we have the next Labour government, by seeing before hand how we can provide the means of fair treatment for the lowest paid and a real low pay policy.  I know the TUC passed a resolution on this subject a few weeks ago; I think we should follow that up \u2013 I believe these matters should, of course, be devised in full consultation with the trade unions.And that is the great difference between us and the other parties in the state.  We are the only party that can shape an economic policy for the nation in association with the trade unions.  We are the only party that understands that that is absolutely essential; in that sense, we are the only party that can recruit the genuine democratic forces of the nation to enable us to escape from this catastrophic slump in which we are caught.The idea peddled by some \u2013 that somehow or other the British people can escape from such a crisis as this when the whole of the trade union movement has had the door slammed in their faces and there is no discussion with about how we should deal with the crisis \u2013 such nonsense is barely credible, particularly after the experience of the last 30 or 40 years.  Well, we in the Labour Party and in the labour movement as a whole must draw the moral more closely than ever; right from the very first day we must have the closest possible co-operation with the unions.  Indeed, the more we can prepare those plans in advance, the better we are likely to be able to put them into operation on the first day.  Indeed, many, most, all the policies on these economic matters presented to conference have been devised by those methods, by those means and by those discussions, and thereby offer the possibility of success.In this context, when I say that we are the only party in the state that can offer this to the nation, I should make some passing reference to the other parties.  I notice that Mr Roy Jenkins a few days ago, having dealt with the momentous questions of proportional representation and the disposition of seats in the Alliance, has now been kind enough to indicate that he is prepared to give his mind to the affairs of the nation.  It is very gracious of him, is it not?  I think it is very gracious of him to make such a splendid gesture.  But I have to inform you \u2013 and I will do it quite quietly, because I do not want to cause too much offence \u2013 that in these discussions (I have looked at them fairly closely), he has been diddled by David!  If you want to find the list of seats that the SDP is not going to win at the next election, Bill Rodgers has got it \u2013 he\u2019s been handed it.  And if we do our job properly there will not be enough SDP members in the next parliament for them to be able to have a three-way split when we carry through the repeal of the Tebbit legislation.  (Applause)Of course, we have still got other matters to settle between ourselves and the trade unions.  I have followed with the utmost care the discussions and debates that took place at the TUC on this subject and on the national economic assessment, about which we have agreed.  We have had lengthy discussions about them, and we recognise the importance for the trade union movement and for the future Labour government in having those understandings and, indeed, in building on them and making them even clearer and more ambitious than they are.  That does not mean that a national economic assessment is a codename for an incomes policy \u2013 because it is not.  I am opposed to any statutory incomes policy.  Indeed, in the last Labour government I was one of the people who played a prominent part in abolishing the Heath statutory policy.  And I do not think that any such policy would ever work.  But I do say this too, and I say it especially because I heard the speech of the spokesman for the National Union of Mineworkers at the conference at the TUC when he referred to these questions.  He talked as if all the arrangements made under the social contract were not any use to anybody in the unions.  I tell you \u2013 and I do not think any miner will deny it \u2013 that pretty well the two best settlements that the miners had in this last 30 years were the two settlements made under the social contract.I was associated in all the discussions with the miners in the first two or three days when we were seeking to get the strike called off.  We had to have a proper settlement to do that.  We had to bring pressure on the Coal Board in order to achieve it.  What the miners stood out for then, even after we had won the election (and I think they were quite right to do it), was a demand which at first the Coal Board were not prepared to accept, but which we were prepared to back.  The miners were demanding that the surface workers should get a decent deal, as well as the people at the face, and that the proportion between the two should be altered.  And it was altered.  It is a kind of primitive incomes policy if you like to call it that.  You can call it anything you like; but it is a way of trying to ensure \u2013 and individual unions can seek to do it and they can do it in their bargaining.  Indeed, if we are going to carry out what I talked about before, and what is in many of the resolutions about low pay, then we shall have to have policies that cover a much wider field.I believe that that is well understood by everyone who has participated in these matters before, that we are determined that when we get that new Labour Government that we shall carry out our pledge to get the unemployment figure down to less than a million in five years.  It is a huge commitment that is going to take tremendous energy, application and determination.  There is no possibility of that happening if we have got a Labour government that is quarrelling with the TUC \u2013 not the slightest chance of that happening.  (Applause) So we have got to get it together; we are the only party in the country that can offer that road of salvation for our people.But we have got to do it in the wider context too, we have got to do it in the international context.  It I sour plain duty as socialists to think in those terms, but it is also in our economic interest.  Because if anybody imagines that we can carry out our commitment to get the unemployment total down to a million in those five years in the context of an international economic blizzard without trying to stop that blizzard, that of course is nonsense.  So we have got to have an international economic policy too, a policy to deal with what the scourge of monetarism has inflicted on the rest of the world besides.  And although the task is an enormous one, we have got some considerable allies in other countries, many of them fighting for the same things that we are fighting for.  Fighting for them often in their own national context \u2013 but there is nothing wrong with that \u2013 but fighting for them to try to lift this Western world of ours out of this hopeless groove in which it is now stuck.In France the election of President Mitterrand and a socialist government was a momentous event in the history of Western Europe.  (Applause) Do not be misled by the Tory tale that President Mitterrand is going to abandon all his policies.  President Mitterrand is a man who has shown considerable persistence throughout his political life, and I am sure he is going to do so over the next six or seven years when he is there to carry through his policies.  And it can be, if we co-operate, a great help to us.There are many other places where it is happening.  In Greece they elected a good left-wing government, also dedicated to an expansionist policy.  We also welcomed the return of Olaf Palme to power in Sweden.  (Applause) It was Sweden under the socialists which, maybe, set as good an example as any other country in the world in dealing with this economic crisis.  It was a shame and a shock when they were turned out, but we are very glad to see them back, able to apply socialist doctrines there once more.Austria has a good a record as any country in the world in dealing with this crisis, not merely in economic affairs but also in seeking to keep open the door of détente in this highly dangerous world.  And with Austria too, we welcome the work that they have done.Even more, it is possible this autumn, when they have the election in Spain, that there will be elected for the first time since 1935 as prime minister of Spain a democratic socialist.  That will be an event of great significance, I believe, and certainly for all us in the Labour Party who remember some of those times.  I tell you, the Labour Party had got quite a good record in these matters because throughout most of the period of the Franco oppression \u2013 thanks primarily to the Transport and General Workers and Jack Jones, but not solely them \u2013 we kept open a Spanish workers\u2019 defence committee which came to the aid of many socialists threatened with gaol and murder by the Franco tyranny.  We came to their aid \u2013 and the aid of many of those who now figure in the government which, I trust, is going to come to power in Spain.  (Applause)We follow, too, with great anxiety the affairs in Germany.  It has been a fortunate matter, not merely for Germany but for the whole of Europe, that there has been a socialist government there in Western Germany over these years \u2013 a socialist government which has sought to apply some of the policies we agree with, not all of them but some of them, and also to keep open the door to a détente in Europe that has really got a chance of working.  And if, in fact, after all the work that they have done, if that government was set aside, it could be a grave setback for all democrats all over Western Europe.  We trust that nothing of the sort will happen.However, if you look at that list, it is a somewhat different picture from the one that is sometimes presented, that of democratic socialism in retreat.  I tell you that that is not the case.  In many parts of the world, democratic socialism in coming back into its own precisely because it is the only creed truly relevant to such modern industrial conditions.  (Applause) Some of the countries I mentioned in that list, you may note, are in the Common Market; some of them are out of the Common Market.  That does not prevent international co-operation.  We are committed as a party to come out of the Common Market.  (Applause) That is a conference decision, like the one we took yesterday.  (Applause) But I say to you also \u2013 and I say it, I am sure, with the concurrence of everybody, in our party alongside that commitment (and I am not seeking to weaken it in any way at all) we are also committed as socialists to understand our international obligations, both in our own interests and in the interests of other countries and other socialist parties as well.  We must carry through our commitment in that field in a manner which is in proper conformity with our international obligations and our obligations as socialists to other people in other lands.  In the Eighties, more than ever, socialism is international or it is nothing, and if we do not understand that we have not understood the kind of world we live in.  (Applause)This is the reason why we place such emphasis on the Brandt Report \u2013 we want to take it out of the pigeon holes, or the dungeons or wherever it is that they have buried it.  We want to improve the Brandt Report, we want to strengthen it; we want to make it a central feature of what is to happen in the Eighties throughout the world and between the poorer countries and the richer countries.  It is essential.  And I cannot help saying in passing that, in doing so, we shall be carrying out the instructions and the wishes of one of the spokesmen on this subject recently \u2013 one of the finest socialists most of us have ever met \u2013 Frank McElhone, whose death we so deeply deplore.  (Applause) If he were here, he would speak to us in these international tones, and we should not forget it. But I tell you also another reason, even more important.  Tomorrow Joan Lestor will introduce the international statement to the party.  I hope, by the way, that Joan Lestor \u2013 she is not only our spokesman on international affairs, she is also our spokesman on women\u2019s rights, the first appointed in the history of the party \u2013 and I hope it will not be long before she is exercising that job in a cabinet as well.  And the sooner we can get there, the better.  (Applause)Returning to this scene where, indeed, we need the co-operation and the enthusiastic co-operation of allies in order to succeed, I come to the most desperate question of all.  It is incomparably the greatest question, as I think we in the labour movement understand, even if it not to well understood elsewhere.  I mean the nuclear arms race, of course, and the other interlocking dangers.  Our policy for dealing with it is in that document.  I believe it is a very good document; it is going to be presented to conference tomorrow and I think it will be carried in the same terms that I have referred to some other conference decisions.The situation is underlined afresh by the news we get from strange quarters, if you like to call it that.  I read only a few days ago the leading article in The Times, headed \u2018India and the Bomb\u2019.  It describes how India is one of the countries that refused to sign the non-proliferation treaty about nuclear weapons, because they did not believe that they should agree to accept the pressures which at that time were put upon them by the Americans, the Russians, ourselves and many others.  They did not sign, but they did not want to go ahead with building nuclear weapons; my guess is that they still do not want to do so because the burden for the people of India on top of their other burdens would be a very heavy one indeed.However, like other people, the Indians look to see what is happening in some of their neighbouring countries: they have seen how some people have been not merely re-equipping Pakistan with so-called conventional weapons, but seeking to assist them in other nuclear fields as well.  And the Indians know that they have had arms races in their subcontinent \u2013 arms races fed, I am ashamed to say, from the West.  Some of the worst evils that are happening in the Third World are fed from the policies pursued here in Britain and the United States.  (Applause) So I want to see that we stop that arms traffic in other kinds of weapons, because \u2013 heaven knows! the scale on which that has increased is an obscenity almost as great as the nuclear arms race itself.But I take note of what I read now.  This is why I was a supporter of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and why I remain a supporter of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament.  (Applause) I warn you that I am not reading from Tribune or even from Militant, but from The Times.  However, after they have discussed \u2013 and I think intelligently discussed \u2013 in this article the dangers for the world, the perils for India if in fact, they felt themselves forced into this ugly business of going into the nuclear arms race themselves, they go on: \u2018However, it does not lie with existing Western members of the military nuclear club to argue that nobody else should be allowed to achieve the same status\u2019.  Quite a powerful argument.They go on to say: \u2018If they were prepared to show their readiness to give up nuclear weapons, their arguments would be more convincing\u2019.  I think that is true too.  I do not say it would all be done by an example, but I do say that if this country insists on saying \u2018we will sustain our nuclear status whatever happens\u2019, then a lot of other countries are going to say exactly the same.  (Applause)But then The Times goes on about the sale of arms to Pakistan, which is part of the cause of the crisis: \u2018Their methods\u2019 \u2013 that is, the methods of the Western nations \u2013 \u2018of controlling nuclear supplies have been subverted by the lure of commercial gain\u2019.Profit: people have been selling these arms for profit.  That is part of the danger, and it is all there in The Times.  It says that India may only decide to go nuclear if Pakistan does, and that applies in some other parts of the world as well.  I say that the greatest tasks that this labour movement of ours will ever have to undertake, when we get that next Labour government, is to carry out our policy for securing nuclear disarmament in this country and throughout the world.  (Applause)But I say to you also that if we can realise that opportunity, it can be the greatest opportunity in the history of our movement.  And we have done some great things for our people and for other people \u2013 we do not need to be instructed in patriotism, or anything of the sort, from elsewhere.  (Applause) All through the Falklands crisis the phrase of George Orwell kept drumming in my ears: \u2018I do not want to see England humiliated or humiliating anybody else\u2019.  That is a very good form of patriotism, even if I ask my fellow Celts to join in such a tribute to English patriotism, because George Orwell would have put it in English terms.  That is not imperialism; it is upholding international authority and international rights.  It is upholding the international authorities which we, as socialists, have always said have got to be substituted for international anarchy.  We have got to hold to that doctrine too \u2013 more especially because there are fewer voices in the world raised on that account, and we have got to multiply their number.We have got to prepare for that day \u2013 the day when we set about rescuing our country, the day when we set about changing the whole climate of international affairs.  It is going to be a great day when we start on that task, a great day that we will all wish to celebrate.  But we all know in our hearts, that if we are going to be able to succeed \u2013 particularly because our people, the British people, are a sensible, commonsense and intelligent people, and a compassionate and a tolerant people \u2013 the party that wins them has got to have those qualities too.  If we do not have those qualities we will not win.  (Applause) I believe that those qualities are deeply embedded in the whole of our inspiration.  From what we heard of the merit awarders a few minutes ago, they spoke to us in those terms too.  We have to revive that compassion and tolerance, the good nature and good will of our movement, on a scale we have never done before.  We have got to demonstrate to people with every possible power of advocacy at our command; we have not got all the newspapers assisting us and therefore we have got to say it all the more clearly and, on occasions, all the more in unison.  I am not in favour of doing it in unison all the time, because I know you have got to argue about lots of things; but I do say that you have also to set the world in its proper perspective.  And democratic socialism is relevant and more relevant than ever today, precisely because it does that.  H G Wells used to say; \u2018You can throw socialism out of the window and you will come in and find it astraddle your hearth\u2019.And that is what is happening in so many parts of the world.  People are discovering, particularly in the poorest parts of the world, that the only way that they can lift their people from the gutter is by the power, intelligence and purpose of democratic socialist ideas.  (Applause)So I ask you at this conference, although we concentrate on our own affairs, I ask you also to think in these international terms.  I would like to read to you the words that I came across in a book the other day, written by a great Italian socialist, Angelica Belabanov.  She wrote a book called My Life as a Rebel in 1936-37, under the fascist dictatorship.  But she put at the beginning of her book words quoted from a great German socialist, August Babel, and she wrote in terms that I believe elevate democratic socialism on an international scale to where it should be.  This is what she said:And if in the course of this great battle (she was describing the battle against our political enemies) for the emancipation of the human race we should fall, those now in the rear will step forward and we shall fall with the consciousness of having done our duty as human beings and with the conviction that the goal will be reached, however the powers hostile to humanity may struggle or strain in resistance.  Ours is the world despite all!Ours is the world!  That is what I say to you as socialists, here and throughout the rest of the world! (Standing ovation)

aVChair and Comrades, I owe you much thanks for the kindness of that reception.  Indeed I owe a deep debt of gratitude to the Labour Party and to the Labour movement as a whole; I will do my best, as I have sought to do since I joined the Labour Party, to my dying day to discharge that obligation to the party.  I believe that is the overwhelming determination of this conference.In giving that thanks, however, I hope you will permit me today to offer it specifically to three people.  Not because there are not hundreds of others here that I owe it to, hundreds of others throughout the country, but I offer it to three, especially today.First of all you, Sam, as chair, for what you have said to me this week and for what you have done for this party over this year \u2013 not an easy year, but one in which, I believe, you have given conspicuous services to the party and also wonderful comradeship to me.Then to Jim Mortimer, our general secretary.  He took on the general secretaryship of this party at an extremely difficult moment \u2013 some of these problems we have discussed and some of them we are going to discuss further at this conference.  Here again I owe to him a special debt of gratitude for all the encouragement, loyalty, and comradeship he has given to me.Then to Denis Healy, the deputy leader of this party, elected some time ago.  I would like to offer my special thanks to him, because throughout the difficult time we have had \u2013 we have had a few difficult times \u2013 he has shown to me a particular kind of comradeship, and I am deeply grateful to him and glad to have the chance of expressing it here in public now.Sometimes it is suggested in some quarters that Dennis and I have not always seen eye to eye on every subject \u2013 I do not mean to say only in the last few years, but over many years.  I am not quite sure whether this is intended in the quarters it comes from as a tribute or a criticism.  But \u2013 Whichever it may be \u2013 I would like to assure you that during these times Dennis has given me wonderful support and encouragement, and I am deeply grateful to him.I do not need to say to you, I hope, that I understand the scale of the defeat which we suffered at the general election.  I understand the scale of it, the measure of it, perhaps as well as anybody in this hall or anybody in the party.  I am deeply ashamed that we should have allowed the fortunes of our country and the fortunes of the people who look to us for protection most, both here in this country and throughout the world, to sink to such a low ebb.  I am deeply ashamed that we have permitted that power to rest with such a government as we have in Britain at the time.  (Applause)  I believe that all of us assembled here have a determination to carry out a proper revenge in the interests of the British people as a whole.But, speaking on the parliamentary report, there have been some specially grevious aspects of that election, the numbers of people in our parliamentary party who went down to defeat on 9 June, not through any fault of theirs, not through any lack of fighting spirit of theirs.  Indeed, I say this on behalf of the whole parliamentary party \u2013 I have to bear the chief responsibility in this matter; I repudiate and suggestion that our defeat was due to the failure of the parliamentary party to carry out its functions and its duties under the constitution of this party and to seek to do every thing that they could to win.  I believe they all did it \u2013 both those who were victorious, those who were defeated - and I am sure that we will go back after this conference determined to carry out and remember what happened.  None of us can forget the depths of the wounds that happened in individual constituencies and to individual people in that defeat.However, before I come to some other aspects of it, let us look at one or two things that have happened since the election.  Let us look for a moment at what happened, shall we say, at Salford.  Not because I think that Salford is necessarily the centre of the universe \u2013 I do not want to have any quarrel with my old friend Stan Orme or with Frank Allaun, who I know, actually do believe it is the centre of the universe. But some other event took place at Salford, and I would like to comment on it.Dr David Owen gave what was described in some quarters as an analysis \u2013 although I think that is much too fulsome a word to apply \u2013 of our present economic situation, and he paid a great tribute to the competitive system; the market economy, the social market economy, the Keith Joseph/Margaret Thatcher/Nigel Lawson economy.  He paid great tribute to it, and said they must apply its rules more astringently in the future.  He talked of this competitive system as if it was a great success, as if it held many merits previously not revealed.  He even talked as if there was a bandwagon moving in that direction.  And if there is a bandwagon moving, he wants to be on it. (Laughter and applause) I must say it is a very strange moment in the his­tory of our country and in the history of the world for anyone to be paying such tributes to the competitive system. The competitive system, the market economy, or whatever you like to call it, has shown itself in the last few years less successful in providing a stable expanding economy than at any time in this century; less able to provide jobs for our people, young and old, than at any time we have known for generations; less able to keep people above the poverty line: less able to use the great resources of our nation - the new resources, especially from the North Sea; less able to deal with human needs in any way that could be regarded as satisfactory. This is the moment when he chooses \u2013 he and his people choose - to extol the successes of the competitive society.If you look abroad, to what is happening in other countries, there have been several discussions over recent weeks, discussions deeply humiliating to the human race, discussions about how they may be able to prop up for a little longer possibly the international competitive system. Left to itself - without intervention from governments, without intervention in the competi­tive system - I tell you the numbers of people starving and condemned to death in the rest of the world would amount to hundreds of millions, to add to the 10,000,000 in our own country kept on the poverty line by this great competitive sys­tem that they laud. Do not let anybody come to us or try to say to the British people that this is a mo­ment when we as democratic socialists should abandon in any degree whatsoever the faith and philosophy in which we believe. (Applause)Sometimes when I consider the antics of the Social Democrats - I will not say much more about them this afternoon and the injury they have done by their treachery to our party and to  our country, I am reminded from lines from one of my favourite poets who said: \u2018when you\u2019re betrayed, be still more true; let faith flame higher.\u2019I believe it is in that faith that we should go about our business as socialists after this conference. Perhaps you may say to me - and I can understand it - that that is much too complimen­tary to them; in the arguments that have proceeded since, I think all my sympathies are with David Steel. If I have any advice for him, I would say to him that he really does not have to take seriously any of these new prescriptions offered him by the doctor. (Laughter)That doctor has not practised any real medicine for years; all he wants to do is take over the practice. (Applause)As I have watched him, and some of the others - but especially the doctor - going up and down the country, proclaiming how strong he is, determined he is­ how all the strength he musters is going to be applied and nothing is to be fudged, as I have seen him going up and down the country trying to persuade us in these matters, I am reminded of the quotation from another of my favourite characters\u2026 Zsa Zsa Gabor, who said \u2013 I must get her absolutely accurate \u2013 \u2018men who try too hard to be macho are generally not mucho.\u2019  (Laughter and applause)Now let me turn to another more serious matter.  I wish to refer to some of the remarks made by the prime minister on her visit to the United States and Canada.  I will refer in a moment to what she said on international affairs, but the whole performance was an astonishing and menacing one, astonishing and menacing for us in this country and for the world at large.  She talks as if she has a great success story to tell.  It is nothing of the kind; it is in fact a shameful failure.  She preaches sermons about honesty in politics, but is content to see the realities of the injury done to our industry of our country and our people concealed by a servile cabinet and, if conceivable, an even more servile press.  She talks as if some grand new remedy for our ills has been bravely applied, when all that has happened is the readiness of her government to resurrect barbarous methods of treating poor people in our community, which we thought had been banished from our county for generations.  But we must take warning, because the more she goes to Canada or anywhere else and says that she glories in what has already been done, the more she threatens more of it in the future.I call your attention to some of the actual words that she delivered there.  Some of you may have seen the frontal assault which she made there on the welfare state as a whole.  This is how she went on: \u2018the share of the nation\u2019s income borne by the government is really at the heart of our problems.  As the state takes more, the private sector has to do with less\u2019.That is part of the monetarist doctrine approved now by Dr Owen and his fellow parrots as well.  But what nonsense; that claim was certainly not true previously, even under Conservative governments.  Over most of the post-war years in most countries of the Western world both public and private sectors grew together, helping each other.  Support is not just a one-way business.  Commonsense ell us that taxes finance education and education helps industry, and indeed that has been the way in which we have expanded the welfare of our nation over the past 30 years.  But that is now being denied us.  She was trying to tell the people of Canada how prosperous we had become over the past three or four years.  I presume that she was trying to suggest to them that there have been great changes here, that maybe they had not fully understood.  And she told them what is happening in Scotland, or what somebody told her has been happening In Scotland.  (Laughter)  this is what she actually said \u2013 she was appealing to a Canadian audience where there were some Scots, and she said: \u2018already in Scotland, where so many Canadian families have connections, more people are employed in electronics than in traditional industries of steel-making and shipbuilding put together\u2019.  (Laughter)You know what has happened in Scotland; all she is saying, surely, is that the shipbuilding and steel-making industries in Scotland have collapsed so much that maybe the electronics have just gone ahead.  Actually, the figures are not even correct about Scotland, and they are the only figures on which she based the whole of her claim about British recovery in Canada when she made the speech there.  But the figures are correct about Britain as a whole, and they illustrate the truth which she is trying to conceal.If you look at the country as a whole, the facts are these: it is the case that there are more people today employed in Great Britain in the electronics industry than there are in shipbuilding and in steel-making put together.  That is a measure of the collapse of the steel industry, of course.  But what she did not tell them in Canada is that, compared with 1979, there are some 70,000 fewer people in the the electronics industry today than there were when she came to power.  (Applause)  It is a collapse not only of the great old industries and the degeneration that has been permitted there, but it is a collapse of the new industries as well, or at any rate a failure of them to expand on anything like the scale that they chose to pretend.Take the steel industry as an illustration.  You all know \u2013 except for those of you who happen to work in the steel industry or in the parts of the country that owe their livelihood to steel \u2013 that a miracle has happened in the steel industry, the MacGregor miracle.  There has been an improvement in productivity in the steel industry,, and that is all to be welcomed.  It has happened in previous years and on previous occasions; it is not an absolute novelty, but it has happened, and we welcome it.But it is not the only thing that has happened in the steel industry during the period of the MacGregor miracle.  We are producing less steel than we did in 1979, less by as much as a quarter.  We have not improved our market share \u2013 about a quarter of our steel is imported compared with one-fifth in 1979.  I has cost quite a lot in hard cash \u2013 I am not complaining about their giving the cash, but we must remember it when they try and make the comparisons.  British steel lost £809m last year; it was not as bad as 1979-80 or 1980-81, but much worse than in the previous years.  Under Ian MacGregor, Mrs Thatcher\u2019s special miracle worker, British steel lost £2,393m in three years, more than twice as much as the total loss of the five years of the spendthrift Labour government.  That is the way the miracle has been operated there. (Applause)If you look at what they have achieved with it, exports are considerably down - 15 per cent, lower than they were in the days of the Labour government. Do not forget, as I say, that it is a miracle; production of steel has collapsed more rapidly during this period than in any other coun­try except the United States. It has never been part of our argument that it is all the fault of Ian MacGregor, and Mrs Thatcher who appointed him; the steel industry cannot exist in a vacuum any more than any other industry. It needs a car industry, an engineering industry, ship-building and railways to buy its products, and these markets have all been hit by this government.Ravenscraig is under threat and still stays under threat now. Not because of what is wrong at Ravenscraig, but because we have lost so much other production in Scottish factories and in other factories up and down Great Britain. (Applause). That is what they have done to steel. I only take it as an illustration of what has hap­pened to our country and what has happened to the basic industries where we need employment for our people.Let me pause for one moment, because I am going to show you in a second that even the Conservatives agree with what I am saying, but that is a different matter. First of all, let us look at the curious problem about why such facts as these, so evident to us all, have been concealed from the British people. Why they have been distorted in the mind of the British people. Why, not during the election only, but in other periods too, the British people get such a distorted (that is a very mild word to use), a completely jaundiced picture of what is really happening.I am not one of those who believe that you can blame the election defeat solely upon the media or newspapers.  I think that would be quite wrong and complacent, not learning the right lessons that we have to learn.  But that does not mean to say that I am in favour of reprieve for the whole of the British press \u2013 not at all.  I say this partly as a journalist as much as a member of the Labour Party.  And I am not lumping the whole of the media together, or anything so foolish \u2013 there are real differences to be drawn between them.  As I look round some familiar faces, I say it all the more for certain, having been a journalist all my working life \u2013 in my opinion, the debasement of journalism is worse in Fleet Street today than at any time I can recall. (Applause)I do not say it is all due to the arrival of Mr Murdoch in this country, although I think he bears his fair share, but to say that would not be fair to the others, would it? (Laughter) It would not be fair to our old friend the Daily Mail, the forgers\u2019 gazette, would it? (Applause) It would not be fair to plenty of others. As I say, I am not saying that it applies to the whole of the press, but I think a very strange picture has been presented to our country. Moreover, Fleet Street is a place \u2013 I know it quite well - where Gresham\u2019s Law applies with a particular ferocity. The bad drives out the good; the evil drives out the shoddy; the tenth-rate drives out the second- or third-rate. You have ferocious competition, and if you have interlocking ownerships in that competition, it may very well be that some of the so-called most respectable papers do not like to criticise some of the most disreputable; that is what happens.I say it in the interests of Fleet Street journalists - I am a paid-tip member of the National Union of Journalists, I say it on behalf of my union - the bingo competition that is now going on in Fleet Street will kill decent journalism if journalism does not put a stop to it. (Applause) Every decent journalist in this country knows the truth of what I am saying. I am in favour of protecting the value and credit of our newspapers, because I believe they are essential to the maintenance of our general freedom. It does so happen to be the fact, however - here I do come back to the election - that there are parts of it that I do not think you can make any rules about and you have to watch them carefully. But, as a general principle, if you want to discover who in Fleet Street (I am not talking, about the provincial press; they have got a higher standard on the whole) has got down lowest in the gutter, it is almost always those who have got an editor or proprietor either ennobled or knighted by the prime minister of Great Britain. (Applause)One way to correct this is to have a newspaper of our own; another way is to try to ensure that we as journalists \u2013 I repeat that I speak as a journalist \u2013 stand by our code of conduct.  If the code of conduct of the National Union of Journalists was carried out in Fleet Street, we would have a healthier politics altogether. (Applause)Amongst the sections of the community which have been conducted is the trade union movement.  It happens especially at election times; it happens in between election times; it happens in every kind of way that some of them seek to ensure that the whole constructive effort of the trade union movement is denied, distorted and presented to the public in that way.  Only last week \u2013 you could not discover it, I must say, in most of the headlines in most of the newspapers \u2013 there was the annual report of the Health and Safety Commission.  It showed that the number of people killed in British industry has been reduced by 30 per cent since the last Labour government \u2013 I was very proud to play a part in it \u2013 placed on the statute book the measure which has established the Health and Safety Commission and incorporated in that measure for the first time in the history of this country provisions for trade unionists to be enabled to play their full part in the safety provisions. (Applause) It has saved hundreds of lives; it has saved our community from many of the degradations that we have known in the past.  There is still a huge amount to be done, but of course the trade union movement has a great constructive future ahead of it.We will be discussing later in this conference how to deal with the trade union legislation that is being proposed by this government \u2013 I am not only referring to one single part of it, I lump it all together.  It is directed at putting such bonds upon them that they shall be weakened in conducting affairs on behalf of their members, which they have done legitimately in this country for 30, 40 and 50 years.  Therefore, however we devise our plan for fighting them, I say our objective must be the repeal of all that legislation.However, now the election is over and despite all the efforts of some of our friends in the newspapers, the debate which they tried to suppress during the campaign is breaking out all over, is it not?  It is breaking out al over where nurses meet, teachers meet, civil servants meet, public authorities meet.  We have heard in the debates, wherever the people have to deal with the reality, the truth about the election is now becoming more evident.  It is even creeping into some of these newspapers that I referred to so flatteringly a few minutes ago.  I am not going to quote the Daily Mail, you will be happy to hear, but The Times a couple of weeks ago referred to the debate that you remember we had at our last party conference, just after the publication of the Think Tank report.This is what The Times said in a leading article.  They consider more carefully what is in a leading article; I am not just reporting any twopenny-half-penny Times reporter, I am dealing with the actual editor\u2019s sober, considered opinion.  (Laughter)  This is what he said: \u2018he\u2019 \u2013 Sir Geoffrey Howe, remember him?  I am talking of him in his previous capacity \u2013 (Laughter) \u2018suggested that the cabinet needed to take a fundamental look at public spending as a follow-up to the now infamous Think Tank report.  The Cabinet took fright\u2019 \u2013 that is a year ago \u2013 \u2018the Conservatives fought the election without any public recognition of the major decisions which they would need to make if they wished to break out of the depressive and inexorable rise in public spending, borrowing and taxation.\u2019 Can you beat it?  They fought it without information, they say, without \u2018any public recognition.\u2019  I remember Peter Shore going on day after day telling the country what was going to happen, telling them what the real meaning of that Think Tank report was, telling the country what was prepared, yet The Times afterwards says: \u2018the Conservatives fought the election without any public recognition.\u2019That may be so, but it was a gross distortion of reality and it succeeded for a while in misleading the nation.  But the truth is breaking out afterwards.  I quote now from The Sunday Telegraph \u2013 not from the editor, but from one who aspires to be editor \u2013 maybe he did not get the job for this reason.  (Laughter)  It said, talking about this whole question of what they are going to do about public expenditure cuts and the future: \u2018it is difficult to see how Mrs Thatcher can avoid being forced to do what she promised not to do.\u2019  It goes on: \u2018a small majority won by telling the truth; how much more strength that would have provided than the landslide victory won by deception.\u2019 That is what it was: a landslide victory won by deception.  (Applause)  Now what we prophesied at the election is fearfully coming true.  Up and down the country they are taking steps to sack doctors, nurses and other workers in the health service.  At the Treasury and in the other departments they are preparing to cut the standard of life of the unemployed and those on supplementary assistance.  Across the board, they are reviving their infamous Think Tank propositions.  Perhaps I might recall to you one more quotation from the capitalist Press, but said by the perspicacious Financial Times political correspondent on 18 April 1983 \u2013 note the date \u2013 just at the time when they were making up their minds whether they were going to have an election or not.  This is what he wrote, and I give him full credit: \u2018privately some Treasury ministers and officials also favour an early date because it will be impossible to make tough decisions on public spending until after an election.\u2019 That is the reason why they had the election; that is the reason why she ran away; that is the reason why the Iron Lady picked up her skirts and skidaddled.  It was the biggest Dr Goebbels exhibition we have had in this country in this century.  (Applause)People talk about the manifestos on which the election was fought. I agree with what Jim Mortimer said about the themes on which we fought. I am not making any apologies for what I said at the election; the apologies to the British people should come from them. The apology has come in these documents that I have listed; the apology will have to come over the weeks and months ahead. I am not saying, as I said to the parliamentary party just, after the election (and I still hold the same view), that our own manifesto was word perfect or idea perfect even, but I tell you this, I am not in favour of casting it aside. (Applause)If we were to do so, believe me, we would not win any respect front the British people at all. When it came to the next election, they would say to us; \u2018what about this manifesto?\u2019 Think carefully how you do it. I am not in any sense whatsoever seeking to impose a rigid way of dealing with these matters, but I say that the more people look at what we actually said, the more people actually read what was in that manifesto, the more, I believe, they will come back to it. I am not turning my back on it and I do not believe the labour movement is going, to turn its back to it, either.That applies, if I can say so, especially in the field of foreign affairs. Because I remember what I said at the election; I do not suppose all of you always read it the next morning, but there you are. I remember what we presented to the British people. I contrast it with what the prime minister has done in these last few days and weeks on the other side of the Atlantic. If is a very perilous course that she has embarked upon. She tries to give the impression that the British government all along has been favour of disarmament, arms control. Just like the Americans, we always wanted to do it. She tries to present that picture to the British people, and I am sure there will be some in our press who will try to present it that way too. I tell you it bears as little relation to reality as what they said about spending cuts at the election bears to their domestic policies. But with this one they are playing with something infinitely more dangerous.All of us can remember the tremor, I think, felt throughout the world when the Korean aeroplane was shot down. We in the Labour Party condemn the Soviet action; we have done so in the statement we made at the tine, and we repeat it to this conference. We certainly condemn it, but we also condemn the reaction to that event. Because I believe sane men and women all over this planet, when they saw what had happened following that accident, when they know how combustible are these stores of nuclear weapons that are now being piled higher and higher - I would have thought sane men and women all over the world, especially those in the highest places, should have paused and said: \u2018let us try and establish some intelligent conversations, first of all between the superpowers.\u2019Sometimes the superpowers behave like superidiots. (Applause)We have got to behave all the more calmly. The nations, like ourselves, that still have some independent powers and judgements, we should have offered cool advice at the moment - instead of throwing more faggots onto the flames.What she tells us, I can show to you quite easily (I will not do it in detail, but I can prove it) is a palpable falsehood. It is not the case that the British and American governments are those who have offered all the proposals for intelligent arms controls, and they have been rejected all on the other side. That is not a proper intelligent record of what has really occurred over these past four or five years. Maybe you can remember it \u2014 President Reagan did not fight his election on a programme of arms control or agreement with the Russians; he fought his election on exactly the same kind of dangerous nonsense that Mrs Thatcher is preaching now. That is what he was elected on. (Applause) He set about carrying it out. One of the first things they did was to abandon - or help to abandon; it was partly abandoned before - the SALT 2 agreements, or at any rate discussions about them. I do not say they would protect world peace for ever, but they were the best arrangements that had so far been made between the superpowers \u2013 so any intelligent person should be trying to protect them, as we did in the Labour Government. Jim Callaghan was doing everything in his power to ensure that the SALT 2 agreement should be faithfully upheld, and British influence was being used in a very different way. But now what they are saying, what Mrs. Thatcher says, is that she has been struggling for disarmament all through this period. It is just not true.First of all, when the SALT2 agreements were cancelled, not a word of protest came from the British government.  Then some of us in the Labour Party and socialist parties in Europe fought hard to get the Geneva agreement started, but she did not do anything about it.  It was not President Reagan\u2019s initiative that got them; it was much more Helmut Schmidt\u2019s initiative I Germany that got the Geneva talks going.  Then at the talks themselves \u2013 I will not go through the whole list now, but it is there on the record \u2013 it is not true that all the proposals for agreements and flexibility have come from the Americans.  I am not deriding some of their proposals \u2013 indeed, I want to get agreement \u2013 but if you look and see what the Soviet proposals have been, there have been very serious departures on their side from what they said originally.  There could be the making of an agreement there, but our government does not do anything about it, does not even listen to what is aid by other countries.It is barely a year ago at the United Nations when the other countries \u2013 many of them smaller countries, and Mexico \u2013 made proposals for a nuclear freeze.  The British government voted against.  Sweden made proposals; we voted against.  India made proposals; we voted against.  That was a bare 12 months ago, yet this government now says it has been working all the time for arms control.  Of course they have not.  What she did a week ago, if people believe what she said, and if her rhetoric (so-called) was translated into action \u2013 I do not want to give rhetoric a bad name; we might need to use it ourselves every now and again, you know, and it is a much better word than that.  But if what she says were to believed, there is no possibility of agreement. The Labour Party\u2019s view bears much greater relation to what is thought by tens of millions of people, scores of countries, hundreds of countries all over the world than anything that is proposed by Mrs Thatcher.  The nuclear powers are not the only countries in the world.  It is not only the Russians or the Americans or the British or the French or Chinese who are the only people who have a right to speak; all the others can be blown to pieces too.  What they are saying is that we should proceed along very much the lines that we in the Labour Party propose.  More than 100 non-aligned nations meeting in Delhi a few months ago said so with much greater sanity than anything you have heard from the British government.  I know we have differences with some of our fellow socialist governments in Europe; we have to discuss it with them too, and I am all in favour of it \u2013 with President Mitterrand, for example.  I have not noticed, by the way, that President Mitterrand and the French are going to put any Cruise missiles on French territory, are they?  If somebody went along and said to President Mitterrand \u2013 maybe if they said it to President de Gaulle before \u2013 \u2018would you mind having some Cruise missiles stationed on your soil on exactly the same terms that Mrs Thatcher\u2019s been prepared to accept here in Britain?\u2019  I can tell you that President Mitterrand \u2013 and even more strongly, perhaps, President de Gaulle \u2013 would have given a very clear answer.I am against Cruise missiles for those reasons.  I am against them for other reasons as well, but I am against them above all because I believe \u2013 this is the Labour Party view that we started at the election, which, I believe, stands, must stand and will continue to be proved to be correct as the years and months go by \u2013 if you allow the Cruise programme, the Pershing programme to go ahead in Europe, the chances of securing any kind of future arms agreement are indefinitely reduced.  We are opposed to it.We also set out a programme on how we are to proceed this year.  Dennis Healey will present it to conference tomorrow.  We set out a programme on how we can proceed over the years ahead.  The more people hear what we have got to say, the more, I believe, over these coming two or three years people will turn back to this election and heed what we said then and say: \u2018maybe they didn\u2019t get it all right, but what they were saying was something that offered sense and humanity for the human race, something in great contrast to what was done by our political opponents\u2019.An early decision was made by the Conservatives just prior to the election to convert the Ministry of Defence into a branch department of the Conservative Central Office.  Ever since then, I give you the advice, do not believe anything they say.  What we will do when we meet again in parliament and throughout these coming weeks and months, is to use all the efforts, all the power, all the imagination, all the new cohesion that I believe we can have in our party \u2013 we will use all our strength, everything we can muster, with our socialist friends and others in Europe and across the world \u2013 to try and stop this hideous nuclear arms race and turn the world back o the course of intelligence.  Perhaps you will permit me to say one word more on matters affecting our own party. Sometimes, when I get to this stage of a speech, the recommendation of Jill, my wife, echoes in my mind, because she sometimes says to me before I start a speech: \u2018don\u2019t do a Beethoven at the end.\u2019 I tell you what she means. She thinks - maybe she is misguided about this - that Beethoven had a bit of difficulty in finishing some of his symphonies. (Laughter) There she is sitting at the back. (Applause)I am not going to but I would like to conclude with these words. They are directed towards one of the victor candidates yesterday, to Roy Hattersley. I wish him the very best of success, and I think that he and Neil together will make a great contribution to our future victory. (Applause)If I could just say to Neil, I was enraptured, as I think the country would be, by what he said when he responded on Sunday night. I was thrilled by it and I believe it can have a very big effect in moving people\u2019s minds up and down the country. I think he has truly in him the spirit, the courage, and the imagination - the very greatest quality of all that Nye had - I think he has got all those qualities. He was born only a few streets away from Aneurin Bevan in Tredegar; Tredegar is already a very famous town. Ebbw Vale is already a very famous constituency, and I hope both can be more famous in the future still. (Applause) I believe Neil can help to do that as well. I think he has the true spirit of Aneurin Bevan in him.If I could conclude with these two recollections, slightly incongruous, you might say. The first one, I remember, was sitting in the House of Commons once - I do not know why this inconsequential affair should have come into my mind - with Aneurin Bevan on the bench there. We were looking at some Tory who was speaking - not one of our favourite characters. He was a Tory who had a very strange physical aspect in this sense in that he did not seem to have any neck at all. (Laughter) His head was fixed into his body without a neck. (Laughter) Nye looked across and waved his fingers and shrugged his shoulders, as he would often do, and said: \u2018the hangman\u2019s puzzle.\u2019 (Laughter and applause)I will tell you another recollection, again rather incongruous but slightly more apposite. I went to hear Nye speak in 1937 when the hunger marchers came to London. It was in Trafalgar Square and, I think, it was 10 November 1937 - 1936 or 1937 - at any rate, it was the day before Armistice Day. Nye made his speech then. He certainly meant no disrespect to those whose courage was going to be celebrated a day later, but he said in his speech as he concluded in Trafalgar Square, to the hunger marchers and the Britain of that period: \u2018we don\u2019t come here to bury the dead \u2013 we come here to bring life to the living.\u2019  That is what we are doing at this conference: life to the living, both in our own country and elsewhere, a new hope for our stricken country and our frightened world.  That is what we can take from this country together; that is how we can change the 1980s into the course which it should take a course for democratic socialists ruling here in Britain, and giving a proper lead to their fellow socialists and others throughout the world, determined to build a peaceful world as well.It is that new hope, I believe, that comes from this conference, and it is in that mood that we are going to carry forward to our victory. (Applause) (Singing of \u2018For he\u2019s a jolly good fellow\u2019).

aVChair, comrades, as you say, for the first time but certainly not the last I rise to move the parliamentary report for the past year. Frankly, after the last half hour, I was rather more disposed to simply get up and move a vote of thanks to our guest speakers.For us it has been a year of advance. Twelve months ago we came to this conference licking our wounds in defeat. We stood at 24.5 per cent in the opinion polls; we were stunned by our worst post-war election defeat.The commentators, with all of the insight and foresight for which they are famous - at least among each other - were talking about us in deathbed terms. Now, in 1984, we have made great gains in the European Parliament elections, and in the local government council elections in the spring of this year. In the four GLC by-elec­tions, which our party correctly called, Labour scored huge victories and - more important, in many ways - we completely vindicate our belief in using democracy to try to defend democracy, in London and everywhere else.That in anybody\u2019s book should be strong evi­dence of substantial and sustained recovery, and it is. Only one thing could possibly arrest that recovery: amnesia, memory loss. It is an awful affliction for anyone, but for a political party it can be an absolutely crippling disease. Indeed, a political party cannot afford any degree of infec­tion by amnesia. It must vaccinate itself completely against such an event. It cannot afford any loss of memory. And in this party, the vaccine is simply to recall what defeat felt like last year, and that should immunise each and every one of us completely against any attitude or activity that can impede our progress towards victory.And all of you who have been winning those European, local and by-elections, know the great feeling of taking an extra pace towards the victory we must achieve at the next election.That is how it has been in this Labour Party, and that is how it must go on: with patience, with understanding, with persuasion, with co-opera­tion, with campaigning, with hard work. Turning outwards, listening to people, and learning from them. Working for the people, working with the people. That is the way the Labour Party will win the election.The prize for that effort is great: it is the demo­cratic power that we need to save our country. And the prize is there for us to win. Think about it: we have to advance as much in three years as we already have in one year. That is the knowledge that spurs our effort, that gives us confidence and sets our course for victory.Every month that passes increases the need for that victory. For in this year, whilst we have been building recovery, our country has been pushed further into slide and shambles by the govern­ment elected in June of 1983.In this year in which the government kept on telling us that the economy is recovering, unem­ployment has risen by 125,000.In this so-called year of recovery, an extra 350,000 young people under 25 find themselves unemployed for more than a year.In this year of recovery 91,000 more manufac­turing jobs have been lost, to add to the 1.7 million manufacturing jobs lost since 1979.In this year interest rates went up by a third, and mortgage rates soared to 12.5 per cent as the government further applied the very policies that brought the pound tumbling in the first place.In this year industrial production has stagnated - fewer cars and commercial vehicles, steel and ships have been produced in this country than in the previous year.This was a year when our trade deficit in man­ufactured products - in this country of makers and traders, that for all the foreseeable future must try to live by selling the things that it makes for the rest of the world - doubled to a rate of over £4,000 million.As for the so-called sunrise industries, we heard this year that in Britain the sunrise industry of information technology is being eclipsed before it has properly risen.These are the statistics of slump, and not the records of recovery. I register them with misery - for our people are the victims of that shrivel­ling economy. I wish with all my heart that it was true that we were experiencing a recovery - even Mrs Thatcher\u2019s recovery. For there is no profit, no comfort, no joy for us in this labour movement in the drudgery, poverty, despair, and insecurity of anybody\u2019s unemployment.This was the year, too, when tax was intro­duced on fish and chips; and, in an industry with over 400,000 unemployed, tax was introduced on home improvements.This was the year when farmers slaughtered milk cows.This was the year when old age pensioners were charged for their spectacles and lens replacements.This was the year when the health service \u2013 \u2018safe in their hands\u2019 - was squeezed into further closures and contractions.This was the year when the school class-sizes stopped falling; when university admissions kept on falling; when medical and technological research was cut back by the government because of its cut.This was the year in which cruise arrived. This was the year in which the cost of Trident soared past £12,000 million.This was the year when cuts pushed public and local services below the level of legality, while simultaneously government threatened prison to those who tried to spend to keep services up to the levels of decency and service to the community. (Applause)This was the year when the elections for the Greater London and metropolitan county coun­cils were abolished: Why? Because the results would be politically embarrassing and devastat­ing for the government.This was the year when the government ban­ned trade unions at GCHQ, Cheltenham. Why? In order to demonstrate its view that security, patriotism, commitment to the national interest, is incompatible with trade unionism. What vile rubbish, utterly unacceptable in any democracy.This is the year when Sarah Tisdall went to jail with a punishment vastly in excess of anything that was merited by the offence.This was the year when Clive Ponting is on trial and being prosecuted by the government.This was the year when national policing was introduced in Britain.This was the year in which young mothers were refused help with maternity costs, and families were denied help with funeral bills, because the fathers of those families were on strike.This is the year when soup kitchens came back to Britain: 1984, the fifth year of Thatcherism.And for seven months of this year, all of those elements - the erosion of civil rights; the with­drawal of welfare support; the cutbacks and closures; unemployment and civil disorder - have all been brought together in a great turmoil of the miners\u2019 dispute.That turmoil is the product of Thatcherism - the combination of ignorance and arrogance, of pride and prejudice, that now rules and overrules this country and makes Britain in this fifth year of Thatcherism less free, less fair, less productive than it was for years before 1979.The erosion of our economic standards, our standards of liberty, of compassion, of care, and of opportunity; it is all that which is, of course, part of the reason for this dispute. Families and communities in the coalfields, like those in my constituency in South Wales, know that pit closure would trap them, entomb them, in unemployment and deprivation for all of the foreseeable future under Toryism. They know that under Thatcherism no alternatives exist and no alternatives are coming to their areas. That is why the resistance has been so determined. People who do not comprehend it should under­stand that the communities now engaged in this dispute are like someone fighting for air to breathe. That is literally the case under Margaret Thatcher.Let everybody be clear. This dispute was caused by the fact that the National Coal Board wanted to impose production targets on the industry which would in this year, by the spring of 1985, bring the closure of 20 pits, the loss of 20,000 jobs, and the reduction of output by four million tonnes - and that was just for starters. They said that the cutback was to bring produc­tion into line with the market for coal - that was the phrase they used; they said that the closures were necessary to save £350 million - that\u2019s what they said.As it happens, that programme could not have benefited Britain in any event. In Britain\u2019s coal­fields now, the male unemployment rates are 15, 18, and 20 per cent. There are no jobs for redun­dant coal miners to go to. That is the simple, sour fact. And that means that closures would simply turn producers of coal who pay taxes into produc­ers of nothing who have to claim benefits. (Applause) That\u2019s the loss we would be making. It would cost the country more; the whole scheme would, to coin a phrase, be \u2018uneconomic\u2019 for Bri­tain. Even apart from that plain argument of arithmetic, the fact is that this dispute itself has torn the purposes claimed by the board for their cutback and closure programme into absolute ribbons.Since the Board tried to impose those demand early this year, there has been a seven-month dis­pute which has cost at a minimum the country a minimum of nearly £2,000 million in extra oil-burn, in lost taxes, in lost production and in polic­ing costs. Since those demands were made by the Board early this year, there has been a seven-month dispute and 54 million tonnes of coal pro­duction has been lost. I want this conference, the whole country, and the government to get hold of the facts that the loss of coal production in this dispute is 14 times more than the loss originally required by the NCB. I want the whole country to get hold of the fact that the financial costs of continuing the dispute are six times as great as any so-called savings that were anticipated from the programme of closures and contractions. (Applause)If people understand that, they will com­prehend that those are the unrelenting facts which would now persuade the board and the government to get away from their stupidity and their inflexibility, from their vanities and their posturing, and step out of their \u2018B\u2019 movie script, and act like responsible people and go back to the arrangements before the compilation of the hit-list. That is the pre-condition, the basic require­ment, of saving this country and the coalmining communities and much else, from the awful pain of the continuation of this dispute. The govern­ment and the Board should get back to the sys­tem, and restore confidence in the system of negotiation about exhaustion, which has stood the industry in good stead for many years. They should understand that the National Union of Mineworkers has been prepared to make its case for new investment, and new development of workable reserves, when pits were reported as exhausting. They should remember that, on those ground of foreseeable and acknowledged exhaus­tion, agreement had already been made before the dispute started, between the NUM and the NCB, to close about a dozen pits in the next two or three years.They should revise their coal investment strategy to improve existing pits capable of development, and stop the distortion whereby eight-tenths of investment is going into a small number of coalfields, including pits that will not even produce coal for the next 10 years. (Applause)And, in Mrs Thatcher\u2019s case, she should stop saying about the miners, as she said to the Financial Times: \u2018Some of their arguments apply just as much to exhausted pits as to uneconomic ones. If you listened to their arguments [though I never know when she did] you would go on pro­ducing mud to keep a community going.\u2019She ought not to have said things like that, because it only demonstrates her crass ignorance of miners and her gross misunderstanding of the issues in this dispute. There is not a miner who wants to take the purposeless risks of working an exhausted pit or a seam that is anywhere near to such uselessness. There are other occupations devoted to provide fruitless fripperies, and Mrs Thatcher may be used to them and paying exotic prices charged in those occupations; but they don\u2019t include coal mining.The fact is that there is no rational, financial, technical, economic or market reason for the Board and the government to keep the dispute going. Mrs Thatcher has no rational economic case for maintaining the dispute. She has no case based on costs; she has no case based on savings; no rational case. But she does have an irra­tional purpose in continuing the dispute: it is the purpose of political vanity on a manic scale. And she can only sustain that cause by uproar. That is all she has left now. That is the game.We must not play the game: we never have; we never will. It is their game not ours. They have used it through the ages. They have always created the conditions of disorder and then sought political credit out of the use of force against that eruption. (Applause)It is 50 years or more since they did it last. Fifty years in which people thought those days had gone for ever; fifty years in which another kind of Toryism which remembered the conflict and chaos of that system actually refused to operate that tactic.But now there is a different Toryism: one that is empty of all of the subtle and genteel concern; one that is devoid of consensus values; one that has no compassion, no instinct for conciliation. It is a Toryism that is all spite, bile and arrogance; it is a Toryism exhumed from the past - a Toryism led by an historical throwback, Margaret Thatcher.Ask the assorted retired senior civil servants; ask one or two bishops; ask the odd judge or two who in an assortment of statements (some with great salvos of publicity, others more subtly) are demonstrating that right across this society - yes, from the men and women struggling in the coalmining communities now, up to the lords and judges and all stations and classes and ages and sexes in between - the comprehension is grow­ing of the nature of the government that is ruling this country.The fact that she is tearing the society apart is therefore increasingly obvious: but perhaps what is less obvious is that it is exactly what Mrs Thatcher promised to do.This conference didn\u2019t need warning. This party tried to warn people. They thought we were exaggerating; they thought we were simply engaging in the partisan knock-about; they thought we were just trying to frighten people. There are millions in this country now who wished they had heeded our lessons, and under­stood that Thatcherism is a personal fixation turned into a system of government.That is the state of affairs. And in all economic policy, in all social policy, in their very appearance and their conduct of government, this gov­ernment creates the climate of confrontation, the conditions of conflict: it speaks only the language of conquest. And, in the midst of all of that chaos, in the midst of all that assault on the essentials of civilised life in this country and of values of this country, they call for the condemnation of vio­lence.I do not respond to that, because it is a taunt, a call to forswear intimidation from a government that bases its whole policy on intimidation. (Applause) I do condemn violence. I condemn the violence of despair; I condemn the violence of long-term unemployment; I condemn the violence of loneliness, decay, ugliness, and fear. I condemn the violence done to hope, the violence done to talent, the violence done to family sec­urity and family unity. I condemn the violence done to civil and personal rights in this country.I condemn the violence, too, of the stone-throw­ers and the battering-ram carriers. And I condemn the violence of the cavalry charges, the truncheon groups, and the shield bangers. (Applause) I condemn violence, I abominate vio­lence, I damn violence - all violence. All violence, without fear or favour. That\u2019s what I do, and that is what makes me different from Margaret Thatcher. I don\u2019t have her double standards (Applause). I do not take her selective and blinkered view of conflict.Of course, I do take sides in this dispute. I couldn\u2019t do otherwise with my background. But in any case, even if I didn\u2019t come from where I came from, I would find the case for coal compelling, and the case for the communities over­whelming. So I take sides in this dispute; this movement takes sides in this dispute. But the only side I am prepared to take when it comes to violence, is to oppose it. The prime minister should do the same thing, instead of delighting in turmoil and using the police as a replacement for policy.Yes, that she is doing, and the police know it too. (Applause) They realise that they are being made into the \u2018meat in the sandwich.\u2019 They realise the pressures are on them to make them depart from the most basic, resilient and most orderly value of British policing - the feeling that they have that they are citizens in uniform. They know that pressure is being applied by the government to make them move away from that tradition; and they also know what the cost, the bitter cost, of being the \u2018meat in the sandwich\u2019 will be. We will be paying that cost for a very long time to come in many of the mining communities.In our society on every side we see things being torn apart. We see terrible wrongs done to the young and the old, we see wrongs done to the poor and the disabled; we see industries decimated, communities deprived, liberties lost. We see unjust laws - laws which are nothing more than prejudice made statute. And every fibre rages against the injustice and the waste of all that. And we ask ourselves: what we can do about it? For socialists that is the question of the ages - because it is in our very nature, in our conviction, that we want to do something. Especially when it is injustice. It was a question faced by our move­ment in the 1930s; and they came back with the answer that the democratic road was the only route for British socialism. All other options, they said, were closed since socialism by insurrec­tion was pure fantasy, and socialism without the ballot box would simply never secure the support and understanding of the British people. They were right. (Applause) They were right in times even more dangerous than ours, when fascism was pressing of every gate of liberty. Democracy is the first premise of our socialism; it is a matter of principle, not of convenience; it is a matter of commonsense, not of tactics.With its absolutism, its dogmatism, its controls on local councils, its destruction of opportunities, its war on trade unionism, it is Toryism which defaces and relegates democracy in our country - not Labour, or the cause of Labour. (Applause)In saying that, we are not being smug and cosy, and giving in for the duration of the Tory govern­ment, when we hold to our belief in democracy.We are upholding the only system which can give us power; the only system that we want to give us power; and the only system that we are prepared to wield when we have that power. Democracy is our cause at all times and in every respect. (Applause) That is not a call to wait in idleness; it is not a call to relax until the election comes along. On the absolute contrary, it is a call to action - action to articulate and publicise the complaint of the people, for if they cry quietly, they will cry alone; action to break through the indifference to the scandals of social deprivation and industrial destruction in this country; action to pressure ministers and promote concessions; action to rouse and rally and resist; action to pro­tect and promote the interest of the people that we are in politics to help; action that is continual; action that recruits and mobilises new people in our cause.That is the action of democracy. We are democ­rats.At the earliest possible time we want to pass and enforce laws to redress grievances; to prom­ote justice and opportunity, to punish race and sex prejudice; to change economic ownership and rewards. We want the power of the law to do that - so we cannot sharpen legality as our main weapon for the future, and simultaneously scorn legality because it doesn't suit us at the present time. (Applause)To recognise that is not to be defeatist. It is to recognise the facts as they exist and as they are supported by the great mass of Labour people and Labour supporters in this country. To recognise that is not to bow down before a vague and variable idea called the \u2018sanctity of the law,\u2019 because we all know how that can be built and bent to defend massive interests. It is to acknow­ledge that our greatest service to those who need our protection and provision from different laws, is to get power and turf out the authors of the pre­sent injustice.We have to work for that incessantly, single-mindedly. It is a great cause but it is a care­ful and cool-headed cause. The people who need the support and safeguard of trade unionism and of public services, cannot afford to be part of any political \u2018Charge of the Light Brigade.\u2019 There is no glory in defeat for them; there is just nothing but extra miserable burdens of insecurity and insufficiency. In those circumstances, it is they - the poorest, the weakest, and the most needy - who are the martyrs. That\u2019s the fact.Our political mandate to change the Tory laws and conditions arises partly out of the evidence of their injustice. That exposure must be fierce and relentless; and, when we gain that mandate, we will use it with the full rigour of our power to pro­mote fairness and freedom, and to punish those who dodge their taxes, or pay sweatshop wages, or practise racialism, or any of the other evils of our society. We will do that, we will have the right to do it, and we will have the power to do it. And we will need that power. You see there is not an aspiration listed this week, or any other week, by this labour movement that will be fulfilled unless we achieve the power of democratic government. (Applause)Our ideals inspire, our policies offer the answers; but however much they intrigue us and encourage us, they are adornments, even enter­tainments, unless we have power to put them into practice. That is the reality. (Applause) That is what we know. That is the understanding. Grip it like you would grip a weapon, that reality; hold on to it as we, work for an election. Understand that we must have power to house the homeless; we must have power to release the poor; we must have power to provide care for the sick, to refash­ion and extend the National Health Service.Power to change the balance of power itself, to restore and develop the structure of democratic government in this country - so that local authorities can have real rights, and so trade unionism can have real rights in this country. We need the power to provide girls and women with the full practical entitlements of equality and no less. We need the power to take prejudice and partisanship out of industrial relations and trade union legislation. We need that power to respond to the needs of pensioners, and to give liberty, choice, comfort, and security in old age. We need the power to meet the justified demands of black people; that they shall have personal and economic status that is equal to any of this coun­try\u2019s citizens - regardless of their colour or creed. We need the power to provide the full equipment of educational training for our chil­dren. We need the power to provide the effective defence of our country and our values, by meet­ing the obligations of modern conventional defence and of alliance - without nuclear weapons, which by their possession make us a nuclear target and would by their use terminate our existence and all future forms of existence. (Applause)We need the power to work for peace and co­existence between East and West and to make it resilient and dependable. We need the power to achieve a new contract between the North and South of this planet, power to ensure that those countries of the Third World do not use up all of their pitiful earnings in debt repayments to the financiers of the industrial countries, but are able to achieve economic progress and freedom by using what they have and what they can be given to sponsor development, and become consumers instead of supplicants.Most of all, comrades, we want and we need power to operate a full policy for employment. It will not be the full employment conceived in the 1940s. It will not be the re-establishment of a society which is ethically, socially, and economically depended upon work for over 40 hours a week between the ages of 16 and 65 for most people - or, more accurately, for most men. Those days have gone, and they are not coming back. You and I know it, but what we need now is a policy for employment in this decade, and in the 1990s, and in the 21st century.This must have three main elements. First, it must be led by a strategy for investment that means that in the very course of expenditure we add value and strength to our economy. That means investment to use and to develop new technology, so that it is a servant and never a tyrant. It means investing in our economic infras­tructure of transportation, communication, construction and energy: Second, it must sponsor the growth of production and demand in order to deliberately generate jobs in our country. Third, it must also decrease the supply of people seeking employment through a shorter working year and a shorter working life. (Applause)The tasks of the modern world need extra prep­aration and we can get it by the comprehensive provision of extended education and training for youngsters, with reasonable pay so that they as individuals and their country collectively are bet­ter able to conquer the challenges of future employment, future, technology, and future development.And at the other end of working life, we need to provide for the gradual voluntary and systematic reduction in retirement age - both by the pro­vision of proper pensions, and by ensuring that the extra years of leisure are attractive and fulfil­ling, and not a condemnation to loneliness and semi-poverty.When people hear that message of a rational way of approaching the real employment, economic and technological requirements of our age, they say \u2018yes, we like that. Sponsor jobs and at the same time reduce the number of people needing to look for jobs in any given generation. We like that.\u2019 But, they say: \u2018Can it happen?\u2019My answer is: \u2018It\u2019s happening now.\u2019 But it is happening in the most clumsy and cruel way. Men and women in their early fifties are now being forced through redundancy into terminating their working life. Nobody asked them if they wanted to; nobody planned it; nobody made additional provision. They are out - and it\u2019s happening now. And for the youngsters, over a million under 25­ year-olds in our country are out of work, and many have never experienced full-time work. Can it happen? they ask. It is happening now, in the worst possible way. Better to civilise it, to turn it, to organise it; to make it supportive to the needs of the people, instead of making that change trample all over the people. That is why our approach is rational.And then they ask: \u2018Can we afford it?\u2019 I say that we are paying the price now, both in the direct £17,000 billion bills of unwanted idleness, and in the indirect but massive postponed costs of despair, of frustration, of conflict. The rational course is to recognise the change, and then to make it work to the advantage of the people. That is why we are socialists; that is why we seek power - to seek that mastery of change for the benefit of the people. If we don't, we shall see with terri­ble speed, and with awful results, the irrational response to technological and economic change which the market economy and he social market economy makes, and has always made - huge numbers of unemployed, millions more who live in a constant fear of unemployment and the insec­urity which it brings; and an affluent few who are safe in their jobs but in danger everywhere else.That isn\u2019t the society we want. In short we want a new concept. Modern full employment by these means before we allow the advent of an unpre­cedented scale of mass unemployment. That is not an option which we will tolerate. I\u2019ll tell you why I won\u2019t tolerate it, in the simplest terms: it is not an option that I am prepared to offer my child­ren, and therefore it is not an option that I am prepared to offer my children, and therefore it is not an option I am prepared to offer anybody else\u2019s children, either. (Applause)That, above all, is why we need power. Let us in this labour movement together with the people of this country plan for it carefully. Let us have the courage to make honest choices and practical priorities; let us work for it together. And when we win, let us use that power to keep our promise of liberty and of peace. For that isn\u2019t just the way to get power, it is also the way to keep power. (Applause)

aVThank you.  Comrades, Alan, I think you must be all Welsh to give a welcome like that. (Laughter) But wherever you come from, I do thank you and I think movement, the country, will have got that message that you gave them there and then very loud and very clear.  There is no mistaking that.  (Applause)Comrades, before I present my parliamentary report this year, I want to mark the fact that at this Conference we see the retirement of an unusual number of our senior comrades in the trade union movement and also, of course, we have seen this year the retirement of our General Secretary, Jim Mortimer.  I want to take this opportunity of paying tribute to all of those people, together with those who are perhaps not so distinguished, for their lifetime of service to this working class movement.  (Applause)Today, however, we learn with deep sadness that one of those retired friends died this morning.  Terry Duffy was blunt, irascible, not always easy to agree with, but as honest as the day was long, and we mourn his death and the fact that he had to endure with immense courage months of a dreadful illness.  We send our sincere condolences to his family, and to Terry and to the many others who have made such a contribution to our movement we say thanks for all that they have done.  (Applause)Comrades, this week in which our Conference meets is the 333rd week of Mrs Thatcher\u2019s government.  In this average week in Tory Britain 6,000 people will lose their jobs, 225 businesses will go bankrupt, £400 million will be spent on paying the bills of unemployment, 6,000 more people will be driven by poverty into supplementary benefit; and in this week in the world at large over $10,000 million will be spent on armaments and less than $1,000 million will be spent on official aid; and in this week over 300,000 children will die in the Third World.  These are the real challenges that we have to face, at home and abroad.  These are the concerns of our nation; they are the crises of our world.  These are the problems which we in our party address and must address this week and every other week.  Only we will address them this week and every other week, because that is what our party is for.The Tories do not see things like that. They do not believe that these are great problems of substance at all.  They think that all of the woes are simply a matter of \u2018presentation\u2019, as they put it.  Presentation \u2013 that is what their ministers tell each other, that is what their Conference will tell itself next week, that is what the Prime Minister uses to explain everything: it is all a matter of presentation.  The unemployment does not really exist, the training centres have not been shut down, the Health Service is safe in their hands: it is all just a matter of presentation.  Indeed, they are so convinced of that that they have now got rid of Mr John Selwyn Gummer.  He has been sent off to the Ministry of Agriculture, where doubtlessly the expertise that he gained as Chairman of the Tory Party in handling natural fertiliser will come in very handy.  (Applause)In little Selwyn\u2019s place we have Mr Norman Tebbit, charged with the task, so the newspapers tell us, of explaining the government to the country.  The last person to have that commission was Dr Goebbels.  (Applause) Whilst Lord Willie Whitelaw, so the newspapers tell us, retains responsibility for co-ordinating the presentation of government policy.  Norman and Willie \u2013 surely arsenic and old lace!  (Applause) Still, to give the devil his due, Mr Tebbit has been very frank about his whole function.  A few days ago he said: \u2018I don\u2019t mind being blackguarded for what we\u2019ve done, but I don\u2019t want to be blackguarded for what we haven\u2019t done.\u2019He will not mind then if I ask him to take a little time off from commissioning young Tories to litter the streets of Bournemouth \u2013 (Applause) \u2013 and give us a few explanations.  Ask him to explain, for instance, how the self-acclaimed party of law and order comes to preside over a record 40 per cent rise in crime in our country in the last six years.  (Applause) How does the declared party of school standards contrive a situation in which Her Majesty\u2019s inspectors can describe the schooling system as \u2018inadequate, shabby, dilapidated, outdated\u2019, and then on top of that the Government goads the most temperate of professions \u2013 the teachers \u2013 into taking prolonged sanctions in the schools they work in?  (Applause) How does the party of the family cut child benefit, cut housing benefit, reduce nursery schooling, turn hundreds of women into immigration widows?  How does the party of the family hit the old and the sick by cutting funds in the health and social services?  How does the party of the family, indeed of the country and the suburbs, isolate the villages and the suburbs by destroying public transport services?  (Applause) How does the party of the family, above all, so arrange things that this year there is the lowest number of public housing starts in the whole of modern history, the same year in which a Prime Minister makes provision for her retirement with a £450,000 fortress in Dulwich?  (Applause) Is that the mark of the family party?How is it that the party that promised to roll back the state has arrived at the situation where 1,700,000 more people are entirely dependent on the state because of their poverty during the time the Tories have been in government?  How can the party of freedom, the friends of freedom, illegalise trade unionism in GCHQ Cheltenham?  How can the party of freedom abolish the right to vote in the Greater London and metropolitan county councils?  (Applause) How can the party of freedom prosecute Sarah Tisdall and Clive Ponting?  How can the party of freedom make secret plans to surrender completely the sovereignty of the British people in the event of war?  How can the party of freedom do that?  (Applause) That did not happen when the Panzer divisions were at the French coast, when this country was in its most dire jeopardy.  The institutions of freedom in this country were maintained.  We insist that at tall times of national gravity, at any time of public jeopardy, there is all the more reason for us to sustain the values and the institutions of our democracy in this country.  That is what we tell the party of freedom.  (Applause)How does the party of enterprise preside over record bankruptcies?  How does the party of tax cuts arrange that the British people now carry the biggest ever burden of taxation in British history?  And how, above all, does the party that got the power by complaining that \u2018Labour isn\u2019t working\u2019 claim in the name of sanity that there is a recovery going on, when unemployment rises remorselessly to the point where this Thursday they will record 3.4 million British people registered unemployed even on their fiddle figures?  That is an awful lot \u2013 3.4 million \u2013 of moaning Minnies, even for the most malevolent Maggie to try and explain away.  (Applause)They are the paradoxes, they are the inconsistencies, they are the hypocrisies that Norman Tebbit has got to try and explain.  No wonder they have given him a professional fiction writer as deputy chairman.  (Applause) But even if Jeffrey Archer was a mixture of the inventive genius of Shakespeare and Houdini and Uri Geller all rolled up into one, he still would not be able to do the trick, because the British people have rumbled.  They have rumbled the methods, the motives, the style of the Government.  They now understand.  The great majority of the British people, including very much those who are not disadvantaged, are now alarmed and ashamed by the way that this Government rules, the divisions it creates, the dangers that it creates in our country.  Their concern is recorded in every opinion poll, it is obvious in the statements of clergymen, it is even apparent amongst the soggier elements of the Conservative Party; and the breadth of that concern is evidence of the breadth of decent values and attitudes amongst the British people.The Government ignores those feelings.  They propose no concessions, no changes.  All we get is a fleeting visit to what the Prime Minister thinks of as \u2018the North\u2019 and we get a Secretary of State for Employment in quarantine in the House of Lords, and then the other response that the Government makes to national crisis is to preach continually that there will be some great miracle of prosperity in some great non-unionised, low wage, tax-dodging, low-tech privatised day that one time will come upon us.  It is a myth, mirage, fantasy, and the British people now know that.They want a government that changes those policies; they want a government that will lift the poor and the unemployed; they want jobs to be generated; and they have demonstrated in overwhelming majorities that they want unemployment and insecurity to be fought by the Government, not used by the Government as the main tool of its economic policies.  (Applause) That is what the British people want.  They resent the Tory strategy of fear.  They know that fear brings caution, insecurity breeds stagnation.  It goes not bring the \u2018get up and go\u2019 society that Mrs Thatcher talks about; it brings the \u2018keep your head down, hang on to what you\u2019ve got, stay scared\u2019 society.  That is what it brings \u2013 anxiety.  And the penalties of disadvantage do not make confidence or co-operation or strength or stability; they make deference, they make division, they make weakness, yes, and they make conflict too.  When tension, division, distrust, racism and idleness are ignited by hopelessness, all of those policies of fear and neglect create chaos in our society and on our streets.I say that we cannot afford to be ruled by a government that does nothing to combat that lethal mixture of stagnation and strife.  We could not afford it at any time, but least of all can we afford it now, when our society must change or decay.  We are in that time now, and there must be a better way to face those challenges, those alternatives, than the way that is shown by the Government of Margaret Thatcher.I believe I know that in this party we do have that better way.  I believe we have it because we have the values, the perceptions and the policies that come from democratic socialism.  We have the combination of idealism, which stops us throwing in the towel and giving in to he defeatism of toryism, and the realism which makes us buckle down to finding and implementing the answers.  That is the essence of what we believe in.  That is the combination of idealism and realism that this country needs now.  I say to this movement and I say to the country: that combination is more necessary than ever before.We live in a time of rapidly and radically changing technology.  We live at a time of shifts in the whole structure of the world economy; we live at a time of new needs among the peoples of the world and new aspirations among young people and among women \u2013 late but welcome new aspirations among half of humankind.  In the light of those changes, we need governing policies in this country that can gain change by consent.  That will not come from government that bullies and dictates.  It will not come from a government that evades changed and dodges the real issues.  Change by consent can only be fostered by a government that will deliberately help people to cope with, handle and manage that change.  That is the task for us \u2013 to promote change in such a way that it advances the people, all of the people.Change cannot be left to chance.  If it is left to chance, it becomes malicious, it creates terrible victims.  It has done so generation in, generation out.  Change has to be organised.  It has to be shaped to the benefit of a society, deliberately, by those who have democratic power in that society; and the democratic instrument of the people who exist for that purpose is the state \u2013 yes, the state.  To us that means a particular kind of state \u2013 an opportunity state, which exists to assist in nourishing talent and rewarding merit; a productive state, which exists to encourage investment and to help expand output; an enabling state, which is at the disposal of the people instead of being dominant over the people.  In a word, we want a servant state, which respects those who work for it and reminds them that they work for the people of the country, a state which will give support to the voluntary efforts of those who, in their own time and from their own inspiration, will help the old, the sick, the needy, the young, the ill-housed and the hopeless.We are democratic socialists.  We want to put the state where it belongs in a democracy \u2013 under the feet of the people, not over the heads of the people.  That is where the state belongs in a democracy.  (Applause) It means the collective contribution of the community for the purpose of individual liberty throughout the community; of individual freedom which is not nominal but real; of freedom which can be exercised in practice because school is good, because the hospital is there, because the training is accessible, because the alternative work is available, because the law is fair, because the streets are safe \u2013 real freedoms, real choices, real chances, and, going with them, the real opportunity to meet responsibilities.  It is not a state doing things instead of people who could do those things better; it is not a state replacing families or usurping enterprise or displacing initiative or smothering individualism. It is the absolute opposite: it is a servant state doing things that institutions \u2013 big institutions, rich institutions, corporate institutions, rich, strong people \u2013 will not do, have not done, with anything like the speed or in anything like the scale that is necessary to bring change with consent in our society.  That kind of state is the state that we seek under democratic control.It cannot be done with brutality and it cannot be done with blandness either.  That is why the Social Democrats and the Liberals are utterly useless for the purpose of securing change with consent.  (Applause) They are in Polo politics \u2013 smooth and firm on the outside and absolutely nothing on the inside.  (Applause) They do not really do anything or say anything to address the real problems.  They have just had a fortnight of conferences, most of which they spent talking about themselves and having a sort of a seminar about which David was going to play second fiddle, because we all know which David is going to play first trumpet, don\u2019t we? (Laughter and applause) They cannot be the enablers, for while there are doubtlessly people in their ranks who seek the decent ends of opportunity and production, there is no one there who will commit the means to secure those ends of opportunity and production.  That is in the nature of the attitude that they have.On top of all that in any case all of their aims for the next election are geared to one objective \u2013 a permanent, vested interest in instability, a hung Parliament, in which they can be the self-important arbiters of power.  That would be contemptible at any time, but at a time when the Government is going to have to get on immediately, urgently, emergently with the task of generating jobs and investment, a strategy which is intent upon horse trading, juggling, balancing and ego flattering is totally contemptible, and the British people should know that.  (Applause)The Tories meanwhile do not desire enabling ends and plainly will not commit enabling means.  In every policy of the Tory government they have shown that their objective is to reduce what we have of an enabling state, what we have of a welfare state, to a rubble of shabby services and lost jobs.  Of course they tell us they are not real jobs.  Teachers, doctors, nurses, home helps, ancillaries in the schools and in the hospitals, ambulance drivers \u2013 they are not real jobs, that is what the Tories tell us.  We know they are real jobs.  We know they are real jobs because if those jobs are not done, if people are not allowed to do them, the consequent is real pain, real loss of opportunity, real suffering, real misery, yes, and real costs too.  That is why they are real jobs, as real as life and death.We see the Tories\u2019 attitude towards enabling people in the education cuts; we see it in the closure of skill centres and training boards; we see it in the reduction in apprenticeships; we see it in the attempted withdrawal of board and lodging allowances to unemployed youngsters and to the chronically sick who need residences.  (Applause) Above all, we now see the Government\u2019s attitude towards enabling in the proposals made by Norman Fowler in his social security review, which you debated this morning; \u2018social security review\u2019 \u2013 it would more appropriately be called social insecurity for you and you and you and you.  Everybody in this country is going to be disadvantaged if they ever get the chance to implement those policies fully.In the Labour party we are fighting, and we will go on fighting, those poor law proposals, and as part of that fight early next year we will launch Labour\u2019s freedom and fairness campaign to put the issues to the British people, to give them our alternatives and to show that once again we have real policies for hope to put in place of fear, which is the only Tory policy.  Of course hope is cheap; attractive, delightful, but cheap.  Help costs money.  So in the course of that fight and in our policies for construction and care we have to take full account of the breadth and depth of the ruin made by the policies of eight or maybe even, by then, nine years of applied Thatcherism. The extent of that ruin is awful.  Last Wednesday the Association of British Chambers of Commerce reported:\u2018Our shrinking manufacturing base and deteriorating trade performance raises a fundamental question about the future of the British economy.  How do we pay our way in the world when the oil trade surplus, at present a huge £11.5 thousand million, begins to disappear in the late 1980s.  Answers to these questions from economic ministers and senior civil servants have been unsatisfactory.\u2019Comrades, in the last six years, alone among the major industrial nations, manufacturing production in Britain has actually fallen by 8 per cent; investment in manufacturing production has fallen by 20 per cent; manufactured trade has moved from a surplus of £4,000 million in the last year of the Labour government to a deficit of £4,000 million in the sixth year of the Tory government.  In the years since 1979 our economic strength has been eaten away just as surely as if we had been engaged in a war \u2013 I put it to this party, I put it to the country, not as a defence, not in any defensive sense whatsoever, but as a salutary fact of life.  The Tories have been the party and the government of destruction.  If we are to rebuild and recover in this country, this Labour Party must be the party of production.  That is where our future lies.  (Applause) It is not a new role for us, but it does require a fresh and vigorous reassertion.Over the years our enemies and critics \u2013 yes, and a few of our friends as well \u2013 have given us the reputation of being a party that is solely concerned with redistribution, of being a party much more concerned about the allocation of wealth than the creation of wealth.  It was not true; it is not true; it never has been and all our history shows that \u2013 from the great industrial development and nationalisation Acts of the Attlee Government, which gave this country a post-war industrial basis, through to the Wilson Government\u2019s investment schemes and initiatives that brought new life to where I come from, to South Wales, to Scotland, to the North-East, to Merseyside to the new towns of the South-East, right through to the actions of t hest Labour Government, which ensured that at least we retained a British computer industry, a British motor industry, a machine tool industry, a shipbuilding industry.  We have a long record and need give no apology for being the party of production.Now in the 1980s we face new challenges in our determination that our country shall produce its way out of slump.  There is the challenge of the hi-tech industries, which six years ago had a surplus with the rest of the world and now run a £2.3 billion deficit with the rest of the world, as a result of deliberately depressed demand, withdrawal of research and development and expensive money \u2013 the policies of the Tory Government.  We have challenges too from the traditional industries, those industries dismissed, written off, by a Tory government that calls them \u2018smoke-stack\u2019 industries and really think s that Britain\u2019s future is as a warehouse, a tourist trap, with nothing to export but our capital.  That is the vision they have of the future \u2013 totally impractical, ruinous, not only for our generation but for all those to come.Through our Jobs in Industry campaign, in all our policies, we in this party say to the British people: Britain has made it, Britain can make it and, provided that we give to e workers, the managers, the technicians, the people of Britain the means to make it, Britain will make it in the future if we have a Labour government.  (Applause) Those means that they must have at their disposal are training, research and development, and finance for investment over periods and at prices that producers can and will afford.  That is absolutely crucial. Other countries do it, and nobody has yet explained satisfactorily to me how it can be, why it should be, that we have a government and a financial system that believe that Britain can\u2019t do it, Britain can\u2019 make it and in any case Britain shouldn\u2019t make it in the future.  We cannot afford that surrender mentality from government.  We have got to have a government like those of Japan, Germany, Sweden, France and Italy, which put the real interests of their country first.  They don\u2019t talk about competing in the world economy as if it is a game of cricket.  They talk about competing and they mean it, so they put their money where their speeches are.I am not saying that an economy can revive and thrive only with government; I am saying that it is a fact of life in a modern economy that there can\u2019t be any real progress while the policies of a government lie like a great stone across the path of productive manufacturing advance.  I am not saying that it can only be done with government; I am saying that the fact of life is that we will not revive and thrive without the active support, involvement, participation of government.To all those defeatists, the real moaning Minnies of Britain, who say: \u2018That\u2019s all very well, but British workers won\u2019t respond, British managers won\u2019t respond\u2019, I say: go to the industries in Britain where modernisation has taken place, some of them foreign-owned, and see how, when people have the means, they can stand their corner with any competing industry in the world.  I say too to them: go to where, in Labour local authorities, enterprise boards have been established, bringing together public capital and private capital, bringing together people with common objectives, and see how they succeed in measurement by anybody\u2019s terms.  Go and see, where people get the chance, how they take that chance, how they use it, how they use money to make production, how they spend some to make some, how they are determined to make modern things for modern markets, and do it successfully \u2013 from handicrafts right across to the frontier technologies.We won\u2019t accept the defeatism, the surrender mentality.  That is why the first priority as the next government of Britain will be to invest in Britain.  It has been obvious for decades and disastrously clear since the Thatcher Government took away controls on the export of capital six years ago at Britain is a grossly under-invested country.  There is less excuse for that now than ever.  The Tories have had more oil money in every month that they have been in government than Jim Callaghan\u2019s government had in a whole year of government.  (Applause) They have spent that money on sustaining unemployment, and even as the oil money poured out on that unemployment, even as it poured in to the Exchequer, the investment money poured out of the British economy altogether.In the last six years, over £60,000 million of investment capital has left Britain.  We need that money \u2013 not the Labour Party or the Labour Government: Britain needs that money, if we are to rebuild.  (Applause) That is why we are going to establish our scheme to bring the funds back home where they are needed, so that they can be used for generating employment, development and growth in our economy.  We are going to use those funds for long-term loans for the purchase of modern machinery, for research and development, for training.  We will ensure that the return paid is comparable to what can be got elsewhere, but the difference will be this: those resources will be here, for the process of investment, for the purpose of creating wealth, for the purpose most of all of generating jobs here in Britain.We don\u2019t make those arguments for getting and using that money out of any jingoistic or nationalistic motive.  What we say is this: we need those policies for we simply cannot afford the level of charity shown by the moneyhandlers of Britain towards our advanced industrial competitors.  That charity is too expensive for this country to tolerate any longer.  We need that money.  We need the money to be able to produce; we need the money to be able to generate those jobs, further development, new investment; we need that wealth to reward people for their effort, for their enterprise; and we need that money and the wealth that it generates to provide the means of properly funding the system of justice and opportunity and care which I call the enabling state.We need that money to make our way in the world, but there are other ways too in which we must make our way in the world.  We must make our way morally as well as economically.  For us as democratic socialists there can be no retreat from our duties as citizens of the world.  We don\u2019t want to be the worlds policemen, we don\u2019t want to pretend that we are the world\u2019s pastor either, but we must be the friends of freedom; and as people who believe that the great privilege of strength, the great privilege of being strong, is the power which it gives to be able to help people who are not strong, we understand where our obligations are in this world.If the morality won\u2019t convince people, if the ethics won\u2019t convince people, let the practicalities \u2013 the material practicalities \u2013 convince them.  In this world now we either live together or we decay separately.  It is in our material interest to ensure that the supplicants of the Third World are turned into customers and consumers by relieving them of the terrible burdens of interest, by the effectiveness of our aid policies and by assisting in their development.  (Applause) That is a clinical fact stripped of all emotion, and I use it to persuade the falterers.  But even to them I say that if you had come with me this year to see the different levels of need in the barrios of Managua and the shambas of Tanzania, in the desert settlements of Kenya and, most of all, in the back streets of Addis Ababa \u2013 for I have never seen such destitution \u2013 I would not have to tickle you with profit.  If you had seen and touched and felt and smelt, you would know where your duty as free people, as people with money, as people with power and strength, really lies in this world.  (Applause) I say to those people that they would want to do all they could to give life and to help people make a life for themselves.  They would.  That is what the British people showed just on the basis of television pictures, even without the touch on the skin of a starving child.  The British people showed it and will go on showing that they feel that putting food in people\u2019s stomachs and putting clothes on people\u2019s backs and putting roofs over people\u2019s heads is our place in the world; and, even more than that, they show they understand that helping people to provide the means to grow their food, to make their clothes, to find their freedom, is our place in the world in this democracy.  (Applause)Just as it is the duty, the privilege, of the strong to help the weak, so it is the duty of the free to help those across this planet who are oppressed because of their beliefs, the colour of their skin, their sex, their poverty, their powerlessness, their principles.  We reach out to them, for we must be the friends of those who are oppressed, those who are made captives in their own lands, in our efforts, right throughout this movement, some announced, some more subtle, to secure the release of refuseniks and so-called dissidents in the Soviet Union, in our support for Solidarnosc, in our aid for the democrats of Chile, in our backing, our solidarity, with the democratically elected government of the Republic of Nicaragua.  (Applause) We stand with them.  In all those and in many other ways, in our support for the United Nations, we know that for us as free people freedom can have no boundaries.Comrades, the Government doesn\u2019t know that.  Britain should not have to be dragged, fumbling, stumbling and mumbling, into imposing even the most nominal economic sanctions against apartheid South Africa.  (Applause) We should be leading opinion, out of pride in our own liberty and out of the practical knowledge, as we in this movement have counselled for years, that there is only one plausible way that stands the remotest chance of securing peaceful change in South Africa, and that is by the strong imposing of effective economic sanctions against apartheid.  Now, when South African businessmen sensibly confer with leaders of the African National Congress, when the United Democratic Front grows bold in its demands for freedom in South Africa and when even the President of the United States of America is obliged to impose embargoes on the apartheid regime, the British government\u2019s excuses and alibis become more lame, more pathetic, more contemptible by the day.Next month is the Commonwealth Heads of Government Conference.  Britain will be stranded, isolated amongst that Commonwealth of nations \u2013 rich nations, poor nations, black nations, white nations, north and south \u2013 as the only nation that shows any degree of friendship towards apartheid South Africa.  We should be taking our place in the world properly, with the Australians, the New Zealanders, the Canadians, and the Zambians, the Tanzanians and those who at the front line have made the most monstrous sacrifices in order to sustain what pressure they can on South Africa.  (Applause)In taking our proper place in the modern world, rid of all the vanities, the nostalgia for a past whose glory missed most of our people, it is essential that we strip ourselves of illusions; most important, that we strip ourselves of the illusions of nuclear grandeur.  (Applause) Not my phrase \u2013 nuclear grandeur, the illusions.  That phrase belongs to Field Marshall Lord Carver, former Chief of the Defence Staff.  In June he said to the House of Lords:\u2018Why do the Government obstinately persist in wasting money on a so-called British independent deterrent?  \u2026Our ballistic missiles submarines are not an essential element of NATO\u2019s strategy.  Whether they are regarded as an addition to the force assigned to the Supreme Allied Commander Europe or as an independent force, they are superfluous and a waste of money.  The essential element is the stationing of United States conventional land and air forces on the Continent; and, in order to persuade the American people that it is right, proper and in their own interests that they should continue to [contribute to the defence of Western Europe], it is essential that we and our fellow-European members of NATO should convince them that we are using our money and manpower effectively to maintain \u2026 the capability of our conventional forces \u2026 That, my Lords, is the first priority of our defence policy, not illusions of nuclear grandeur.\u2019I don\u2019t suppose I agree with Field Marshall Lord Carver about everything, but that was a very effective way, from a very effective spokesman, of demonstrating the insanity, the waste, the illusion of Tory Party policy, and demonstrating too the reality and necessity of our complete non-nuclear defence policy to maintain the proper security of our country and alliance.  (Applause) That is our policy, our commitment to the British people, and we will honour it in full.We want to honour our undertakings in full in every area of policy.  We want to say what we mean and mean what we say.  We want to keep our promises, and because we want to do that it is essential that we don\u2019t make false promises.  (Applause) That is why we must not casually make promises that are so fanciful, so self-indulgent, so exaggerated that they can be completely falsified by the realities in which we live and the realities that we know we shall encounter.  If we do not take that view, if we do make false promises, we shall lose integrity, we shall demonstrate immaturity, we will not convince the people.Comrades, 463 resolutions have been submitted to this Conference on policy issues, committed honestly, earnestly, and a lot of thought has gone into them.  Of those 463, 300 refer to something called the next Labour Government and they refer to what they want that next Labour Government to do.  I want to take on many of those commitments.  I want to meet many of those demands.  I want to respond to many of those calls, in practice \u2013 not in words, but in actions. But there is of course a pre-condition to honouring those or any other undertaking that we give.  That pre-condition is unavoidable, total and insurmountable, and it is a pre-condition that in this movement we do not want to surmount.  It is the pre-condition that we win a general election.  (Applause) There is absolutely no other way to put any of those policies into effect.  The only way to restore, the only way to rebuild, the only way to reinstate, the only way to help the poor, to help the unemployed, to help the victimised, is to get the support of those who are not poor, not unemployed, not victimised who support our view.  (Applause) That means, comrades, reaching out to them and showing them that we are at one with their decent values and aims, that we are with their hopes for their children, with their needs, with their ideals of justice, improvement and prosperity in the future.There are some in our movement who, when I say that we must reach out in that fashion, accuse me of an obsession with electoral politics; there are some who, when I say we must reach out and make a broader appeal to those who only have their labour to sell, who are part of the working classes \u2013 no doubt about their credentials \u2013 say that I am too preoccupied with winning; there are some who say, when I reach out like that and in the course of seeking that objective, that I am prepared to compromise values.  I say to them and I say to everybody else, and I mean it from the depths of my soul: there is no need to compromise values, there is no need in this task to surrender our socialism, there is no need to abandon or even try to hide any of our principles, but there is an implacable need to win and there is an equal need for us to understand that we address an electorate which is sceptical, an electorate which needs convincing, a British public who want to know that our idealism is not lunacy, our realism is not timidity, our eagerness is not extremism, a British public who want to know that our carefulness too is not nervousness.I speak to you, to this Conference.  People say that leaders speak to the television cameras.  All right, we have got some eavesdroppers.  But my belief has always been this, and I act upon it and will always act upon it.  I come here to this Conference primarily, above all, to speak to this movement at its Conference. I say to you at this Conference, the best place for me to say anything, that I will tell you what you already know, although some may need reminding.  I remind you, every one of you, of something that every single one of you said in the desperate days before June 9, 1983.  You said to each other on the streets, you said to each other in the cars rushing round, you said to each other in the committee rooms: elections are not won in weeks, they are won in years.  (Applause) That is what you said to each other.  That is what you have got to remember: not in future weeks or future years; this year, this week, this Conference, now \u2013 this is where we start winning elections, not waiting until the returning officer is ready.Secondly, something else you know.  If Socialism is to be successful in this country, it must relate to the practical needs and the mental and moral traditions of the men and women of this country.  We must emphasise what we have in common with those people who are our neighbours, workmates and fellow countrymen and women \u2013 and we have everything in common with them \u2013 in a way we could not do if we were remote, if, like the Tories, we were in orbit around the realities of our society, if, like the Social Democrats and the Liberals, we stood off from those realities, retreated from them, deserted them.  But we are of, from, for the people.  That is our identity, that is our commitment, that is how much we have in common with the people.  Let us emphasise that, let us demonstrate it, let us not hide it away as if it was something extraordinary or evidence of reaction.  Let us emphasise what we have in common with the people of this country.We must not dogmatise or browbeat.  We have got to reason with people; we have got to persuade people.  That is their due.  We have voluntarily, every one of us, joined a political party.  We wish a lot more people would come and join us, help us, give us their counsel, their energies, their advice, broaden our participation.  But in making the choice to join a political party we took a decision, and it was that, by persuasion, we hoped that we could bring more people with us.  So that is the basis on which we have got to act, want to act.Thirdly, something else you know.  There is anger in this country at the devastation brought about by these last six years of Tory government, but strangely that anger is mixed with despair, a feeling that the problems are just too great, too complex, to be dealt with by any government or any policy.  That feeling is abroad.  We disagree with it, we contend it, we try to give people the rational alternatives, but it exists.  If our response to that despair, anger and confusion amounts to little more than slogans, if we give the impression to the British people that we believe that we can just make a loud noise and the Tory walls of Jericho will fall down, they are not going to treat us very seriously at all \u2013 and we won\u2019t deserve to be treated very seriously.Fourthly, I shall tell you again what you know.  Because you are from the people, because you are of the people, because you live with the same realities as everybody else lives with, implausible promises don\u2019t win victories.  I\u2019ll tell you what happens with impossible promises.  You start with far-fetched resolutions.  They are then pickled into a rigid dogma, a code, and you go through the years sticking to that, out-dated, mis-placed, irrelevant to the real needs, and you end up in the grotesque chaos of a Labour council hiring taxis to scuttle round a city handing out redundancy notices to its own workers.  (Applause) I am telling you, no matter how entertaining, how fulfilling to short-term egos \u2013 (Continuing applause) \u2013 you can\u2019t play politics with people\u2019s jobs and with people\u2019s services or with their homes.  (Applause and some boos) Comrades, the voice of the people \u2013 not the people here; the voice of the real people with real needs \u2013 is louder than all the boos that can be assembled.  Understand that, please, comrades.  In your socialism, in your commitment to those people, understand it.  The people will not, cannot, abide posturing.  They cannot respect the gesture-generals or the tendency-tacticians.Comrades, it seems to me lately that some of our number become like latter-day public school-boys.  It seems it matters not whether you won or lost, but how you played the game.  (Applause) We cannot take that inspiration from Rudyard Kipling.  (Continuing applause) Those game players get isolated, hammered, blocked off.  They might try to blame others \u2013 workers, trade unions, some other leadership, the people of the city \u2013 for not showing sufficient revolutionary consciousness, always somebody else, and then they claim a rampant victory.  Whose victory?  Not victory for the people, not victory for them.  I see the casualties; we all see the casualties.  They are not to be found amongst the leaders and some of the enthusiasts; they are to be found amongst the people whose jobs are destroyed, whose services are crushed, whose living standards are pushed down to deeper depths of insecurity and misery.  (Applause) Comrades, these are vile times under this Tory Government for local democracy, and we have got to secure power to restore real local democracy.But I look around this country and I see Labour councils, I see socialists, as good as any other socialists, who fought the good fight and who, at he point when they thought they might jeopardise people\u2019s jobs and people\u2019s services, had the intelligence, yes, and the courage to adopt a different course.  They truly put jobs and services first before other considerations.  (Applause) They had to make hellish choices.  I understand it.  You must agonise with them in the choices they had to make \u2013 very unpalatable, totally undesirable, but they did it.  They found ways.  They used all their creativity to find ways that would best protect those whom they employed and those whom they were elected to defend.  Those people are leaders prepared to take decisions, to meet obligations, to giver service.  They know life is real, life is earnest \u2013 too real, too earnest to mistake a Conference Resolution for an accomplished fact; too real, too earnest to mistake a slogan for a strategy; too real, too earnest to allow them to mistake their own individual enthusiasm for mass movement; too real, too earnest to mistake barking for biting.  I hope that becomes universal too.  (Applause)Comrades, I offer you this counsel.  The victory of socialism, said a great socialist, does not have to be complete to be convincing.  I have no time, he went on, for those who appear to threaten the whole of private property but who in practice would threaten nothing; they are purists and therefore barren.  Not the words of some hypnotised moderate, not some petrified pragmatist, but Aneurin Bevan in 1950 at the height of his socialist vision and his radical power and conviction.  (Applause) There are some who will say that power and principle are somehow in conflict.  Those people who think that power and principle are in conflict only demonstrate the superficiality, the shallowness, of their own socialist convictions; for whilst they are bold enough to preach those convictions in little coteries, they do not have the depth of conviction to subject those convictions, those beliefs, that analysis, to the real test of putting them into operation in power.There is no collision between principle and power.  For us as democratic socialists the two must go together, like a rich vein that passes through everything that we believe in, everything that we try to do, everything that we will implement.  Principle and power, conviction and accomplishment, going together.  We know that power without principle is ruthless and vicious, and hollow and sour.  We know that principle without power is naïve, idle sterility.  That is useless \u2013 useless to us, useless to the British people to overcome their travails, useless for our purpose of changing society as democratic socialists.  I tell you that now.  It is what I have always said, it is what I shall go on saying, because it is what I said to you at the very moment that I was elected leader.I say to you in complete honesty, because this is the movement that I belong to, that I owe this party everything I have got \u2013 not the job, not being leader of the Labour Party, but every life chance that I have had since the time I was a child: (Applause) the life chance of a comfortable home, with working parents, people who had jobs; the life chance of moving out of a pest and damp-infested set of rooms into a decent home, built by a Labour council under a Labour Government; the life chance of an education that went on for as long as I wanted to take it.  Me and millions of others of my generation got all their chances from this movement.  (Applause) That is why I say that this movement, its values, its policies, applied in power, gave me everything that I have got \u2013 me and millions like me of my generation and succeeding generations.  That is why it is my duty to be honest and that is why it is our function, our mission, our duty \u2013 all of us \u2013 to see that those life chances exist and are enriched and extended to millions more, who without us will never get the chance of fulfilling themselves.  (Applause) That is why we have got to win, that is what I have always believed and that is what I put to you at the very moment that I was elected.In 1983 I said to this Conference \u2018We have to win.  We must not permit any purpose to be superior for the Labour movement to that purpose.\u2019  I still believe it.  I will go on saying it until we achieve that victory and I shall live with the consequences, which I know, if this movement is with me, will be victory \u2013 victory with our policies intact, no sell-outs, provided that we put nothing before the objective of explaining ourselves and reasoning with the people of this country.  We will get that victory with our policies, our principles, intact.  I know it can be done.  Reason tells me it can be done.  The people throughout this movement, who I know in huge majority share all these perceptions and visions and want to give all their energies, they know it can be done.  (Applause) Realism tells me it can be done, and the plain realities and needs of our country tell me it must be done.  We have got to win, not for our sakes, but really, truly to deliver the British people from evil.  Let\u2019s do it.  (Standing ovation)Thank you, comrades.  Everybody has got the message: we\u2019re not the Liberals or the Tories. Thank you very much.  (Applause)

aVNeville, comrades, I always get a little nervous, even though I am immensely gratified by a reception like that, because I am always afraid that those who commentate on the things will add together the minute before and the two minutes after and decided that I did not get as much as David Steel.Neville, following the act that we have just had from Winnie and from Aubrey only adds an additional 150 per cent to this task. Winnie, a peacemonger, Aubrey, the first maker of jams I have met today that I actually like. (Laughter)We are meeting, Comrades, in the autumn of this eighth year of Thatcherism - 90 months of Maggie, 90 months in which our society has become more divided than at any time since the second world war, 90 months in which our industry has been devastated as never before, in which our economy has been weakened as never before; and still, after all that, the Prime Minister says that she seeks an other term. Well, she is not going to have another term. (Applause) We and the British people together will definitely see to that. And not all of the creative genius of Mr Jeffrey Archer or the sweetness and sourness of Mrs. Edwina Currie can change that course of events. Not even the Chairman of the Conservative Party, Norman Tebbit, Mr. Punch set to control all the puppets, can change that course of history, for all his scare tactics, which are such proof of a scared party that he chairs.We have had those years of Thatcherism and we are also, of course, in the sixth year of the coagulation of the Liberals and the Social Democratic Party. At last David Steel and David Owen are finding out that it takes more than fishing trips and Edinburgh Festival visits and French leave to make either a policy or a party. And if they did not know before, they cer­tainly know now, after a Liberal gathering last week which will long be remembered as the Assembly which put the lie in Alliance. (Laughter and applause)It should not really have come as such a surprise that they voted as they did on defence, on civil nuclear power and on many other things. They did after all have the inspirational experience of being addressed by Dr. Owen at their very first session of the Assembly. To be fair to Dr. Owen, he is unique. He wanted to dominate the Labour Party. He failed in that. He is trying to dominate the Liberal Party. He is going to fail in that too. They do tell me that some Conservatives fancy an association with Dr. Owen. I think he ought to carry a political health warning to political par­ties. (Laughter) In any case, the Conservatives should be cautious. After Mrs. Thatcher, once bitten, twice shy.As the Tories fade and as the Liberals and Social Democrats falter, this party - our party - is entering its fourth year of recovery and of advance. That recovery has been worked for by people right across the movement, in every part of the movement. In the local authorities where people have had to endure the most crushing pressures and have still fought their way through, in the trade union movement, which has been subject to incessant attacks from every quarter, from unemployment, from the courts, from the prejudice made statute that is so much part of the Tory codes against free trade unionism in this country.It has been fought for and worked for too by rank and file members right through this party, who have worked as never before to get our mes­sage of jobs and justice to the British people with an effectiveness that we have never shown before.We have been making that recovery through a unity of purpose with­out which all else would have been absolutely impossible. We have been making that recovery by listening to people, by heeding people, and not straggling behind the lowest pace of opinion, but never wandering away from the main trail either, so far as to lose sight of the main thread of pub­lic opinion.We have made the recovery also, in this democratic socialist party, by ensuring that we sustain both our democracy and our socialism. We have not done it in an authoritarian manner. We have done it because we could not allow our democracy to be distorted, we could not allow our generos­ity to be abused in this democratic socialist party. (Applause) We have done it by natural justice to them and, yes, we have done justice to our­selves. In all of that, we have earned new strength by hard work, by effort.But of course there is more to do. There always is more to do. First, there is no feeling of satisfaction, no threshold of support on which we will rest contented.It is a fond presumption among a few pundits that we hide ourselves away and do fancy arithmetic to find out what neat arrangement of Tory and Liberal and Social Democratic support will give us the highest number of seats with the lowest number of votes. Well, I can tell them we don\u2019t do that. We are not in that dangerous game; in fact we are not in a game at all. We are in the serious and sustained task of convincing more people, of putting our ideas and our policies and of persuading people to our view. That is the way in which we search for power, not by some roll of the dice, but on the basis of the effort that we are prepared to make to gain the mandate in this democracy. We will go on doing that and we will go on gaining and keeping support from everyone who is prepared to hear our message, everyone who is prepared to give us the democratic chance to show just what we can do.We have seen of course what others do. We have seen their seven sav­age years; we have seen what they have done to our country. Given declining unemployment in 1979, they have increased it by over 2 mil­lion. Given restored manufacturing investment in 1979, they have cut investment and destroyed capacity so that manufacturing investment is still 20 per cent below the level that it was when they took over. Given a working body of manufacturing industry in 1979, they have lopped off whole limbs of manufacturing industry. Given a stable world trade posi­tion in 1979, they have lost 22 per cent of our share of world trade. Given the fantastic bonus of £50,000 million of oil revenues, they have blown it - wasted it - on the massive bills caused by the unemployment which their policies have generated.That and much more - so much more - makes them a government unfit to govern. They are rulers who, in Percy Shelley\u2019s words, \u2018neither see nor feel nor know, but leechlike to their fainting country cling.\u2019 Leechlike they have increased interest rates and the tax burdens leechlike they have allowed the drain-off of investment capital from this investment-hungry country.Those rulers, who neither see nor feel nor know, have cut house-building, training, research and development, the Health Service, education. And these are not just attacks on institutions; these are direct attacks on individuals and their liberties, families and their needs. That is what those rules have been doing in their blindness, their stupidity, their malice, in the past seven years. (Applause) And all the time they have been doing that we have heard these strident homilies about Victorian values and about morality. Homilies on the virtues on self-reliance, when mil­lions would like nothing more than to have the rudimentary means to be self-reliant. Homilies on the virtues of thrift, when families in poverty are constantly humiliated as they try to clothe and feed themselves and their children. Homilies on the virtues of responsibility, when the right of those who care for old and sick and disabled loved ones are secured only by the interventions of the European Court, and even then what is given with one hand by the judgment of the court is taken away with the other by a government that denies resources to the carers of this country (Applause)Mrs. Thatcher says that her policies start with the freedom and well being of the family. When there are 6 million people in this country now so impoverished that they cannot even afford essential items of clothing, when they are 2 million children living in families dependent on supplementary benefit, when one in four families in Britain is living in sub-standard housing, when thousands of homeless families are condemned to the appalling conditions of bed and breakfast accommodation, the Prime Minister lecturers the family, lecturers the country, on morality.And she has a sort of clone now as Under-Secretary of State for Health Service, who recommended but last week that a high-fibre diet should replace the National Health Service. It reminded me of the Tory lady who in the depression was generous enough to give lectures to families of the unemployed on what nourishing soup they could make with fish-heads, until one woman in the front said, \u2018That\u2019s very nice, my lady, but could you tell us who has the rest of the fish?\u2019 (Applause)We get the lectures on morality when the Silentnight Company, when British Coal, when News International desert their basic obligations to those people who have given them faithful years of service. It is the people outside who are lectured on morality and never those who sit in the office inside. (Applause)I suppose that the pious sermons and self-righteous homilies from Mrs. Thatcher and Mr. Tebbit are easier than facing the real problems, answering the real questions, and there are plenty of those, plenty those real moral questions.When it is so obvious that a drugs plague endangers young people in our country, why get rid of one in 9 customs officers, why sack 900 customs officers, whose job it is to restrain the importation of drugs? (Applause)Another question: when it is so obvious that dark streets and labyrinthine housing estates and insecure doors and windows give such freedom to criminals and such terror to people, especially old people, why not invest in repairs and in strengthening and lighting those streets, so that people can enjoy real security and the criminals can be defeated? (Applause)When violence is such a terrible menace, especially violence against women, why can\u2019t the laws against beating the abuse that already exist be fully and rigorously enacted and enforced in this country? Why can\u2019t that be the case, so that we can free victims from the perpetual fear of the returning brutal husband, so that the guilty can be punished or treated for whatever sickness it is makes a man hit a woman? We will see that those laws are enforced. We will make the investments in security. We will see that the customs officers are there as part of the partnership against the drug menace.There are other areas too where there are moral questions. When it is clear that thousands of lives could be saved and terrible anxiety and pain relieved by an effective system of cervical cancer screening, by an increase in the treatment of kidney ailments, by the maintenance of med­ical research, why close down the cervical and breast cancer screening facilities? Why make cuts which prevent dialysis and treatment?Why impose reductions that terminate research programmes and send some of our best young scientists abroad to work in other countries, away from our land, when it is obvious that death rates, mental and physical sickness rates, suicide and family breakdown rates are all much higher amongst the unemployed than they are amongst the employed? Why not fight unemployment as we will instead of simply saying that it is disap­pointing or one of the two great mysteries of our time, as Mrs. Thatcher does?These people, these Tories, dress up the get-rich-quick society as the opportunity society. They continually represent arrogance and aggression as the only truth of strength. They have dedicated every policy to making the very rich richer and the poor poorer. They flaunt the commercial paradise before the young people of this country, but with unemploy­ment and insecurity at a mass level among the young of this country they inflict a purgatory on the young who have been promised so much. (Applause) With their 40p pensions rise and their cuts in concessionary fares, community care and housing and benefits they daily - these moralists - preach the commandant that teaches us \u2018Honour thy father and thy mother.\u2019 That is the morality of this government.I look at all that and I ask myself, \u2018Just where do they get their idea of morality?\u2019, and the British people ask the same question. There is a great grouping in our society which opposes the malice and the meanness of Toryism. There is a huge number which abominates the dual standards and the double-talk sermons. There is in this country - there always has been; there always will be - a moral majority. It is not a narrow, bigoted, self-righteous grouping; it is a broadminded and compassionate group­ing of people. That majority is not sentimental, for it knows that senti­ment is very cheap. That majority is realistic too, for it knows that if its morality is to have tactical effect it must be backed by the material provi­sion provided in justice.We as democratic socialists make our appeal to that moral majority. It does not expect politicians to deliver heaven on earth. It does expect politicians to work to stop hell on earth. That is what the moral majority demands in this country. (Applause)Party of that majority would consider themselves well blessed if they had just a roof over their head, if they had a job to go to, if they knew that the colour of their skin inflicted no extra disadvantage on them. They would feel well blessed if they did not have to fear electricity or gas bills with all the tortuous anxiety of poverty. If they could afford a pair of shoes for the children without being fearful of an economic crisis in the family, they would consider themselves to be well blessed.Of course, there are millions who do not live in that condition of pen­ury and many of those - I meet them - are not themselves impoverished or insecure. But they still say to me, \u2018We are not badly off, but we can\u2019t get our Mam into hospital\u2019; \u2018We are not badly off, but with two younger children at home we just haven\u2019t got the room to accept the daughter and the son-in-law. They can\u2019t come and live with us\u2019; \u2018We are not badly off, I am working, my husband is working, but our 20-year-old has never had a job and our 16-year-old is leaving school this year and doesn\u2019t know where to start looking for a job\u2019 - people in security them­selves but surrounded by all the evidence and all the pressures of insec­urity which comes over their own doorsteps.There are millions too who are not even affected at that range by the problems, but who consider that we need a government which will try to use policies which begin to attend to those material needs and fulfil those moral obligations. They want a government which does not preach the pious sermons of Maggie\u2019s morality but practises the policies of provi­sion. They want a government which will back up its morality by policies, by determined effort to operate policies of investment, of production, of growth, of employment.We, indeed only we, will provide that government for Britain, and in doing that we will be guided by four basic facts of our condition.First, there is no prospect of a sustainable reduction in unemploymentin this country unless we can attain stable, long-term economic growth.Secondly, there is no possibility of long-term growth and resilient prosperity for the British economy without a major development of British manufacturing industry.Thirdly, the length of our relative economic decline and the way in which it has deteriorated and has been accelerated and intensified in the last seven years presents our country with a new set of strategic problems to which there must be a new set of strategic answers.Fourthly none of the major social, commercial, industrial or employ­ment problems that we face is self-correcting. The market will not look after those problems; it can only worsen those problems. (Applause) If they are to be overcome, systematic planned action must be taken by gov­ernment, and it must be taken in concert with all the participants in the economy, to construct the framework of the educational, economic, tech­nical and social condition within which this economy can thrive again.We have to operate on a new agenda and we need new instruments, new policies, for that strategic change. We have to combat slump now and simultaneously foster the structure of change necessary to stop and to reverse the long-term deficiencies and decline which pre-date even Mrs. Thatcher's rule.On that new agenda is our new two-year programme to combat unemployment and bring unemployment down by 1 million, by generat­ing jobs that need to be done for people who need to do them in a country which needs them to be done - jobs in construction, jobs in cleansing our environment, jobs in training people, caring for people.And on that new agenda too there is our five-years, medium-term employment strategy, which has the objective of laying the foundation of steadily expanding investment and employment. And then, at the same time, the implementation of a 10-year planning horizon which is essential to provide the continuity of development, which takes proper account of the change in the pace and the scale of technology, of trade, of employ­ment, so that we are not caught, without warning or overwhelmed with our change in the way successive generations have been.For all those reasons it is essential that investment finance is returned to this country and retained in this country. (Applause) That is why we shall introduce our capital repatriation scheme. If we were to leave it just at that, it is possible that the money would be in Britain but would not be used for the maximum benefit of our country in any coherent fashion at all.Other countries, indeed our most successful competitor countries, have institutions which provide the necessary coherence in allocating funds for investment and growth, and we need such an institution too. That is why we are establishing the British Investment Bank, to give investors the dual advantage of investing in Britain and getting a rate of return that compares with what they could get elsewhere. Some of those funds will be taken up by companies large and small which have in exis­tence worthwhile and specific investment ideas.In other cases we need finance to restructure and to modernise, to create and to nurture new industries. It is for that reason that we will be establishing British Enterprise as a holding company engaged in putting social ownership into practice through taking shares or complete prop­rietorship of enterprises which are critical to growth and investment in our country. That system of social ownership embraces activity from small co-operatives to municipal enterprises and right through to the major utility corporations like British Telecom which, in the strategic interests of this country, must come back into full social ownership.The purpose of a practical programme is to produce our way to sustain­able recovery, to sponsor new technologies, to strengthen consistent research and development, to promote our export trade and to provide employment. Comrades, I have said it before, I will say it again and again and again: we must literally make our way to recovery, produce our way to recovery, sell our way to recovery in the world. For there is no other way we can fully earn the living that we want for ourselves and for our children. That has got to be understood, and there are some other factors that have got to be understood too.If we invest in production and provision, and we will, and if we restore and extend social and personal services, and we will, and if pay better pensions and help the poor and the disabled, and we are going to, then what we have got to make sure of is that the extra demand that we sponsor does not all go on the purchase of foreign finished goods. (Applause) For if it were the case, that it was actually making jobs not in Britain but in Japan and in Germany, then the effort will have been kindly but it won\u2019t have been very constructive. It would be stimulating, but the result would not be very substantial.Secondly, and equally crucial, if those different policies of growth under a different government of growth were to bring rises in capital costs or in labour costs beyond what could be absorbed by efficiency, beyond what could be tolerated by purchasers, then the chance of significant development and increasing employment would be wiped away.There is in this country now a great reservoir of injustice and impati­ence, which has been built up and is still building in these years of Thatcherism. I know that. You know that. We can empty those reser­voirs of injustice by deliberate and persistent policies and by sticking to our strategy, but if we tried to do it in any other way than by persistence, by being systematic and by sticking to our strategy, if we simply tried to open the floodgates, then the prospect of renewal and recovery would be washed out.That is why we are not going to do that. We cannot. We will not. And our decisions about those things will not be governed by obedience to convention or to some fancy idea of political virility. Those decisions are governed by reality, guided constantly by the determination to generate jobs, to rebuild industry, to re-establish justice in our country. And those decisions, those policies, will operate best and most fruitfully in partner­ship with trade unionists and with managers who understand that if we were to try to do everything at once we would end by doing nothing at all. That is why our priority for jobs, for growth and for fighting poverty must be strict and straight, and it must be sustained. That is how it will be. Whilst the speed may vary, because it would be ridiculous to assume that somehow we inoculated ourselves against the realities of the move­ment and the marketing which we must sell to the world, the director of those policies, of those decisions, will unerringly and unreservedly be towards economic recovery and structural change all the time.That is the reason for establishing our new instruments of the British Investment Bank and British Enterprise. That is the reason for our approach to social ownership. We need to ensure that the right money is in the right places, available to people who want to make, to invest and to employ.Like any family or any business or any country we are going to have to raise money in order to invest in the means of making wealth. Some of the money will come as we cut unemployment, some of the money will come through the repatriation scheme and some of it we shall borrow, and what we have to borrow is about an extra two per cent of the total income of this country.Despite the fact that she is the greatest borrower in British history, Mrs Thatcher is constantly saying that she won\u2019t do that, she won\u2019t borrow. She won\u2019t increase borrowing by that extra two per cent of national income in order to fund development. She says she won\u2019t do that because she is not prepared to leave the burden of debt to our children. That is very touching. Or at least it would be touching if it wasn\u2019t so cruelly obvious that Mrs Thatcher is prepared to leave our children with a legacy of decay and decline right through our society. (Applause)Somehow she doesn\u2019t care that the result of not spending is increasing unemployment now and a guarantee of future unemployment, future under-employment, future under-investment, yes, future under­development in our country. It is one thing to say to your children, since she is so concerned about the children, \u2018I leave you with the house and the remainder of the mortgage to pay after my days.\u2019 That is the prudent way, that is the careful way. It is another thing altogether to say to your children, \u2018Because I wouldn\u2019t pay the mortgage, I will leave you nowhere to live after my days.\u2019 That is the Thatcher option. That is the impru­dent, careless way.We Socialists, conscious of the fact that we cannot and do not serve just one generation, conscious that each generation depends upon another, that one generation inherits in the very course of its preparation for the next generation, that there is this continual thread of dependence be­tween the generations of human beings, we Socialists always try to leave this place a little better than when we found it, and that attitude is not confined just to our own country.It is a definition of our view of the world. It is a perception which is more necessary now than it has ever been, for in our one world the dan­gers know no boundaries. Famine spreads like a contagion. The poisons of pollution spread with the winds and the tides and become more noxious, more dangerous all the time. Terrorism and warfare impose the rule of fear upon millions of people across this globe. People of so many coun­tries face the crises of insecurity, inequality, injustice and exploitation. Throughout our world aggression and oppression and starvation kill peace, and they kill people and they kill hope and they kill freedom.Afghanistan is still occupied by an invading empire, Iran and Iraq are still engaged in a merciless war of fanaticism. In Chile, Pinochet tramples into his 14th year of dictatorship and the people of Nicaragua are strug­gling to keep their infant democracy alive against the attacks of terrorists armed and funded by the government of the United States of America. (Applause)Those people of Nicaragua must look at pictures of the 4th of July celebrations and wonder what it can be that makes the United States of America, the great democracy, itself born in revolution, finance evil people to murder the innocent of Nicaragua. What makes them do that? They must ask themselves, as we ask, \u2018How can a President who is so rightly the enemy of terrorism, as any sane person is, sponsor the ter­rorism of the Contras in Central America?\u2019In friendship and in frankness we say to the United States, \u2018It is wrong to arm the Contra forces. It is wrong to try and squeeze the life out of that poor country of Nicaragua. It is wrong even in your own terms in the USA.\u2019 For it is clear that if Nicaragua ever went into any form of partnership with the Soviet Union, it will have been pushed there by poverty and not pulled there by desire. (Applause) If Nicaragua did become a Russian outpost, the reason would lie in the White House and not in the Kremlin. That is why we say in friendship and in frankness to our fellow democ­racy in the USA, \u2018Treating near-by nations as neighbours is one thing; treating those countries as if they were bits of your backyard is another thing altogether.\u2019Long ago in the United States of America and elsewhere the human race decided that it was wrong for one person to try to own another per­son. Long ago in a revolutionary war in 1776 they decided in America and elsewhere that it was wrong for one country to try to own another country, and what was right in America and between America and Britain in 1776 and what was right about our view of Russia and the Eastern Euro­pean countries in 1946 is surely right about the USA and Nicaragua in 1986. (Applause)Just as it is wrong for one country to seek to impose its ownership on another, so it is wrong for one race to impose its domination on another. That is why apartheid is so wrong. That is why apartheid must be ended. Apartheid truly is a crime against humanity. And while it remains, none of the people of South and Southern Africa will be truly free, no one in the white minority will know real security, no one in the black majority will know anything resembling real liberty, no one in the neighbouring countries will be able to live in real security. That is why we want to hasten the day of change to a democratic South Africa, and the lever which we have long ago chosen for that purpose is strict and strong sanctions against South Africa - (Applause) - They are the only practical means of trying to promote an end to apartheid that is not soaked in the blood of millions.Such sanctions are of course resisted by some. Mrs. Thatcher, Herr Kohl, President Reagan refuse to promote a regime of robust sanctions. The excuse that they offer for refusing to impose the implacable pressures that are necessary against apartheid is that such pressure, such sanctions would be immoral because they would inflict upon the poor further wounds of suffering and destitution.I hear the President, I hear the Prime Minister, I hear the Chancellor and I hear different voices too. I hear louder voices. I hear voices of great­er authenticity and greater authority upon the business of the future of the people of South Africa. It is the voice that comes straight from that bitter and bleeding land of South Africa and it does not come from the high-faluting politicians or people in hotels or air-conditioned suites. That voice I hear from South Africa comes from the townships and it comes from the homelands and it comes from the Churches and it comes from the trade unions. (Applause) It comes from Nelson Mandela in prison, it comes from Archbishop Tutu in his palace. (Continuing applause) It is the voice that says, in the words of Chief Albert Uthuli \u2018Shorten the day of bloodshed, impose those sanctions, aid us in our efforts to end apartheid and oppression.\u2019This is the Labour Party. We will form the Labour Government. We will answer that call for sanctions from the people of South Africa. Well will impose those strict and stringent and comprehensive sanctions. And with the people of South Africa we shall overcome. We shall overcome apartheid with those people and we shall overcome the instability and the terror of Southern Africa as we go about that. We shall take common action in common cause for common good. That is necessary in so many areas, and that fact is now more obvious to more people than ever before.In this year of 1986, a prophet of that fact, who gave us much more than his prophecies, was killed in his own capital city, out for an evening with his wife. This year we lost my dear comrade and a friend of the world, Olav Palme, a man who gave his intellect to the best possible employment, which is providing practical solutions to the practical problems of humanity. Olav was killed, and the memorial that we have to erect to him as to demonstrate that his instruction about the community of interest across the boundaries of the world has not been lost on this generation and that we work for his objectives in his memory. It is necessary more than ever before.Within two weeks of April of this year two events, thousands of milles apart, originating from entirely different sources, came together to for an equation in the minds of millions of people in this country and throughout the rest of the world. The bombing of Tripoli and the explosion at Chernobyl demonstrated in the starkest possible way the fragility of our world, the interdependence of its countries and peoples; the need to understand new realities and to provide new responses for our survival depends upon it ultimately. Those responses include the question of defence of our country and our system of values.I hold it to be self-evident that it is the first duty of any government to ensure the security of the country over which it governs, especially if the government is elected by democracy. That duty does not change in an age, and we will discharge that duty fully, for this is our country and we defend our country, as we always have. (Applause)Meeting obligation requires that we defend ourselves effectively by land, sea and air and that we participate properly in the Alliance of which we were full and firm members.We will fulfil that obligation, and that is amongst the most prominent of reasons for implementing a non-nuclear defence strategy. (Applause) For it is now plainly the case that, by pursuing a nuclear-dependent defence policy, the present government is diminishing the conventional defence of our country.The Ministry of Defence documents - the so-called towpath papers, which were published three weeks ago - give the consequences of the Trident programme as being just for the Navy - not for any of the other services, just for the Navy: major reductions in our conventionally armed submarine fleet, a 20 per cent stretch in the lifetime of our service fleet and a new wave of privatisation in the defence sector like the indefensible and dangerous sell-off of the royal dockyard in Devonport, with all the job losses that that will involved. Not only does that mean that the gov­ernment is failing to meet the defence needs of Britain. It also means that, because of that increased dependence on nuclear weapons, because of that diminished dependence on conventional arms, the nuclear threshold is lowered. There is no enhanced security for our country in that. There is only increased jeopardy for our country.That is why we say that at this time of choice the alternatives before the British people are very clear. One alternative is a Tory policy which, in the very act of building up nuclear armaments at ruinous cost, erodes conventional defence and adds to nuclear danger without enhancing in any way national security for Britain. The other alternative is our policy, a policy which responds to the realities, ends the nuclear illusions and properly meets the conventional defence needs and duties of our country. They are the real alternatives, although until a short time ago Dr. Owen, Mr. Steel and parts of the press would have sought to persuade us that there was a third alternative - the so-called Euro-bomb.Apart from the fact that it is overwhelmingly rejected as an option by the British people, it is an option without substance, the product of a weekend break in Paris, which had as its function a patching up of a wide­ning crack in the defence positions of the SDP and the Liberal Party. If it ever was in any way feasible, it would mean fingers on the nuclear trig­ger and a great hole torn in the whole idea and treaty arrangements of non-proliferation. It would mean highest jeopardy at lowest security at maximum cost. It would not influence friends, it would not impress potential enemies, it would not buy us a seat at any disarmament confer­ence or give us essential control over the life and death decisions that affect our country.They call it the Euro-bomb. They call it the minimum deterrent, when it could kill 60 or 70 million people. They can call it those names as long as they like, but in reality it would not be increased security; it would be the entente terminale. (Applause) It has nothing to do with protecting our country or our continent and everything to do with the attempt of the Lib­eral and SDP leaders to conjure an illusion of a policy out of a delusion of grandeur. No wonder they were rejected.Of course in recent days there have been some other intervening voices from outside Britain. Some of the language has been lurid, but it has been repudiated. It has been made clear that it is not the representative voices of the attitude of the administration - at least, not representative of the American administration but representative perhaps of the current British administration. The reports are of the Tories asking for a particu­lar element in the United States of America to help combat our defence policies in this democracy. The conclusion is plain. The interventions that we have heard in recent weeks are not so much the product of Ameri­can anxiety as a result of Tory alarm at the fact that we are defeating them and we are going to beat them in the next general election. And they will pull any dirty tricks they can in order to try and prevent that?The attitude of the American administration shows a great deal more common sense and common interest than the Tory attitude. It arises from the knowledge that if a member of the Alliance of these democracies were to seek to subordinate the policies of a democratically elected allied gov­ernment, it would be invalidating the very principles of democracy and sovereignty which NATO exists to defend and always has existed to defend. (Applause)There is another reason for that common sense and common interest. It is that here in Britain and in our territories elsewhere across the world, there are installations which are critical to the defence and intelligence needs of the United States of America, from the early warning system at Fylingdales to the submarine-watching system in Pembrokeshire; from GCHQ to Cyprus; from Hong Kong to Edzell in Scotland. They are essential facilities for the national interests of the United States and the collective interests of the NATO Alliance.We do not propose for one moment, and we never have proposed for one moment, that those facilities should be withdrawn from the Ameri­cans, for they are our allies and we honour the Alliance. But it does demonstrate that we play and will continue to play our part in providing security for the American people, and no United States government will sacrifice that essential link in their security.In all of these matters modern men and modern women, whatever their office, whatever their status, whatever their country, whatever their poli­tics or lack of politics, face the fact that the terrible existence of nuclear weapons puts us in a condition unknown to any previous generation of humankind. We are the first generation in history to have to deal with those weapons, the first generation in history to have to deal not just with the weapons of horror which inflict such dreadful death and suffering during wars but with the existence of weapons of total obliteration. That gives us different challenges and requires different responses. The know­ledge must not make people panic; hysteria is not the response. But it must mean that people face that fact of the existence of weapons of oblit­eration and how we control, reduce and abolish them squarely and hon­estly.I face those questions as the leader of this party who works to become the democratically elected leader of this country. I face those facts too as an adult, as a citizen and as a father. I tell you in no casual spirit, no bravado, that like most of my fellow citizens I would if necessary fight and die, fight and lay down my life for my country and what it stands for. I would fight and die for my country, but I tell you I would never let my country die for me. (Applause)In everything we do in this party in every part of it we refuse to submit to the idea that the present and future are beyond control. We will not bow down to the defeatism that says that our economy is so badly wounded that it is incapable of renewal. We will not succumb to the defeatism that says that the tensions and dangers and the poisons of the world are so great as to make conflict and contamination inevitable.We look at the weaknesses of our country and we look at the menaces to humankind and we say that inasmuch as these conflicts and dangers are made by human hand, so they can be unmade by human hand. Just as these horrors are made by human error, so they can be unmade by human effort.That is not a blind attitude. It is not lightly put. It is not evidence of innocence. On the contrary, it is the starkest reality of all. For we either surrender to hopelessness or we stand and fight against it. For us as democratic socialists there is no real choice. We stand and we fight against hopelessness. It is fundamental to our socialism. It is essential to the case that we put to the people of this country, and it is our country: we have nowhere else to go and we have nowhere else that we want to go. (Applause) That is the investment that we make in it. This is our living space. It is the living space that we want to leave secure, prosperous, just and free to our children. That is the reason why we ask the people of this country to give us democratic power, and it is because we ask for those reasons that they will elect us to that democratic power. (Standing ova­tion)

aVComrades, it is at this point in conference, immediately following the merit awards, that I feel that my journey is in vain. When Catherine Griffiths was talking to me there, a South Walean woman, a former district nurse exactly like my mother, she said as she stepped back: \u2018I would have made a speech if I could have remembered.\u2019 (Laughter) And I thought, well, Cath, I have the next few minutes and if I do what you have done in the time allotted to you then it will be quite remarkable. (Applause)Comrades, this conference is dominated by the fact that we meet in the shadow of defeat. Indeed it is that fact which, to all intents and purposes, dominates our agenda, sets our agenda. For we know that out of that defeat we must build victory. We do not therefore go into a period of mourning, for that would be sheer self-indulgence. Instead, we use defeat for its only useful purpose: instruction. We learn from our defeat, and we learn hard enough and deep enough to ensure that it is the last defeat that will be inflicted upon our movement. (Applause)That need for learning, that need for instruction, is well understood by this party, as you demonstrated in those overwhelming votes on the review yesterday. There are many lessons to learn and we shall learn them. And as we set about the task I think it is helpful in preparing ourselves for that task of review, of assessment, of analysis, of learning, to remind ourselves without any complacency that there were features of that election which we lost that provide us with foundations of confidence. I say again, without complacency, there were features of that election which meant that, yes, we were defeated, but we certainly were not beaten - certainly not like so many of the commentators and anticipators and watchers of the runes and readers of the tea leaves would have had us believe just weeks before that election started.Amongst those foundations of confidence is the fact, first, that we significantly increased the number of women Labour MPs - not enough, but a firm step in the right direction.Second, our party achieved the election of our black Members of Parliament, and by that means saw to it that we began to have a multi­racial parliament to reflect our multi-racial society. (Applause)Third, among these foundations of confidence is the fact that we made very substantial gains in Scotland, Wales and the North of England, and the people who supported us there and everywhere else deserve our thanks and have our thanks. And they have this tribute too: all over this country, all over England, Wales and Scotland, we shall not be taking their support for granted. We regard their support as a spur to greater and more successful efforts, not as any excuse for relaxation.Fourth, in the foundations of confidence, it is also the case that we did have a very good campaign - not just at the levels that received the most attention and publicity, but, in many ways even more impor­tantly, right through the whole of this party. I want to use this conference to thank people throughout the movement for the unprecedented efforts made everywhere - politically and organisationally - to try to ensure that Labour would win and therefore that Britain would win. That campaign gave people throughout this party energy, pride and confi­dence. And those feelings stay with us even in defeat. That is important: for it is those qualities of energy, of pride, and of confidence that give this party the courage to be candid, the boldness to be honest, with everyone else and with ourselves.That is the spirit in which we shall undertake this review; and that was the spirit, I believe, in which the conference took its decision yesterday. That review will be thorough. It will spread across the whole field of policy, leaving nothing out. It will ensure that the programme that we develop in this party is directly related to the conditions that we shall encounter before and during and after the next occasion on which we get the chance to bid for power in a general election. For the task of the review is not to adjust our focus on the past: the task of that review is to give us a clear and accurate perception of the future. The question of whether the policies were right or wrong in June 1987 is of course a matter of some interest - indeed, it is a starting point. But the question of whether the policies will be right or wrong for 1991 must be the matter of the most profound and supreme importance. That is the dominant consideration of that review. That is the frame of mind in which we proceed.It appears, however, that there are still some who are timid about the idea of \u2018review.\u2019 They seem to have \u2018do not disturb\u2019 notices hung on their minds. The very activity of examination is described by some as a \u2018betrayal of fundamental principles.\u2019 I must say I have a very different opinion of \u2018review.\u2019 I believe that after losing three general elections any serious political party that did not undertake the assessment, the review, the examination - and do it honestly - that party would be betraying its principles and its policies and its people. (Applause)Indeed I have to say that it is from those people who want us to win that the demand for such a review comes. It has not been dreamt up by Tom Sawyer or by Walworth Road or by the party leadership. Everywhere I have been in the last four months in England, Scotland and Wales I have talked to our party members, talked to trade unionists, talked to supporters. And anyone who has done the same in our movement will know that it is they who are asking for the review. That demand does not come from people who are defeatist, panic stricken or suffering apolitical identity crisis. On the contrary, the demand for the review comes from people who are very sure of their political identity, of their ideals, of their principles. So sure, indeed, that they do not think that their convictions will expire like some fragile plant if they are exposed to the light of reality.These are people who are not afraid to examine, not afraid to think, not afraid to test their beliefs against the realities: because those beliefs were occasioned in the first instance, were rooted, in the realities that they encountered. Indeed, that is the elementary appeal of socialism, that it is related to the realities in which people live their lives. Those people are not the kind of people who would accept, let alone suggest, the discarding of democratic socialist values.And they are not the kind of people who will accept the advice (widely tendered: some of it malicious, some of it merely hysterical) that we should jettison everything we stood for on 11 June, 1987. Nothing would more deserve the charge of cynicism and nothing would more surely sabotage our credibility than to try to make a bonfire of everything that we asked people to vote for in June of this year. So we won\u2019t be doing that.And there are two other things that we will not be doing either: we won\u2019t be pursuing the pipe dreams of electoral pacts; and we won\u2019t be chasing the non-existent pots of political gold at the end of rainbow coalitions. We stand for ourselves, with ourselves and our ideals. (Applause)What we will be doing in that process of review, and the activities related to that and many other campaigns, is to develop the means to further the ends of democratic socialism. We shall further the commitments to community, democracy and justice. And to real individual liberty that does not depend for its exercise on the ability of the individual to pay. We shall further the commitments to individual security and freedom from fear, and the commitment to the spread of opportunity to ensure that all people can achieve whatever ability and effort makes possible for them. They are all living purposes.So, too, is the commitment to the civil liberties of every citizen: every man, woman and child, regardless of sex or colour or race or creed. For ours is a socialism that does not just recoil from the ugliness of racism or the insult of sexism; it actively engages itself in combating both on all possible occasions. (Applause)It is a socialism that knows that the natural environment of this world is fragile; that it is perishable; and that it must be safeguarded against the exploitation and carelessness that constantly menaces the very existence of a habitable environment.And ours is a socialism, too, that knows that whilst the market is an adequate system for deciding the price and availability of many goods and services, the market has not been, is not, and will never be an adequate mechanism for deciding upon the supply or the quality of health care and education and so much else that is fundamental to a decent life.  (Applause) The market alone will never be adequate for determining the quantity and quality of investment in science or in the arts. And the market alone will never ensure that flow of investment in machines, people, skills and ideas which is necessary to gain and to sustain long-term economic strength and the employment that comes with it.Ours is the kind of socialism which believes that the future will not take care of itself... the socialism that holds that preparation for the future cannot be left to the crude short-term calculation of profit and loss, any more than the opportunities and life chances of people can be left just to luck.They are the values basic to our socialism, basic to the nature of our party. They are the purposes that we want to put into practice. Because these are not declarations, icons or holy relics, these values: they are there as living proposals for the elevation of human kind, the advancement of our whole society. They are there to be put into practice, not into storage. They are the purposes that brought us into this movement and the purposes best able to take us forward in this move­ment.And we know that, if we are to get the chance to do that (to go forward, to put the purposes into practice), those purposes will have to be matched to the realities that exist and will exist in the corning years. That is common sense. Anyone that does not think it is should heed the advice of Aneurin Bevan who warned that the socialist must be:On guard against the old words, for the words persist when the reality that lay behind them has changed. It is inherent in our intellectual activity, that we seek to imprison reality in our description of it. Soon, long before we are aware of it, it is we who become the prisoners of the description. From that point on, our ideas degenerate into a kind of folklore which we as around to each other, fondly thinking we are still talking of the reality around us. We become symbol worshippers. The categories which we once evolved and which once were the tools which we used in our intercourse with reality become hopelessly blunted. In those circumstances the social and political realities we are supposed to be grappling with change and reshape themselves independently of the collective impact of our ideas. We become the creature and no longer the partner of social realities.That is why I recommend the common sense of realising that we direct and we relate our values, principles and purposes to the realities of our condition, and not to where we would like to be - or to some imagined environment that has yet to be created, indeed yet to be perceptible in the longest possible term. We, in our time, face the challenge of the social realities spoken of by Bevan. We are not daunted by them - such a mood would ill befit any socialist.The social realities that we face are the realities of increasing home ownership: the realities, too, of less housebuilding and of growing homelessness. We face the fortunate reality of earlier retirement and of longer life for an ever larger proportion of the population; and we also face the grim reality of poverty and isolation that so frequently still accompany old age. We face the reality of many more people owning a few shares; and the reality alongside it of increasing poverty, of low pay and growing inequality and division. We face the reality of the change in the pattern of work from mass production manufacturing to high-tech custom production; and, alongside that, too, the reality of under-investment in science and in skills. They are just some of the mixed realities already here or in very firm prospect for the early 1990s \u2013 a time in which our economy can no longer rely on the bounty of oil, and there is nothing else left to privatise.These are just some of the realities we face. They are the realities of a changing economy, a changing society, and they are the realities of a changing electorate too. They present their own fresh challenges, they make their own demands on our candour. If this movement pretends, for instance, that a few million more people owning a few shares each will not make any difference to their perception of their economic welfare then this movement will be fooling itself. Of course, we know that those scattered shares do not make any real difference at all to the structure of economic ownership in our country. They do not make any difference at all to the structure of economic power in our country.  But, equally, we know that they do make a difference to their owners\u2019 personal economic perceptions. That is a matter of fact. And the result of it is that our policies are going to have to take account of that reality, and of a number of others.Of course, again, not everyone appears to be willing to listen to that, to understand that. In the past few days I have heard such a recognition of the changing realities described as \u2018retreat,\u2019 \u2018defeatism,\u2019 \u2018pandering to yuppies.\u2019It is not a retreat from anything, and it is not pandering to anybody. It is simply understanding the hopes and the doubts, expecta­tions and reservations of people who are not necessarily young, not particularly mobile and who, in any event, did not vote Labour. They are frequently people - not yuppies - who live in the kind of places and work in the kind of jobs that would qualify them for any certificate of working class authenticity that any comrade wanted to award. And they did not vote Labour last time or the time before.Many throughout this movement know them. They know them from their own work, their own families, their own neighbourhood, their canvassing and their campaigning. And those people pose direct questions to us as a socialist movement: they pose questions to us a socialist movement with its direct relationships with trade unions, as a socialist movement that made its appeal across the broad spread of society, that never had any inclination to try and pick and choose who it would like to vote for it. Those people face us with challenges; and we have to recognise those challenges.Ron Todd made the point with deadly accuracy just a couple of months ago when he asked: \u2018what do you say to a docker who earns 243400 a week, owns his house, a new car, a microwave and a video, as well as a small place near Marbella?\u2019 \u2018You do not say,\u2019 said Ron, \u2018let me take you out of your misery, brother.\u2019 (Laughter and applause) When he asked that question, Ron Todd was not suggesting that we trail along in the wake of something called popular capitalism - he was facing a fundamental question for our party with admirable candour that I would recommend universally. It is a question which we must all face if we are going to have an effective response to the changes taking place in our society.Of course, it is not really a very new question. I remember when I first faced it. It was not last June. It was not in 1983. It was after the 1959 election. I was 17 and had worked very hard during that election down in the Monmouth constituency. I was devastated, as was the whole movement, not just by defeat but by the scale of our defeat. And I, like just about everyone else in the movement, was asking for explanations of the defeat because it had not felt as though it was going to happen.Amongst the most prominent of those explanations, both in the movement generally and indeed in the annual conference that reviewed the election in that year of 1959, was the assertion that a major reason for our failure in that year, the failure against Macmillan, was something called the Affluent Society. You could hear that everywhere. It was made to sound like a curse. Part of me actually wanted to believe that explanation - it was an easy explanation that had a certain appeal to someone who was convinced that socialism was fundamentally, primarily, a cause that existed to help the underdogs, the downtrodden.But the other part of me could not really believe that as an explanation. The idea that the Affluent Society, or at least that part of it which I knew, was a bad thing, was contradicted by the evidence of my own eyes \u2013 indeed all the experiences of my own living. I could not see for the life of me how it could be that the neighbours\u2019 cars that were starting to appear in the street, the wall-to-wall carpeting, the washing machines, the televisions and the first foreign holidays to which the working class were getting access, could somehow be a disadvantage - how could it be anything but a very good thing for the people like my family who had never known anything like that before? And so I could not bring myself to believe that this affluent society had thrown such a shadow as to obscure socialism.I knew that that improvement did not have much to do with Harold Macmillan. I knew where it had come from: people doing lots of very hard work, working overtime, so that they were able to get these things. I could not see either, how those advances were contradictory to the socialism which I believed, and still believe, is about ordinary people getting on: ordinary people having a better life, ordinary people being able to consume more and choose more, and gain greater comfort and opportunity and security. I could not see how socialism was in collision with that. But I was perplexed.I did what I always did on such occasions when I had these fundamental questions (and you are entitled to do it at any age, but most particularly at that age), I went to see an old socialist in Tredegar, Oliver Jones, and asked him whether there was a collision between affluence and socialism. He told me: \u2018there is no collision between affluence and socialism \u2013 I have been striving for both all my life.\u2019 (Laughter and applause) And then he went on to say in words that were unforgettable: \u2018the point is, you see, that if socialism has got to wait for want, then socialism will wait for a very long time. And it will be right for socialism to wait for a very long time: because if it needs misery to give it majority, God forbid we have the misery.\u2019 (Applause)He was absolutely right, wasn\u2019t he? And it meant then and it means now that democratic socialism has to be as attractive, as beckoning and as useful to the relatively affluent and the relatively secure as it is to the less fortunate in our society who are frequently referred to (in a phrase which I have always thought of as patronising and complacent) as our \u2018natural vote.\u2019 I do not know what that is \u2013 I have never known what that is. Any citizen in this democracy who has the right to exercise the franchise is a citizen to whom we should and could be able to make an appeal. (Applause) That attractiveness and usefulness of democratic socialism should not be difficult for anyone confident about their socialism to be able to demonstrate. It is not a great challenge.Take the docker of whom Ron spoke, or many others like him earning a little more or a little less. Those kind of people are comfortable, secure, satisfied with decent conditions, and the best of British luck to them. But even with those wages, even with that security, even with that comfort, he is still not able to give the comprehensive care, the special housing, the sheltered accommodation, the support with transport, that his ageing mother and father might need. Even with those wages he is still not getting enough to enable him to meet the price of the schooling for his children, even more so if they wanted to continue into further education or go on to university. And still with those wages, he is not able to ensure that he and his family could meet their full medical needs without worry, especially if there happens to be in that family (as so frequently and tragically is the case) someone with a chronic or crippling illness or disease.Those are the factors. The way in which the old and the sick are looked after; the kind of serenity people have when they are absolutely sure that they have access to high-quality medical facilities; the un­bounded opportunity that we want for our children to ensure that their education should not be cramped by having a price tag attached o it They are the real assets, and they are the things which condition the quality of life throughout the whole of society. They are the factors which determine the full abundance of life and the real extent of security. And they have something else in common. They are all assets which must be collectively supplied if they are to be there without fail, regardless of the changes of economic fortunes of an individual or the ability to pay.That commitment, systematic and ready to make that collective provision, cannot come from the current government - or anyone like it - that is guided by hostility to that collective provision. As a matter of doctrine, as a matter of dogma, in the place of that collective provision they want to install a system that makes access to all those assets of care and opportunity increasingly dependent upon the ability to pay. It is a very cheap and a very nasty view, with very expensive and very nasty results. And yet it is presented as a ideological new broom, a compelling doctrine, a grand and radical scheme. A Big Idea taking its place alongside all the great political philosophies. It is called Thatcherism, the Big Idea.But what is this Big Idea? How is it attuned to the realities, how does it stand up to the examination of real circumstances? How, for instance, does the Big Idea address the real problems of a generation of children who will meet greater challenges in their future as citizens and  workers than any generation has ever known before? Well, the Big Idea responds to that reality and the responsibilities for that generation by making such cuts in education investment as to put education spending as a proportion of our GNP lower than that of any comparable economy.What has the Big Idea got for the inner cities? It has a galaxy of initiatives, programmes, task forces and schemes \u2013 in fact it has everything except money. The Big Idea, applied to the inner city, is that you put one pound of programme money in for every nine pounds that you take out in rate support grant from the inner cities. That is the Big Idea. (Applause)The Big Idea cuts investment in house building by three quarters in eight years. And the Big Idea now requires the imposition of a poll tax - a tax which has no connection with ability to pay, which punishes families which have dependent sick or aged relatives or dependent grown up children at home, which costs a fortune to administer and which tears up the roots of local democracy. That is the Big Idea.And then there is the jewel in the crown of this great new intellectual and ideological force. The jewel in the crown of the Big Idea: privatisation. The sell-off system which is supposed to be the engine of popular capitalism, but which turns out to be a scheme for changing great public monopolies into great private monopolies by means which ensure that some small investors get a little slice of gain and a few very big investors get great slabs of additional wealth and the power that goes with it.Private monopolies cannot deliver an efficient telephone system, but are excellent, brilliant, magnificent as a means of handing over major British assets to foreign asset holders. A scheme of privatisation which turned Jaguar Cars into an American-owned company, a scheme of privatisation which is turning Rolls Royce into a Japanese concern, a scheme of privatisation which is just about to turn British Petroleum into anything but British.Now of course we have another of the ideologues, John Moore. He has the big idea: \u2018to move people away from dependency,\u2019 as he put it, \u2018and towards opportunity.\u2019 It sounds very attractive, does it not, opportunity? My father used to say that he was brought up in an opportunity society \u2013 boundless opportunities, opportunities everywhere you looked. And he said that the only thing that made him as one of seven children go down the pit at 14 was sheer bloody-mindedness! (Applause) Move away from dependency towards opportunity \u2013 it does sound like a good idea. Nobody likes the status of dependence. The human taste is always for self reliance: indeed, that is a major, basic reason for our advocacy of socialism, to be able to extend that self reliance so that people do not have to be dependent.But our way of doing it of course, is to end dependence by trying to end need. Mr Moore works from the other direction. He intends to end dependence by ending provision: teaching people to fly by pushing them off the roof \u2013 that is how he wants to end dependence! (Applause) And that is his Big Idea: you are on your own. What a brilliant new idea! What a forceful and compelling way to have our society ruled.Can the Big Idea attend to the real basics? That should be very easy for such a great scheme. Can it, for instance, attend to the very rudimentary requirements of old and poor people to keep warm in the winter? No, it can\u2019t. Not because of any malevolence or meanness, you understand, but because these saintly enemies of dependence would simply not want to demean frightened and freezing old people with the status of being \u2018dependants.\u2019 They are kindness themselves, you know, these ideologues of the Big Idea.And the Big Idea is not just applied at home. The same small mindedness applies abroad too. For when asked to tackle any of the great issues of menace to the environment, of racial oppression, of want in the world - that Big Idea turns in upon itself and shrinks into selfishness.It is a Big Idea that will not join in any of the international initiatives to combat the poisoning of the land, the sea or the air.It is a Big Idea that will accommodate and appease apartheid and refuse to tighten sanctions to squeeze down on that regime on the grounds, as the prime minister puts it, of morality. Morality, when the object of those sanctions should be a government of apartheid that is allowing the imprisonment, torture, beating and killing of children who are said to threaten their apartheid state in their protests against it. (Applause)It is a Big Idea that cuts the aid budget in half and turns its back on the people of the world who need some extra help to enable them to make their way out of the misery of poverty, insecurity and starvation. How can anything so empty of responsibility, so empty of generosity, of decency, be thought to be a big idea?But there are big ideas around. I'll tell you who has got a really big idea. Gorbachev and Reagan, Shevardnadze and Shultz, they have a Big Idea. They have a really big idea. Their Big Idea is to secure the withdrawal of intermediate nuclear forces and then to embark upon significant reductions in strategic nuclear weapons. Now that is what I call a really big idea. (Applause)That is a major purpose: but too major, it would appear, for this government in Britain; and that is why they have tried to block every stride in all the progress made since Reykjavik, laying across the path of progress all the time. Friendly visits to Washington, little nips into Europe, speeches from the Berlin wall, speeches that collide with those who have the Big Idea. George Shultz, the American Secretary of State, when challenged that the removal of intermediate weapons would not bring about a vast reduction in the nuclear stockpiles on each side, said that that was true. But, he said: \u2018We have to start somewhere.\u2019 (Applause) Within days, the response of the mistress of the Big Idea is not to say, \u2018yes, let us make a start, let us see what we can get and how far we can mutually go.\u2019 It is to say, in her words: \u2018It has gone far enough.\u2019 What a Big Idea.But of course she is wrong. Because the patent fact about the attitude of the superpowers is that they consider that the progress has not gone far enough. And we, like the huge majority of humanity, agree with them entirely in that view, that the progress has not gone far enough. There is a long course yet to run. We welcome the fact that the process will continue, and, as it continues, will change and improve the condition of common security in this world. Not only in the nuclear sphere, but in securing the ending of chemical weapons and the reduction and balance of non-nuclear conventional forces. We welcome that process.And because of the continued assertions on both sides of a real will to proceed, we can look forward to that improvement in common security. That is why we will work to ensure that we have policies that are capable of dealing with the changed conditions of the 1990s in a way that will enhance the prospect of removing reliance on nuclear weapons of any description.In that, and in many other ways, we shall review our policies. Those reviews will take their direction and their inspiration from the values of compassion and concern. They will show our commitment to Britain and the British people. They will be sharpened on the realities: including the salient fact of life that - if we are to achieve our ambitions of proper care, of full opportunity, of defeating poverty and disadvantage - we must implement policies to make our economy more competitive, more efficient, more productive. That is essential, for without it we could not fulfil our contract to generate jobs, or to meet social needs, or to modernise and multiply the essential services of health and education.Of course, all of our enemies and, yes, some of our friends give the impression that we are hostile to those ideas of efficiency and competitiveness \u2013 just as we are said to be antagonistic to personal good fortune, to private industry and to a lot of other things. But if any of that were the case, why is it that so many of our members and supporters are buying their houses, so many of our members and supporters are making personal pension arrangements, and undertaking many other activities to secure proper protection for themselves and their families? If we really had those hostilities, why would so many Labour councils (to their eternal credit) show such initiative and expend such energy on attracting and retaining and working in partnership with so much private industry? If we really had that opposition to efficiency and competition, why would so many of our trade union colleagues scourge management for under-investment, for inadequate provision for training, for poor sales promo­tion and marketing activities?The truth is, is it not, that so frequently and so rightly, when we get the chance to improve the material well-being of our families, our communities, our colleagues in this movement, we take that chance. And we are right to do so. When local councillors of this party can win industrial development for their areas, they do it. When trade unionists can secure the advantage of the members of their union by more efficient performance, they do it. There is no concession of ideals in that. Certainly there is no corruption of the values of socialism or its purposes. There is nothing to apologise for: indeed, they are personal and collective achievements, by socialists, for socialist purposes.So - instead of tolerating the insults of our enemies, or accommodating the indulgence of a few of our friends, that we are, or somehow should be, antagonistic to material advance - we would really be better employed telling the truth about ourselves, employed best of all in ensuring that we preach what, in reality, we are practising. And then perhaps we would get some credit for it where credit is due.That is the spirit in which we will review and renew our economic policies to ensure that we develop the strategy necessary to meet our economic and social goals. That is our purpose; and we shall accomplish it. And then we shall promote it. And we shall promote it in \u2018years not weeks.\u2019 That, of course, must be our well-developed habit in every area.In the last few months I have heard the phrase \u2018years not weeks\u2019 very frequently. I needed no persuasion. For, as it happens, I had the chance - indeed the duty - to say it first: elections are won in years, not weeks. I did not just have the chance and the duty to say it on the night of our election defeat in June of this year, but I actually said it in the plainest possible terms, as some of you may recall, from this very platform when you elected me leader four years ago: \u2018elections are won in years, not weeks.\u2019 (Applause) Many listened, many understood, many applied it; and they have worked to win for \u2018years, not weeks\u2019 right throughout this movement.That is why, in the last four years, we have been engaged in continual campaigning: the NHS campaign; the Freedom and Fairness campaign; the Investing in People campaign; the Jobs and Industry campaign; the Modern Britain in a Modern World campaign; and a host of other campaigns at national and local level. All for the purpose of trying to secure an advance in years and not in weeks.And there were many who understood that the need to work \u2018for years not weeks\u2019 applied not only to the obligation of campaigning in this party, but to conduct in this party as well. They understood that we would be judged not only by the substance of policies or the quality of campaigns, but also by the way in which we acted as people and as a party. Now, in the wake of our third election defeat, there can be very few, if there be any at all, who do not comprehend the need to be convincing in all three of those areas: policy; campaigning and conduct. All three, and we forget them at our peril. (Applause)And to maintain all three will require self-discipline. The self-discipline of not promising so much that the promise is destroyed by incredibility. The self-discipline of understanding the implications of action. Not just for the term, not just in the immediate situation, but for the standing of the whole movement, wherever that action is taken. The self-discipline of ensuring that every word, every deed, every statement, every action, is related completely to the task of achieving victory. The self-discipline of accepting that in everything that each of us, individually and collectively, says and does, we work in the clear and certain knowledge that we address many people who still need to be convinced if they are to make the shift to supporting us - people who need to be certain that their trust in our common purpose and in our common sense is fully justified.None of that means speaking of our socialism behind cupped hands. None of that self-discipline and sacrifice means bowing down to prejudice or injustice. It does not mean putting away our initiatives and it does not mean forgetting our inspirations. Recognising those require­ments of a serious, sensible, socialist movement is not defeatism, nor is it a retreat from convictions. On the contrary, recognising it and applying it is the precondition of the victory which we need to get the power to put those convictions into effect. (Applause)That is not a plea for self-discipline. I am not pleading at all. Because the people who need us are not pleading. The people who need us are demanding - demanding that we conduct our affairs, run our movement, meet our responsibilities to each other and to the community. And meet those responsibilities in such a way as to continually demon­strate those qualities of vitality, purpose and unity which brought us such credit during the election campaign.When that demand for unity is made, I anticipate the question: \u2018unity on whose terms?\u2019 And the answer is, on the terms of the people who support us and would like to support us. For serious socialists, for serious democrats, that is not much to ask. And if anyone doubts the need for that self-discipline, for that unity, then they had better just remind themselves of the price that is paid for indiscipline and disunity. It is not paid by those who are locked in combat, it is not paid by those who have an interesting exchange, it is not paid by those who thrive on division. The price is paid by the people of Britain. And it is paid most by those who need most: those who need the schools and the homes, those who need the hospitals, those who need chances for themselves that can only be built on the foundations of a just society and a, strong economy. The price for division and disunity is paid most of all by those who attract our greatest concern, those who most need our help, those who most depend upon our success. We cannot let them down, we must not let them pay that price again.And that is why we review. That is why we reassess. That is why we regroup. They are acts of rededication to our principles and our purposes, and to policies that are attuned to the realities in which people live. They are the acts of a party that is not satisfied with the luxury of opposition nor attracted by the purity of powerlessness. They are the acts of a party that cannot live on constant diets of resolutions condemning and motions deploring and statements opposing, when it wants the power to do things. (Applause)It is the act of rededication, the act of a party that knows that it will offer nothing to the British people if it contents itself with gestures that will be ignored, bluffs that will be called and illegality that will be ruthlessly punished. (Applause)Review, reassessment, regrouping are the acts of a party that wants power to decide, power to influence, power to govern in a way that can advance the condition of our fellow human beings. We seek the opportunities of that power and accept the obligations of that power. Of course they will impose pressures and impose burdens. But ask anyone in this movement: who is not prepared to accept such responsibilities? Whether they want this party to achieve victory, or whether they will settle for being members of a party that can offer the British people nothing but sympathy? A party that will do little more than attend the funerals of hopes and of communities and of industries, a party of permanent condolence senders. I do not think that that is what this party and its members want for themselves or accept for themselves. (Applause)Comrades, four years ago when you elected me leader I told you that there must be no activity in this labour movement superior to that of defeating Toryism. I meant every word. I meant no activity superior to that task of defeating Toryism. I say it again. I know that there are now many more people in this movement who not only understand that to be desirable but regard it as essential and act upon it all the time.That is now the spirit in the labour movement in its overwhelm­ing majority. And because that is the spirit, it makes us fit to fight. It makes us fit to win. And it will make us fit to govern. (Prolonged applause)

aVGwyneth, Comrades, as you may have observed, before I began I started to cough. It was not a bug that I picked up in Scottish night last night, but I picked it up from somewhere. I haves fantastic cold from somewhere, so I trust that, in best comradely fashion, you will bear with me if there should be some sound fade in the course of what I have to say this afternoon.Thank you very much, Gwyneth, for your generous welcome, and thank you, too, to the conference. I would also like to say to both Dolly and William, thanks very much from all of us for everything that you have done, everything that you do, and, indeed, being so hale, hearty and committed, everything that you will keep on doing for the Labour Party in the future. (Applause)Comrades, now that everyone has had an opportunity to digest the results of Sunday night, I should like to thank you again for your support.You know that my feeling about the leadership election was that it was an unnecessary distraction from our work in the party. (Applause)But the fact is, asked for or not, elections have results and results give mandates.That mandate was given democratically and it will be used democratically. It will be used very deliberately and very directly for the purpose for which I believe it was given to me by people right across the Labour movement.The purpose of unity.The purpose of change.The purpose of doing everything that can be done to secure victory for this party at the next general election. That is why I was given this mandate. I was given the mandate, too - and this is how I will serve it - in order to pursue the democratic socialist values of this movement and the social and economic vision which arises from those values.We are socialists, we are rationalists.Our vision is insight, not a mirage.We have strong ideals, but our idealism is not naivety. We do not pretend that the world is as it is not.We have a dream, but we are not dreamers.We do not simply desire ends. We understand the necessity of committing means and it is precisely that which produces our commitment to social justice and to economic efficiency.There are those, of course, like the present government, who consider social justice to be an impediment to economic efficiency. There are some - including, from what they say, some in our movement - who consider economic efficiency to be a threat to social justice.Both are wrong.The simple fact is that sustained social justice depends upon a foundation of economic prosperity and economic success cannot be properly achieved without social justice.Justice and efficiency - the two go together.Of course, you can get some costs down, you can get some profits up, you can get some form of efficiency by ignoring social justice. You can say that you are slimming down, sharpening up, shaking out, and call it efficiency. But if in the process you shut down 30 per cent of your country's manufacturing capacity, if you refuse to modernise training or invest in science, if you have generated all the costs and losses of mass unemployment, if you have kept your interest rates and your currency at a level which helps importers and harms exporters, then the efficiency you get is going to be limited, fragile and temporary.Similarly, you can - and should - have greater justice out of better distribution. You can - and should - use what you have got more fairly. You can - and should - take the most from those who are best off and give the most to those who are worst off. All that is essential. But it is not enough by itself. Unless the policies of justice and generosity are built on the foundation of vitality of production, efficiency of production, expansion of production, they will not last very long. Those policies of justice and generosity will die for lack of sustenance, lack of means.Justice and efficiency. They are interdependent.The proof of that abounds.Education and training provide the most obvious examples. That is not recognised in practice by a government whose commitment to training is a fraction of that of our competitors. It is not recognised at all by a government whose education policy is to opt out schools under a cabinet that has altogether opted out of state education. (Applause)They refuse to recognise that you cannot have an efficient economy if you waste the potential of the people. And you cannot have a fair society either.If we want fairness and efficiency, we shall, for instance, have to break the historic habit of regarding girls and women as second class citizens in so many spheres of education, training and employment. (Applause)We shall have to stop treating child-bearing and child-rearing as a disqualification from opportunities.We shall have to stop treating the provision of childcare as a privilege and a luxury and start to treat it as a right and a necessity. (Applause)And if, in this modern economy with the changing shape of its workforce and the changing conditions, demands and realities of work, we are to ensure that women have the opportunity to reach their full potential, part-time workers must have full-time rights when it comes to training, social security support and health and safety at work. (Applause)Justice argues for that. So does efficiency. For there is no stimulus to advance in poverty wages, low skills, bad conditions, exploitation, insecurity. All of those are an inducement to employers not to make the commitment to investment, modernisation and development. It is folly for anybody to assume that you can secure economic success in a low-tech, no tech, low-wage economy. That is the opposite of justice and the opposite of efficiency for both sexes. And it doesn\u2019t work.That is the test that we apply. Not just in our criticism and condemnation of the sweatshop, but in our judgment in the whole shape of the economy.For some people, judgment of the shape of the economy is very easy.There are those, like the government, who simply say \u2018private good, public bad.\u2019There are those who say, in a mirror image, \u2018public good, private bad.\u2019Neither of them are dealing with the realities.Neither of them are applying the real test, the real judgment of the shape and performance of industry. Neither are asking the real question \u2018does it work?\u2019But that test is applied elsewhere.It is applied in Germany, in Japan, in Sweden, in France. In all of those countries they appreciated long ago that public and private sectors, government and market, had to work in combination if the strength of the economy was to be developed and the potential of the economy to be maximised.It is that combination that works.And we have to make it work for us in Britain through all the instruments available. Through social ownership in all its forces, great and small.Through regulation to protect consumers, the environment, health and safety conditions both of workers and - we remind ourselves in this year of the King\u2019s Cross disaster - of the public as well.We must use the instruments of strategic investment in training, in science, in research and development.All of that is essential to strengthening a British economy that is underinvested, underperforming and carrying a huge trade deficit.Some of those weaknesses are chronic. Some are acute and recent. They\u2019ve come about despite the enormous oil bonus.The weaknesses would be serious in any circumstances. They would present great challenges at any time. But now we are facing the extra pressure and contests that arise from the completion of the European Community single market.The Tories\u2019 preparation for that huge change has been pathetically inadequate. It has consisted of a £9 million advertising campaign and a few business breakfasts.For the Tories the single market is nothing more than a free capital market. They ignore industry\u2019s needs whether those needs are for modern training support, for science funding or for a competitive, pound to give our exporters a fighting chance in the rest of the European Community.Patently, our producers have not had that chance. When Margaret Thatcher became Prime Minister in 1979 we had a balance of payments surplus with the remainder of the European Community of nearly £1 billion. But what is not advertised as we approach that single market is that we now have a deficit with the other countries of the European Community of £14 billion. In those circumstances, we patently have not been prepared, we are patently at a disadvantage, made all the greater by the fact that our major competitors in the Community market have been making strategic preparation, sector by sector preparation, industry by industry preparation, to see what advantage they can secure.But apart from the absence of preparation, the government resent and resist the social obligations arising from the creation of the singleIt is the hostility to that social dimension which has produced the Prime Minister\u2019s play acting in recent weeks.This is the Prime Minister who whipped and guillotined the Single European Act through the House of Commons in 1985 specifically to spur the move to the single market. So it is no good her playing Boadicea now when she sold the pass three years ago. (Applause)The intensity of Margaret Thatcher's hostility to the very concept of the social dimension disgusts even Conservatives in Europe. They should understand that the very idea of \u2018community\u2019 makes Margaret Thatcher recoil.Our attitude is very different. We want Europe to be a community as well as a market. We want that market to work for people, not the other way round. We want continuing common strategies for expansion across the Community in place of the Eurosclerosis that leaves 18 million workers in that single market unemployed.And we want all that because we insist on social justice as well as economic efficiency.That insistence is put by democratic socialists right across the continent. In the TUC last month, Jacques Delors said: \u2018The European Community will be characterised by co-operation as well as competition. It will encourage individual initiative as well as solidarity. It would be unacceptable for Europe to become a source of social regression, while we are trying to rediscover together the road to prosperity and employment.\u2019 Of course, Delors was right.If a single market is created that extends across half the continent of Europe and the requirements of social justice are not installed as a central component in that venture, then the fruits of economic efficiency will be scooped up by a few countries - indeed, a few regions in a few countries. We will then be left with two Europes: rich and poor, congested and neglected, over-developed and under­developed - and I mean under-developed in the most literal sense.None of that would be just. Certainly, none of it would be efficient. It would be expensive, ugly, a constant cause of waste, a constant source of tensions between peoples. That is why we say that the social dimension of the, single market must be central to the prospectus and to the practice of the European Community.Social Europe must mean getting the highest standards of working conditions and workers\u2019 rights right across that single market.It must mean raising pensions and benefits to European standards. British pensioners will know how far they lag behind their contemporaries in the rest of the European Community. It is a source of shame. (Applause)It must mean, in this multinational market, tough anti-trust laws firmly enforced by domestic governments and by the Community itself in order to protect the consumer against monopoly and monopoly practices.It must mean substantial social and regional funds to counteract the market\u2019s inevitable pull of wealth, production and jobs towards the centre.And social Europe must mean the root and branch reform of the Common Agricultural Policy which is unsustainable in terms of justice and efficiency. (Applause)It is clear, too, in this neighbourhood of Europe, where distances get smaller and contact gets greater, where the idea of community with diversity gets clearer, that we live cheek by jowl and social Europe must mean community action to safeguard, to protect and conserve the environment: land, sea and air.In the name of social justice and economic efficiency we insist upon all of that. Nowhere is that insistence stronger than in policy on the environment.Perhaps, here at least is some conjunction with the Prime Minister after her speech last week.She is aroused to the environment.It took many people so much by surprise that there was talk of administering a drug test! (Applause)The arousal has been a long time coming.She has had nine years of power. Nine years in which the hazardous waste imported into this country has increased tenfold because the British government of Margaret Thatcher has kept standards of monitoring, checking and storage so low that firms in Britain can actually undercut firms in the remainder of the European Community. (Applause)In her nine years in power the government has consistently weakened and blocked European moves to control industrial emissions and to improve the quality of water in the reservoirs, rivers and in the sea around our coasts.In her nine years of power, the National Environmental Research Council has had its grant cut. So much so that a scientist, commenting last week on Mrs Thatcher\u2019s remarks, said, \u2018To be a scientist in Britain now is to know what it felt like to be a Christian in ancient Rome.\u2019 (Applause)Perhaps after the speech to the Royal Society last week the sinner repenteth. And we, being generous spirits, will rejoice - not necessarily in heaven but in Blackpool - which is the next best thing, I am told. If the sinner repenteth, if there really is a change, we welcome it.But if there really is a change of heart it produces a basic question that Mrs Thatcher must answer.She must tell us and the country how she thinks it is possible to protect the local, the national, the international environment from the poisoning and pillaging now going on by relying on the mechanisms of the market which she so much admires. How will it be possible for that to be done? (Applause)If she is going to rely solely or mainly on the willingness of the market to tend to the great strategic issues of cleaning and conserving the environment, then the lady is not serious.To be serious she will have to respond to the calls that we have made together with Greenpeace, SERA, Friends of the Earth and many other lobbies and bodies anxious to conserve and develop, improve and protect the environment. We have made calls for investment in science, more prosaic calls for the repair of the sewers of Britain, calls for cleaning up the beaches, controlling the industrial filth that is thrown into the sky and into the sea because there is totally inadequate control.If the Prime Minister really is serious about her commitment, she will have to respond to the repeated calls for urgent action and new legislation to control pesticides, to control the import of waste, to control and prevent dumping at sea and to reduce atmospheric pollution.The Prime Minister can soon produce tangible proof of her intent. She can incorporate all of those demands that I listed and a few more in the Queen\u2019s Speech next month. She can make the absolute commitment to comprehensive legislation. She can do it very quickly. We would support that legislation gladly: We want it, we have argued for it.And we want some answers to some questions as well:Since the Prime Minister claims such zeal for the protection of the environment, is she going to introduce new regulations to stop the development sprawl into the green belt in the south-east and elsewhere in Britain? (Applause) Is she going to stop Ridley\u2019s raiders spraying concrete over this green and pleasant land?For it is a fact that her successive secretaries of state for the environment have softened, dissolved, effectively removed the assortment of circulars and regulations that gave communities the ­right to protect themselves against speculative development and urban sprawl. They, in the name of the market, have taken that away. If the Prime Minister is serious, for the sake of consistency, she will not just nave to restore powers that previously existed, she will have to make them modern and absolute as we would.The Prime Minister has another question to answer. Is she going to provide local authorities with new resources, extra rate support grant, for urban improvement instead of punishing those local authorities who have tried to do their best to protect, develop and improve their urban environment? (Applause) You cannot be an environment enthusiast and a rate-capper.Is she going to cancel water privatisation? Surely, anyone so evangelical about the environment as the Prime Minister could not possibly contemplate handing the supply and safety of water to owners who are only going to consider quality after they have decided what profit they need to take. (Applause)Is the Prime Minister going to cancel electricity privatisation? Surely, anyone with her fervour about the environment could not possibly transfer control over nuclear energy, over the burning of fossil fuels, over the conditions of production and supply and price to owners of the industry who, by definition, will have to put profit first.Surely, no one with her newfound fervour for safeguarding the environment of Britain could contemplate any act of privatisation that would result in the extensive ownership and control of water and electricity - two fundamentals of life - to commercial interests that either do not belong to this country or are not interested in this country or both. How can that kind of control be handed to people who will never have to live with the consequences?There is, of course, one other great requirement for anyone expressing serious concern about the environment. It is that they do everything possible to ensure that the poor countries of the world - the poor countries whose poverty itself is a major cause of environmental degradation - are helped out of their agony. (Applause) If Margaret Thatcher is going to do that, the very least she has to do is to double the current level of overseas development aid, for her government, in nine years, have cut it in half. (Applause)Mrs. Thatcher has been to Africa. Geoffrey Howe has been to the north Kenyan desert. So it is not as if they have not witnessed the consequences of people so poor that they have actually got to kill the earth from which they live, by over-grazing, over-farming, without any adequate support, without adequate investment, without adequate tools, without irrigation. The land is so over-used that they know that in the very act of feeding their families today they are beckoning famine for their families tomorrow.That has not happened because of carelessness. It has not happened because of incompetence. These are some of the most skilled farmers in the world - most of them women, naturally. It has happened because of the intensity of cultivation that they have been forced into because of their poverty.If Margaret Thatcher is serious about the world\u2019s environment, as she said, if she thinks that it is \u2018the great challenge\u2019 of the last part of this century and of the next century, she has got to provide money to ensure that people can save their lives and the lives of their families by having the resources to care for the earth that feeds them. (Applause)If she did that it would be social justice and economic efficiency on a global scale.We need that in our international relationships just as much as we need it in our national life. For if social justice and economic efficiency are not the ruling values of our society, where does our society go?Many people are asking that. They say, \u2018What is happening to our country and what is going to happen to our country?\u2019Anne Holmes is here. She was our candidate in Kensington. People who had never voted Labour before voted Labour because they were asking this question as they witnessed the great divide - not the north-south divide, the south-south divide that fractures the south of Britain as Britain is divided north to south. These were prosperous people concerned about what was happening in their society around them and what is happening to our country.The answer is that unless we apply the policies of social justice and economic efficiency to create wealth, and unless we apply those policies to use that wealth to create a fairer society in Britain, then Britain inevitably goes further along the path that it is set upon now. It goes further along the path to a split society.It goes further towards a community divided into three unequal parts - a small, opulent superclass at the top; a larger class of people living in reasonable but sometimes anxious affluence in the middle - especially those at the bottom end of that central class who are subject to the pressures of a credit-driven economy; and at the bottom a third class, an underclass of people living in dire need.I am not describing some distant tomorrow, some awful decade away, I am describing Britain now.In Britain now nearly nine million men, women and children live on supplementary benefit. Another nine million live on low pay. That is one in three of the population, 18 million people on poverty level, whether they earn those desperately low wages or are thrust into poverty because of unemployment, illness or disability and are confined to the dependence on what the government chose to hand out to them in their social security system.By 1991, that underclass will be even bigger - 22 million men, women and children - and they suffer all of the social and civil disadvantages that go with their low incomes. Our society is disfigured and endangered by such great poverty.To their credit, many who are not poor understand that. They understand, too, that a society with such great and growing differences in personal economic conditions is unlikely to be a society at peace with itself. It is an insecure society. That is what we have now.The expressions of insecurity take many forms. They include increasing family break-up, increasing neurotic stress and breakdown, poverty and homelessness, crimes of sexual abuse and robbery, drug and alcohol abuse, a huge rise in violence for criminal ends and - incredibly and terrifyingly - a spread in violence for entertainment, whether it is in football crowds or in quiet country towns on a Saturday night.Of course, no one could or would blame the government for all that. But it is impossible to accept that there is no connection between the fracturing of our society and the grabbing \u2018loadsamoney\u2019 ethic encouraged by a government that treats care as \u2018drooling,\u2019 compassion as \u2018wet.\u2019 A government led by a Prime Minister who says that \u2018There is no such thing as society.\u2019\u2018No such thing as society,\u2019 she says.No obligation to the community.No sense of solidarity.No principles of sharing or caring.\u2018No such thing as society.\u2019No sisterhood, no brotherhood.No neighbourhood.No honouring other people\u2019s mothers and fathers.No succouring other people\u2019s little children.\u2018No such thing as society.\u2019No number other than one.No person other than me.No time other than now.No such thing as society, just \u2018me\u2019 and \u2018now.\u2019That is Margaret Thatcher's society. (Applause)I tell you, you cannot run a country on the basis of \u2018me\u2019 and \u2018now.\u2019You cannot run domestic policy on that basis, and you certainly cannot run international policy on that basis. Nowhere is that more obvious than in defence policies.Margaret Thatcher tries to operate \u2018me\u2019 and \u2018now\u2019 politics at every level. Thankfully, other leaders do not share her narrowness or her lack of vision.The relationship between the superpowers has been changing radically since Reykjavik. But it is in the year since we last met at conference that that changed relationship has manifested itself in tangible form, with the treaty to remove intermediate nuclear weapons.That relationship, whatever the outcome of the presidential elections in the United States of America, will be further developed by the reduction in strategic nuclear arms and it will be strengthened by agreements on conventional force reductions.Those changes have taken place partly because of the fact that Mikhail Gorbachev and - I guess you never thought you would hear it from this platform - Ronald Reagan, too, had the courage and wisdom to take initiatives that grew, according to their own testimony, from the fact that they as individuals and as leaders they have accepted the moral arguments against nuclear weapons that we, and many like us across the world, have been putting for three decades and more.When Mikhail Gorbachev and Ronald Reagan say that we have \u2018entered the age of nuclear disarmament,\u2019 then there are opportunities for clearing countries and continents of nuclear weapons that have not existed at any time since NATO and the Warsaw Pact became nuclear powers.That is why we must encourage all new steps, celebrate all new achievements and seek the power to participate in that process to end dependence on nuclear weapons anywhere in the world. That is what we must do. (Applause)That power, as is obvious to everyone, can only be attained, only be exercised in government.For everyone here and throughout the Labour movement knows that if we do not get the power of government, the consequence will be that Trident will definitely be completed and deployed, and, in addition, other systems will be multiplied under the guise of \u2018modernisation.\u2019To win power is to have the means of achieving a non-nuclear defence policy ourselves and securing the reduction in the nuclear weapons systems of others.Not to win power is to make certain the increase of nuclear arms by a Tory government that wants more of such arms and not less.This party, I am certain, wants to be part of the process of nuclear disarmament. Indeed, this party wants to take a leading part in that process of nuclear disarmament.That is only possible in government. It is not possible out of government.When we conclude our review next year and when we resolve our policy for fighting the next General. Election, that policy must be serious about nuclear disarmament, serious about defence. Indeed, so serious about both objectives that we are capable of earning the democratic power to achieve them. (Applause)The whole policy review process is a challenge that we have given ourselves. Many welcome it and participate in it as a means of refining and refreshing the ways of applying our values in practice.Others are not so bold. They see the emphasis on individualism and on competitiveness and it sends them reaching for their slogans.\u2018We don\u2019t like all that talk about individualism,\u2019 they say.Frankly, I am amazed that any socialist can say that. Because to me there is no test for progress other than its impact on the individual.The great inspiration, the great distinction of democratic socialism is that it does not just desire the ends of individual liberty, individual identity, individual choice, it actually commits itself to collectively providing the means for the people to exercise their rights in practice.Let those who say that there is a collision between concern for the individual and commitment to collective provision understand this - that the whole purpose of such collective provision is the service, the safety, the care, the opportunity of the individual. (Applause)For democratic socialists, collective provision is a means not an end.The moment that the collective becomes an end in itself, a basic value is deserted and socialists deliver themselves into the hands of those who want to defame socialism as a creed of uniformity, of regimentation, of drab levelling down.We are none of those things. Our belief is in diversity, liberty, real freedom of choice and real freedom of chance, real freedoms that can be exercised because the means exist and are at the disposal of every person for the material and spiritual advance of all people.Be confident in that belief.The collective is the means not the end, and the end is the advancing, the nourishing, the encouragement, the succouring, the reward of the merit of the individual.Be confident in that belief, for it is individualism without the Tory grub of greed.And what about this problem that some people say they have with the idea of competitiveness?What do they want? An uncompetitive economy?Is anyone going around deliberately looking for a job in an uncompetitive firm?Is anybody trying deliberately to negotiate a bargain in order to bring about uncompetitiveness and the threat to jobs that goes with it. Of course they are not.Don\u2019t those who are afraid of accepting the commitment to competitiveness understand that we make calls - as we all do - for investment in science, in training, in roads and infrastructure, in regions, in education, we are not just demanding the means for social justice, we are also demanding the ingredients of competitiveness?Or are some people so defeatist, so short-sighted, so lacking in conviction that they believe the Tory propaganda that you can only get competitiveness by getting rid of workers, by shutting down firms, by pushing down wages?Of course, when we make these arguments about individualism and about competitiveness, we make the arguments as the consumers\u2019 party - as we always have been from the first day that the first socialist demanded decent health care, decent houses, decent education. They are the basic requirements of consumption because they safeguard basic rights. We do not want those rights buried under bureaucracy or administration. We recognise the fact that all but the most powerful and tenacious individuals are puny when they are faced by an administration, a bureaucracy, a seller much bigger than they in power and stature. That is why we are and always have been, the consumer\u2019s party.But when we speak of those things, when we make those arguments about individuals and consumers and competitiveness it is not long before we hear people in the movement saying that we are proposing \u2018to run the capitalist economy better than the Tories.\u2019Comrades, the day may come when this conference, this movement, is faced with a choice of socialist economies. The debate will be fascinating as the Labour Party conference chooses between the two.But until that day comes, when that choice of socialist economies is actually presented, actually in existence, the fact that the kind of economy that we will be faced with when we win the election will be a, market economy. That is what we have to deal with and we will have to make it work better than the Tories do. (Applause)By better, we mean that we combat unemployment, we make the commitment to training, we make the commitment to investment, to paying proper pensions, to funding the National Health Service.Even after that has been the implemented programme of a Labour government for years, there will still be a market, still be a market economy. What will be different will be the condition of the people who have had the chance to train, who will have been engaged in the new industries, who will have benefited not just from the greater production but from the fairer distribution that it finances. That will be applying our values, our vision in practice instead of just talking about it.There is no \u2018slide to the right\u2019 in that.There is no \u2018concession to Thatcherism\u2019 in any of that.In any case, let me tell this party what so many in this party tell me: the greatest concession to Thatcherism is to let it win again. That is the ultimate concession. (Applause)Those who are afraid of developing the alternatives that will gain the support of the British people, those who say that they do not want victory at such a price had better ask themselves: if they will not pay that price for winning, what price are they prepared to pay for losing? And who are they prepared to see pay that price? (Applause)Because I tell you this - the price of defeat is not paid by the people on this platform or even in this hall.The price is paid by the poor.We feel disappointment, frustration, anger when we are beaten. We feel all that.But we will not have to live on poverty pensions.We will not have to go creeping and crawling to the social fund. We will not have to wait in dead end training.We will not have to live on low pay - at least, not most of us here. There are some low-paid workers here paying the price of defeat. Not the rest of us.I am heartily sick of seeing the victims who pay the price of our defeat.I am heartily sick of meeting people in anguish and having nothing to offer them but sympathy and solidarity when I know we should have the power to give them real hope, real support, real backing, real opportunities. (Applause)It is not just here. It is not just those 13 million people living in poverty in Britain who pay the price. Many more pay the price - women, men and children. There are millions beyond our shores.This year, Glenys and I went to Zambia, Zimbabwe, Botswana and Mozambique. You might have seen it reported - because the journalists with us were hypnotised by a few minutes of exchange with a very frightened, very nervous soldier in the Zimbabwean army.But that day we had been to Mozambique. That day we had been to two villages in central Mozambique: Chimoio and Inhaminga. Chimoio and Inhaminga are railway villages where the people in their thousands are starving. Not because of floods. Not because of drought: Not because of some dreadful natural catastrophe. They are starving in that village because their village has been isolated by the attacks of the terrorists of RENAMO financed by the South African government.As Glenys and I got into the square we saw a thousand starving children, not one of them with anything remotely resembling normal clothing. Indeed, Glenys and some of the journalists saw children wearing tree bark, women wearing parachute silk, escaped slaves from RENAMO, women who could testify on the day that they escaped to journalists that the parachute silk had come from ammunition boxes that they had carried from South African submarines on a beach in Mozambique.At Chimoio we met an old man in his sixties with his nose and ears clipped off. He had been mutilated because he was the secretary of FRELIMO in his village.And yet we have a Prime Minister who says that sanctions against the state that sponsors the terrorism that commits those atrocities against children and old men and old women would be \u2018immoral.\u2019I say to you when we do not win, it is not just the wretched of our country, the poor and the needy of our country who lose, it is people far away, human being who need to have in Britain a Labour government committed nationally and internationally to the cause of social justice.Any time anybody is tempted to pass a resolution, to make a statement, to conduct a vote, to hold a demo that a moment\u2019s thought would teach them would obscure the true nature, the identity, the effort to gain attention for the policies of the Labour Party, let them pause and think of the people they meet in their Saturday morning surgeries, or the people who might live next door to them, or the kids in Chimoio and Inhaminga who need a government of social justice.If we remember these things in this movement, out of it will come a solidarity and a unity that makes us an attractive force and a mighty force.It is for those reasons that I listen to the people of our party in their thousands who tell us to get on with compiling the policies that will appeal to the people, that will win us power to apply our principles of social justice and our plans of economic efficiency.I am certain - more certain now than I have ever been - that that is what the people of our party, the people who support our party, the people who want to support our party are looking to us for.Let us do it. (Applause)

aVDavid, comrades, as a concession to the Chair I have actually taken my watch off, put it in front of me and now I can cheerfully forget it, (Laughter)We meet in this conference in a spirit of progress; we meet in a spirit of confidence. The people of Britain know that we have worked for and earned the support that they are now giving to us. They respect us for the changes that we have made and the changes that we are making. Increasingly, they know that we are attuned to the realities of the present and increasingly they are prepared to trust us with the future. People tell me that, when I meet them. The polls say that when we read them. But most important of all, we know that we are winning support and understanding and trust because the people tell us when they vote.They told us that in Pontypridd and the Vale of Glamorgan; they told us that in Vauxhall and in Glasgow Central. They told us that in the county council elections, and all over Britain, in that magnificent victory on 15 June they told us that in the elections for the European Parliament. (Applause) They keep on telling us and telling the Labour Party \u2013 \u2018You\u2019re doing the right thing. Keep on doing it.\u2019 We will keep on doing it.We will keep on because it is the winning way. It is the best way to serve the people we want to stand up for. We will keep on winning. And we will do it with no wheeling, no dealing, no horse trading and no electoral pacts. (Applause)We will put ourselves to the people and we will go on getting their support. We will get it by continuing to construct strong unity of purpose. We will get it by our conduct as a serious, socialist, self-disciplined party. We will go on earning support by having the same candour and confidence that we showed in facing up to ourselves and our times in the policy review. We will get the support by continuing to produce answers that are relevant and practical for the present and for the future, answers that offer the kind of socialism that the people of Britain want. The kind of socialism that insists that the National Health Service shall not be split up, sold off, privatised, sent to the market, but shall be kept and improved and modernised as a service free of charge at time of need for all the people of this country. (Applause)The kind of socialism that the British people understand and support is the kind of socialism that resents the injustice, the cost and the divisiveness of the Poll Tax, that demands a local tax that is fair between people and regions, related to the ability to pay and, for those on low incomes, includes a fair system of rebates to insure against the injustice of tax.The kind of socialism that the British people are attracted by and understand and support is the socialism that takes its inspiration from individual freedom and the right to organise and bargain in freedom collectively. They support that kind of socialism and, they resent the centralisation, censorship and control that in the past ten years has given the state more power over the life of the individual in Britain than at any time in modern peacetime history. They do not want that. (Applause)The kind of socialism that the people of Britain understand and support is as Tawney described: in the 1930s, in the wake of defeat and division in the Labour Party, he said: \u2018Socialism is no longer bad politics in Britain unless socialists choose to make it so, which some do with a surprising ingenuity. \u2018Nevertheless,\u2019 he went on with the right combination of \u2018a realism that is not torpor and an idealism that is not foolishness,\u2019 the Labour Party, a socialist party, is unstoppable because its natural constituency is the majority of the British people. That was true then and it is true now. That is why we are getting the support for the kind of socialism that we are offering to the British people.Of course the Tories will try to hit back. They will do it in a variety of ways. First of all, there will be the personal attacks on the Labour leaders. It will not be anything serious \u2013 nothing like as serious, for instance, as the personal attacks they make every week of every year on the pensioners, the poor, the homeless and families with children. They are real personal attacks. They really hurt.The next part of the counter-attack will be to order civil servants to waste thousands of hours of time trying to \u2018cost\u2019 our programme. They will push those figures, collected at the taxpayers\u2019 expense - such is the nature of the modern Tory state - through the counterfeit machine in Tory Central Office. You are very familiar with the procedure: it is the one that they have perfected for the purpose of calculating the employment figures, the unemployment figures and Lawson\u2019s Budget estimates. (Applause)Then there is their secret weapon, the Team. They have got themselves a Team. It was announced last week. Next week, if you should be over 18 and very stable of mind, put the television on and watch them up at Blackpool. On the back of the stage there will be the slogan \u2018The Right Team for the Future\u2019 - Margaret Thatcher\u2019s Team. That is a bit of a confusion in terms, is it not? (Laughter) It is like Dennis Skinner\u2019s shyness or David Owen\u2019s legions, a real confusion in terms.They have that Team. It is difficult to envisage it really, but since dray horses come in teams, and donkeys and sled dogs come in teams, I suppose the Tories can have a team as well. You can see it now can you not? The huskies dashing across the icy wastes, eagerly and unquestioningly, with the driver holding a whip over them, saying \u2018Mush, mush.\u2019 (Applause) And you know what huskies do, if one of them drops dead don\u2019t you? The rest of them eat him. (Laughter) That is the Tory team spirit.Of course there is a lead dog. The top dog in the team is the Chairman of the Conservative Party, Kenneth Baker. Theirs must be the only political organisation in any democracy in which a move from being in charge of education to being in charge of propaganda is regarded as a promotion. (Laughter and applause)It would not happen anywhere else. He has got that job because he is supposed to be a master strategist. At least that is right. What else could you call a man who presides over education for three years and then, just eight weeks before the country finds out that we are 3,600 teachers short, gets another job? That is a master strategist. He really is a quite brilliant mover. He is the man who invented the Poll Tax and then moved on before it caught up with him.He was appointed, of course, by the Prime Minister. She is a very considerate person really. There are people who say she is very remote and detached. I will not have that said about Mrs Thatcher. I have seen her rubbing shoulders with crowds, talking to children, travelling on a train. Pity it was in Japan. (Laughter and applause)They gave her a lovely reception. They had all the bands out, red carpets. But let\u2019s face it: if we had a relationship with a country and they had had a £1 billion trade deficit with us in 1979 and now they had a 5 billion trade deficit with us, I would give them the red carpet treatment. They could have my ticket for the Arms Park. There would be nothing too big.Japan is a fairly good place to go to to listen and to learn. That did not happen when Mrs Thatcher went there. As usual, Mrs Thatcher went there to lecture. She went to instruct the Japanese that if only they would de-regulate, implement free trade policies and remove exchange controls, they too could enjoy the same level of unbounded success as Britain has under Mrs Thatcher. That is what she was telling them. (Applause) She told them - and she tells us - that we have been enjoying an economic \u2018miracle.\u2019 Nigel Lawson says the same, that we are enjoying a \u2018miracle.\u2019 The Sun, the Daily Mail and even some of the newspapers say the same thing. (Laughter) I suppose it is a miracle of a sort, because if you think about it, when Moses parted the Red Sea and took the children of Israel across, that was a miracle. The trouble was that in the middle of the same miracle along came Pharoah\u2019s army. They got onto the bottom of the Red Sea and it all closed in on them: We have been going through this miracle from the Pharoah\u2019s army eye-view.But it has been a miracle, truly. We have had oil wealth that none of our major competitor countries has had. At the end of that ten years, Britain has got two million unemployed still - recorded unemployed - the highest inflation rate of any industrialised country, the highest interest rates of any industrialised country, the biggest balance of payments deficit by far of any industrialised country and, to go with it, something that is not too frequently disclosed, a huge net outflow of long term capital. We get lots of money in, because we are offering 14 per cent. It stays for a short time and then moves around, but there is lots going out - incredible for an oil-rich country, but happening under our \u2018brilliant Chancellor\u2019 and our genius business managers. Even with that litany, that is not the worst news. The worst news is that underlying those figures of failure - indeed causing those conditions - is the Tories\u2019 refusal, year after year, to make the essential commitment to the productive base of the economy: education and training, research and development, science and the transport and communications system are all objects of gross neglect. We are the only major industrialised country that in the last ten years has continually spent a lower and lower proportion of our gross national product on education; everybody, else has been increasing it. Where could be the sense in that?The result of all that was always certain to be an unbalanced economy, under-equipped, under-skilled, inflating and increasingly importing. Britain was bound to become a place of paralysing congestion in some areas, of miserable underdevelopment in others. A place of inefficiency and - yes - because of the neglect of public investment, a place of considerable danger too for the travelling public and for people who work in those industries, as we have seen so tragically demonstrated. That is where they have got us to now.They have not finished yet. They have still got two years or so to run, which will get us nearly all the way through the time left before the completion of the Single Market of the European Community at the end of 1992.That is going to be a delight, is it not? We shall be part of an open economic zone, operating in a currency exchange rate mechanism in which the pound will be included and subject to even more intensive and direct competition from the other European Community countries than at the present time. And they are countries that all have made and do make a much stronger commitment to skills, research, transport and science than we have under a Tory government. The British government has done absolutely nothing to prepare our country or our people for the challenges or the opportunities of that new Europe. That is the mess they are going to leave to us, because sometime before the completion of the Single Market we shall have a Labour government.The fact that we shall inherit a mess is nothing really new for us; indeed, every incoming Labour government has inherited a mess from every outgoing Tory government. The only difference is that next time the mess will be even bigger - I say to you soberly, even bigger than the mess has ever been before.No one here or anywhere else should have any doubt about that or the scale of what we shall inherit. No one here or anywhere else should fail to understand that those conditions that we inherit will have the most direct implications for what we do. We are therefore going to have to be very deliberate in our choice of priorities and, having chosen them, we are going to have to stick to those priorities. And we will.Everyone should understand too that if we do anything other than to choose priorities, no matter how tough they are and stick to them, the result will be that we shall set ourselves the task of doing everything that is desirable and end up doing nothing that is significant. (Applause)I do not say that because I am daunted. I do not feel in the least bit defeatist about what I know we shall face, neither do the rest of the people who will form that government, nor indeed the other people in the Parliamentary Labour Party. Nor should you feel daunted; on the contrary.Without any vainglory say that there have been times before when our party has been called in similar circumstances to work for our country in government, generally in dreadful circumstances, circumstances that would have torn a Tory government apart and retarded Britain even further. There are various versions of the history of the Labour Party in government. None of them records any Labour government or any Labour minister as being perfect. But what I would say is that they were patriotic and did their damnedest for their country in a way that no single Tory Cabinet Minister in the bunch that we have got now would think of doing. (Applause) I do not say any of that about what we shall inherit because I am intimidated by the prospect. I tell you and the British people that because it is the truth.There is another truth too. There is no easy mechanism, no single, solve-all strategy that can catapult Britain to economic strength. That has been Nigel Lawson\u2019s fad over the years, even though he has changed his single instrument once or twice.Success has got to be worked for and it has to be built. That is why we are going to start to do what the Tories should have been doing in these oil-rich years.We are going to start to combat the transport congestion and make the investment in communications, without which Britain will judder to an expensive and dangerous halt in a very few years. We will get on with that job.We are going to build up the commitment to science, because if we carry on like we are under the Tories, Britain will be pushed down into the second or third division of the industrial nations.We are going to develop inducements and encouragements for a major expansion of research and development in both the public and private sector, because if we are going to rival our major competitors, we have got a long way to go in catching up with them.Most important of all, we have got to increase the quality and quantity of skills training and make a new commitment to education in this country.The reason for that is very simple. Now and for all time in the future, human skills and human talents will be the major determinants of success or failure, not just for individuals, but for the whole society in all its social, cultural and commercial life. Education and training are now the commanding, heights of every modern economy. We must mobilise all of the available abilities \u2013 and I mean all.In the future which we envisage, therefore, there can be no question of allowing disadvantages in opportunity and access to be suffered by women. (Applause) We need an economy of all the talents. To get that, we are going to have to make provision to ensure that, for the very best reasons of social justice and economic efficiency, equal rights of education and training are guaranteed and the opportunities are made genuinely accessible by providing support, especially for mothers with children, so that they can enjoy those equal rights in reality. (Applause)Comrades, research and development, transport and communications, science, education and training are our priorities. They are the productive base of our economy; they are fundamental to success in the future. If we are to combat inflation, if we are to turn that balance of payments deficit into surplus, if we are to bring down unemployment, if we are to generate the wealth properly to fund and pay for the bills of social justice in a modern society, we are going to have to succeed in building up that base. It means giving that task an unparalleled priority. We will do that. That is the attitude that we will take. It is the practical way.We know it is the practical way, because it is the way that all of our successful competitors have done it. We know that it is the practical way too, because for the last ten years the other way has been tried, the Lawson way. Is that practical? Is it practical to have neglected and under-funded and run down the foundations of modern industrial strength in order to make tax cuts for the top paid in our country? When that culminates in a prodigious balance of payments deficit, is that practical? Is it practical to use the highest interest rates in the industrialised world to try to squeeze consumer demand when at the very same time those very same interest rates are hammering the very productive industries that we are depending upon to try to pay our way in the world? Is that practical?Everybody knows that as soon as the supports are shifted in any way, the pound will bounce around all over the place, making it virtually impossible for any company, any concern to plan production or to calculate prices with any certainty. What is all that supposed to achieve? Is the interest rate strategy there to buy us some time so that we can restructure British industry? Is it to buy us some time so that we can get some decent training for the youngsters? Is it to buy us some time so that we can negotiate a new deal in Europe? No, it is not for any of those reasons. The only reason we have got the interest rate strategy is because the Tories do not know what else to do. It is as basic as that.What they are hoping for of course, is that they can get to a few months before the next general election and then take the brakes off, make some tax cuts and try to deceive the people of Britain yet again that things are back on course. It will not work. It will not work for political reasons; it is one con-trick too far. It will not work for economic reasons either. You do not need to be an economist to know why. All you have to do to know why it will not work economically is to have to pay a mortgage. Those monthly bills are certificates of the failure of Lawsonism.Nigel Lawson does not see it that way. He says people with mortgages may be finding \u2018a little difficulty,\u2019 but that little difficulty, he says, will be \u2018self-correcting\u2019 and we can all look forward to \u2018a soft landing.\u2019 At least he is equipped for that. (Laughter) But if he is in orbit, anticipating a soft landing, nobody else is. If he does not understand the reality of what he has done to people\u2019s mortgage payments, he should ask his erstwhile chum, the man who was Chief of Staff at the Tory Central Office in the 1987 election. He was writing in the I last week. \u2018Home owners feel cheated,\u2019 he said. \u2018Today, they are paying more and more in mortgage repayments for houses that are worth less and less in the market. And those needing to move home too often have to make a marriage-wrenching gamble as the housing market becomes as slippery and dangerous as Brands Hatch on a wet Saturday afternoon.\u2019 That is Tory property-owning democracy 1989.These home-buyers are not the only victims of course. Thousands of elderly people were pleased when this government said they wanted them to make extra provision for their retirement. They liked that idea. But the government did not tell them they were going to slash Housing Benefit, and they did not tell them that in order to make provision for their retirement many of them were going to have either to mortgage or sell the houses that they had spent a lifetime paying for The greatest victims of the Tories\u2019 big cheat in housing of course are those who are suffering because of the gigantic cuts made in house building and who are now in overcrowded accommodation or, in increasing numbers, homeless.The reason for all that, obviously, is that the Tories never really had a policy for homes; they only ever had a policy for property. It is not the same thing. The Tories never really had a policy for building and renovating or for providing people with real choice between buying or renting. They only ever had a policy really for selling. In this party, we want people to be able to buy houses. That is very important. We want them to be able to buy the houses they previously rented, either in the public sector or the private sector, if that is what they want to do. But what is essential is that they should be able to afford the homes that they buy or rent, and it is essential that if they do not want to buy a house or cannot buy a house, they should still have a residence that they are proud to call home. (Applause)There are very few things quite as reassuring and quite as secure as a home, bought or rented, that you know is safe and you know you can afford. There are very few things more intimidating and frightening than having the responsibility of a home that is not safe and that you cannot afford. People are going through agony in Britain now, people who 18 months or two years ago thought that they were secure and making their way, but have been hit, almost as if they were being assassinated, by the Tory interest rate strategy. That is Tory property-owning democracy 1989.In this party we have got a housing policy, a real housing policy. One that provides for buying and for renting, building and renovating. One that insists not only on quantity but on quality. One that protects consumers whether they are buyers or tenants, in the private or the public sector. And it is a housing policy that is capable of meeting the needs of the future. That is the policy that we offer to the British people, and we offer it in place of the deceit and double dealing that made so many people feel that they had been cheated by the Tories.Of course, double-dealing is their stock-in-trade on any number of subjects. I saw a fellow in Risca in my constituency a fortnight ago. He was very, exercised about something I will not go into at the present time. \u2018Tories?\u2019 he said \u2018Tories are the kind of people who start off promising you the earth and end up selling you water.\u2019 That is not a bad definition. (Applause) They are not only trying to sell it; they are advertising it to you at your own expense. I think that is pretty rich. Do you know why they are having to advertise it and push it so hard? It is because nobody can understand why anybody should want to sell it, so they are having to flog and push and advertise. Water adverts and electricity adverts - I ask you. \u2018Electricity is a good thing for you.\u2019 I did not know that before. (Laughter) How did I miss out and not realise that water was good for me? A fellow in my office had his prospectus a fortnight ago from the Anglia Water Board. They said \u2018As a water user, we are giving you priority.\u2019 (Laughter and applause) When I see those adverts on the hoardings and the television, do you know what I am reminded of? Have you ever been in a town in the Soviet Union, especially a big town with those great boulevards? They have those huge, heroic hoardings with preposterous slogans and paintings of people with muscles on their muscles. You know the ones I mean. They have taken those down in Russia. They are putting them up in Britain. (Laughter and applause) They are putting them up for water and electricity, and I guess we shall go on seeing water ads. It has nothing to do with privatisation, you understand. It is just a coincidence, because a couple of months before water privatisation the regional boards decided that they needed to engage in some public relations. It was a total coincidence; they did not even know there was going to be water privatisation. So we\u2019ll continue to see these water ads. But I do not know how much we shall see of the electricity ads, for a few months in any case, because they have got into a total shambles with the effort to sell off electricity. A bigger shambles would only come if they actually managed to sell it off. Comrades, there, is a race against time. It is a race between the sale of electricity and the next Labour government.Indeed, if is a race between not only the privatisation of electricity, but the privatisation of the coal industry as well. Perhaps if they ever really do get around to putting together a Bill, the Privatisation of the Coal Industry Bill, they will at least have the honesty to put an accurate title on it, \u2018The Termination of the Coal Industry Bill,\u2019 for that is certainly what it would be. (Applause)Shambles or not, they are desperate to sell both water and electricity, not because they want to serve any sensible purpose of the economy or energy, the environment or any strategic purpose. On the contrary, selling either or both of those utilities contradicts every strategic, environmental, logical, industrial and reasonable purpose. The reason that the government is so anxiously obsessed with selling off these two industries is that they want the receipts so that they can bankroll themselves for the next general election. That is the real reason why they want to sell off electricity and water.They might succeed in getting under the wire before the election. They might succeed in doing that, but, frankly, it is not going to, help them very much at the ballot box, because there are huge majorities in every opinion poll against the sell-off of water and electricity. The reasons are simple. The British people are opposed to the sell-offs because they are more socially responsible, more community minded, more realistic, more far-sighted and more patriotic than the government that governs them. That is why they are against the sell-off of water and electricity. (Applause)The people know, as we know, that it is simply wrong to put vital: utilities of this kind into the hands of private monopolies, not least because we know - and the British people know - that the whole thrust of privatisation, collides head on with environmental concern.Privatisation of water and electricity also puts a great big gaping hole straight through the government\u2019s claim to be guardians of the environment. This government cannot prove green credentials simply by moving Nick Ridley - I am not saying anything about the disposal of toxic waste - and replacing him with a much better public relations merchant, Chris Patten, the slick following the Nick. (Laughter and applause) That does not prove green credentials. They do not prove green credentials even by introducing a Green Bill over a year after we offered to draft one for them.For the Tories to have any credibility at all as trustees of the environment, they are going to have to take a much bigger and more serious step. For them to have that credibility, they are going to have to change the whole basis of their philosophy.The central canon of Thatcherism is that the market is sovereign and that the earth and all that therein is should be governed by the magical movement of demand and supply. Whatever else you can look after with that system, you cannot look after the environment with such a system. (Applause) This essence of Thatcherism is dressed up as the Big Idea. The reality is that it is a very small, very cheap, very nasty idea. It is an old idea as well. Municipal Tories like Joe Chamberlain rejected it 100 years ago. They rejected it because they said that private monopoly ownership of utilities like water and gas were incompatible with the public good. They knew that 100 years ago, when enterprise capitalism in Britain was red in tooth and claw, a period when Margaret Thatcher would have regarded it as bliss to be alive. But she would not have got a Tory mandate then for water privatisation.Market sovereignty of the kind that Margaret Thatcher preaches is most certainly incompatible with the investment in research, the effective regulation, inspection, supervision, prevention, co-­operation and decentralisation of powers that are among the essential ingredients of a competent policy for the conservation and improvement of the local, national and global environment We understand the need to implement such comprehensive policies, and there are working examples to instruct us on many of the most salient objectives.In Denmark and Sweden two weeks ago I saw how the problem of refuse and the problem of heating homes were brought together to make a solution. Two problems making one solution. In Copenhagen, for instance, the city\u2019s refuse is incinerated in conditions which are subject to the most rigorously enforced and constantly improving environmental standards. The resulting heat combines with surplus heat from the city\u2019s other power-stations to warm 250,000 homes very cheaply and dependably. They have reduced by 30 per cent the energy needed to heat Copenhagen\u2019s homes over the past 10 years. The residue of the waste is 6 per cent of its original volume. That is a good deal. In a country like ours, where we have a huge amount of waste, some of it lethal and all of it ugly, we know we just cannot keep on piling it up. To serve the future properly we have got to adopt policies that are socially and economically functional and environmentally progressive. The innovations of the Swedes, the Danes and the Norwegians instruct us, and we shall be emulating and improving upon the developments that they have made.Those innovations go much wider than waste incineration. In the same visit I saw Volvo and SKF, the biggest ball-bearing manufacturer in the world - two companies as hard-nosed and competitive as any companies anywhere - implementing the environment policies worked out in conjunction with the government, local authorities, environmental groups and trade unions. Those companies are prospering, not in spite of the environmental conditions which they satisfy, but because of those conditions. That was the testimony of the companies. They acknowledge that the stimulus comes from the government that sets environmental targets and timetables to achieve them. The same companies told me that they bettered the targets and the timetables; they had reduced their waste and attained greater efficiency in the process, reducing marginal costs. They do not regard such government involvement as \u2018interfering.\u2019 In this and many other ways they consider government involvement to be normal and necessary.I am not describing perfection. I do not have the awe of a return visitor from an environmental Shangri La. I am not saying that what they have got is perfect; they would not accept that it was and certainly it is not. I am saying that in this country we could - and we must - make such progress in exactly the same way. In government we are determined to achieve that, and even in the couple of years before we are elected, we are going to use the evidence of those working models to campaign for the speediest possible change in our country, which is getting dirtier and more dangerous by the minute.There are some of course who believe that concern for the environment is largely a passing anxiety of the affluent who have nothing else to worry about. That is wrong on all counts. The concern is not passing. The concern is here to stay, and the only change will be that it will get bigger. Anybody who believes that the concern stops with the well-heeled has only to go to some of Britain\u2019s cities, where in the Thatcher years the rat population has grown substantially, not out of sympathy with the Conservative party, but because of changed eating habits and because of sewers that are in increasing disrepair, through no fault of the local authorities. In those and other areas, damp and disrepair are the greatest environmental concerns. A fellow said to me not very long ago, at the beginning of the summer before it really started to get warm, that he had terrible damp problems. It was just at the time that they started advertising water. He said, \u2018Be an H2Owner? I thought I had a monopoly \u2013 it\u2019s coining out of my walls.\u2019 The environmental concern runs right through all levels of society.It goes a great deal further than the people who are far from affluent in our towns and cities. The poorest people in the world are the most environmentally concerned. For them the problems of the environment are not questions relating to the welfare of the ozone layer in ten or 20 years\u2019 time. The problems of the environment for them relate to the immediate and fragile conditions. For them, the condition of the environment is a matter of eating or not eating, living or not living. They are the wretched of the earth. They are the most environmentally concerned.But as they try to care - and very often succeed for the land that they farm and graze, the pressures of poverty are such that very often they are fighting a losing battle. That will go on unless we in this far and prosperous North of the world do much more to help them beat their poverty. But instead of giving help on the scale that is needed, the industrialised nations, the IMF and the World Bank operate finance and debt strategies which have done the opposite of giving help. They have ensured a huge flow of wealth from the poor countries to the rich countries; and the banks have been the major beneficiaries. Between 1983 and 1987, aid payments to countries in Sub-Saharan Africa totalled $58 billion. In the same period $45 billion came out in debt payments. The situation in Latin America is even more stark. Between 1983 and 1987, countries of Latin America received about $28 billion in aid and paid out $226 billion in bank loan repayments. That cannot be right.Far from easing the pressure on the people and on the land, the industrialised countries are intensifying the pressure. It is a terrible global injustice, but it is shocking global stupidity too. In the very act of burdening the people and land of the developing countries with huge payments, the financiers and governments are burdening their own people and their own lands too.Environmental degradation is a communicable disease. Even the most short-sighted in the Northern hemisphere must realise that if we do not help the poor countries to be green and pleasant, we will not have green and pleasant lands ourselves anywhere in the world. (Applause)As part of the strategy for trying to safeguard the future therefore those debts must be radically and rapidly reduced and, as frequently as is possible, cancelled. Development aid must go directly to the poor who know best how to use it. They are the most skilled guardians of the earth, if they are ever given a chance. Developed countries, and the people in developed countries, must adopt fair price regimes so that the people of the poor countries have the breathing space and the income to enable them to protect and improve their environment, both for their own sakes and, yes, for our sakes too.That is what we put in the policy review. It is an argument for global citizenship, a recognition of the fact that in the world now and for all the future, passive co-existence is not enough; active co-operation to defeat common problems is essential to environmental security for every country. It is essential for every other form of security too.It is certainly vital in the changing relationship between East and West. We are now at the beginning of the time when we can, in George Bush\u2019s words when he visited Germany earlier this year, \u2018open up the possibilities\u2019 for Europe to forgo the peace of tension for the peace of trust. Even in the few months since he said that, Poland and Hungary have had their first free elections in many decades. The televised proceedings of the People\u2019s Congress of Deputies in Moscow has shown us the extraordinary and encouraging sight of democratic arguments in that body.This very day in East Germany, on the anniversary of the establishment of the German Democratic Republic, people are demonstrating in their thousands on the streets for freedom. When all that is happening, we know that Europe - the whole of this continent - is never going to be the same again. As Mikhail Gorbachev said in the United Nations last December, \u2018there\u2019s no going back for anyone.\u2019 That is now a central truth of the age; indeed it is a central hope of the age. A momentum is well under way, and whilst there can be no accurate estimate of its speed, the direction is certain.In this party we want to be part of that progress, part of that momentum, making the changes, taking the opportunities. We seek the power to do that. To stop being spectators and start being negotiators. To take our country off the sidelines and put it in the mainstream of advance, where it should rightly be, exercising its influence for understanding improved world relationships. That is what we will do.In the still deep divisions of ideology between East and West there are of course suspicions and rivalries built up over more than 70 years, which are not going to vanish in a year, or in five years or maybe even in ten years. Because of that security will continue to mean armed security. But it must also increasingly mean - and it does increasingly mean - the security of negotiated disarmament and the security of developing social and economic relationships. In other countries of    NATO alliance that is not only understood, it is being pursued with a vigour which is absent from the British Government. There are other members of NATO - notably West Germany - who are already operating agreements to train thousands of young Russians to broaden the business relationships, to offer new technologies. A new dual-track towards security is being built, not a bit like the old one. On it, the efforts for negotiated disarmament are running alongside increasing economic engagement.We want to travel that track. We want to do it for our own interests of security and stability and economic prosperity. We also want to do it because we know that the pressure for freedom that is exercising its irresistible force among the people of the Eastern Bloc needs to be reinforced by economic support from democracies. For the danger will be that if the new liberty being experienced in the trail-blazing countries like Poland and Hungary is surrounded by poverty and under-development in the early years, then that liberty will be fragile. Even the sweet taste of the freedom that these people have yearned for can turn sour if it does not bring with it the beginning of material advancement. Those countries therefore have to make the leap from the command economy to the market economy, from the single party state to pluralism.The problem is that it is physically impossible for them - and physically impossible for anybody - to leap slowly. It is essential therefore that the West - and especially the European Community countries - give support to try to ensure that the take-off of those emerging democracies is firm and their landing is certain and stable.I have talked to democratic socialists from Poland. They explained to me that it is totally understandable that people in large numbers want to make the lurch directly from what they have known, with its shortages and its queues and its inadequacies, to what they believe to be the free market society, as advertised in the glossy magazines. Those who have been exiles in the West, good comrades in the democratic socialist exiled parties, some of whom have gone back to their own countries for the first time in 30 or 40 years and others much younger, tell us that their main task is to counsel people that the best path in those countries is not at either end of the pendulum, but actually in employing the mixture of necessary regulation and the dynamic of the market. The only political philosophy that really offers the opportunity to do that is the democratic socialism that they have been seeking to uphold in those countries all those years. I think that is a tribute to the scope and energy of democratic socialism. And as people think about it the logic is bound to appeal.In the meantime, before people come to final decisions, when this maelstrom of new liberty is swirling in those countries what we have got to do is to provide the maximum opportunity and the best support that we can offer to ensure that people do not just get their freedom, but get the chance to build their standard of living as wellOur country should already be properly involved in that support, certainly in the form of technical and training aid. But once again we see the ambivalent Prime Minister making gestures of encouragement and simultaneously using the language of tension. A couple of weeks ago, when she was in Japan, she described these changes in the Eastern Bloc with their great and inspiring possibilities for the advance of liberty as \u2018a period of uncertainty and danger.\u2019 It need be neither. Of course, no one is asking that defences be utterly dismantled in celebration of the election of Solidarnosc to government. I have not heard anybody advocating that. On the contrary, there could be a period of greater certainty and greater safety if people like Mrs Thatcher really wanted the advance of those conditions and were prepared not just to talk about it but to do something about it But yet again, even at this time of great opportunity to use democracy, to help democracy, we see Mrs Thatcher holding back.It is always the same. From East-West disarmament negotiations to the attitude they adopt in the Commonwealth towards South Africa, to international environmental co-operation, relationships with the Third World and their posture within the European Community, Margaret Thatcher shows that she is from the Greta Garbo school of diplomacy, \u2018I want to be alone.\u2019 (Applause) That is the constant theme. It is not splendid isolation or cunning or sagacity or diplomatic skin. It is a fundamental failure to perceive and to try to secure Britain\u2019s role in a rapidly changing Europe and a rapidly changing world. She is out of touch, out of date and out of step with the British people.We are in step. We share the British people\u2019s recognition of the reality that we have got a positive part to play in the development of the new relationship between East and West. We share their recognition, as they demonstrated it on 15 June, of the reality that we have got an essential part to play in a European Community that belongs at least as much to us as it belongs to anybody else. We are going to make it work in a way that can simultaneously develop it as a community and not just as a market. We are going to see that our country is safeguarded and stimulated and not emptied by that pull to the centre - a movement from Britain and other countries in the Community that would be devastating for so much of the European Community.We will do that job properly, because you see, comrades, what these issues and many like them demonstrate is one of the biggest differences between the Tories and ourselves. In every sphere of policy, international and domestic, the big difference is that we are going forward to face the future to meet it, to try to shape it in the best interests of the British people. The Tories are just waiting for the future to hit them. That is all that can explain the way in which they are so confused over these great changes going on in the world. The way indeed in which, even knowing the fixed date of the arrival of the completion of the Single Market, they made no preparation for it; they just waited for it to come and wash over them. They made no preparation for the Channel Tunnel. They are supposed to be the great sponsors of that idea. They consulted no one, neither locally nor nationally. They did not plan, they did not invest. They will not finance the railways; they do not even know the regions exist. Now they do not even know if they can finance the finishing of the Tunnel.When people are so purblind, when people are so incapable even of working towards fixed targets of the future, when they do not have to guess, look into crystal balls or make estimates, but have got a precise date and still mess it up, there is no part of the future that they are fit to rule.That attitude towards tomorrow that they have is not good enough to serve the future. They are not good enough for the British people. We are now. I know that, you know that. You feel, you rejoice in and you work to increase the support that we have got. It is not an empty claim to say that this Conference is one of progress, is one indeed of celebration, not one of relaxation or of complacency. In Robert Frost\u2019s words, we have \u2018miles to go\u2019 and \u2018promises to keep.\u2019 That should always be a guide for socialism. There is no time in socialism anywhere at all where we can take it easy, lean back, say the job is done. Nobody here will say that. But it is an encouragement, an inspiration to see this party working together, coming to a joint position on objectives, and not only telling itself, but exuding to the British public the feeling that we are fit to serve our country. As I think of those things, I would like to put my feelings into words greater than anything I could ever produce, the words of Percy Bysshe Shelley:A brighter dawn awaits the human day.When poverty and privilege,The fear of infamyDisease and woe,War with its million horrors and fierce hell shall live,But only in the memory of time.Let us seek power. Let us earn power. Let us be elected to power. Let us use power to ensure that all of those evils are put into the memory of time and we shall greet the brighter dawn of that day. (Prolonged applause)

aVDavid, comrades, we meet in this conference in strength and in the confidence that progress and advance bring to us. When we met last year we had over 8,600 Labour councillors in. Britain and had control in 164 councils. That was a record. Now, this year, we have well over 8,900 councillors in Britain and control of a higher record of 175 councils. (Applause) When we met last year, Mid Staffordshire was a Conservative parliamentary seat with a Tory majority of 14,000. Now it is a Labour seat with a majority of 9,000. (Applause)         When we met last year, you will remember that the Tory Party was loudly proclaiming that they had what they called \u2018the right team for the future.\u2019 You will remember Kenneth - not Kenneth Branagh, but Kenneth Baker \u2013 playing Prince Hal: \u2018He which hath no stomach to this fight, let him depart.\u2019 Three weeks later Nigel Lawson went. (Applause) Two months later Norman Fowler went. Three months later Peter Walker went, and then two months after that off went Nicholas Ridley, kaput, as they say. (Applause) They were billed as \u2018the right team for the future.\u2019 Comrades, I have seen the future and it is nearly all resigned. (Laughter)Much else of course has changed in this last year, not all for the better. A year ago at their annual conference the Tories were promising that they would make the economy stronger. It is now in recession. They promised to get inflation down. Then it was 7.4 per cent, now it is 10.6 per cent. They promised to get interest rates down, and on the Thursday of their conference interest rates went up from 14 per cent to 15 per cent. It has been a further year of Tory failure.But the real problem is not just that things are worse now than they were last year. The real problem is that in so many vital respects things are worse now than they were 11 long years ago. (Applause) When Mrs Thatcher became Prime Minister in 1979, Britain, like every other country, was suffering the effects of major increases in oil prices. Britain\u2019s inflation was too high: it was at the European Community average. Now, after 11 years, it is nearly double the European Community average. In 1979, unemployment was 1.25 million and falling; now it is 1.6 million, even by the new accounting system, and rising. Then - 11 years ago - the balance of payments was roughly in balance; now we are heading for a £17 billion deficit this year, following a £20 billion deficit last year, following a £15 billion deficit the year before. They are definitely going for the Triple Crown this year: three deficits above £10 billion. (Applause) In terms of inflation, unemployment, balance of payments, economic growth, interest rates, manufacturing investment, housing starts, tax burden, world trade share, domestic trade share and so many other measures of performance, the Tories are not even back at square one after 11 years.Confronted by all of that, Mrs Thatcher could only say, with a sob in her voice, when she was interviewed last week by a newspaper, that it was likely that no income tax cuts could be made next year \u2018because of the Gulf crisis.\u2019 Even by her standards that was a pretty lame excuse. No one believes that the current economic nose-dive began with the invasion of Kuwait.Everyone knows that it is the direct result of Tory policies that long pre-date the aggression of Saddam Hussein. But in any case, whatever desperate excuse the Prime Minister thinks up for not cutting income tax, I have to say that I do not think that income taxes should be cut next year. (Applause) I think that the children and the pensioners and the sick people of Britain come a long way before income tax cuts next year or for many years to come. (Applause)Of course, tax bands can be changed to increase fairness, savings and investment can be encouraged through the tax system to increase efficiency, and there is one tax that can be cut - the poll tax. We are going to cut it out of existence altogether. (Applause)The Tory idea that general cuts in income can be justified in a country where the schools are under-funded, the wards are being closed, the land, the water and the air are dirty and the streets are not safe is rejected not only by me, but by the great majority of the British people. Such ideas deserve to be rejected, not because no one likes to pay tax, but because anyone with any sense at all knows that further general reductions in income taxation mean further general decline in the standards of provision that are essential to life in a civilised, secure community.If the Tories cannot cut income tax, what are they going to do? They have only ever got one answer to that. \u2018Keep interest rates up, keep on squeezing the economy, keep on the pressures of recession and eventually,\u2019 they say, \u2018inflation will come down and all will be well.\u2019 That is their plan. It will not work; it never works. Kenneth Baker said as much last week. \u2018We\u2019ve dealt with inflation twice before,\u2019 he said. That rather begs the question, doesn\u2019t it? If you have dealt with inflation twice, why have you got to do it three times? (Applause) If they dealt with inflation in 1980, why did it come back in 1985? If they dealt with it in 1985, why is it back now? The answer is that they did not \u2018deal with\u2019 inflation. Their single response of very high interest rates can of course bring the inflationary temperature down. It can cool the fever. But high interest rates cannot by themselves combat the virus of inflation. On the contrary, high interest rates inflict such wounds on the economy that the higher investment costs, the higher production and living costs that they leave behind, even after the rates have been temporarily cut, make the economy yet more prone to weakness and the return of inflation. That has happened twice in the last Tory decade. That is what will happen again unless they radically change their policies. Sadly, there is not too much of a chance of that.So what should they be doing now in the circumstances that they have created by their own incompetence and irresponsibility? I will tell them, not from some academic sideline or as the leader of a minority party with no prospect of power or even years away from a general election where events may intervene. I. will tell them what they should do to help our country now, and do it from the standpoint of someone who knows that within the next 12 or 18 months, whenever the Tories choose to call a general, election, we shall win that election and face the problems, the legacy and the mess that they leave. (Applause)What should they do? First, they should cut the very high interest rates and so reduce industrial and housing costs. That is what we would do. That is what we will do if interest rates are at their current level. Secondly and simultaneously, in. order not to release a consumer credit spree that would suck in imports, they should introduce controls on the supply of credit, restraints in what the banking system is allowed to lend. Several other mixed economies do it successfully. That is what we would do. That is what we will do.Thirdly, they should be negotiating entry into the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System, not as a short term anti-inflationary measure, a wing and a prayer, not as an electoral expedient, which is how they now see it, but as a strategic means of providing stability to the British economy and to British producers. That is what we would do. That is what we will do: interest rate cuts, credit controls, negotiated entry to the exchange rate mechanism. They are not what the Prime Minister calls \u2018soft options.\u2019 There are no soft options anywhere at any time for anybody. But there are sensible options. They are the changes necessary to bring the beginnings of cost reductions and stability that are vital to the productive economy. They are not easy, but they are certainly better than continuing to squash whole areas of the industrial economy with insupportable interest rates. They are the sensible options. Crushing industry is the suicide option. That is what they are doing. (Applause)Of course, when people speak in such terms, the Prime Minister describes them as the voices of gloom. She does not like that. So, ever the gentleman, permit me to be the voice of optimism. Let me set aside the gloom and say that in this country of ours there is enterprise and innovation; there is initiative. There are many managements and workforces with shared objectives. There are great skills of design and adaptation. There is a widespread desire to compete effectively, because everybody knows that ultimately their prosperity and security depend upon it, and when companies and workforces call for change in the government\u2019s economic policies, they are not engaging in special pleading, they do not want featherbedding; all they want is a context in which they can properly prove themselves. That context, that environment for success, is simply not being provided by a government that hits them with very high interest rates 60 to 70 per cent above those that have to be paid by their competitors in the same trade. It is not being provided by a government that refuses to make the commitment to research and training that is common amongst our competitors.Even as I describe the conditions that disadvantage our producers, as they are very frequently put to me by people on both sides of industry, I can already hear the Tories saying \u2018These aren\u2019t the responsibilities of government. Industries should stand on their own feet. All these matters should be left to the market.\u2019 That is the constant mantra of the last 11 years.Other governments do not think like that. Even if in public they say they think like that, in private they certainly do not act like that. When governments in Japan, France, Germany and other countries provide the long term support to industry and ours does not, it really is no good for the Prime Minister, the Chancellor of the Exchequer or Nicholas Ridley to cry \u2018Foul.\u2019 They have to understand that we are not involved in cricket but in ruthless competition, and they have to give our people a fair chance, as other countries give their people a fair chance. (Applause)That competition is hotting up. Just 27 months from now the European Community will be a completed single market. If the government here does not do what must be done to help to strengthen the performance of British industry, inflation will remain a recurrent plague and the slide into deficit and debt, unemployment and insecurity will continue. It is to stop that slide, to provide the realistic alternative, that our Labour policies give the highest possible priority to the long term measures that will increase productive and competitive strength in Britain. Nothing supersedes that.We have got to employ science. We have got to mobilise the skills of women and men on equal terms. We have got to modernise our transport system and diffuse new technologies throughout industry. Above all, we have got to raise the standards of training and education to levels that at least compare with those of our main competitors. So much is obvious; yet ours is the only major industrial country which is spending less on research and development as a share of national wealth than it did 10 years ago. The under-funding of research and development, the shortage of qualified science teachers in our schools, the brain-drain of scientists and technologists to other countries, the crisis of morale that is reported from so many parts of the science community, are not isolated features. They are the results of a bias against science, the disregard of the importance of research and development, the refusal to invest in ideas in an age when that investment is critical to any possibility of success. That attitude must be reversed. We will do that.We will shift spending from military to civil research and development in order to get better economic value for public investment. We will increase basic research, bring it together with industrial needs and achieve the successful technology transfer that is increasingly common in the economies of our competitors. Like those competitors, we will provide security and continuity in research and development by using takeover regulations and tax policies to see that firms that are making the research and development commitment are not targeted by takeover predators, which too often is the case. With those and other changes we will be developing a long term infrastructure for science in Britain.We need to do the same with transport. Amongst the most vital components of the modern, integrated transport system that Britain needs to succeed there must be modern, high speed rail links running from Scotland and Wales through the length and breadth of England to the Channel tunnel and on to the European mainland beyond. (Applause) We will build those rail links. We will do it through a financial partnership between public and private sectors. That is how the TGV has been financed in France, and now, 10 years after it was embarked upon, the TGV network is not only spreading prosperity to the regions of France, stimulating investment and creating jobs, but repaying its capital costs and earning a healthy return for public and private investors alike. That would never have happened without the French socialist government making exactly the long term commitment that the British Tory government over the same period has categorically refused to make. Nothing could more clearly express the great gap in the attitudes, between a government that has an active partnership with the private sector in strengthening the economy and a government whose perverse ideology will not allow such a productive relationship.Every commuter, every driver, every business - and therefore every citizen in Britain - is paying dearly for that dogma. It is inefficient, it is anti-social, it neglects the environment, it disables the economy. That dogma is a barrier across the road to national progress. Everyone now knows that the only way to clear away that block is to get rid of the government that forms the block across the road to progress. (Applause) We will use the combination of public ­and private funding to the benefit of the public and the private interest in Britain.A strategic policy for science and technology and a modern transport system are essential components of a long term economic strategy. But without doubt the most fundamental requirement of future success is improvement in the British education system. Parents know it. Employers, teachers and students themselves know it. The general public knows it. They also know that there is a crisis in British education. Everybody realises that with the exception of the government. Only the government denies it. They deny it not only because they are completely out of touch with the realities of the state schooling system in our country, but because they are also out of sympathy with the state schooling system that provides for a huge majority of the parents and children of this country. (Applause)They have got to be replaced by a government that is in touch, a government committed to improvement, a government of people who do not favour the maintained schools in any abstract sense, but who support them because those schools educate their own children. The only government of that character, as Jack Straw brilliantly demonstrated yesterday; will be the Labour government. (Applause)The Conservative government\u2019s practice of treating schools as if they are laboratories to test out the latest Tory social engineering theories has got to stop. They disrupt, divide and demoralise children, parents, teachers and communities. They do nothing for general standards in results or in conduct. They have little to do with learning and everything to do with political meddling.In this party and, I believe, in this country people want improved education, not perpetual experimentation with the lives and futures of their children. (Applause) We regard it, first, to be essential to improve the provision of the equipment of education: the supply of qualified teachers, the essential, books and learning materials, the buildings and facilities which are vital ingredients of an up-to-date education system. Teachers, books, materials, buildings - it is called getting back to basics, the basics that will ensure that teachers are able to give more attention to individual children, the basics that foster achievement in reading, writing, number - yes, and in cultural and sporting activities, because they too are essential to the rounding and good grounding of every youngster. No youngster should be denied the chance of access to music, literature and sport. None should be denied that; too many are now. (Applause)The basics include those fundamental requirements of actively encouraging parents to be involved in and informed about the education of their children, partners with the schools instead of being continually regarded as being an alternative source of funding because the government will not provide the resources. (Applause)Secondly, as a feature of our approach to education we will get rid of the concept that education for the majority is something that begins round about five and ends round about 16. That is why we aim to provide nursery education for every three and four-year-old whose parents wish to exercise that choice. (Applause) It is vital not only for the advantage of the child and its social and educational development, but for the liberty and the choice of men and women parents who want to sustain careers, who need frequently to get jobs and should not, as was said from this platform yesterday, perpetually face the dilemma of making a choice between a reasonable standard of living and caring in the way that they want to for their children.I have to say that I read in a report this morning that Mrs Thatcher, speaking in the wake of the meeting that she attended of the United Nations this weekend, spoke of the need for mothers to give attention to nurture and provide wisdom. Nobody in their right mind could disagree with that. But I wish the Prime Minister comprehended the advantage - the wonder - of being able to do that with your children and would do something to ensure that many more parents could do it with their children too, because they love their children as much as she ever loved hers. (Applause)We shall implement our policies to reform education and training after 16 and provide access to vocational and. academic courses through which people can earn qualifications appropriate to their needs and abilities.Thirdly, the cuts in central government funding for education have got to stop. Huge losses have been inflicted on education in Britain over these years. This year the Tory government will be allocating 4.8 per cent of gross national product to all forms of central expenditure on education. If they had maintained the commitment of the last Labour government \u2013 5.5 per cent of GNP \u2013 Britain\u2019s primary and secondary schools, colleges, polytechnics, and universities would this year be £3.6 billion better off than they are now. Figures and percentages of GNP are immensely boring. Figures of £3.6 billion are immensely boring. But translate that in terms of teachers, books, decent classrooms, access to university and higher education, and all of a sudden they become immensely exciting, the greatest adventure that people can have, the fulfilment of their own desire to find their education liberation. That is denied when the GNP is cut back on that scale. (Applause)     No one expects that we shall be able immediately or even in years to make up fully this huge shortfall. We will strive to do it, naturally, but such is the position from which we shall have to start after the years of Toryism that we are going to have to build up to those levels. That is what our neighbours and competitors did. They did not achieve their educational and economic success by borrowing wildly or by taxing fiercely. We shall not be doing either of those. They did it by committing the public expenditure that they could afford and, above all, by keeping on doing it year after year. We must do the same.I will give you an example of what I mean. France, like every other country, is today under economic pressure as a. result of the Gulf crisis. Unlike Britain, they have no oil of their own, and in their budget published a fortnight ago the government has tightened expenditure in many areas in order to cope with the present and projected costs arising from the emergency. But there is an exception to that budgetary restraint - indeed, there is an exemption. Their education budget has not been reduced at all. Their education budget for this financial year is increased by 9 per cent. That is what you mean when you say that socialism is the religion of priorities, a 9 per cent increase in the education budget, even in straitened circumstances.They have been following those policies for 10 years through thick and thin. They have done it because they know that if they want strength, they must have skill, and if they are to have skill, they must have more people educated to a higher level in smaller classes with sufficient teachers. That is the only way in which it adds up. They are not just talking about it or wishing for it, they are getting on with it. They are investing in it.The French education is obviously not without its blemishes, but what is not in doubt is the superiority of their levels of participation, access and opportunity. Participation, access and opportunity are the keys to unlock the door to achievement - not just economic advance, but cultural and spiritual fulfilment, for that also \u2013 indeed mainly - is what education is about too. We are not in the business of seeking to produce a computer age version of hewers of wood and drawers of water. We want capable people, confident people, demanding citizens, people who are adaptable and applicable. Education is the key to giving people all of that opportunity. It has advanced in France. We have got to catch up with that with the next Labour .government. We must provide those keys. In education, as in so many other fields, our country can only get out what it puts in. If we want to get out of education the skills of the future for the people of the future, we have to put in now and keep on putting in.Obviously, it will not be enough to do it only in education. It must be done in training too. The reason for that is obvious. Eight out of 10 people who will be in our workforce in the year 2000 are already of working age and they need training for work and in. work. Over two\u2011thirds of the working people in Italy, Germany, France and Spain are getting some skilled vocational training. But in Britain, after 11 years of Conservative government, only a little over one-third of our working people get any training at all. That is hardly surprising when the government seems to regard training not as a key to economic success, but as a branch of social security - and a pretty flimsy branch at that.Now, after a decade of de-skilling, the government is cutting more millions from the training budget. When there are no incentives to train, no advice on how to train, no targets for quantity or quality that compare with those of our competitor countries, it is not surprising that so many companies do not make the proper training commitment.As you heard from Tony Blair yesterday, the Labour government\u2019s national training strategy will be used to overcome that great strategic weakness. It will be built on a practical national and local partnership between employers, trade unions and the providers and users of education and training. We will concentrate on the quantity and quality of training and qualifications from training that will be adaptable in the service of women and men throughout their working lives in order to meet and master the changes that they will encounter with great rapidity. That is why we shall be giving strong encouragement to the industries and employers who do make a proper commitment to training. It is also the reason why we shall require employers who do not train, but who \u2018pirate\u2019 from the responsible firms, either to change their ways or to make a financial contribution so that training can be provided.At the level of the national economy, the industry, the firm and the individual, we shall be working to enable Britain to become a capable, country. We shall do it not only to ensure that individuals have greater control over their lives and their futures, but also because we know that in the 1990s the technological revolution and the advance of our country\u2019s fortunes depends upon success in the training revolution.Those policies for the strengthening of Britain\u2019s productive and competitive performance have obvious purposes. They are essential if our country is to pay its way. They are essential if our producers are to generate the wealth necessary for future investment. They are essential too if we are to generate the wealth that is necessary to provide high and rising standards of social justice, welfare support and opportunity in our country. They are policies that will mean, not simply demand, ends.That is essential if we want to pay - and keep on paying - proper pensions. It is essential if we want to fund fully - and go on funding fully - the National Health Service., That is what we will do. We will start to do it by bringing the opted-out hospitals back into the NHS. (Applause) By next April hospitals are supposed to clear their debts and their books to prepare for what the Tories call \u2018reforms.\u2019 Once again we are on the brink of a winter of cuts and closures and distress and pain, but this time it is all being made deliberately worse by a government intent on wrecking the national health service. That is the real price of Tory health care. That is why no one in this, country can afford another Tory government.Certainly, even outside the hospitals and the formal structure of the NHS, there are millions of people, who are chronically ill and being cared for in their own homes, who cannot afford another Tory government. In this country there are 6 million people looking after others, usually relatives, who are young, long-term sick, disabled, elderly or fragile - 6 million carers. The overwhelming majority of them are women. The government has praised their selflessness to the skies, dripping with braid, knobs on and bands playing. But only 110,000 out of the 6 million carers get invalid care allowance. That same praising government has cut carers\u2019 benefits. They have forced cuts in carers\u2019 services. They have taken away carers\u2019 rights to unemployment benefit. This year, to cap it all, the government postponed community care in order to save a few pennies on the poll tax. (Applause) The government that claims to have produced economic miracles and tries to tell us that the economy has underlying strength broke its pledge to provide the package of nursing and home care, daycare and respite care that should have been available through community care. Next week the Tory Party conference will meet under the slogan \u2018The Strength to Succeed.\u2019 I just wonder what sort of strength it takes to inflict blow after blow on people who are trying to care for their desperately sick loved ones in their own homes. (Applause) I would say it was brutal strength, wouldn\u2019t you?No wonder caring families feel cheated. They are not asking for much help. They are not asking to be relieved of their obligations. They would do what they do in any case in the cause of love and duty. Often they do it in circumstances of dire poverty and isolation, at risk to their own physical and mental health. If these 6 million people did not do it - or even a large proportion of them - the rest of us would have to find the funds to pay for beds in long stay residential care for elderly people at a cost of over £200 a bed per week. The costs would be vast.As well as being humane, it makes sense therefore to operate a comprehensive system of community care with earmarked, local government funds. It makes sense to develop a carers\u2019 benefit, as we are doing. It makes sense to allocate responsibility for this major part of the nation\u2019s services to the sick to a new Department of Health and Community Care. A Labour government will do all of that. We owe it to the sick, and as a society we most certainly owe it to those who care for them:The government\u2019s desertion of their promise to introduce community care is, sadly, far from unique. Indeed, it is the stock-in-trade of the government, especially when they have given undertakings to support social progress or to improve the quality of life and eventually find themselves faced with the demand to deliver. They have a Prime Minister who tried to present herself as the .guardian of the earth. They have a Secretary of State for the Environment, who I thought at one time was so green that he was inhaling carbon dioxide and inhaling oxygen. (Laughter and applause) The Tories have had 11 years in power, huge resources and inexhaustible supplies of high quality information and advice on every part of the battle to save the national and global environment. But last week they drew themselves up to their full height and produced an environment White Paper which has something to say about practically everything and something to do about practically nothing at all. (Applause)They are not a pressure group; they are not an opposition; they are not a think tank. They are a government that has been in power for 11 years and can exercise power. Even while no one with any sense - certainly none of the leading environmental groups - thinks that everything can be done at once, it is reasonable to ask that there should be some specific commitments to specific action. Why do they not at the very least go with our European neighbours and act as they have done against global warming, make the commitment to stabilise carbon dioxide emissions by the year 2000 and make substantial cuts in the early years of the next century? That is what we shall be doing.        Why, when traffic congestion and vehicle pollution are the fastest growing threat to our environment, do they not make the commitment to build a high speed rail network to link every part of Britain with the rest of Europe? That is what we shall be doing. Why don\u2019t they make the commitment to establish strong, independent agencies to set and secure environmental standards for food, air and water with the health and safety of children as the benchmark for acceptable standards? That is what we shall be doing. Why do they not in a number of other areas such as the trade in toxic waste, the cleaning up of the North Sea and targets for development aid, act as if they really meant it when they said that they were guardians of the earth? We would accept it and support them. (Applause)All of what I list are practical, achievable targets. Indeed, they might be regarded as modest for a government that says that it wants to promote the cleaning of the environment \u2018from the street corner to the stratosphere,\u2019 but then they will not commit the resources to clean the street corner. (Laughter and applause) If you do it, you get poll tax capped. So it is not really surprising that while they will sign on the dotted line of just about any international environment conventions, they will take little action to honour such conventions in practice. They will make any commitment as long as it does not commit them to anything.In many ways this last year has been the fastest year in history. A year ago when this conference met, Hungary and. Poland had just had their first free elections and still faced what they thought would be a journey of some years to full democracy and independence. Czechoslovakia was still ruled by Husak and the dictatorship re-established in 1968. Romania was still ruled by Ceausescu\u2019s barbarism. In East Germany the people were just starting to come out onto the streets, but Honecker was still in power and the Stasi in authority. The Warsaw Pact, so far as anyone knew, was still a cohesive military alliance which faced NATO. The Western Alliance was still confined to its 45-year-old military role. Now here we are in October 1990. Poland and Hungary are independent. Czechoslovakia is a free country under - glory of glory - the presidency of a playwright. Romania has freedom, but it seems it has yet to achieve the same confident liberty of Czechoslovakia. The Warsaw Pact has effectively ceased to exist. NATO has considered specific proposals for increasing its political role, and resolved upon the establishment of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe in a permanent institution. At midnight tonight there will be no more East Germany or West Germany. That country will be united as a parliamentary democracy. We send from here through the West German ambassador - from tomorrow, I hope, the German ambassador - Herr von Richthofen, who is here this afternoon, our best, wishes and solidarity to the people of Germany for a great and prosperous future in freedom. (Applause)These marvellous changes bring of course their own problems and dangers; but they are capable of being surmounted. These changes, which some of us thought to be a very desirable though very distant prospect and many more thought to be utterly inconceivable, are now a reality. The impossible has become possible. Hope has become fact.On both sides of what was the East-West divide, people who had become resigned to the idea of no change have become impatient for more change. The end of the Cold War has opened the possibility for the first time in history that by negotiation, by verification, by co-operation in a new security community, all prospect of war can be banished from Europe, the continent that has been the bloodiest battlefield of all human history. Because for decades the East-West deadlock has dominated the political shape of the world, the changes being made across this continent make wider and greater change possible across the rest of the world. The task - the hope - of building a new world order, so long the mission of idealists out of power, has now become the frankly and publicly stated objective of those who hold superpower. That is the great change of our age. That is why it is bliss to be alive now, when the possibilities of these great alterations in the fate of humankind are opening up.By great irony, the conditions which produced the declarations of purpose to work for that new world order by the Presidents of the United States of America and the USSR came as a result of military aggression by a tyrant. The invasion and occupation of .Kuwait by Saddam Hussein has nothing to commend it, obviously. But in the reaction to it, the community of nations has quickly formed bonds and taken joint action in a way that would have been unthinkable two years ago, or even a year ago. God knows what would have happened in those circumstances, without that possibility of immediate and strong international solidarity against such aggression.The action taken, firm and universal sanctions and the deployment of force in defence of Saudi Arabia and its neighbours, was absolutely correct. There is no possibility of an aggressor with the nature of Saddam Hussein being prevented from further attempts at conquest by any other means. That is why the action taken has won and kept the active consent of the world community in the United Nations. The scale and solidarity of that consent clearly means that the longest possible time must be given for sanctions to be used to secure the submission of Saddam Hussein to the will of the United Nations. (Applause)The pressure must be sustained. It must be made clear to the Iraqi dictator that not only does he not have any friends anywhere now; but he can look forward to no accommodation from any part of the world unless and until he withdraws unconditionally from Kuwait. The solidarity of nations must continue to be so implacable that even in his Iraqi fortress Saddam Hussein understands that the shutters of the world are up against him and will stay up against him for as long as he illegally occupies another country. (Applause)Saddam Hussein must be made to succumb to international law. It must be done in such a way as to deny him the fruits of aggression, the means of further aggression, any gain to reputation, any status of martyrdom. In the course of resolving this crisis, every possible effort must be made to avoid creating the conditions for further and even worse turmoil. If that is not done, then Saddam Hussein could so easily, in the eyes of so many people in the Arab countries, be turned from being an aggressor, so scornful of Arab unity that he attacked the neighbouring Arab country and slaughtered its people, into being the greatest Arab resistance leader of a generation.The world community, having imposed the rule of law, must then keep the peace. It is an unending obligation, and one that can only be discharged if, in the wake of the withdrawal from Kuwait, there is a firm and sustained embargo on the sale of all weapons and weapons manufacturing machinery to the country of Iraq. It can only be sustained if Iraq\u2019s chemical weapons and chemical weapon-making equipment is totally dismantled and if Iraq is thoroughly monitored to establish whether there is any nuclear weapon-making capacity and, if there is, that it be utterly removed and never returned. That is what must happen after Kuwait is cleared. (Applause)These purposes can, and must, be fulfilled. But let everyone heed the fact that if they are to be, then the world community must also, first, spread and exert its authority to see that similar actions are taken in the case of other nations with possible chemical and nuclear weapons capacity. Secondly, international action to control and reduce the world arms and arms manufacturing trade will have to be taken with a breadth and thoroughness never previously known in history. (Applause) We must learn the lesson of where Saddam Hussein got his weapons.The whole world now has a vested interest in trying to see that Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait is achieved, if possible by peaceful means. The reasons for that go far beyond the need to remove any threat to the security of much of the world\u2019s oil reserves, important though that is to every nation, rich and poor.           In the weeks since the United Nations first responded to the Iraqi invasion, it has become clear that there is a real ambition to forge a new and effective structure for world security. If such a structure could be given strength, it would have boundless potential for co-ordinated international action, not just to prevent or push back aggression, but even to combat poverty, to protect the environment and to become an agency, if not for democracy, then at least for recognisable freedoms.None of that is certain. None of it is guaranteed. There is no straight path leading from the Security Council and its specific resolutions towards a new, golden age of liberty, prosperity and safety for the whole of the planet. But it is important to know that the objective is now within the realms of possibility and not smothered by Cold War or excluded by hopelessness. Such a development offers a prospect of stable peace unknown in history. It is, in the words of President Bush in Congress very recently, a \u2018new world struggling to be born.\u2019No one should found all their hopes - even less all their policies - upon that effort. It could yet be a house built on sand. But what everybody should do is to open up their minds to the possibility that it can be a firmly based and enduring global security structure and that it is worth striving for. The watchword must be \u2018Don\u2019t dream of what may be; work for what can be.\u2019 The understanding must be that it is worth working for.There are countless reasons for that. This afternoon I give you one: children - the children of the earth. Of the world\u2019s children under the age of five, 40,000 die every day, mainly from hunger and preventable diseases of hunger. Of the world\u2019s children, 20 million suffer severe malnutrition, 150 million are chronically underfed and 100 million children never have any schooling. The statistics of childhood misery and early death in this world are horrifying.The cause of most of the countries\u2019 tragedies is poverty. The poverty is brought about not by natural disasters, but by exploitation, under-development and war. Those evils can be stopped. They are man-made. They can be man-prevented. It is within the power of the adults of the world to do that.That power could be multiplied beyond measure if the structures of security which are now amongst the ambitions of world leaders were established to promote aid, to protect the environment, to relieve debt burdens, to establish fair trade, to spread education, health care and. housing in place of ignorance, disease and squalor.In this party we will not be dreaming of that, we will be working for it. We are democratic socialists. Our cause is the welfare of the community. We recognise no boundaries in that cause between countries or continents. (Applause) We shall work for the new security structures. We shall work for the new world order, because it is natural to us and necessary for our country and for our world.We shall go on doing it in opposition and we shall do it with full effect in government. That day is coming. We are fit and ready not just to win, but to govern the people of this country. Let us fulfil that purpose, not for our own advantage, but out of our duty to the people of our country and of our world. (Standing ovation)

aVComrades, thank you very much. Tom, comrades. Well, somebody is blowing the whistle and I think even the Prime Minister can hear it. (Applause)Could I, before I open my speech, thank you very much Tom for quoting from Idris Davies. Idris said, \u2018He that forgets his history lives in the slough of slavery.\u2019 I think that will prove to be instructive when people recall the last 12 years because we are here today and we will fight through these coming months, as we now understand it to be, to change history and lift the burden from the people of our country. (Applause)This morning I went to see Jo Richardson. She is in good spirits and is making a good recovery and she sends her love to all of you and her thanks for the marvellous messages of support and love that have come from this conference. Jo is an inspiration and with a little bit of luck she will be back with us tomorrow in order to wind up on the debate. Let us hope that will be the case. (Applause)Conference, what a year it has been for the Conservatives. They started it by losing their leader and ended it by losing their nerve. Last night it became evident that Britain has a government that is afraid of the people. I want to tell the Conservative Party this: \u2018You can postpone people's choice but you will not change the people's verdict. You can run but you cannot hide.\u2019 (Applause)If I may coin a phrase, what we are seeing is a government, a British government, scuttling round the press handing out rumours through its own ministers. Well, I tell them this, they cannot play politics with people\u2019s jobs and with people\u2019s lives. The people will hold them to account. The Prime Minister cannot even bring himself to make a candid public statement, telling the people that he is running away from their judgement and trying to prolong his fingernail grip on power. It will do him no good; worse, it does this British democracy no good when a government manipulates in this fashion. It must be ended, and Labour will end such a system. (Applause)The people of Britain want a government that puts the country first, not the party first and they will get that with a Labour government, for that is what this party wants. It wants our country rebuilt again, our country bold, audacious and just again. We will put the country first. We are ready, fit to serve and able to lead Britain to a better future. We have the policies that the people want. We have a fine team for government, indeed we have the best team for government, of that there is no doubt and we have been building support in every contest. (Applause)In this last year we have continued our successes in local government elections. There are now more Labour councillors and more Labour councils in Britain than there ever have been in history. We have continued our successes in Parliamentary by-elections, particularly in that spectacular victory in Monmouth and in that unique contest in Walton. Militant, squeezed into the open, were soundly beaten by democratic socialists, and they always will be beaten by democratic socialists. (Applause)Comrades, we have earned our support and we shall earn our victory by addressing the real needs of the people of our country. By looking at a future instead of reaching for the past, by being positive.The Tories have done the opposite. They fought the European elections in 1989 relying entirely on negatives and name calling. They lost. In the local elections last year and this year they relied on negatives and name calling. They lost. They will be relying on negatives and name calling again in the General Election and they will lose again. As my father used to say, \u2018The best answer to dirty play, boy, is score a goal.\u2019 We are going to score a goal. (Applause)Comrades, one of the main reasons why they will lose and deserve to lose, is that they are stale and sour. They have no fresh directions, no fresh approaches to offer to the British people. After years in which the Tories have put Britain at the bottom of the league for growth, bottom of the league for investments, bottom of the league for jobs, they still have no policies for building and keeping strong economic recovery.With one million people on hospital waiting lists, 150,000 homeless families and the highest recorded crime rate in British history, they still have no policies to make our country more fair, more secure. After 12 wasted years, if you want to see their monuments, look around you. Even worse, if you want to see their future, look around you. It is clear from everything they say and everything thing that they do that a fourth term of Tory government would mean more of the same. A fourth term of Tory government would mean at least two more years of poll tax, the tax which could be, should be - and when we are elected will be - abolished immediately. (Applause)A fourth term of Tory government would mean years more of under-funding for schools and under-investment for training. It would mean years more of moving the National Health Service into the market. More years of Toryism would mean years more of falling behind our neighbours and competitors in Europe. It would mean years more on the recession roundabout.If the Tories kept power their policies would again take our country through the rise in credit finance consumption, the rise in deficits, the rise in debt, in inflation, in interest rates and then bring the return to recession and rising unemployment all over again. We know that would happen because they are doing now, in their second recession, exactly what they did in their first recession. By following the same policies they would get the same result, a third recession.The Tories are a government in blinkers, hoping that the British people are wearing blindfolds. They hope in vain. People see what is happening in their own country. They live with the realities and the people of Britain want fresh direction, they want new approaches.People look at the state of our economy, 1000 businesses a week going bankrupt, 3000 people losing their jobs every week, redundancies, closures, in the south as well as the north, the east and the west, in high tech industry, in high street shops, they see all that and they live with all that and they say, \u2018It has to change.\u2019 People look at the state of our society and they look at our neighbours in the rest of the European Community. They see the high standards of training, the quality of child care, the investment in public transport and they ask, \u2018Why not here, why not here in Britain?\u2019 The answer is, it can change, we can do it here with a Labour government and I say that with certainty because we shall be doing here in Britain what others have done and are doing in more successful economies. We shall be investing in economic strength as others do and we shall be providing a climate for investment as others do. That is the foundation of the standards of living and the continuing economic vitality in other Community countries. Their provision for pensioners, for training, for child care, for education and transport and health does not come out of huge levels of taxation. It does not come out of higher levels of public expenditure. It comes from sustained economic success. Success that has been built because year on year they have invested more in their people, invested more in their economy. They have planted wealth to grow wealth. That is what we must do. Those governments, socialist, conservative, coalition governments, whatever else separates them, share a sense of responsibility. They know it is the prime duty of any modern government, certainly any modern democratic government, to create conditions for business to succeed and for individuals and communities to thrive.Britain needs a government with a sense of purpose that will provide the country with a new sense of direction. That is the way for Britain to catch up, to compete, to give of its best and to get the best. We will form such a government and our purpose in government will be to help to create a modern industrial economy so that the whole of the country is mobilised to gain and to maintain prosperity.We will help to create a modern industrial economy, to compete and to succeed in the single market of the European Community. We will invest just as our competitors do, year on year, continually, strategically.That is the way, not just to help Britain out of recession in the short term, it is the way to enable Britain to stay out of recession in the long term.We will do that with practical policies. We will be providing tax incentives to companies so that they bring forward new investment in plant and machinery. We will begin a phased release of the £6 billion held by local authorities that they have got from the sale of council houses. The Tory government forbids them to use that money. (Applause) We will get on using it to build homes. We will use it to bring the construction industries out of recession. We will modernise our transport system by mobilising private as well as public investment.Last week the French Railways Corporation, SNCF, issued a bond in the London money market to raise money to invest in the French high speed rail network, but the Tory government will not let British Rail do the same to get investment in British railways. We will change that. If the French can do it for France, we can do it for Britain and we need it in Britain. (Applause)It is with practical policies like those that we will begin to build sustained strength in the economy, lasting prosperity for our country, and we will be doing more to foster the development of manufacturing industry - still, after all the devastation of the Tory years, responsible for more than 50% of our income from export, still the basis of strength in a service economy.Economic success in the 1990s and in the new century will be built on innovation, on new products and new processes. Economic success will be built on converting scientific inventiveness into competitive industrial production. The Tory government refuses to recognise that. In the last 10 years they have cut the share of public support for research and development. The result is that for every public £1 spent in Britain on discovering and developing new technologies for industry, £1.50 is spent in Italy, £2 is spent in France, £2.35 in Germany. There just is not any comparison even though we face the same challenges in a testing world.After 12 years of this government the Department of Education and Science estimates that by the mid-1990s Britain will be short of 3000 qualified technology teachers and 2000 chemistry teachers.Other research forecasts serious shortages of maths and physics teachers. What a way to enter a new phase of the technological age and the same goes, of course, to teachers of modern languages and indeed in many other areas, where the skills and talents and interests of children need the nourishment of qualified teaching.All of that would be shameful at any time in any advanced country but it is all the worse in Britain, where the capacity to invent has been and still is so very strong. Everyone knows that British scientists invented the first steam engine, the first electric motors, generators and transformers, radio, television, the first jet engine, the first cardiograph, penicillin, the first computer. The list goes on. It is a glorious list. A list worthy of great pride. But what is much more important to our generation than that pride in what is past, is the fact that the genius of scientific inventiveness is still strong in Britain today. The transputer, fibre optics, the catalytic converter, the body scanner, clean coal technologies, liquid crystal display, holograms, microwave technology - just a few of the epoch-making modern achievements of today\u2019s British scientists.These are the sort of discoveries that change the whole way in which things are made across the world. They change and shape our lives, but the tragedy is that so many of those modern products, developed from the brilliance of contemporary British scientists, are not made here. Not made in Britain. They are taken and developed by overseas firms, turned into manufactures made elsewhere and then sold back to us as finished or part-finished goods. Invented in Britain but made abroad. It is resigning the future.We have got to change that. We have got to do everything possible to ensure that the products invented in Britain are developed in Britain, made in Britain, sold to the markets of the world from Britain. I make that not as any nationalistic argument but I do say that, when we have these remarkable assets of genius we really should be able to convert them into production in the jobs, in the success, in our own country. That is what we should be doing. (Applause) We should be making, indeed we have to make, Britain into an innovation-driven economy and we will do it.We will do it with sustained research funding, we will do it with a Ministry of Science, we will do it by establishing technology trusts modelled on the success in Germany and Japan. We will be linking research in universities and polytechnics with business and industry. An innovation-driven economy needs a tax system and economic policies which promote sustained investment. It needs monopolies and mergers regulations that promote competition and safeguard company programmes of research and development. We shall make those changes. An innovation economy, above all, needs increases in the quality and the quantity of human skills. The most valuable resource of the country, our only truly renewable resource, is the talent and imagination of our people. Fostering those abilities is essential to personal opportunity, personal prosperity and personal liberty and it is vital to national economic, social and cultural well-being.The present government refuses to face up to that fact. Bribes are offered to opt out. Money is lavished on city technology colleges, league tables are introduced, when what is really needed is not league tables but laboratory equipment, modern classrooms and qualified teachers to work in those classrooms. (Applause)Kenneth Clarke, saying why he thought he had to have league tables last week, said that what happened inside schools was a mystery. Well, we know why it is a mystery to Kenneth Clarke, he does not use those schools. (Applause)I tell you what is the real mystery. It is how a government, in 12 years, collects unprecedented assets, revenues from North Sea oil, the sell-off of public resources, the highest tax bill in British history and still manages to cut expenditure on education by £3 billion. That is a mystery. (Applause)Why has he been doing all that? Training is cut, research is cut, capital and revenue support for schools is cut, support for colleges is cut. Clearly, our country cannot hope to succeed with such policies.That is why, as you heard from Jack Straw and Tony Blair yesterday, we have set out and we will implement new directions in education and training. We are going to make proper commitment to primary schools. We are going to improve the National Curriculum so that every student can combine academic and vocational subjects. We are going to make post-16 provision that will take us towards the standards achieved elsewhere in the European Community. We are going to develop the higher and adult education system, so that all people who can take advantage of it can do so to bring out the best in themselves, right throughout their lives. Yes, and we will be expanding and improving pre-school education too. (Applause) That should be basic to any modern society so that children can learn and parents, especially their mothers, can earn.If anyone does not understand why it is so important, perhaps I can tell you an everyday story by way of explanation. It is the story of a four year-old child, of a father with an industrial disease which meant that he had to travel long distances for specialist treatment and of a mother with training but without anyone to look after the child because the family was a lengthy bus journey away. What saves that family from living on unemployment benefit? A nursery school. A nursery school with good facilities and qualified teachers 10 minutes away from home.The nursery school that I went to 45 years ago, the nursery school that meant that my father could get his treatment and then eventually get back to work, the nursery school that meant my mother could return to nursing and serving the community, a nursery school enabling and transforming the lives of a whole family. That is the reason for pre-school education. (Applause)That was 1946. Frank was talking about \u2018old codgers.\u2019 It put me in my place, didn\u2019t it? Now, in 1991, standards of that kind really should not be too much to ask in a modern country, should they? (Applause)In the rest of the European Community, it is taken for granted. 88% of three to five year-olds in Italy get pre-school education. 95% in Belgium, 95% in France. In Britain just 40% of under-fives get pre-school education and but for the efforts of Labour councils up and down the country, the figure would be a fraction of that. (Applause)That has got to change and with a Labour government it will change, so that we can reach those European standards and give children and parents in Britain the same chances and the same security.Comrades, incentives to invest, proper commitment to education and training, modern transport, scientific and industrial innovation: these are the new directions that Britain needs to build long-term competitiveness and lasting prosperity. These are the new directions that Britain must take to succeed in the European single market and the movement towards economic and monetary union that lies beyond that. These are the changes that are coming in Europe. We must be ready for them. If we lag, we lose, yet again.That is why we are determined to put Britain into Europe\u2019s first division and we have the policies to do it. That is the basic difference between ourselves and the Tories. We will actively engage in building that productive strength, building the strength of our country and unlike any other government in the European Community, the Tories turn away from that duty.Of course, when some of the more glib commentators consider our programme - the training, the investment incentives, transport policies - they say it is not exciting, it is not adventurous. Not adventurous! If passengers could be certain to travel on fast, clean trains, have a seat - there is a revelation - and arrive on time, that would be an odyssey of delight, not just an adventure. (Applause)Not adventurous, when a British breakthrough in science can find British finance, be developed and turned into production in British factories, using British design teams, creating jobs in Britain and exports for Britain. I think that is quite enthralling. Not adventurous, when a 27 year-old miner, whose livelihood has collapsed around him because of his redundancy, gets good training, a marketable skill, a job, wages, choices, the confidence of knowing that he can care properly for his family. That is a real adventure. (Applause)At the same time, a 35 year-old housewife, who stayed at home and brought up the children, back in the labour market but very unsure of her skills, gets decent training and becomes a qualified technician, with the income, status and opportunity that goes with it. That is a real-life adventure.It transforms people\u2019s lives and the result of all of the advances of this kind, multiplied across the nation, would make a well-equipped country, a country that welcomes the adventure of the future because the people have the skills, the industries have the investment, to face the challenges with confidence.Confidence, of course, is more than a matter of job opportunities, vital though they are. It is also a matter of security, and security comes in many forms and from many sources.People need the security of knowing, for instance, that the environment in which they live, the water they drink, the food they eat and the air they breathe, are all safe. In a complex modern society, in a contaminated world, that safety can only be achieved if governments are active and vigilant, if governments give the people the power to be active and vigilant and if governments and people work together to protect and to improve the global environment. It is for that reason that our environmental policies are centred on government accepting its obligations to protect and promote sustainable development and on citizens being given the right in law to ensure that those obligations are fully met.Confidence, security, is also a matter of knowing that if things go wrong and they do go wrong for people, it does not mean they plunge into poverty. That is why we will overturn the Tory policies which have spread poverty and dependency to 10 million people in Britain, including two and a half million children, one in five of Britain's children in poverty under this government. We are going to work to end child poverty. We will begin immediately by restoring the value of child benefit and we will, of course, also be combating child and family poverty by introducing the national minimum wage. (Applause)Confidence and security come from knowing that when people retire they will get a pension that permits them to enjoy life and not just to exist and we will be starting to make that advance by raising pensions by £8 and £5 and making other improvements. (Applause)Confidence and security come from knowing that you can rely on a high quality National Health Service, free when you need it, whoever you are, wherever you live. Confidence and security. (Applause) That security is cherished by the British people. That is why they regard the National Health Service to be their most precious public asset and it is the reason why in the Labour Party we are determined to support it, strengthen it and ensure that it thrives as a people's service.In stark contrast the Tories want to take the National Health Service to pieces, to hand it over to the market, to make it a creature of contracts and commerce. The difference between us could not be greater. Labour will modernise the National Health Service. The Tories privatise the National Health Service. That is the difference. (Applause)Of course they protest that they will not, but that means that they either do not understand or they will not admit to understanding the dynamic of the process that they have already started. Their hospital opt-outs will create, and are intended to create, a health service consisting of trading units. Their GP contract system will create and is intended to create, a market place of haggling doctors, \u2018buying and selling patients,\u2019 as the Chairman of the British Medical Association put it. In each case, the ability of private purchasers to buy advantage in a market system - because that is what a market system means - will mean increasing dependence by the NHS on the sale of treatment. That will happen whether patients are buying treatment as a matter of preference or whether they are buying it in desperation as free health care shrinks and the queues get longer. That is the way that the deck is stacked. You diminish the standard by under-funding. You further isolate it by introducing a market system and eventually people who have every faith in the health service and no intention of buying, are goaded by pain and anxiety into becoming customers instead of just being patients. (Applause)The process is called privatisation. There are some areas of the health service which a privatised system would not really want, of course. Long-term care of the elderly in hospital. The care of the psychiatrically ill and community care really have not got much of what could be called profitable potential. Accidents and emergencies -well, we have expert testimony there. The managers of the Royal Liverpool University Hospital Trust \u2018marketing plan\u2019 advise that \u2018emergency admissions are relatively unattractive from a commercial viewpoint.\u2019 Yes, that is the plan they put out. Who can want a health service to be run according to judgements like that, a commercial viewpoint? (Applause)The doctors, nurses and health workers, they do not want it. The patients and the public do not want it. None of those people, the people who provide the health service, the people who use the health service, they have not demanded the Tory changes. The only demand for these changes has come from a government determined to ram the market system into every corner, every nook and cranny, of national life and of public service and the British people do not want the market system rammed into every corner of the public services. (Applause)At the next election the British people will be deciding whether they keep the National Health. Service or whether they lose the National Health Service. Those who vote Labour will be voting to build up the NHS. Those who vote otherwise will be voting to break up the National Health Service. (Applause).Many people, including Conservatives, do not want that but they must be advised that is the true choice and measure their vote accordingly. When people vote Labour, they will be voting to stop the opt-outs, they will be voting to put an end to the cuts and closures. They will be voting for the practical policies of preventative medicine.When people vote Labour they will be voting for the introduction of a comprehensive system of care in the community, with the funds ring-fenced so that they all go directly to the elderly infirm and the chronically sick and disabled, being cared for in the community. In voting Labour the British people will also be voting to ensure that the full revenues from economic growth are used year on year to meet the needs of the whole nation and not to favour the few. That is Labour's policy and is the people\u2019s priority. We know and the nation knows that providing for the treatment of the sick, caring for the old and giving full opportunities to the young must come before any tax cuts. (Applause)That is the order of priorities of the British people, the sense of purpose of the British people, but it is an order of priorities and sense of purpose that the Tories have not shown and will never follow.The reductions that they have made in top-rate taxes since 1988 alone have already cost £10 billion. Now they are planning to cut another billion off inheritance tax. A country whose health service has to have raffles and fun runs to buy basic hospital equipment cannot afford giveaways like that to the best off in our country. (Applause)Comrades, all the time it is the people in the middle and the people at the bottom, who pay for the tax cuts for the very few at the top. That is why the tax burden in Britain, the tax burden on the whole country, the tax burden on the average family, is higher than it was in 1979, higher than it has ever been in peace time.The Tories have always had an open-ended tax system and the open end is spelt VAT. Whenever they have been under pressure they have hoisted VAT. They did it when they came to power, they did it earlier this year, when they plunged into the poll tax crisis and they would do it again if they ever got the chance. That is the Tory way, everybody pays higher tax. We believe that in a civilised society the best off minority must pay their fair share to meet the needs of the majority. That is not the politics of envy, that is the ethics of immunity, the ethics of society. (Applause)It is the course that we choose and the course that the British people want. In following that course we will not be spending what the country cannot afford. We will not borrow for consumption and we will not increase the tax contributions of the huge majority of the people. We think that people pay enough tax already and we also believe that a government that has to work within the limits pledged to the electorate must be a more efficient government. We will pay for better public services by growth and by ending Tory waste. We will pay for better public services by getting better value for public money.Value for money, that is what you get when you stop wasting £18 million of tax payers\u2019 money every day propping up the poll tax. (Applause)Value for money is what you get when you stop wasting £500 million paying accountants and administrators to privatise the National Health Service and not an extra bed to show for it. Value for money, that is what you get when you stop wasting £6 billion of taxpayers\u2019 money trying to bribe people out of the State Earnings-Related Pensions Scheme. Value for money, that is what you get when you build homes instead of paying huge bills for bed and breakfast in hostels for the homeless, week in week out, month in month out, year in year out. (Applause)Value for money is what you get when you start to collect the £5 billion in taxes lost every year because of evasion. That is what a value for money government will do. It is what a Labour government will do.Discharging the duties of government obviously goes beyond managing the money of the country, vital though that is. For democratic government, it extends to strengthening the democratic powers and rights of the people. We shall do that and we shall do it by decentralising the government and by empowering the people of Britain. We will introduce a freedom of information Act. (Applause)We will increase accountability by ensuring that everyone everywhere can vote in elections for part of their council every year. We are going to reform the House of Lords, improve the legal aid system, introduce devolution, first to Scotland and then progressively and with consent to Wales and to the regions of England. (Applause)We will enact our Charter of Rights, backed up by a complementary Bill of Rights. We are going to make these and other changes because our party and our people recognise and respond to the need for stronger safeguards for personal and civil rights and responsibilities in Britain.In making changes we are dealing in a practical and progressive way with the essential questions of how our country is ruled and whether the system of rule serves the changed and changing needs of the nation. These are the actions of a confident and liberating party. A party that believes that the duty of democratic government extends to enabling the people and to giving extra vitality to democracy.You proved that again in this conference last year when you voted to establish the working party on electoral systems. The decision was taken in recognition of the fact that this is a serious issue of debate, that it must be addressed with the fullest and widest public information and that it is about the basic questions of the quality and strength of representation and government and not about the tactical jostling of parties and politicians. That is what the issue is about. It is the right way to approach democratic change and that is how we will approach it in government.Comrades, change is most certainly needed. In these last 12 years the centralisation of government power has been intensified. There has been a continual effort to politicise the Civil Service and to subordinate government employees. Local democracy, whether run by Labour, Conservative or anybody else, has been seriously eroded. Political patronage has been used on a prodigious scale. Official secrecy has been increasingly used for the protection of government interest and not for the protection of the public interest. (Applause)In these last 12 years women, the majority of our country, have lost rights under the law, not been granted in any way at all an advance to real equality under the law. All that has happened and is happening in a modern country with deep democratic roots. It has not produced efficiency and competence in government. It has produced arrogance, incompetence, shiftiness, waste in government and it has proved that many civil and individual rights which we thought to be basic and unbreakable in Britain have, in reality, been fragile. We need to safeguard against that fragility. That is why in government we will make constitutional change to give new potency to democracy and to promote good government in our democracy. We will strengthen freedom here by adding to it and as we do that we must also nurture the freedom growing elsewhere by actively supporting it.The need to do that and the opportunity to do that increased beyond measure six weeks ago when the drunken conspirators in the Kremlin were defeated. The world became a different place and it changed for the better again last Friday, when President Bush announced his fresh initiative for disarmament on an unprecedented scale. Britain must be part of that progress. (Applause)We must be part of the new negotiations on verifiable disarmament and we should be doing everything possible now, straightaway, as a Labour government will, to bring in the other nuclear powers, to halt and reverse proliferation and to secure agreements to end testing of nuclear devices. (Applause)That is the active role that we should be taking in the world and we have got to be part of the efforts to ensure that progress is sustained in the Soviet Union too.The course of action that we must take is clear. I offer you this statement as a guide, \u2018I often hear the question, how can the West help us today? My reply is as paradoxical as the whole of my life has been. You can help us most if you help the Soviet Union on its irreversible but immensely complicated road to democracy.\u2019 They are the words of President Havel of Czechoslovakia speaking to the United States Congress last year. Nothing could be more articulate, nothing could be more persuasive about the need to give active support to the development of democracy and change in the Soviet Union and those words of a former victim of Soviet oppression, a great democrat, a man of unsurpassed humanity, Vaclav Havel. We must help to make that advance to democracy and economic security and we must help to ensure that it is stable and peaceful and since disarmament is central to economic progress in the Soviet Union our aid must be linked to that. As Oleg made clear on this platform on Monday, that is what the democrats of the Soviet Union and its Republics want us to do and we must not let them down.Our help will feed the roots of freedom and just as it will contribute to the economic and political security of the people of the Soviet Union and its former satellites, so it will be an investment in our own well­being. As the massive resources that have been dedicated to the Soviet military system are diverted to civil production, we in the West can increase our peace dividend. We must use it to build economic strength. We must use it as an industrial dividend, a production dividend, a jobs dividend, an investment dividend, so that any peace dividend that we get in our generation is an enduring source of wealth and not merely a short-term bonus that has to be used for paying redundancy and unemployment benefits. We can make it that source of continual wealth for expenditure on the social priorities and the development of our country, if we use that dividend properly for the purpose of investment to advance our economy.We certainly need that economic strength in Britain. We need it for Britain and we need it in order to help to combat poverty in a world in which a silent emergency of starvation is killing countless thousands of children and women and men every week. Nothing, not even the historic changes in Eastern Europe and the potential for famine and turmoil in the Soviet Union, nothing must be allowed to obscure the suffering of the countless destitute millions in Africa, Asia and Latin America. (Applause)To those who will not concern themselves with those tragedies, I simply say, if mercy does not move you then concern yourselves with the condition of humanity for your own sake. The misery of the poor today could, in this interdependent world, become your cataclysm tomorrow. Unless the free and affluent countries play their full part in the conquest of poverty, that poverty will eat away at prosperity, security, stability, even liberty itself. We are democratic socialists. In our own society we know that the rights of the individual depend upon the actions of the community. The actions to establish and maintain the political, economic and social freedom. The same is true of the world.Just as in our own society we know that opportunity for the individual depends upon the way that the community acts together, so we know that is true for the whole world and that is why we say, act together to combat poverty, for in doing so we add to the wealth of all. Act together to defeat ignorance, for in doing so we add to the knowledge of all. Act together to cure and prevent disease, for in doing so we promote the health of all. Act together to protect the environment, for in doing so we all become safer. Act together to stop war, for in doing so we all profit from peace. Act together as a world, one humanity. (Applause)Friends, in our country and for the sake of our country, it is time for a new direction, time for a government with a sense of real national purpose. As we approach the year 2000, we the British people have to decide how we are going to mark the end of the millennium and the beginning of a new age. Is it to be with nothing much more than a New Year\u2019s Eve party? Are we going to be able to greet the year 2000 as a fair and free society, a strong and productive economy, a confident and creative people? If that is the future that we want and it is, it must be prepared for with determination, vitality, vision. Only we will do that. Conservatives never will. The democratic socialism that we believe in is, above all, about enabling people to get the best out of life by putting the best into life. Its purpose is to ensure that people are prepared for the future, able to control their own destiny. Conservatism, especially British Toryism, is above all about letting the future look after itself, about letting people fend for themselves, whether they are able to or not.Now is the time for change from their way. Time to build Britain's industrial strength, time to make our National Health Service modern and secure, time to raise the standards of our skills and schools, time to create a cleaner, safer environment. It is time to start transforming Britain from the country it has become to the country we know it can be.It is time for that change. It is time for Labour. (Prolonged applause)You really are marvellous people, honestly. I tell you, in these last couple of weeks when the odd criticisms floated past my eyes, the people who have really communicated how they feel and what they want for the country have been the kind of people who are here, only many, many more. People in the Labour Party, people outside the Labour Party, ordinary people, who have said that we cannot go on like it has been and we need a lead to take us into the future and that has been the best form of encouragement that Glenys and I could ever have sought. Thank you for all of that.Now, I will tell you, this idea of extended ovation is something of a novelty in our party but singing is not. How about if we get up and sing a song which is not only a great hymn of progress but also, in our case, is a forecast of an absolute racing certainty. \u2018We shall overcome.\u2019 (Singing) (Prolonged applause)

aVComrades and friends, it is a great honour to have been elected Leader of the Labour Party and it is a proud occasion for me to address conference for the first time as your leader.Not all of you were present at the special conference in July, so let me thank you now for placing your trust in me. It is an immense responsibility as we begin a new era for Labour.At the outset let me make one thing clear: it is not my wish or my intention to lead for long a party of opposition. I was elected to lead a party of government and, with your help, that is what I will do. (Applause) I take over this mantle of leadership from Neil Kinnock. Neil had the vision to see what needed to be done to carry Labour forward, he had the courage to take on the task and he had the determination and skill to see it through. No one else could have achieved that. (Applause) Neil, the Labour movement owes you an incalculable debt of gratitude, and all of us owe the same debt of gratitude to Glenys, because if ever there was a complete partnership, this is it. We are all enriched by the warmth, the integrity, the personal effort and the dedication you have both shown over the past eight years. Neil and Glenys, we salute you today. (Applause)I want on this occasion to pay a tribute to everyone who worked so hard during the general election campaign - my colleagues in the shadow cabinet, fellow Members of Parliament, members of the NEC, the party's staff all round the country, Labour candidates - men and women of outstanding ability and dedication - party agents, volunteers young and old, and of course our colleagues who organised so skilfully in Trade Unions for Labour. People did not just work hard; they gave all they had to give, physically, mentally, emotionally. So please accept our thanks, as well as the thanks of the entire labour movement. We were defeated, but we have nothing to be ashamed of, because you are exceptional people and the labour movement has good reason to be proud of you.We fought a hard and honourable election campaign. We had a united and professionally organised party. There was a sense of energy and excitement, a sense of purpose which many had not experienced in the whole of their political lives, and we gained seats right across the country. Indeed, we were the only party to make gains, and we made many of them in spectacular style. So I am proud of the campaign we fought and I am particularly proud because we told the British people the truth. We told the truth about our policies and we told the truth about the condition of our country. The Tories did not, and all that has happened since 9 April has confirmed our worst fears and exposed their deceit.I do not believe that the return of a government, last April was in any way a positive endorsement by the British people, nor do I accept that it was a vote of confidence. There was no enthusiasm for this government, no admiration for their performance, no sense that, after 13 years, they had delivered the goods, fulfilled their promises or proved themselves worthy of the nation's trust. That vote on 9 April was a reluctant vote, and now, six months on, how many of those reluctant voters who gave John Major the benefit of the doubt are regretting their decision? (Applause)Two weeks ago, confronted with a sterling crisis of their own creation, we saw a government gripped by indecision, paralysed by fear, and a Prime Minister plodding on to disaster. John Major had only one policy - to wait and see, what happened. The result was total humiliation, not only for himself and his government but for Britain, the opt-out Prime Minister leading a do-nothing government off the European stage. So much for being at the heart of Europe.We were promised a New Statesman and what have we got instead? The Spectator. (Applause) The man who dreamt of toppling the Deutschmark carries the responsibility for the single most disastrous day in our post-war economic history. So our people are entitled to be angry. The cynical deceit of the Tory election campaign, the easy promise that all the economy needed was the reassurance of a Tory victory - all now exposed in the harsh light of the real world.But of course this was not just the work of weeks; it was the result of years of economic error compounded by mismanagement, and it has left the pound not top of the pile but as the one currency that no one wants to hold. The dole queues, poverty, repossessions, the collapse of industrial investment - a record which has sent our manufacturing industry to the breaker's yard. There is no escape for John Major, no alibi. As Chief Secretary, as Chancellor and as Prime Minister, he has designed and delivered the disaster. It is all his own work.In the debate in the House of Commons last week a Tory Member had the gall to ask me how much Labour\u2019s programme for economic recovery would cost; this from a party which in one day, Black Wednesday, in the course of its failed attempt to prop up the pound, cost this nation £1,000 million. Just think what could be done constructively with £1,000 million. How many houses could be built, how many schools could be repaired, how many hospital wards could be opened with £1,000 million? (Applause)The events of the past weeks have proved once and for all that the Tories have failed. What we have seen is the devaluation not just of a currency but of a Prime Minister and an entire government. Yesterday their humiliation was complete. After a week of Downing Street press briefings blaming the Germans for sinking the pound and after the shameless attribution of blame to the Bundesbank by Mr Major in the House of Commons, yesterday the Chancellor, Mr Lamont, travelled to Brussels and finally apologised at a meeting of Community Finance Ministers, while still trying to give the impression that it was all the fault of the press.It is surely bad enough that yet again this government\u2019s economic strategy is in total disarray, but what is really unusual this time: is that they cannot even work out who is to blame. If ever there was a time for apologies to be made, it is certainly now, and it is not just Norman Lamont who should be apologising; it is the Prime Minister. He should apologise to the. British people for his betrayal of their trust. (Applause)What started out on Black Wednesday as a tragi-comedy has degenerated into Whitehall farce. John Major and Norman Lamont - the Laurel and Hardy of British politics. Another fine mess they got us into! (Applause) And just look at that mess. In three days last week 3,000 jobs went at British Aerospace, 1,500 were lost at Ford and nearly 1,000 went at Rolls-Royce; and today we hear that the government is sacking 2,000 workers from its Defence Research Agency, with no thought at all of how such skills might be used elsewhere to strengthen our industrial future. With these crucial sectors in such deep decline, we have good reason to fear for our ability ever to repair the damage that this government has inflicted.Have you noticed the way Tory Ministers steer well clear of the management techniques they want to apply to everyone else? They keep saying that the idle and incompetent must be weeded out and they call for performance-related pay. If the Prime Minister is so keen on these ideas, why does he not apply them to the Cabinet? I think the trouble is that he would not know where to start. Should he start on the idle or concentrate on the incompetent? Would he be able to tell which is which? (Applause) Would there be any Ministers left? But if the Cabinet faced performance-related pay, they would be in real trouble. With the present crime wave, what, I wonder, would be the proper performance-related pay for the Home Secretary? With the current trade deficit, how much would the President of the Board of Trade deserve? Perhaps it is just as well he is not short of a bob or two himself. And with unemployment rising to three million, what could the Employment Secretary hope to get?But I suppose it is no surprise that Mr Major does not introduce such a principle. After all, he would have to apply the same rule to himself and his Chancellor. The fact is that if this government were on performance-related pay, the taxpayer would not be paying them; they would be paying the taxpayer. (Applause) So no wonder they will not practise what they preach.I want to announce this afternoon a new policy. It is a citizen\u2019s charter, designed, they usually say, to hold one particular group of service providers to account, forcing them to meet new standards of efficiency and giving customers rights of redress if they do not measure up. It is a citizen\u2019s charter for the Cabinet. Perhaps we should call it \u2018Majorwatch.\u2019 From now on I and my colleagues on the front bench will be checking their every move. In the days and months ahead we will expose all their broken, promises, all their empty commitments, so that the British people can hold them to account. (Applause)I made my first contribution to Majorwatch in the debate in the House of Commons last Thursday, and it gives you some idea of what we are up against. Before, the election the Prime Minister promised that the Forestry Commission would not be privatised. After the election it was a different story. The explanation given by Downing Street for this U-turn, for breaking a pre-election pledge, was: The commitment given by the. Prime Minister on this matter was drafted incorrectly during the frenzied activity of the general election campaign. So there we have it - the frenzied activity of the general election campaign offered as a justification for any reversal of policy, any shift in the government\u2019s position. So there is clearly no more devalued political currency than a Conservative election promise. (Applause)In the bleak aftermath of the early days after the election fashionable political commentators said that Labour was dead. They said that our vision of a fairer society had been conclusively rejected by the British people, and that the only future lay in abandoning our beliefs; even jettisoning our name. But they were wrong. Why? Let me tell you why. They were wrong not merely because the Tory dream has turned into a nightmare. They were wrong because they failed to understand the enduring values of our movement; they failed to, appreciate the underlying beliefs that inspire and guide us.When the Labour Party was born at the end of the last century it was born, out of the desire of working people .to challenge the power of private capital and the tyranny of the ruling elite. It was born out of the determination of ordinary citizens to play their full part in society, to claim for themselves the opportunities enjoyed by others, opportunities of-individual advancement and fulfilment that had previously been denied to them. The Labour Party was a vehicle for their individual aspirations; it was a force for social justice and for change.Our strength today lies in these same principles, in our belief that people should enjoy as a right of citizenship and not as a privilege of wealth the opportunity of a good education, the chance to find a decent job with decent pay, the opportunity to buy or rent a decent home, to have access to child-care and health care and security in their old age, to enjoy a clean environment, to walk the streets of their neighbourhood in safety and to have a real voice in the conduct of public affairs. And our strength lies in our knowledge that we are, each of us, members of one community, and it is our responsibility as citizens to work together for the good of that community as a whole, because we believe that the power of all of us together can advance the good of each individual.These are the principles that inspire us. They are the bedrock of our movement, and we know in our heart that our values, the values of individual opportunity and social justice, are also the values of the British people.This Conservative government has an idea about people that I must say I find totally objectionable. Fundamentally, they believe people are driven, purely by greed and self-interest. They believe all of us are motivated by a desire to accumulate wealth with no regard for others. They see us exclusively as consumers in a market place. Everything is up for grabs as long as you have the money. In this blinkered view of the world there is little room for community, little room for compassion, little room for helping others to share the benefits we enjoy. Their language is the language of self, of self-interest.But I have too much faith in the British people to accept that view. I do not believe that the British people lack a sense of compassion, a sense of decency, a sense of honour. I believe they do care about others and that they are concerned about their country\u2019s future, for people live in communities, not in isolation. I believe they want to be citizens of a country which shows care and responsibility for all its people and which does not pass by on the other side. (Applause) And for those who claim that Labour lets its heart rule its head, I say they could not be more wrong. In modern civilised societies, social justice and economic strength go hand in hand.It is a simple enough point and it is plain common sense: the more people there are out of work, the more people there are without homes, the more people there are in poverty, the heavier the burden on our economy. It costs the public exchequer £8,000 a year for every person who is unemployed and it costs £14,000 a year for every homeless family. And still the Tories say \u2018We cannot afford Labour\u2019s policies to revive our businesses and put our people back to work.\u2019 Tory policies are not only heartless, they are also mindless, and it is no wonder there is a great longing for a better way forward.Later this year, the Special Commission, on Social Justice, which I have proposed, will begin its work. More than a new policy initiative, the commission will be the first serious attempt since Beveridge to assess need and find new ways of dealing with our deep social problems. Income, wealth distribution; poverty, social welfare policy and taxation are all interlinked and have to be tackled together by us in a strategic and radical way.Ina recent interview Mr Major was asked about poverty in Britain. Do you know what he said? He said \u2018What poverty?\u2019 \u2018What poverty?\u2019 said the man who, as Minister for Social Security, invented the Social Fund. \u2018What poverty?\u2019 said the man who took housing benefit away from three million people. Well, Mr Major may not know what poverty is, but he certainly knows how to create it (Applause)After 13 years of Tory government people begin to think that the condition of our country is all part of some inevitable social decline, but it is not so. It is the legacy of this government and it is not inevitable. There is a better way.What is the role of government in modern society? We know what the Tories say about that. They want to leave everything to the market. Some of them are not even sure that society exists. For them it is more important to build a free market than a free society. They do not accept that governments have a responsibility to shape society, to offer opportunities and to provide for need. They believe governments should abdicate in favour of the market. But a society run only on the lines of a market is a society in which power is in the hands of the few who have economic strength, not the many who have democratic rights, and it is shaped to answer financial demand, not social need. It is a society that respects purchasing power, not individual rights.In a revealing phrase Mr Major said he wanted to see what he called the \u2018privatisation of choice\u2019: note, not the extension of choice, not the improving of choice, but the privatisation of choice. Now what does that mean? Let me put it another way: if you want choice, you pay, or the other way round, no pay, no choice. (Applause) Not a classless society but a heartless society, ruled by a government devoid of any sense of responsibility for its people.Mr Major\u2019s first comment as he finally emerged blinking from the air-raid shelter last week was to protest that it was not his fault. It was the markets that were irrational That is a case of the pot calling the kettle grey. (Applause) And has it not occurred to him that it might just be a mistake to let these same markets, these irrational markets, determine all aspects of our national life?For the past 13 years people have been obliged to live their lives at the mercy of this irrational force called the market. But we know to our cost that this approach has failed. The market must serve our needs, not we the needs of the market; and if the market system becomes an agent of speculation and stagnation instead of an engine for prosperity, then it is time for governments to act. For governments are not impotent. They have power at their disposal to shape events, to bring about change, to improve the lives of the people whose trust, after all, they carry. That is why it is so unacceptable, so unbearable to see the injustice in our country, the waste of human talent, the lack of hope, the loss of pride, because it is not inevitable.We in Labour stand for active government - active government not absence of government; government taking responsibility, not pointing the finger at someone else; government caring about all the people, not just looking after its own; government acting to help industry, to create jobs, to boost the housing market, not sitting on its hands waiting for those green shoots to sprout. An active government is what Britain needs today, and it needs it urgently if we are ever to lift ourselves out of this downward spiral of decline.I believe our people want government to take responsibility for the things that they as individuals just cannot provide - safe streets, an efficient transport system, a high standard of education, good health care, training for jobs, a strong economy  - for without these things people are not free, nor do they have real choices.Of course government should not run people\u2019s lives for them, but it can help them live their own lives to the full; and government need not run companies or small businesses, but it must create the conditions for them to prosper. Good government, active government, lies at the very heart of a fair, prosperous and free society.It is not difficult to see where action needs to be taken in Britain in 1992. We need action to get the economy moving again, with measures to stimulate investment, create jobs and boost the housing market. We need action for, families, action to build new homes, homes for rent as well as for sale, homes that people can afford, homes built to modern standards of energy efficiency, homes that get families out of the costly misery of bed and breakfast and get our building industry working once again. (Applause)We need action for young people, to give them the skills to do the jobs to win success, both for themselves and for Britain. A government that leaves training to the vagaries of the private sector puts school-leavers and workers at the mercy of people whose priority is profit and whose interests are short term. It is the responsibility of government to invest in the future of our workforce.We need action to stop the turmoil in our schools. For far too long they have been used as an ideological battleground by the Tories. Children, teachers and parents have been pushed this way and that by one failed reform after another, and we must restore stability and confidence to our classrooms. (Applause) We need action on the environment. Active government means standing up for the quality of people\u2019s lives, and in our society that requires tougher regulations on waste disposal, making the polluters pay for the harm they inflict, and high standards of water and air quality.It is the job of active government to make sure that the strategic assets of our country are preserved. One of Britain\u2019s most important resources is our immense coal reserves. It was ready access to coal that put Britain at the front of the industrial revolution and it is the plentiful remaining reserves that give us an edge over most of our European competitors. Yet Britain\u2019s present government is proposing to abandon half of all the pits that remain. That is vandalism. (Applause) It is vandalism because it will destroy whole communities built around their role of providing the nation with coal. But it is also vandalism because it will destroy a national asset which could meet Britain\u2019s long-term energy needs.But we now have in this country a government so beholden to the vested interests it has created - the private water monopolies, the private energy monopolies, the, deregulated transport concerns - that they are too weak to set and enforce the standards that the people want. That is why we are calling for an environmental protection agency to tell the people the truth about the water they drink, the food they eat and the air they breathe.An active government means providing efficient and caring public services. That is why we are committed to a National Health Service that is free at the time you need it. (Applause) We will never abandon that principle, because it is the only way to ensure that all patients get the treatment they need, not the treatment they can afford; and it is the only way to ensure, that the people who work in the Health Service can concentrate on providing the treatment that gives the best results, not the treatment that gets the biggest commercial return.People of pension age make up almost half of all National Health Service patients. They are the generation who created the National Health Service and who paid for it all through their working lives. Surely it is the job of government to make sure that the National Health. Service can now serve them and any member of our society who needs the support of a modern health service.Active government means strengthening the rights of people at work. Labour believes we need to establish a framework of rights for employees as part of a fair system of industrial relations. We also believe that the rights pf workers are best advanced through the work of free and active trade unions, with whom we in our party are proud to be linked. (Applause)I have long been committed to a minimum wage which gives people a fair reward for their labour, for low pay leads to low aspirations, low standards and low productivity. We want Britain to be able to stand alongside her European partners and say: \u2018We are proud of our workforce and we treat them with the respect and dignity they deserve.\u2019It is the role of active government to ensure that everyone can contribute to our country\u2019s public life, not just half the population. We need women to participate fully in all fields of work if we are ever to respond successfully to our country's needs. I have to say that this is as true in politics as in any other field. But if we are to change attitudes, we must have women in place to change them; and if we are to have women in place, we must make it possible for them to be there. Child care provision, flexible working hours, job-sharing, are practical and necessary measures for women - and for men too - who should not have to choose between family life and outside employment.We believe that active government must also mean democratic government, with people having a real say in their community's affairs, having more, not less, control over the decisions that affect their lives. That is why we want to strengthen local democracy and decentralise power. That is why we need a Scottish Parliament, a Welsh Assembly and devolution of power to the regions of England. (Applause)We need a Freedom of Information Act to break down the barriers of secrecy that surround government institutions. Knowledge is power. We want to share that power with the people and we should start by sharing knowledge with them.We need to push back the barriers of prejudice that restrict the choice and waste the talents of so many in our society. It is not enough to make discrimination illegal. An active government must positively promote opportunities for all our citizens in every aspect of public life.I look around Britain today and I see millions of families who, instead of feeling that they are moving forwards, are struggling to stay in the same place, struggling to make the household budget balance, struggling to keep a job, run a business or keep a roof over their head, struggling to make sure their children get a decent education and a solid start to their working lives.The British people deserve better than this. We are a nation rich in talent and in skills, men and women who are eager to work hard and to succeed, men and women who want to play their full part in the life of our nation, and young people full of energy and aspirations. All these people ask is the opportunity to prove their worth; and it is up to government to unlock the extraordinary potential of our ordinary people. For the people of Britain deserve good government, and for that they need active government, a government that will stand up for them, a government that will meet its responsibilities so that they in turn can meet theirs.But of course the responsibility of active government extends far beyond our national boundaries. Earlier I spoke about our duty as citizens to work together for the good of the whole community, in the knowledge that the power of all can advance the good of each. That basic tenet of democratic socialism applies not just to us as individuals but equally to Britain as a country on the world stage. I have always believed that Britain's future lies in Europe and that we must take a confident and leading role in the European Community. That has been my firm conviction throughout my political life, and the events of the last few weeks have done nothing but reinforce it.But we cannot expect to influence either the major political and economic events of our own continent or the direction of global affairs if Britain is pushed to the periphery and relegated to the second division of Europe. We are not advocates of a European super state, we never have been, but we are determined to play our part, working closely with our sister socialist parties, in maintaining the momentum for closer co-operation, to build a stronger European community, to extend social justice, to preserve the environment and to deepen our democracy. That is why we are advocates for change and progress in the European Community.For Europe cannot stand still. We can either move forward or retreat into isolationism. On 1 January the single market will begin. Europe will be a community for business, but still not a community for people, and that is something we in the Labour Party cannot accept. It is why we have strongly supported the Social Chapter, which provides the framework for a social dimension in Europe. It is also why we believe the Community must take joint action on the real economy at the heart of its economic policy, making growth and jobs the benchmark of success.We demand that the Community strengthen its democracy. Too many of its institutions are too remote and not accountable enough to the people they represent. The principle of subsidiarity - making decisions at the closest practicable level to the people - must be given real force. We have argued for a more open and effective Council of Ministers, closer scrutiny of the work of the Commission and more power to the European Parliament.Mr Major, struggling to patch together his crumbling European policy and his stumbling EC Presidency, will no doubt talk a lot about subsidiarity and the democratic deficit over the next few weeks and months. I for one will only believe Mr Major\u2019s new commitment to subsidiarity when he puts it into practice at home. That which he recommends for Europe should also be applied at home in. Britain. (Applause) If it is good for Europe, why is it not good enough for Britain?But of course our commitment .to Europe should strengthen, not weaken, ours obligations to a wider world. Right at the heart of our policies should be strong and consistent support for the United Nations. I have always believed that that is the best means of principled and collective international action. I want to see the powers of the UN strengthened and I want to see it broaden its agenda to tackle the economic and social issues which call out for a global approach just as desperately as do the environment, poverty and peace­keeping.The new challenges to international stability come from poverty in the Third World, worldwide environmental decline and regional conflicts and unrest. In the former Yugoslavia we see the tragic consequences in terms of human suffering of ethnic intolerance and civil war. Labour not only supports the UN\u2019s peace-keeping role; we argue strongly for the strengthening of the mandatory sanctions and an increase in humanitarian aid.At a time when the hearts of our people have been moved by the suffering in Somalia and elsewhere in Africa, what does our government do? It threatens a massive reduction in Britain's already shamefully low budget for overseas aid. To seek to inflict the results: of their economic incompetence upon millions of people living in poverty in the developing world is not just callous, it is morally repugnant. (Applause)Labour knows that we cannot afford to allow the downward spiral of poverty, debt, protectionism and instability to continue. As a world community, we simply cannot afford it. So we must .work to make Britain a strong and confident country again, so that she can play her rightful part in shaping the world of, the future, a strong and confident country within Europe, within the United Nations, within the Commonwealth. Everywhere where Britain has influence we must strive unceasingly for co-operation and for new and imaginative solutions to our problems.We live in a time of great pessimism, not just in our own country but throughout the world. As the fear of nuclear annihilation recedes, it is not being replaced by optimism but by new fears, fears of environmental catastrophe, of economic disintegration, of racism and fascism, of new ethnic and religious tensions, and the fear that we do not have the means or the will to deal with what lies ahead. People want answers, but they feel there are none. They want action, but they see none.More than anything else today Britain needs leadership, leadership to take the long view of problems and to act to solve them, to anticipate future tensions and to act to avoid them, to restore hope; leadership to make people feel their voice is being heard, their needs no longer being ignored.Labour is going to provide that leadership. In the years that remain of this discredited government Labour will be a fighting opposition. We will relentlessly challenge every attempt by this government to inflict further damage on the fabric of our society or to limit the chances of our people. But at the same time, in every week of every month, we will be working and preparing for government. For there is a void at the heart of our public life in Britain, a vacuum left by 13 years of Conservative rule. It is up to Labour now, to all of us working together, to fill that void, to fill it with a new programme that responds to the real needs of our communities, with leadership that speaks for the real interests of our people and with a vision that will restore hope and create confidence in our country\u2019s great future. (Sustained applause)

aVTony, comrades and friends, there can surely be no one at our Conference today who was not profoundly moved - and indeed inspired - by the historic event which occurred in Washington earlier this month. The Labour Prime Minister of Israel and the leader of the PLO shook hands - a gesture of peace and reconciliation which few would have dared to hope for even a short time ago.Let us today salute the courage and vision of two men who dared to take risks for peace - Yitzhak Rabin and Yasser Arafat. And let us also acknowledge the patient and dedicated mediation - so vital to the success of these negotiations - of our colleagues in the Labour Government of Norway.And, as at long last, we witness the end of the inhuman system of apartheid in South Africa, we applaud all those in that country who are striving for peace and democracy. To Nelson Mandela and the ANC we send from this Labour Conference our warmest good wishes. And more than that, in preparation for next April\u2019s historic elections, the Labour Party pledges every help we can give to ensure that those elections will be democratic, will be free, and will be fair.We are truly living at a time of momentous change: a time of great opportunity; a time when it is surely right to hope for a new world of peace and of progress. But here in our own continent of Europe, the optimism generated by the end of the Cold War has been overtaken by new uncertainties. The transition to democracy was bound to be risky, long and hard - as recent events in Russia and the states of the former Soviet Union show only too clearly.And of course, we have witnessed the tragedy and the despair of the war in Bosnia. The horrors of so-called ethnic cleansing are a terrible reminder of the darkest period in Europe\u2019s history. And who can doubt that both Europe and the world community should have acted far more decisively to prevent the escalation of the conflict and to secure a peaceful solution?But instead, governments have held back, and no one has been prepared to take risks for peace. Sanctions against Serbia were too little and too late. The international community has given the UN an almost impossible task, with neither the resources nor the commitment necessary for effective peacekeeping or humanitarian relief. Surely, there has never been a time when an effective UN mattered so much: a time when clear vision and bold leadership were so sorely needed to shape our future.The momentous events in the Middle East and in South Africa have shown us what can be achieved if we are prepared to take risks for the things we believe in.The Labour Party has a proud history of international action. The post-war Labour Government was a key architect of the institutions of the United Nations. Now, in a new era, it falls to our generation to provide new leadership and to strive for a new vision of peace, democracy, and economic justice. In this new world of movement and change, our commitment to a strong United Nations must be the foundation stone of our foreign policy. We must maintain the momentum of disarmament, both nuclear and conventional. We must work to prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons, and agree a comprehensive test ban treaty.And, having seen the divisions between East and West start to fade into history, it must now be our purpose to end the cruel division between North and South. We must set a new agenda of international economic justice that can release millions of people in the developing world from their lives of debt, disease and poverty. And we must also face the new challenge to the security of our planet, protecting and enhancing the world environment, in the recognition that we are the sole guardians of a world we have borrowed from future generations.The values that propel the Labour Party\u2019s international ambition - our determined commitment to build a better world - are needed today as never before. And these same values are needed as never before in Britain, too. Because there can be no doubt that this country has been damaged and diminished by fourteen years of Conservative rule: years in which the extraordinary bounty of North Sea Oil offered us an unprecedented opportunity. We had the opportunity to rebuild, to re-equip and to restore the strength and vitality of a country that once was famed as the workshop of the world. But instead of seizing that opportunity, it has been thrown away. These have been fourteen years of waste, years of neglect, years of decline. Fourteen years of casino economics - a speculators\u2019 paradise - have plunged British industry into two record-breaking recessions with an inflationary boom in between.And what has been the result? Economic growth lower than in the 1960s and the 1970s; investment in manufacturing - the vital wealth creator of our economy lower than in 1979; a multi-billion pound deficit in both our public finances and our overseas trade; record levels of homelessness; record levels of crime; a gap between rich and poor wider than in Victorian times and, the most tragic relic of all of these fourteen Tory years, officially nearly three million people in this country without work. These are the facts of fourteen years of Conservative rule. These are the facts that nobody can contest: the facts that mock the Tory hype and propaganda. These are the facts that explode their so-called economic miracle: the so-called Thatcher revolution of which John Major claimed to be so proud when he was her Chief Secretary and then her Chancellor. \u2018An astonishing economic transformation,\u2019 were the very words he used to describe those fourteen years.But I doubt whether we shall hear very much more about that from the lips of Mr Major. For what did he say in a revealing interlude between TV, interviews a few weeks ago? What confidence did he share with Michael Brunson of ITN, unaware that his words were being recorded? What was it he said about his own Party? How did he describe them? \u2018A Party,\u2019 he said, \u2018Still harking back to a golden age that never was.\u2019They, the poor fools, still believed their own propaganda. But now we know that he, John Major, never ever believed it. \u2018A golden age that never was\u2019: six words that crystallise the Prime Minister\u2019s view of the Conservative Government\u2019s dismal record in office.But I do not think. I. should be too hard on John Major. He is beginning to understand what his Party is made of. He has discovered that members of his Cabinet - let me put this more delicately than he does himself - are of doubtful parentage. And at long last he has realised that many of his back-benchers are barmy. I really do not know why it took him so long - we have been trying to tell him that for years.Still, sorting out the barmies on the back benches is really a matter for internal Tory debate. It is the bunglers that the rest of us have to worry about. But I gather John Major has decided to take a fresh look at employment rights. He is finding out what it is like to be at the mercy of a particularly ruthless employer - the Conservative Party. Perhaps even at this late stage he may decide that the Social Charter is a good thing after all, because we can all see the Tory vultures circling above Downing Street. The threat of another unseemly dismissal is hanging in the air.Mr Major\u2019s Cabinet colleagues - you know the ones I mean, let us call them the B-team - are busy behind the scenes sharpening the knives and jostling for position. Only the other weekend the new Chancellor, Mr Clarke, cheerfully swinging his six pack, tells the BBC that the Government is still in a hole. What a helpful remark that was. With Cabinet friends like him, who needs barmies?And then, Norman Fowler - apparently a friend of the Prime Minister - sends the poor man on a Central Office suicide mission; a morale-boosting tour of the Tory constituencies. Mental cruelty on this scale tells you all you need to know about the modern Conservative Party.But let me say this to the Tory Party and to the men in grey suits who are even now preparing to hand Mr Major his P45: it is the people who should decide who runs this country. No change of personnel at the top will alter the views of the British people. No night, of the long knives will stem the tide of disgust that has swept through this country. It makes no difference who leads this clapped out Government: the people will never trust the Conservatives again.Faced with the chronic failure of this discredited Government, people in Britain today are angry: not just disappointed, not just disillusioned, but angry. They are angry at the state of Britain; angry at the total absence of leadership; angry at the absence of vision; angry at the hypocrisy and double standards; and they are angry at the incessant incompetence of a Government they no longer respect and increasingly despise. And are they not - and are we not - entitled to be angry: angry at the misery of mass unemployment; angry at the cruel denial of opportunity to our young people; angry at the callous acceptance of injustice; angry at Government without purpose, and politics without principle?Today I offer the British people a better way and a clear choice: a choice between Labour\u2019s high skill, high tech, high wage economy, and John Major\u2019s dead-beat, sweatshop, bargain basement Britain; a choice between Labour\u2019s opportunity society which invests, which educates and which cares, and the sad reality of neglect, division, and rising crime that is Tory Britain today; a choice between Labour\u2019s commitment to democratic renewal, rights, and citizenship, and John Major\u2019s centralised, secretive and shabby Government.If proof were needed of the nature of the choices, let me remind you of the advertisement placed in the German press by our own Government earlier this year. It was designed, apparently, to attract foreign investment to Britain. It had one selling point - cheap labour. There was no mention of the skills and talents of our workforce; no reference to our history of innovation; no pride in our great engineering expertise - just cheap labour.That advert disgusted me. I was ashamed of its low ambition for our people. And, like them, I was appalled to see Britain sold so cheap. But nothing reveals more clearly the true nature of Conservative economic policy and the choice that Labour offers instead. For Britain can never succeed as a low skilled, low wage economy. Britain will only succeed if we build - as we know we can - a high quality workforce with the talent, the drive and the ambition to match and to beat the best in the world.What Labour stands for is investment: long term investment in the productive capacity of our economy; investment in people and their skills; investment in technology and innovation; investment in our regions and in the infrastructure that underpins our nation's prosperity. Ours is a strategy that looks to the future. It is a strategy that embraces the changes taking place in the industrial world: a strategy for a modern labour force, where women are equal partners both at home and at work. And it is a strategy that puts the skills and the talents of all our people at the very heart of our economic programme.We believe that wealth creation is not the exclusive preserve of a privileged few but requires - indeed it depends upon - the active involvement of the whole community. We reject the absurd double standard which encourages massive rewards for those at the top whilst everyone else has to suffer pay cuts, longer hours, and fewer and fewer employment rights.It is the old Tory trick - one special rule for their elite, another for all the rest. And just look at this double standard at work. The highest paid director of the East Midlands privatised electricity company will receive £226,000 this year, an increase over two years of 98 per cent. But a young Midlands hairdresser was told by her employer that, since the wages councils had been abolished, she would no longer get the £2.88 an hour to which she was previously entitled. She would get just £2 an hour - a drop of 31 per cent. The chairman of North West Water got an increase - an increase - of £72,000 this year, bringing his wages to £238,000, while an auxiliary nurse working long hours in hospital received a pay rise of just £105 for the year, from £7,000 to £7,105, because the Government told her the country could not afford to pay her a penny more than that. And now Kenneth Clarke tells this nurse and other public sector workers that they will not get any pay increase at all this year - unless, of course, they become more productive. What utter nonsense is this? How does a nurse become more productive? Does she juggle two bed pans at the same time? And is a fire-fighter expected to put out fires in two different places at one and the same time?And whilst freezing pay, that same Mr Clarke puts up VAT and National Insurance, so that a typical family will pay £8.50 a week more in tax next year and £12.50 more the year after. How on earth does he expect hard-pressed people with families and mounting bills to cope with pay cuts on the one hand and tax and VAT increases on the other? How can it be right to impose a pay freeze and a VAT hike at one and the same time, hitting people\u2019s incomes twice over?But what else would you expect from a Government that abolishes wages councils, that opts out of the Social Chapter, that always finds ways of hitting low-waged people hardest, whilst the very rich seem to get bigger and bigger pay rises all the time. Because that is the double standard practised by this Government. That is their choice. That is the sickening hypocrisy of their trickle-down economics. And that is the reality of a Government that cares more about lining the pockets of its rich friends than it does about the real needs of individuals and families in our country today.Labour\u2019s choice is to end these double standards. That is why it is vital that we have a Labour Government to set anew agenda for the working people of Britain: a Labour Government that will restore to every working man and woman the dignity, the respect, and the rights to which they are entitled. Our charter of employment rights will give all working people basic rights that will come into force from the first day of their employment. We will give the same legal rights to every worker, part-time or full-time, temporary or permanent. We will give every working man and woman the right to protection against unfair dismissal, and access to health and safety protection. And every worker will have the right to join a trade union and have the right to union recognition. And it is for these principles that Labour fought at every stage of the Maastricht Bill, to secure for our people the same conditions at work and the same rights that the Social Chapter grants to every other working man and woman in the European Community. That fight will go on - right through next year\u2019s vital European elections - until a new Labour Government adopts the Social Chapter in full.And more - we will guarantee to all employees a national minimum wage. We need a national minimum wage in this country to help millions of low-paid workers, most of whom are women, who still suffer the worst exploitation and discrimination at work. Let us hear no more nonsense about the effect of a minimum wage on jobs, from a Government who have been responsible for the highest unemployment levels since the 1930s. If France can afford a national minimum wage, so can we. If Germany can afford minimum wage protection, so can we. And if members of the Cabinet would not dream of working for poverty wages, they should not force anyone else to do so either.Our choice is founded on a very simple principle - when people work for a living, they should be paid a living wage. There are officially nearly three million unemployed people in Britain today. And out of that three million, nearly one third of the total unemployed are under 25 years of age: almost a million young people who want to work, who want to get a start in life, who want to prove their worth and to earn their way. Young people are being deprived of the chance to work for a living. What a terrible waste of our nation\u2019s youth. What a dreadful betrayal of their future. And it is a shocking indictment of this Government that at such a time as this - when getting people back to work should be our overriding priority - central Government expenditure on employment and training has actually fallen by 22 per cent over the past five years, and expenditure on youth training has fallen by 34 per cent over the same period. Only a Tory Government would choose such a callous and irresponsible approach. And only a Labour Government will have the will and the resolve and the vision to get our nation working again.That is why our economic statement to Conference this year - drawn up by Gordon Brown and his Treasury team - reaffirmed the pledge made to the British people as long ago as 1944 that: \u2018The Government accept as one of their primary aims and 'responsibilities the maintenance of a high and stable level of employment.\u2019 This commitment to the goal of full employment is central to our economic approach. It means using not just interest rates - which now even the IMF believe should be cut - but all the instruments of economic policy to go for growth, jobs and investment. It means what we, as democratic socialists, have always believed, that it is the duty of Government to match unmet needs with unused resources. For surely it must be blindingly obvious to anyone in this country - this country of mass unemployment - that there is much work waiting to be done: work needing to be done to improve our schools, our hospitals, our transport system, and to improve and invest in our environment. All this work is waiting to be done, and crying out to be done now.For what kind of country is it that has record numbers of homeless families, hundred of thousands of construction workers on the dole, and building companies making losses in the worst and longest recession we have endured since the war? It is Conservative Britain, where local authorities are prohibited from spending billions of pounds of their own money to build homes and create jobs. Why can they not be allowed to do what everyone knows is plain common sense?But common sense is probably the last thing you will find in today\u2019s Conservative Party. After all, we know that Mr. Major thinks his own back benchers are barmy. But considering the Government\u2019s privatisation programme, maybe the Prime Minister should be questioning his own grip on reality. I have a suggestion for Mr Major. Find a quiet bathroom in Downing Street, look into the mirror, take a deep breath, repeat the words: \u2018Rail privatisation,\u2019 then ask this question: \u2018Mirror, mirror, on the wall, who is the barmiest of them all?\u2019We know that there is barely a single person in this country outside Downing Street who thinks it is a good idea to privatise British Rail. John MacGregor is struggling to defend a policy that has neither the support of the public, the private sector, nor even back­bench Tory MPs. At a time when we are invited to believe that the country is in a state of penury, £200 million of tax-payers\u2019 money is being spent on the break-up of our railways. And seventeen separate consultancy firms are being paid by the Department of Transport and by British Rail at a cost of £25 million to try to smooth out the problems which the sell-­off throws up every day.And what is all this designed to achieve? A system which will undoubtedly provide fewer services, which it is already clear will force substantial fare increases, and which sadly threatens the very existence of many rural lines.But still, undeterred by the massive unpopularity of his plans, the Prime Minister ploughs on with his crazy privatisation programme. In the latest so-called market testing exercise inside the. Civil Service, the Inland Revenue\u2019s tax records are to be privatised. I do not believe the British people want their personal tax affairs to be entrusted to some unknown private company, any more than they wanted the Government\u2019s skill centres to be given away and then shut down, any more than they want the prisons of our country to be handed over to private operators so that they can make a profit out of the perpetrators of crime, any more than they want the Royal Mail to be sold off or the rail network to be broken up and auctioned off to anyone except British Rail - the only people who know how to run it.Does John Major, with his barmy army of right-wing ideologues, not realise that there are some things that should never be put up for sale? Some responsibilities are the responsibilities of the nation and nobody else. You cannot privatise a national rail network and expect it to stay intact. You cannot privatise the responsibility to train our country\u2019s workforce. And you certainly cannot privatise, and you should not try to privatise, law and order.But this Government seem to think that the only thing that can possibly motivate people is greed, and if not greed, then fear. The concept of pride in public service for its own sake is utterly beyond the understanding of this Tory Government. But we know there is a different set of values. We know there are millions of people in this country who choose to work for the sake of the public good, because they want to deliver a service, because they want to help their community. We see these values at work every day, in schools, in hospitals, in community centres and in homes for the elderly: people who spend their lives helping others; fire-fighters who risk their lives saving others.Every person in this hall this afternoon knows somebody who does a job of work, not for greed, not purely for profit, but for the satisfaction of helping and caring for other people. And not a word of thanks do they get from this Government, not a word of praise, nor any recognition of the value of their effort. All they get is a constant barrage of attack. They see their work devalued, their jobs threatened by cuts, their status and their conditions undermined. And they see their wages frozen, cut in real terms by a Government that have no idea of how ordinary people live or how hard they work.This Tory Government are deluded by the bizarre notion that the free market is intrinsically good and the public sector is intrinsically bad. So they try to sell everything off to the private sector, and the things they cannot sell, they try to run according to free market rules. But schools are not businesses and neither are hospitals. Head teachers are not entrepreneurs and doctors are not accountants, nor should they be forced to act like them. They should all be allowed to get on with the job they are trained to do - to teach the children and to heal the sick.We in the Labour Party believe in the value of public service. We are a Party that believes in the public good. And to the nurses and the teachers and the midwives and the fire-­fighters, and to everyone who works so hard to deliver decent services to the people of this country we say that we are proud of what you do. We recognise your vital contribution to the life of our communities, and we abhor the disgraceful attempt by this Conservative Government to make you pay the price of their miserable failure.The Government would like us to forget the promises they made to the British people before the last election. Let me remind you of some of them: the promise not to raise taxes; the promise not to put up VAT; the promise not to put up National Insurance. We will never let the Tories forget these promises they made to win votes before the election promises they have now broken one by one, pledges they have betrayed one by one; and, in the process, they have brought hardship and suffering to millions of old and vulnerable people in, our country.A typical family will have to pay out an extra £1,000 in taxes over the next few years as a result of the last budget - a budget from a Party that won an election by frightening people with lies about Labour\u2019s tax plans.What is the nation to make of a Government that tells you after they have won the election that nothing they said during the campaign really counted at all? It was the new Chancellor, Mr Clarke, who said in the House of Commons that voters should not take too seriously what people said on some rainy night in an election campaign. But people do take it seriously, and I think they should take it seriously, and I can tell them that they take it very seriously when those promises are broken and these pledges are betrayed.And what is the nation to make of a Government prepared to send three businessmen to jail to protect itself from the scrutiny of the law? The full extent of the Government\u2019s deception in the Matrix-Churchill affair is slowly coming to light under the relentless and probing glare of the Scott inquiry. We see senior Cabinet ministers ducking and diving, twisting the truth and lying to Parliament, running for cover and allowing others to carry the guilt of their own shabby behaviour. What could be more revealing than the weasel words of Mr William Waldegrave to the Scott inquiry, dodging and weaving his way around the questions he could not answer - the same William Waldegrave who is now the minister in charge of open Government?And what is the nation to think when they see so many former Cabinet ministers popping up on the boards of companies they themselves helped to privatise? Ministers one after the other are taking that slippery sleazy slide from the Cabinet room to the boardroom; cashing in on their own privatisation plans.And what is the nation to make of a Government that has such contempt for democracy that it takes away the power of the people's representatives on local authorities and hands it over to Tory place-men on quangos and on boards; unelected Tory yes-men who are not accountable to the people for the decisions they take on their behalf?The Government has created a whole new unelected state which controls crucial aspects of community life - health, training, urban development, housing, roads. And the communities themselves have no say, no influence, no control, over these decisions. This is a Government that cares less about democracy than about power, that cares less about people than political dogma, that cares less about fairness and justice than about defending its own interests and the interests of its own rich benefactors.No wonder people feel disillusioned with politics. No wonder they feel dismayed and disappointed. And no wonder they feel disgusted with a Government that has proved itself time and time again unfit to run this country.And now there is much talk in the air of stalking horses. The Sun - usually the most loyal of Tory papers - ran a phone-in competition last week. Which stalking horse, they asked their readers, had the best chance of beating John Major for the Tory leadership? The Sun\u2019s own tip was not Mr Clarke or Mr Portillo or Mr Hunt. It was Red Rum. And Sun readers agreed. The horse romped home - the 9-1 favourite, running on a ticket of no VAT on hay.The prospect of a Tory horse race is really something to behold: Teresa Gorman riding Thatcher\u2019s Revenge; Messrs Lilley and Portillo galloping off to the right. And poor old John Major frantically clutching on to the mane of his grey mare as it falls at every single fence. And where is jockey Clarke? Lurking in the stables sawing away at his rivals\u2019 saddle-straps.Surely our country deserves much better than this: not the self-serving ambitions of Tory ministers, but a new politics of principle and a new agenda of democratic rights.Here in Brighton this week, our Party is offering the British people a new and exciting agenda of constitutional reform. We are proposing nothing less than a new constitution for a new century: a new and modern conception of citizenship, which recognises the importance of the community acting together to advance individual freedom; a revitalised democracy which protects the fundamental rights of each and every citizen, regardless of race, colour, gender or creed; a system of government that is open, accountable and close to the people it is elected to serve.That is why the next Labour Government must enact. a Bill of Rights, legislate for freedom of information, modernise our parliamentary system, restore the powers of local Government, and devolve power to the regions of England and the nations of Scotland and Wales. Constitutional reform is far too important today to be regarded as the exclusive preserve of the so-called chattering classes. It goes right to the heart of what is wrong with the Government of Britain today - a Government that is arrogant, centralised, and unresponsive to people.Our choice \u2013 Labour\u2019s choice - is to build a democracy founded on pluralism, participation, and justice: a politics that springs from the roots of democratic socialism and from the writings of Tom Paine, the struggle for votes for women, and trade union campaigns for the rights of people at work. And we in the Labour Party - unlike any other Party - see the vital link between rights in the workplace and rights at the ballot box. For surely we need both, if we are to create a society of free and self-confident citizens.I want to lead a Labour Government that will introduce the most radical package of constitutional reform ever proposed by any major political party. This, I believe, will be a key battleground of the 1990s, as we seek to define the new politics of a new century. And if we are to win that battle - as we must then I believe we must have the courage and the confidence to reform our own constitution as well. So let there be no doubt about the nature of the choices before our nation: the stark choices that confront our people.Today I have set out a tale of two Britains: the Tory Britain we live in, and the new Britain that Labour wants to build. In the Tory Britain, an angry and disillusioned people are in danger of losing faith in our future. They have too often seen their jobs destroyed, people made homeless, youngsters denied opportunity. They worry - and no wonder they worry - that our society is coming apart, that our very sense of community is being undermined. And they worry that the crime on our streets and in our homes is spiralling out of control. In this Tory Britain, people see their income squeezed and their prospects reduced by recession after recession. In Tory Britain, people have stopped believing things will get better - they just hope they will not get any worse.But we believe there is a different kind of fixture on offer to our people. Labour\u2019s Britain will be a confident society that opens doors wide to new opportunities: a society that looks to the future and trains people to meet that future; a society that encourages new ideas, and rewards hard work and ambition, and a society also that looks after its poor, its sick and its old people.In Labour\u2019s Britain, we will stop the rot and start once again to build a country where strong communities help each one of us to live a fulfilling life, in which racism has no place and no quarter. This is the choice we set out before the British people - the Tory Britain of today, or Labour\u2019s Britain of tomorrow? And where the Tories have clearly failed, Labour must succeed.More than anyone else, I am deeply conscious of the huge challenges we face, of the vital choices we will have to make, for we will inherit an enfeebled economy and a demoralised society. But we will face these challenges. We will make these choices, with confidence in our ideals and pride in our values. So we must be bold in our ambitions: bold in our determination to get our country back to work; bold in our unyielding commitment to social justice; bold in our vision of a truly free and democratic society.For I tell you this: there is no other force, no other power, no other party, that can turn this country round. It is up to us, all of us, together. This is our time of opportunity: the time to summon up all our commitment; the time to gather round us all our strength. And, united in our common purpose, it is the time to lead our country forward to the great tasks that lie ahead.

aVDavid, Conference, friends, today I set out my vision for our party and our country: what we are, where we stand and how we will govern. We meet in a spirit of hope, hope that change can come, hope that we can rid our country of this Tory government, their broken promises, their failed policies, their discredited philosophy, and elect in their place a Labour government for Britain. (Applause)We all remember where we were and what we were doing when we heard that John Smith had died. Together, one nation, all parties, united in mourning and in celebration of his integrity, his honesty and his decency. We were proud to know him and proud to be led by him. We will honour his memory best by ensuring that the party he loved becomes once again the government of the country he loved. And we have begun our task. The people have already elected us to control 175 councils. In May we won over 2,500 new seats. We have won four by-elections this year, and three of our new MPs are women. In the European elections too we gained record numbers of seats. My friends, these were not opinion polls. They were elections, and we are winning them.We are proud too that one of our MEPs, Pauline Green, is the first woman leader of the Socialist Group in Strasbourg. (Applause) And, if you will forgive me, there is one other representative in Europe to whom we pay tribute: Commissioner Kinnock, a credit to our party here, as he will be to our country in Brussels. (Applause)We had our own election too. One million people took part in a leadership contest that was a tribute to our democracy and from which we emerged with our unity and strength enhanced. I would like to thank John Prescott for his magnificent contribution to our party and, on behalf of us all, to pay tribute to Margaret Beckett for the credit she brought to our party in picking up the reins of leadership and leading us with such dignity. (Applause)We celebrate too the record growth in our membership - 14,000 new members in August alone. I can announce today that by the end of this month we will have passed the 300,000 mark. I am glad too that we have again an active Young Labour section, three times as many members as the Young Tories. I think I can safely say I am the first leader in a generation who can say with confidence to our youth section, \u2018I want to see an increase in your influence.\u2019Friends, one other debt of gratitude. Larry Whitty is to leave the post of General Secretary of the party and take up a new and important job co-ordinating the party\u2019s links with Europe. Larry is one of the best, most genuine and least self-serving people I know, and we thank him for all the loyalty and dedication he has shown us. (Applause)We are a party proud of our international solidarity, and I am delighted to welcome representatives here today from the government of the new Republic of South Africa. (Applause) I was 10 years old when Nelson Mandela was imprisoned on Robben Island. Since then, the words \u2018Nelson Mandela\u2019 have been an inspiration. But are not the words \u2018President Mandela\u2019 even more inspiring?We welcome too representatives of the Israeli government. We applaud Yitzhak Rabin\u2019s Labour government and Yasser Arafat\u2019s PLO for breaking new ground to help the Palestinian people towards self-government. We congratulate our sister parties in Sweden, Australia, Denmark and Holland on their recent election successes; and we wish success to socialist and social democratic parties in Austria and Germany in their forthcoming elections.Colleagues, 50 years ago the British Labour government helped to form the United Nations. We will continue to work for it to be stronger, more cohesive, more capable of bringing new order to a world no longer dominated by the cold war. In particular, in Bosnia we urge acceptance of the peace plan now on the table to avoid further brutality and bloodshed.We live in a world where a quarter of its population lack drinking water and a fifth starve; where civil war, in Rwanda and elsewhere, is rife. We should not forget those people. I can tell you that overseas aid and development will always be a central part of the Labour Party that I lead. (Applause)We should show courage too over a quite different sphere of international relations -Europe. Britain\u2019s interests demand that this country be at the forefront of the development of the new Europe. Of course Europe should change; of course we should stand up for British interests, as others stand up for theirs. Indeed we should be taking on the common agricultural policy, which costs the average British family £20 a week and about which the Tories do nothing. But the Tories are playing politics with Europe and the future of this country. Let them. Under my leadership, I will never allow this country to be isolated, cut off or left behind in Europe (Applause)The tide of ideas in British politics is also at last on the turn. For the first time in a generation it is the right-wing that appears lost and disillusioned. No longer believing in their own language, they turn to ours. You will hear Ministers trying out \u2018community,\u2019 \u2018partnership,\u2019 even the odd one talking of \u2018fairness.\u2019 Indeed some are now talking of \u2018civic conservatism,\u2019 a contradiction in terms. Most absurd, \u2018full employment\u2019 was tried out by Mr David Hunt at the TUC. His reward was the most humiliating demotion imaginable: one day counting the unemployed; the next he is counting traffic cones.Today politics is moving to our ground. Across the nation, across class, across political boundaries, the Labour Party is once again able to represent all the British people. We are the mainstream voice in politics today, back on the side of the vast majority, to speak out for them and against the entrenched interests that hold them back.To parents wanting their children to be taught in classrooms that are not crumbling, to students with qualifications but no university place, we say the Tories have failed you, but we are on your side: your ambitions are our ambitions. To men and women who get up in the morning and find the kitchen door smashed in, again the video gone, again, to the pensioners who fear to go out of their own homes, we say the Tories have abused your trust, but we are on your side: your concerns are our concerns. To the banks, employers burdened by government failure, to employees living in fear of the P45 and, above all, to those men shamefully laid off at Swan Hunter and the thousands of others insecure in their jobs in every part of this county, we say the Tories may have forgotten you, but the Labour Party never will: your anxieties are our anxieties. (Applause) And to middle and lower income Britain suffering the biggest tax rises in peacetime history, we say the Tories have betrayed you, but Labour is on your side: your aspirations are our aspirations.We are back as the party of the majority in British politics, back to speak up for Britain, back as the people\u2019s party.Just look at Britain 15 years after Mrs Thatcher stood on the steps of Downing Street. Do you remember that? Where there was discord, is there harmony? Where there was error, is there truth? (Delegates: \u2018No.\u2019) Where there was doubt, is there faith? (Delegates: \u2018No.\u2019) Where there was despair, is there hope? (Delegates: \u2018No.\u2019) Harmony? When crime has more than doubled. Truth? When they won an election on lies about us and lies about what they would do. (Applause) Faith? When politics is debased by their betrayal. Hope? When three million people are jobless, nearly six million on income support and one in three children grow up in poverty.They have brought us injustice and division but these have not been the price of economic efficiency, because tax is also up - £800 a year extra for the average family. Spending is up and growth over the last 15 years is down. And look at what they wasted on the way: billions of pounds gifted by nature, the God-given blessing of North Sea oil, billions we could have invested in our future, squandered - £118 billion, £5,000 for every family in this country, gone, wasted, vanished. And to hide the truth of the nation\u2019s problems they have sold our nation\u2019s capital assets, built up over many years, and used the proceeds not to invest but to cover current spending - £70 billion gone for ever.I say it is time to take these Tories apart for what they have done to our country not because they lack compassion - of course they do, they are Tories - but because they are the most feckless, irresponsible group of incompetents ever to be let loose in government on Britain.  Their time is up.  Their philosophy is done. Their experiment is over. Their failure is clear. It is time for them to go. And why are they incompetent? It is not just because of the individuals, incompetent though they are. It is not this or that Minister that is to blame. It is an entire set of political values that is wrong. They fail because they failed to understand that a nation, like a community, must work together in order for the individuals within it to succeed. It is such a simple failing and yet it is so fundamental.Go and look at a company that is succeeding. It will not treat its workforce as servants but as partners. They will be motivated and trained and given a common purpose. Of course sweatshop conditions in the short term can make do, but in the end they fail. The quality, the commitment is not there, and it is the same with a country. It can be run on privilege and greed for a time, but in the end it fails. And this is not theory. We have living proof of it here in Britain today. At the end of 15 years we are taxing and spending not to invest in future success but to pay for past failure. I do not mind paying taxes for education and health and the police. What I mind is paying them for unemployment and crime and social squalor, and that is what the British people are being taxed for today. (Applause)Is it not extraordinary that after 15 years we spend more of our national income on unemployment and poverty and less on education? If the share of national wealth invested in housing was the same as in 1979, we would spend £11 billion more, but next year we will spend £11 billion on housing benefit; and now they want to cut the benefit. Instead of cutting the benefit, why not cut the homeless queue, cut unemployment and build houses for people to live in? And if it needs an initial capital investment, release the money tied up in local authority bank accounts, put it to work to start the house building programme.Tory economics is based on a view of the market that is crude, out of date and inefficient, and their view of society is one of indifference, to shrug their shoulders and walk away. They think we choose between self-interest and the interests of society or the country as a whole. But in reality self-interest demands that we work together to achieve what we cannot do on our own.More and more I believe that, though of course ability plays a great part in life, what most distinguishes those at the top from those at the bottom is their life-chances.  So much talent is wasted, so much potential under-developed, and I do not just mean the unemployed: I mean those who just have jobs, when what they should have is careers with prospects and a hope of advancement. We can learn these lessons from the family.The Tories have posed as the party of the family for too long. They are no more the party of the family than they are the party of law and order in Britain today. They have done more to undermine stable family life in this country than any other government in living memory. (Applause) The Tory view of the family is the same as its view of the individual: you are on your own. But the essence of family life is that you are not on your own, you are in it together, and families work best when the members of it help and sustain each other; and the same is true of communities and nations.  Community is not some piece of nostalgia. It means what we share. It means working together. It is about how we treat each other. So we teach our children to take pride in their school, their town, their country. We teach them self-respect, but we teach them respect for others too. We teach them self-support and self-improvement; and we teach them mutual support and mutual improvement too.The Tories despise such principles. Their view is simple. They believe in a world where they just have to watch as the hospitals spring up, as the schools rise in green and pleasant playing fields: let\u2019s just sit tight on this planet of miracles, where the free market builds business, trains employees, controls inflation, preserves demand, ensures everlasting growth. Let\u2019s congratulate ourselves, they say, that, thanks to our inspiring inaction, the elderly live in comfort and the young play in safety. And all around, people on this planet sing hymns of gratitude to the invisible hand of the market, as it brings equality and prosperity to all, cascading down from generation to generation. Welcome to Planet Portillo. (Applause) It is the theatre of the politically absurd.Market forces cannot educate us or equip us for this world of rapid technological and economic change. We must do it together.  We cannot buy your way to a safe society. We must work for it together. And we cannot purchase an option on whether we grow old. We must plan for it together. We cannot protect the ordinary against the abuse of power by leaving them to it; we must protect each other. That is our insight, a belief in society, working together, solidarity, cooperation, partnership. These are our words. This is my socialism, and we should stop apologising for using the word. (Applause) It is not the socialism of Marx or state control. It is rooted in a straightforward view of society, in the understanding that the individual does best in a strong and decent community of people with principles and standards and common aims and values. We are the party of the individual because we are the party of community. It is social-ism, and our task is to apply those values to the modern world.Of course it means changes. It will change traditional dividing lines between right and left, and it calls for a new politics - without dogma and without swapping our prejudices for theirs. It is time to break out of the past and break through with a clear, radical and modern vision for Britain.Today\u2019s politics is about the search for security in a changing world, and we must build the strong and active society that can provide it. That is our project for Britain. It will be founded on these four pillars: opportunity, responsibility, justice and trust.A society of opportunity must be built around a strong and stable economy in which all of us have a stake.Mass unemployment is inconsistent with a civilised society. It is time to state clearly in the words of the pioneering White Paper of 1944 that it is the duty of government to maintain a high and stable level of employment. It is a responsibility we share as a society, and that commitment - the goal of full employment - I reaffirm for the Labour Party today. (Applause) It will take time. The means of doing it will change. But it must be done if this is to become a society of which everyone feels a part.But above all we must conquer the weaknesses of our economy that hold our country back. It will not be done by state control, but it will not be done either by market dogma. It can only be done by a dynamic market economy based on partnership between government and industry, between employer and employee, and between public and private sector.Take investment in infrastructure. Only in Tory Britain could the government have tried to build the Channel tunnel without public investment. They even passed a law against it, and then in desperation they had to ask the taxpayer to fork out more than half the cost. Now it is up and running. Trains speed through France at 185 miles per hour, through the tunnel at 85 miles per hour and then go through Kent - at 47 miles per hour. The French got the high-speed link. We got the slow coach link. But then we\u2019ve got the Tories. (Applause)Government must take the lead, and a Labour government would do that. We would get public and private finance working together in transport, in housing, in capital projects, in health and education; and if there are Treasury rules or antiquated concepts of public borrowing that hold us back, change them. That is what intelligent government is for.Take technology: there is an information revolution under way. Fifty per cent of employees in Britain now work in information-related industries. In the next century, 70 per cent of the wealth will be created in those industries and 80 per cent of all the information stored anywhere in the world is in English - massive markets, massive competitive advantage, massive Tory failure. We should be investing in the new electronic highways, satellite and telecommunications technology that will be the nerve centre of a new information economy, doing for the next century what roads and railways have done for this one.The government, as ever, failed to see this revolution coming and, because of that, a new market is operating under old rules which work against our companies, large and small. We will act. We will set the framework which encourages the new investment, so that we can co-ordinate a new national effort to ensure that British companies are at the head of the competition, not falling behind. And we have to invest for the long term. In the Tory years dividends have risen by 12 per cent per year in manufacturing alone, profits by 6 per cent and investment by only 2 per cent. We have to change that.We have to ensure that those long-term finance agreements between finance and industry are available and we have to invest in economic regeneration. There are areas of the country which are laid waste by the shedding of old industry. The market will not rebuild them on its own. A partnership economy will, and where imaginative Labour local authorities have worked with business it is happening. But we want more of it. That is why we have proposed one-stop shop development agencies for our regions to help create the wealth they need. Small and medium-sized businesses will be the driving force of that new economy. The Tories have done nothing for them. Two weeks ago Labour put forward the most comprehensive programme for small business development seen in this country, welcomed by small business - active government working in partnership.I see people, some of them occasionally in our own party, falling for the Tory attack that we have no policies. What nonsense! We have a huge body of policy, which we are now developing. The difference is that we now have policies that win us votes at a general election. (Applause)Above all in this partnership economy we need to train and educate our people. Education will be the passion of my government. I know how important the education of my children is to me and I will not tolerate our children going to run-down schools with bad discipline, low standards, mediocre expectations or poor teachers, and nor should anyone else. If schools are bad, they should be made to be good; if teachers cannot teach properly, they should not be teaching; and if the government cannot see why education matters, then sack the government and get one that does. (Applause)But education is now throughout life.  If you want to earn, you have to learn. The University for Industry, the 1990s equivalent of the Open University, will use satellite, cable and the new information highways to give every home and workplace access to information, skills and teaching to achieve the objective of permanent education and opportunity for all. Switching on your computer to link up with work and education opportunities will one day be as natural as switching on your TV to watch a football match.Education is just one of the public services we provide together to improve the quality of opportunity for each of us. It cannot be left to the market, nor can our health service, our armed forces or our police; and nor should the railways or the Post Office. These are public services. They should be run for the public and they should stay in public ownership for the people of this country. (Applause)When these Tories tell us there is no money to fund better public services, let us suggest some cuts they could make. They could save £700 million on the costs and fees and city charges of railway privatisation, £700 million that could have been used to build a high-speed link from London to Manchester and Liverpool, upgrade lines between Hull and Middlesbrough, and still have enough left over to improve commuter services on Network South East.While waiting lists in our hospitals are past one million, when patients are lying unattended on hospital trolleys, when dentistry has virtually gone out of the NHS, they could save £1.6 billion if they started to spend it on patient care and not on bureaucrats within the national health service. (Applause) Or let the £30 million spent on turning police authorities into quangos go on putting police on the beat, where the public actually want to see them.While students scrimp to get through college, a university vice-chancellor gets a huge vote of no confidence and is rewarded with a £500,000 pay-off. We could have bought half a million exercise books with that. It is their system, their dogma, their shambles, but our children who always suffer as a result.We should start a new campaign with our public services; get the money to the front line on public services. It is time to change. I want hospital resources released from the administrative chaos of opting out, so that nurses can actually nurse again, which is what the public want to see them do. I want schools released from form-filling and red tape, so that teachers can teach again. And I want our uniformed services freed from paper pushing, so that they can go and catch the criminals terrorising our society. That is what we should be providing - a society of opportunity for all, guaranteed through a strong economy and strong public services.But with opportunity must come responsibility. For the Tories, the language of responsibility is what those at the top preach to the rest, while neglecting it themselves. But the left have undervalued the notion of responsibility and duty too, and it is time we understood how central it is to ourselves. Parents should have responsibility for their children, and that means fathers too. Companies should have responsibility to their employees and their community.  Ministers should have responsibility to the truth, and citizens to each other. It is at the heart of our message about crime.The Labour Party is now the party of law and order in Britain today, and quite right too. Only one in 50 crimes ever goes punished; sentencing is haphazard; victims are given short shrift. Meanwhile, that Home Secretary, Michael Howard, protests that he has been attacked week after week for being too tough. He is dreaming. He would love to be attacked for being too tough. He is attacked because he is long on rhetoric and short on policies that work. Michael Howard, the man in charge of prison catering, last year told the Tory Party Conference that he was building six tough new prisons. Butlins would not win the contract, he said. He was right. The Savoy got it. (Applause)We can all get angry because crime hurts, and it hurts most the people who are least able to fight back. But it is not enough to get angry, to stamp your feet and shout from the Tory Conference platform.  That is the soft option. We need a new approach, one that is tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime.  Over the past year we have put forward a range of detailed policies to fight crime, policies that are tough on crime, measures to tackle juvenile offending, to crack down on illegal firearms, to punish properly crimes of violence, including racial violence, to give victims the right to be consulted before charges are dropped or changed; and policies that are tough on the causes of crime - a comprehensive crime prevention programme, an anti-drugs initiative, long-term measures to break the culture of drugs, family instability, high unemployment and urban squalor in which some of the worst criminals are brought up.Responsibility means a recognition that there is no divorce from the outside world - social responsibility for all. The unemployed youngster has no right to steal your radio, but let us be just as serious about catching the people in the City with an eye on your pension. (Applause) This is where the Tories fail.Responsibility is a value shared.  If it does not apply to everyone, it ends up applying to no one.  It applies to those who defraud the state of benefits; it applies to those who evade their taxes; and it also applies to those water, gas and electricity company bosses running monopoly services at our expense and awarding themselves massive salaries, share options, perks and pay-offs. They have a responsibility as well, which they are not achieving. (Applause) And it applies in the health service. Do you remember how those reforms were sold in the name of better and quicker patient care? We would all be able to get the doctor I want at the time I want in the hospital I want. Who have those reforms benefited? Not the patient, but the pen-pusher, getting the carpet I want and the wallpaper I want and the nice big company car I want - and can we get the wife on the board too?Responsibility applies in the financial services. The big bang is now exploding in the faces of pensioners who were cheated of their pensions, crime victims who cannot get a pay-out from their insurance claim, home-buyers ripped off by estate agents, and small businessmen pushed to the wall by banks who have lost all sense of their role and responsibility to the nation. A society without responsibility is the enemy of the society built on merit and hard work. It creates an economy in which enterprise is just another word for the quick buck.The Thatcherites used to boast that they were anti-establishment, but the trouble with them is that they never wanted to bust the establishment, just buy their way into it. And the new establishment is not a meritocracy; it is a power elite of money-shifters, middle-men, speculators, people whose self-interest will always come before the national or the public interest. If they are allowed to go on running the country in their interests, is it any wonder that it is not run in ours? So it is hardly surprising if, after 15 years, sleaze in high places has given birth to the yob culture. Tory philosophy is the most effective yob creation scheme ever devised. (Applause)Colleagues, we have one further proposal to make here. There are nearly one million young people in this country who have no work or training or education. This is not just a waste of talent but the breeding ground for resentment, crime and drugs. The Social Justice Commission has called for a new civilian service, a voluntary national task force of young people allowed to do constructive tasks - I support that; I think they do as well - working for the community on environmental projects or caring for the elderly, something useful to the community and personally fulfilling, to instil that sense of responsibility, self-discipline, self-respect and a sense of achievement.Responsibility and opportunity both require fairness and justice, the right to be treated equally as a citizen. That means we take a strong stand against discrimination on grounds of race, sex, creed or sexuality. But justice is about much more than fighting discrimination. It is about our lives at work, the laws we live under and the tax we pay.If you ever want to know whose side the Tories are on, look at the tax system. Millionaires with the right accountant pay nothing, whilst pensioners pay VAT on fuel. Offshore trusts get tax relief, while homeowners pay VAT on insurance premiums. Middle-income taxpayers get stung, whilst perks and privileges at the top roll on unstopped. And because the government changed the rules, two million more people now pay the top rate of tax.We will create a tax system that is fair, which is related to ability to pay, where the abuses end, the perks stop and where ordinary families are not squeezed to pay for the privileged. Colleagues, it sticks in my gullet when I hear Tory MPs, some of whom earn more for a half-day\u2019s consultancy work than some of my constituents earn in a month, denouncing our plans for a minimum wage. Is it not wrong that the taxpayer ends up paying more than a billion pounds on benefits to subsidise poverty pay? A minimum wage exists in every European country, in America too, for the simple reason that it makes social and economic sense.  Of course the minimum wage should be set and implemented sensibly, and it will be, but there will be no retreat from its basic principle, because it is right and a Labour government will introduce it. (Applause) And we will sign the Social Chapter because it is right for our country and gives people fairness as well. And we will give the right to people at work to join a trade union and, where they want it, to have that union recognised. (Applause) And let one small but significant act be a signal of our commitment to fairness at work: that is the restoration of their trade union rights to the workers of Cheltenham GCHQ. (Applause)Colleagues, as part of justice we will make work pay. John Smith put it very simply when he set up the Commission on Social Justice: \u2018People don't want hand-outs; they want a chance to achieve.\u2019 The Tories always complain that the welfare state costs too much. The answer is not just increasing benefits, adequate though those benefits should be. But the people on benefits need and deserve better - not more benefits, but help in getting off benefits, because welfare should be about opportunity and security in a changing world. It is about helping people to move on and move up. Because the world has changed, the welfare state has had to change with it, and we are the only people who can be trusted to change, reform and modernise the welfare state, because we are the people who believe in it. (Applause) The Tories will cut benefits and make poverty worse. We will put welfare to work - a nation at work not on benefit. That is our pledge.But, my friends, there is one big obstacle in the way of all our plans for change. It is the legacy of the Tory years - disillusion with politics itself. If we want to remove it, we must show that our politics is not theirs, not just that our vision for Britain is different, but also that our means of achieving it is different. A new politics, a politics of courage, honesty and trust. It means telling it as it is, not opposing everything every other party does for the sake of it. If the government are getting it right, as over Northern Ireland, we give credit. We welcome without reservation new hope beginning there. We pay tribute to our own government, the Irish government, and Unionist and Nationalist opinion in the north for their efforts in the peace process. And we pay a special word of tribute to John Hume, leader of our sister party - (Applause) - who is coming to address us tomorrow, for his unceasing commitment to that cause. It means speaking the same language to each other as we know we need to speak to the country.Politicians are looked to by the people for leadership, and leadership is about having the courage to say no as well as yes. Even this week I have heard people say that a Labour government must repeal all the Tory trade union laws. There is not a single person in this country who believes that we shall actually do it. No one believes that strike ballots should be abandoned, so why do we say it? We should not, and I will not. Let us just tell it as it is. (Applause)I have said, and I mean, that I am committed to the goal of full employment. We will develop the plans to achieve it. But I will never pretend that I can deliver it overnight. I shall not seek to fool the unemployed into thinking that we will walk into power on Thursday and they will walk into a job on Friday. Let us be honest and straight and realistic, because those most in need of hope deserve the truth. (Applause) Hope is not born of false promises; disillusion is. The British people are tired of dogma. They are tired of politicians pretending to have a monopoly on all the answers. They are tired of glib promises broken as readily in office as they were made on the soap box. When we make a promise, we must be sure we can keep it. That is page 1, line 1 of a new contract between a Labour government and the citizens of Britain. (Applause)But we should do more. We have to change the rules of government and we will. We are putting forward the biggest programme of change to democracy ever proposed by a political party: every citizen to be protected by fundamental rights that cannot be taken away by the state or even by their fellow citizens, enshrined in a Bill of Rights. (Applause) Government will be brought closer to the people. We will legislate for a Scottish Parliament, an assembly for Wales, in the first year of a Labour government. (Applause) And the Tory quangos will be brought back under proper democratic control. (Applause)We will enact a Freedom of Information Act to attack secrecy wherever it exists, in the public or private sector. We will reform the House of Commons to make its working practices and its powers to investigate more effective, and to achieve through our party the increase in the number of women MPs that we have talked about for so long. (Applause) And we will make history by ending the ancient and indefensible privilege of hereditary peers voting on the laws of this land. (Applause) We will tighten the rules of financing political parties; and since trade unions are balloted on their political contribution, it is surely only fair that in this free country shareholders are balloted on theirs. (Applause)Colleagues, the people of this country are not looking to us for a revolution. They just want us to make a start, and I want you with me in that task. I want you with me head and heart, because this can only be done together. Leaders lead, but in the end the people govern.Some of you will think we are too modest in our aims, too cautious. Some of you, I hear, support me simply because you think I can win. (Laughter) Actually, that is not a bad reason for supporting me, but it is not enough. I want more. We are not going to win despite our beliefs. We will only win because of our beliefs. (Applause) I want to win not because the Tories are despised, but because we are understood, supported, trusted. And there is no choice between being principled and unelectable and electable and unprincipled. We have tortured ourselves with this foolishness for too long. We should win because of what we believe. That task of renewing our nation is not one for the faint-hearted, the world weary or the cynical. It is not a task for those afraid of hard choices, for those with complacent views or those seeking a comfortable life.I want to tell you something. At the next election the voters will have had this Tory government for 17 or 18 years. They may hate them, but they know them. I want them now to know us, our identity, our character as a party, and change is an important part of that. We have changed. We were right to change. Parties that do not change die, and this party is a living movement not an historical monument. (Applause) If the world changes and we do not, we become of no use to the world. Our principles cease being principles and just ossify. We have not changed to forget our principles, but to fulfil them, not to lose our identity but to keep our relevance. Change is an important part of gaining the nation\u2019s trust.We were right to introduce one member one vote last year, and that change is now done. But look at how the regeneration project being run from party headquarters has begun the task of building our membership and taking the party closer to those communities. Are we not right to reach out to those people in this way, to show them that politics is not some Byzantine game played out over screeds of paper in wintry meeting-rooms but a real and meaningful part of their lives? On Friday we will reach out further. John Prescott will announce the biggest programme of political education undertaken by any party in Britain for a generation, and those efforts will be central not just to building our membership but to engaging those members, new and old, to help shape this party\u2019s future.Let us have the confidence that once again we can debate new ideas, new thinking, without for ever fearing the taunt of betrayal. Let us say what we mean and mean what we say, not just what we are against, but what we are for. No more dumping, no more ditching. Stop saying what we do not mean and start saying what we do mean, what we stand by, what we stand for. (Applause) Caution will not win us the next election, but courage will.I believe it is time that we had an up-to-date statement of the objects and objectives of our party. John Prescott and I, as Leader and Deputy Leader of our party, will propose such a statement to the NEC. Let it then be open to debate in the coming months. I want the whole party involved and I know this party will welcome this debate. If that statement is accepted, then let it become the objects of our party for the next election and let it take its place in our constitution for the next century.This is a modern party living in an age of change. It requires a modern constitution that says what we are in terms the public cannot misunderstand and the Tories cannot misrepresent. (Applause) We are proud of our beliefs. Let us state them, and in terms that people will identify with, in every workplace, every home, every family, every community in our country. And let this party\u2019s determination to change be the symbol of the trust that they can place in us to change the country.The British people are a great people. We have proud, democratic traditions. We are a nation of tolerance, innovation and creativity. We have an innate sense of fair play. We have a great history and culture. And when great challenges face us, as they have twice this century, we rise to them. But if we have a fault as a people it is that, unless roused, we tend to let things be. We say \u2018Things could be worse\u2019 rather then \u2018Things should be better,\u2019 and the Tories encourage this fault. They thrive on complacency. I say it is time we were roused as a nation.Let us be blunt. Our system of government has become out-dated, our economy has been weakened, our people have been under-educated, our welfare state and public services have been run down and our society is more divided than at any time for 100 years.  Our politics need not be like this. Our country need not be like this.Ours is a project of national renewal, renewing our commitment as a nation, as a community of people in order to prepare and provide for ourselves in the new world we face. We must build a nation with pride in itself, a thriving community, rich in economic prosperity, secure in social justice, confident in political change, a land in which our children can bring up their children with a future to look forward to. (Applause)The next election will be our chance to do that, colleagues. The next election will offer us the chance to change our country, not just to promise change, but to achieve it - the historic goal of another Labour government. Our party - new Labour; our mission - new Britain. New Labour, new Britain. (Standing ovation)

aVGordon, Conference, before I begin my speech I would just like to introduce you to someone sitting on the platform - it is Mary Wilson, the widow of Harold Wilson. (Applause) Mary, we thank you and we thank Harold for all the work and dedication for our party and for our country.Can I welcome too today the many ambassadors from all round the world and, in particular, if I may, the ambassador from Israel and from those of the Arab countries involved in the peace process. We wish you well. We hope that your process succeeds. The whole courage and eyes of the world are behind you.Today I place before you my vision of a new Britain - a nation reborn, prosperous, secure, united - one Britain. I say how this vision is to be achieved: by a new, confident Labour Party that, with the support of the British people, will sweep away forever the most discredited, dishonourable government in living memory.New Labour, new Britain. I know that for some of you, new Labour has been painful and there is no greater pain to be endured in politics than the birth of a new idea, but I believe in it and I want to tell you why. Socialism for me was never about nationalisation or the power of the state, not just about economics or even politics. It is a moral purpose to life, a set of values, a belief in society, in co-operation, in achieving together what we cannot achieve alone. It is how I try to live my life, how you try to live yours - the simple truths - I am worth no more than anyone else, I am my brother\u2019s keeper, I will not walk by on the other side. We are not simply people set in isolation from one another, face to face with eternity, but members of the same family, same community, same human race. This is my socialism and the irony of all our long years in opposition is that those values are shared by the vast majority of the British people.I joined this party because it represented those values, but I felt something else and I think in your heart of hearts you felt it too: that however great and timeless our values, at that time our party\u2019s politics, structure and even its ideology no longer reflected those values in a way that brought them alive for the British people. We had become separated from the very people we said we represented. We called them \u2018our people,\u2019 while forgetting who they were.1983 for me was a watershed. New Labour was born then of the courage of one man. We would not be here, proud and confident today, but for that man - Neil Kinnock. (Applause) And then it grew under the wisdom of John Smith, who guided us through the revolution in our party democracy and whose memory we honour, and in this last year we have transformed our party - our constitution rewritten, our relations with the trade unions changed and better defined for today's world, our party organisation improved, political education on an unprecedented scale, new policy breaking new ground.I did not come into politics to change the Labour Party. I came into politics to change my country and I honestly believe that if we had not changed, if we had not returned our party to its essential values, free from the weight of outdated ideology, we could not change the country. We could not win and even if we did, we would not have governed in the way Britain needs. For I do not want a one term Labour government that dazzles for a moment, then ends in disillusion. I want a Labour government that governs for a generation and changes Britain for good.It has been hard, I know - hard for me sometimes. Last year, I was Bambi. This year, I'm Stalin! From Disneyland to dictatorship in 12 short months. I\u2019m not sure which one I prefer. OK - I prefer Bambi, honestly.There have been good moments, however, like yesterday when for the first time since I became Leader, my children were impressed by something I did. \u2018Did you really meet Kevin Keegan, Dad?\u2019 \u2018Did you really do 27 consecutive headers?\u2019 And wasn\u2019t it good to see Eric Cantona back in action? Let us hope this time he remembers that kicking people in the teeth is the job of the Tory government.So, it has been tough. No one ever thought it would be done, and it has been, but what I want to say to you is this: I did not do it alone. We did it together. Thank you. Our success is record by-election results, record local election results and - I am as proud of this as anything - the new Labour women candidates we have chosen. There has been some pain there too, yes, but look at the results. We could have 80 or 90 Labour women MPs after the next election and that would transform politics in this country.I read the other day that not one winnable Tory seat has picked a woman candidate. What a disgrace. But, then again, what is a winnable Tory seat? Peter Lilley, MP for St Albans - majority 16,000 - unsafe; Lilley on the chicken run to Hitchen and Harpenden. Tory Chairman, Brian Mawhinney, a man whose job it is to say that the Tories will sweep the country once more - majority 5,000 - unsafe; on the chicken run from Peterborough to Cambridgeshire. And what about Basildon man himself? Terrified of the nation watching on election night as that smug grin is finally removed. Why did the chicken cross the road? To get to a safer seat, but never have so many chickens died in vain. Ask the man who said: \u2018They can run, but they can\u2019t hide.\u2019There is great success to celebrate and much of the work in gearing up our party has been done by the Deputy Leader, John Prescott, and I pay tribute to him. He is a good friend and a great support; blunt, honest, outspoken - and that's just with me.I see, incidentally, that Mr Major is now planning to challenge me to a TV debate during the general election. Fine. His record against our policies, any place, any time, but I have a better idea. Instead of just challenging us to a television debate, challenge us to a general election and do it now. (Applause)We now have 100,000 new members. Next year for the first time we will have more members than the Conservative Party, and a huge increase in Young Labour - five times as many in Young Labour as in the Young Conservatives. We value our members, new and old, and let us never fall for this nonsense, that by seeking new support, we turn our back on the poor, the homeless and unemployed.I have spent 16 years being angry, passionate and indignant about young people huddled in doorways, families made wretched by unemployment, the poor unable to make ends meet. I am fed up with anger. They do not need our anger, they need action and they will not get it from the rage of opposition, but through a Labour Party that has had the courage to take hard choices, get into government and do something for them.We know that the hard choices get harder in government: when we refuse to take risks with inflation because this country cannot be rebuilt on boom and bust, even to boost short-term employment; when we want more children at university and do not want the government student loan scheme and face choices about how it will be replaced; on public sector pay when, let us be honest, a Labour government, like any other, will have to say \u2018no\u2019 as well as \u2018yes,\u2019 even to people in this hall. Hard choices are what good government is about, but remember this, I love my party, I just hate it being in opposition and I love my country and hate what the Tories have done to it. Every promise ever made has been broken - taxes, unemployment, crime, the health service, education. It is a record of incompetence and dishonesty on an epic scale. Now they plead with the British people, \u2018Trust us this one more time.\u2019 I say to the British people, there are two sides to a deal. They gave their word, you gave your vote. They broke their word, do not ever give them your vote again.I will tell you about the Tories and tax. They cut your taxes before the election and they raise them afterwards and only ever give one side of the equation. They will cut your income tax, but raise your VAT. They make you pay charges, such as in the NHS, extra costs like taxes on insuring your home. It is all a con. We all want ordinary, hard working families to pay less tax, but the way to cut tax and make it last is to cut unemployment, crime, welfare spending - all the reasons why taxes have gone up.Imagine for one moment a Tory fifth term Britain. Would there be a National Health Service? (\u2018No!\u2019) Would there be a free state education system for all? (\u2018No!\u2019) Would there be a welfare state? (\u2018No!\u2019) Would Mr Redwood be in charge of deciding which single parents get to keep their children? (\u2018No!\u2019) Well, let\u2019s make sure it doesn\u2019t happen. Re-elect them and be in no doubt. Back they come with VAT on fuel, all schools to opt-out, your post office sold off, more health privatisation, giant privatised monopolies controlling your services, the price decided by a gaggle of former ministers on the board, for they too are a party changed. Half the Conservative back benchers voted for Mr Redwood to be prime minister. All aboard Starship Redwood, bound for Planet Portillo! Do you remember Planet Portillo? Last year it was a joke. Next year it could be Britain. Don\u2019t let them capture this country\u2019s future, for they offer it nothing.This is a new age, to be led by a new generation. Let me talk to you about my generation. We grew up after the Second World War. We read about fascism and saw the Soviet Union and we learned to fear extremes of right and left. We were born into the welfare state and the National Health Service, into the market economy of bank accounts, supermarkets, jeans and cars. We had money in our pockets our parents never dreamt of, we travelled abroad, we have been through the sexual revolution of the 60s. Half the workforce now are women and the world of work revolutionised by science. We built a new popular culture, transformed by colour TV, Coronation Street and the Beatles.My generation enjoys a thousand material advantages over any previous generation and yet we suffer a depth of insecurity and spiritual doubt they never knew. The family weakened, society divided, we see elderly people in fear of crime, children abused. We live today with the knowledge that the world through nuclear weapons, chemical weapons and contempt for the environment can end a billion years of evolution.Mine is the generation with more freedom than any other, but less certainty in how to exercise it responsibly. It is the generation that knocks on the door of a new millennium frightened for our future and unsure of our soul because we live in a new age, but in an old country. Britain won two world wars. We had an Empire and formed a Commonwealth. We invented the sports the rest of the world plays, we gave the world some of its finest literature, art and poetry. We are proud of our history, but its weight hangs heavy upon us. Why? Because for far too long it has left us defining ourselves as a nation, not by what unites us, but by what divides us: a class system, unequal and antiquated; a social fabric, tattered and torn; a politics where dogma so often drives out common sense; even an education system where one part of the nation is taught apart from the other; and where, if we do not change course now, we will have two classes of health service, two classes of state school, two Britains, one on welfare, the other paying for it.I want us to be a young country again with a common purpose, ideals we cherish and live up to, not resting on past glories, fighting old battles and sitting back, hand on mouth, concealing a yawn of cynicism, but ready for the day\u2019s challenge, ambitious, idealistic, united, where people succeed on the basis of what they did to their country, rather than what they take from their country, not saying, \u2018This was a great country,\u2019 but \u2018Britain can and will be a great country again.\u2019 A young country: no more bosses versus workers - partnership at the workplace; no more public versus private - cooperation to rebuild our nation\u2019s road, rail, inner cities and regions; no more boom and bust economics, but stability which businesses need to plan for the future; help for small businesses; a new relationship between public and private sector, measures to encourage long term investment.  But above all, I present to you today our proposals to equip our people and businesses for new technological and economic challenge, to change the basis of this country's thinking of the past 100 years. Education is the best economic policy there is for a modern country and it is in the marriage of education and technology that the future lies. The arms race may be over; the knowledge race has begun and we will never compete on the basis of a low-wage, sweat shop economy. It cannot be done that way. We have one asset - our people, their intelligence, their potential. Develop it, we succeed, neglect it, we fail. It is as simple as that and the pace of technological change means that this task is urgent.           Education does not stop when you walk out of the school gates for the last time. Education must be for life. This is hard economics. The more you learn, the more you earn. It is your way to do well out of life - your route to jobs, to growth, to the combination of technology and know-how that will transform our lives. Look at the potential of it. Look at industry and business: an oil rig out in the Gulf of Mexico has metal fatigue, it can be diagnosed from an office in Aberdeen. European businesses will finalise a deal with the Japanese with simultaneous translation down the phone line. The calls in the future could even be free. Leisure too: virtual reality tourism that allows you to go anywhere in the world, computers that learn about a child as they teach them, shaping courses to their personal need. Knowledge in this new world is power, information is opportunity and technology can make it happen if we use it properly and if we plan and think ahead for the future.Just think: direct access to the best teaching skills from the workplace or the home - class size of one; the engineer who needs to keep pace with technical change; the self-employed architect who wants to do his own accountancy; the computer operator who needs to adapt to new systems; the mother on maternity leave learning a new skill or language to equip her for her return to work. It can be done, but will it happen? Only if we make it happen. It means bringing together the private sector, government, universities, research centres, science laboratories, to put together an advanced system of further education for the electronic age for people at work and for people who lose their job. It requires a supreme national effort. The market will not do it.A Labour government will and can and we have started work on it already. It will be called the University for Industry and it will transform education and skills in Britain and make lifelong learning a reality. But we must be even bolder. We have huge advantages - some of the finest telecommunications companies in the world, world leaders in broadcasting, the world\u2019s first language - English. Together they could put us years ahead in education, technology and business, but in Tory Britain we waste our assets. We are not using them, organising, making the most of them and time is running out because other countries are doing it.I put before you today this proposal, that we should open up the markets in communications and technology - yes, a market solution. The cable companies are playing their part, using the new technology to good effect, but we should aim for free and fair competition and end the restrictions that have prevented British Telecom, Mercury and others from playing their part in wiring up Britain until there is full and open competition everywhere from the year 2002. This is a market with huge potential, but in return these companies owe some responsibility to the nation. That is the essence of partnership.In these past weeks we have been in discussion with British Telecom. In return for access to the market, I can announce that they have agreed, as they build their network, to connect every school, college, hospital and library in Britain, for free. They get the chance to win new markets, the nation gets the chance to succeed. That is what I mean by new Labour, that type of co-operation with our people; public and private working together, building a dynamic economy that addresses the nation\u2019s needs and serves the nation's interests. Eventually we want every home to be wired up in new Britain - a goal worth striving for, no haves and have nots in the computer age.We can make it happen: business enhanced, life more entertaining, public services improved, People better off and Britain better off. I can announce a third public-private initiative. David Blunkett will be opening discussions with both the education authorities and the computer companies which supply them about how we meet the goal of ensuring that every child has access to a proper laptop computer. It is a big challenge; it would need new forms of teacher training and a whole network of delivery, but it is possible. Just think: 50 years ago, their grandparents came into state schools for the first time and sat at a proper wooden desk and a Labour government provided them. Half a century later, a new way for a new age. That is also what I mean by new Labour.Thirty-fifth in the education league may be good enough for the Tories but I didn\u2019t come into politics satisfied for Britain to be 35th best at anything. What an appalling record to have. We are going to put our education system right - no more dogma, no more arguments about structures, for every school, fair and equal funding, no return to selection, academic or social, but a new deal in our classrooms.We will be the champions of standards for the 21st century: more support and in return, more demand for achievement; the aim of a nursery place for every three and four year old; a voluntary network of associate teachers - adults with expertise in a foreign language or business - to assist the classroom teacher; a new adult-pupil ratio in class, pioneered by Labour authorities, extended to the whole of Britain; proper assessment for all five year olds; schools playing to their strengths, not just technology, which should be part of every school's curriculum, but schools with a specialism that can bring out the best in their pupils - science, music, design or maths - developing areas of expertise, subjects in which they can offer that extra depth that helps the child, centres of excellence for the benefit of the whole community. And one more thing: the Tories say that class size does not matter; if that is true, I just wonder why so many of them spend so much money buying small classes in the private sector.The Tories spend over £100 million a year on the Assisted Places Scheme. Under Labour, the scheme will be phased out. £60 million - just over half the cost of the Assisted Places Scheme - would pay for every five, six and seven year old to be educated in classes of less than 30 children. That is how they will be educated in Labour Britain.The price of more support will be higher expectations of success and more action to combat failure. Teachers should be rewarded, but if they cannot do the job, they should not be teaching at all. Headteachers should prove their leadership skills before they are considered for a head\u2019s post. Parents have duties too. Children do homework, they should not be playing truant and where they are, it is not just the school\u2019s job to do something about it, it is the parents\u2019 job too. We support the development of home-school contracts where schools and parents jointly take responsibility for children (again pioneered by Labour in local government), tougher inspection, higher targets and more prompt action when things are going wrong. I know some of that may sound harsh, but actually it is fair. If we tolerate failure in our schools, it is ordinary children who suffer and we cannot betray their future.Our challenge to be a young country is not just economic, it is social and moral. Look at the wreckage of our broken society, see Britain through the eyes of our children. Are we really proud of our society today - drugs, violence, youngsters hanging around street corners with nothing to do? We have to have the courage to build a new civil society, a new social order, where everyone has a stake and everyone plays a part - justice for all, responsibility from all. It is a bargain between us and the people.No one pretends that we can solve unemployment overnight, but no decent society can tolerate these levels of long-term unemployment, with all the misery and social breakdown they bring. We will take the excess profits of the new robber barons of Tory Britain, the privatised utilities, and use them for the most radical programme of work and education for the unemployed ever put forward in Britain. We will use that money too - and end up saving money - by giving single parents the chance not to live on benefit, but to plan their future, organise childcare and training so that they can support themselves and their children, not be the butt of Tory propaganda, but citizens of a new Britain who can earn a wage and look after the children they love.With this opportunity comes the responsibility because both come together. It has always been absurd that the debate about crime in this country has some talking of its causes and others of the need to punish criminals. Sweep away the dogma - tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime: reform of the criminal justice system; a comprehensive programme to deal with juvenile offending; tackling drug abuse; proper treatment of victims and witnesses; tougher penalties on violence or guns; a crackdown on those who make life hell in their local neighbourhoods through noise or disturbance and, for the first time, a nationwide crime prevention policy in which in each community, police, schools, businesses and local government plan together how to beat crime. Law and order is a Labour issue today. We all suffer crime and the poorest and vulnerable most of all. It is the duty of government to protect them, but we can make choices in spending too and instead of wasting hundreds of millions of pounds on compulsory identity cards as the Tory Right demand, let that money provide thousands of extra police officers on the beat where they can actually protect people. This is what a young country can do.The truth is, and we know it, that the best two crime prevention policies are a job and a stable family. A young country that wants to be a strong country cannot be morally neutral about the family. It is the foundation of any decent society. Behind strong communities, lie strong families. Go to any juvenile court and you will see, because in the family people learn to respect and care for one another. Destroy that in a family and you cannot rebuild it in a country. In every area of policy, we should examine its effect on the family, seeing how we can strengthen it and keep it together - in benefits, employment, education, and there is something very tangible we could do in housing. Let local authorities use the money from the sale of council houses to end the most telling obscenity of Tory Britain, that we spend millions of pounds on slum bed and breakfast accommodation for families when we could use that money to build homes for people.In this young country, we can then reform and modernise our welfare state, and the party that founded it and believes in it is the party to reform it. There are hard choices and we will face up to them, but they should be made with justice and equity. This party introduced universal pensions. We believe they must remain the foundation of pension provision, but we cannot cure pensioner poverty simply through the state pension. Some 600,000 of our elderly people are left behind because they do not claim means-tested income support. Increasing numbers of pensioners have second and third pensions. That is why we are looking at ways for people to put together income from public and private sources to guarantee a minimum standard of living for our pensioners. The aim of this policy should be to remove the stigma of means testing for ever and guarantee a minimum income that provides dignity in old age. That is new Labour too, and we are also thinking through new ways of planning for long-term care. You will all know elderly people who saved all their lives and now see their savings eaten away by nursing home costs. It is one of the great modern tragedies of our country and we will examine that and bring forward sensible proposals there to help those people.But I do not want an old social order. I want a new one with rules for today. I believe in the family and in being tough on crime. Some would say that those are the moral values of the old-fashioned or the right, but don\u2019t let the Tories claim these values as their own. They are our values and you can be tough on crime and tough on prejudice too. In any young country, the talents of all are allowed to flourish. There should be no discrimination in our young country on grounds of disability, gender, age, sexuality or race. I say this to the Conservatives, those who play politics with race or immigration, betray the values of a decent, civilised society.Justice, in society and at work: people at work should have a stake in the companies for which they work. A young country gives rights, but it demands responsibilities. Leave the battles of the past. Ballots, peaceful picketing, proper conduct of disputes - these laws are staying we know. But there will be new rights for all individuals at work.A Labour government will be part of the European Social Chapter. Part-time employees will no longer be treated as second class citizens. There will be an end to zero-hours contracts. Young people will be properly protected against under age working and joining a trade union will be a matter of free choice, but where that choice is exercised, there will be a right to representation and, where the majority want it, a right to union recognition.There is one other piece of unfinished business. For 10 years, good and patriotic workers at GCHQ have been denied the right to join a free trade union. Under Labour, they will get it back. One other thing: Keir Hardie did not manage to achieve a minimum wage and nor did Attlee, Wilson, Callaghan or anyone else, but this next Labour government will introduce a statutory minimum wage for Britain. That is our pledge, and it will be done. Not building a workforce where fear is the spur or insecurity the incentive, but a workforce of partners committed to a new and dynamic Britain at work.A young country will sweep away the dogma from our public services. We need to make them public services again - modernised, but serving the public, not vested interests of any kind.  This party created the National Health Service and we will save it. Let that £1 billion in extra administration that the Tories have spent on bureaucracy, accountants and company cars be spent on beds, nurses and patients.     Let the internal market that pits hospital against hospital cease. Let our system of GP commissioning replace GP fund-holding that has created this two-tier system and let the National Health Service work as a service again. Let doctors do what the doctors should do - care for the sick not be forced to make a business out of them We will improve it and today we can announce a new proposal from Professor Robert Winston in the audience today, one of the world\u2019s leading consultants. It is about how we can   use technology to create regional centres of excellence in specialist care, directly linked up through our superhighway proposals to local hospitals and surgeries. That is his proposal. He is passionate not just about defending the National Health Service, but about improving it and he is also a passionate supporter of this party, working for Labour, working for Britain.We will sweep away the dogma of the market in transport and the environment. Our cities are congested, our roads a driver\u2019s nightmare, our railways reduced to such a state that their latest timetable has as many false promises as a Tory Party manifesto. This nation needs a proper national, integrated transport system that serves the people and safeguards the environment. We should sit down and plan it, not wait for the free market to build it - but plan it together - the market where it works, where it does not, we do it. Let me make one thing clear: I do not give blank cheques in any area of policy, including this, no matter what the pressures, but to anyone thinking of grabbing our railways, built up over the years, so they can make a quick profit as our network is broken up and sold off, I say this there will be a publicly owned, publicly accountable railway system under a Labour government. We can then save the hundreds of millions of pounds being wasted on selling our railways to upgrade the service and modernise our lines. That is new Labour too.The privatised utilities will be properly regulated. We even have plans for the lottery too. The lottery profits could be going to good causes. Camelot have six years of their contract to run. A Labour government will then be seeking an efficient, non-profit making promoter so that we can release more money for the benefit of Britain. We will be seeking ways of ensuring that the views of the lottery players themselves are taken into account when lottery panels decide how the takings are spent. It is the people\u2019s lottery - they should get more out of it.But nowhere is a young country more needed than in politics itself. We will change the old and dead political culture of Tory Britain. Where it is right, we will co-operate as well as oppose - on constitutional change and on Northern Ireland. I will not play political games with the peace process in Northern Ireland, it is too important for that. But it is time to end the Tory sleaze, to sweep away the quango state, to take power back from big government and share it with the people. Scotland shall have its Parliament; Wales will have its Assembly. They will be legislated for in the first year of a Labour government and people will then have a say over how their health, education and law and order services are run. A young country should not be frightened of such change. It will strengthen Britain. The only thing that threatens the United Kingdom is a government that refuses to listen to the desire of people to take more power to themselves. That is the threat to Britain.London, our great capital city, will be run by a directly elected authority like any other capital and if, in time, the regions of England want a greater say in their health, education, police and transport, then that can come too. We will rebuild local government in this country and end the muddled hopeless system of rate-capping. We will do it in a way that changes the whole relationship between citizen and state - a Freedom of Information Act for central and local government, an end to hereditary peers sitting in the House of Lords as the first step to a proper directly elected second chamber, and the chance for people to decide after the election the system by which they elect the government of the future.The Tories set up the Nolan Committee on Standards in Public Life. Now they are refusing to implement it because it forces Tory MPs to say what they earn from outside consultancies. Labour will implement it in full.This young country will be proud of its identity and its place in the world, not living in its history, but grasping the opportunities of its future. It is a disgrace that the Conservative Party have reduced British foreign policy in Europe to the level of a joke. Of course, Europe needs reform. We have led the calls to reform the Common Agricultural Policy and the institutions of Europe. Of course, if there are further steps to integration, then we have been the first to say the people should give their consent at a general election or in a referendum, but Europe is a vital part of our national interest. To be sidelined without influence is not a betrayal of Europe, it is a betrayal of Britain. I warn this country, there is now a growing part of the Conservative Party that would take Britain out of Europe altogether and that would be a disaster for jobs and business. I say this to my country in all honesty, we cannot be half in and half out for ever. This country should be leading in Europe and under Labour it will lead in Europe.We will be a nation that stands up for the rights of other nations, as we have done in Bosnia; a nation that will stand up for our allies when right and make a stand when they are wrong, as we do when we condemn without reservation the decision by France to carry out nuclear testing in the South Pacific.We will be a nation proud to welcome our friends from abroad, as we do on Thursday with the visit of Thabo Mbeki and we are doubly proud that we were prepared to support them in prison and not just in government. We will be a nation that will never, for the sake of short-term electoral advantage, sacrifice our overseas aid budget for the poorest people in the world, and shame on those Tories who suggest it.We will be a young country, equipped for the future with a just society, a new politics and a clear understanding of its role in the world. I want to make this pledge today to the whole country and especially to those despairing, who have almost given up hope of change under politicians, that the party I lead will carry out in government, the programme we provide in our manifesto - nothing more, nothing less. That is my word. We deliver what we promise; we do not promise what we cannot deliver.Is this not a vision worth fighting for? Can you not already see the foundations of new Britain being laid just in what we have said today? Ahead in technology, schools transformed, the National Health Service restored and saved, police patrolling the streets, a new battle against crime, democracy and politics renewed, the homeless in houses not on the street, an integrated transport system, partnership between government and business, public and private sector to create the dynamic and modern economy that we need, a direct attack on unemployment, real help that will get single parents off welfare and into work. Feel new Britain come alive. Feel the vitality that can course through this country\u2019s veins and make it young again.Rise together to the challenge because new Labour cannot create new Britain alone. I challenge this country, my country. Let us rouse ourselves to a new moral purpose for our nation to build a new and young country that can lay aside all the prejudices that have dominated our land for generations, a nation for all the people, built by all the people, old divisions cast out, a new spirit in the nation, working together in unity, solidarity, partnership - one Britain. That is the patriotism for the future where never again do we fight our politics by appealing to one section of our nation at the expense of another, where your child in distress is my child, your parent ill and in pain is my parent, your friend unemployed and helpless is my friend, your neighbour, my neighbour. That is the true patriotism of a nation so that together we do make this the young country of my generation's dreams, 50 years from the war, five years from a new millennium, at a turning point in our history. I say to Britain, be strong and of good courage. The Tories will tell you that it cannot be done. They will lie about you, they will lie about me, they will lie about themselves, but do not let fear drive out hope.The coming election is not a struggle for political power. It is a battle for the soul of a nation and I say to you, my party, be strong and of good courage. The Labour Party that first won support from the British people was new Labour then. 1945 was new Labour, 1964 was new Labour - both new Labour because both had the courage to take the values of the Labour Party and use them, not for the world as it was, but for the world as they wanted it to be. New Labour now is ready in 1995 to build new Britain.During the VJ Day celebrations, I was on the platform with Tory ministers and as we walked down the Mall, there were thousands of people, holding their Union Jacks and it became clear, to the horror of the Tories, that most of them were Labour and they were waving and shouting and urging me to \u2018get the Tories out.\u2019 These are our people. They love this country just as we do and it is because they love this country that they look to us to change it. Let us say with pride, we are patriots. This is the patriotic party because it is the party of the people. As the Tories wave their Union Jacks next week, I know what so many people will be thinking. I know what the people want to say to those Tories: it is no good waving the fabric of our flag when you have spent 16 years tearing apart the fabric of the nation; tearing apart the bonds that tie communities together and make us a United Kingdom; tearing apart the security of those people, clutching their Union Jacks, swelling with pride at their victory over tyranny, yelling at me to \u2018get the Tories out\u2019 because they want security, because they want to leave a better world for their children and their grandchildren than they created for themselves and they know the Tories cannot do it; decent people, good people, patriotic people. When I hear people urging us to fight for \u2018our people,\u2019 I tell you, these are our people. They are the majority and we will serve them and build that new Britain, that young country, for their children and their families.I make them this promise now: that I will do all that I can to get these Tories out and devote every breath that I breathe, every sinew of my body to ensuring that your grandchildren do get to live in that new Britain in a new and better world. Discipline, courage, determination, honesty: this victory can be won. The prize is immense. It is new Britain, one Britain - the people united by shared values, shared aims, a government governing for all the people and the party, this party, the Labour Party, new Labour, founded by the people, back truly as the people\u2019s party.New Labour, new Britain, the party renewed, the country reborn. New Labour. New Britain. (Prolonged applause)

aVDiana, friends, colleagues, this year we meet as the opposition. Next year, the British people willing, an end to 18 years of the Tories and we will meet as the new Labour government of Britain. (Applause) It is exciting!But it is also a great responsibility. \u2018A chance to serve - that is all we ask.\u2019 John Smith\u2019s final words from his final speech the night before he died. We owe a debt of inspiration to John Smith, and a debt of honour to Neil Kinnock. (Applause) I did not begin new Labour; Neil did. I intend to repay them both in full. All I ask is the chance to serve. And at the time of the next election there will be just one thousand days until the new millennium, a thousand days to prepare for a thousand years.As a father, as a leader, as a member of the human family, I ask this question of Britain\u2019s future. We live in an era of extraordinary, revolutionary change at work, at home, through technology, through the million marvels of modern science. The possibilities are exciting. But its challenge is clear. How do we create in Britain a new age of achievement in which all of the people - not just a few but all of the people - can share?For all the people or for a few? That is the difference between us and the Conservative Party that governs Britain today. That is the choice before us. That is the challenge of the 21st century. I want to lead Britain into this age of achievement, and today I want to set before you how.But first we should welcome all the representatives, the ambassadors from round the world. I would want to welcome in particular at this time the Israeli Ambassador and the representative of the Palestinian people. (Applause) You are here together and you have our prayers that the tears and the bloodshed of the past few days can once again be ended and peace restored.Here, too, are those from all the communities in Northern Ireland. I would like to say this personally to the people there. No leader with this nation\u2019s interests at heart could do anything other than see this peace process through. With the Irish government, with the parties in Northern Ireland, I can assure you it will be every much a priority for me as for John Major. All the force and energy I have will be bent towards it. We have been responsible in our actions over the peace process from the outset; we will continue to be so now. (Applause)I say this to Sinn Fein and, after events of the last 24 hours, to Loyalist groups as well. You have your chance to take the path of peace. It is your duty to take it as members of the human race. Honour it and you shall play your part. Fail in that duty and I swear to you, the search for justice and reconciliation will carry on without you. The choice is yours. (Applause)My friends, I would like, too, to give apologies for one absentee today. The National Executive invited Aung San Suu Kyi of Burma to be our guest here this week. For reasons everyone will understand she cannot be with us. Let us hope to invite her here next year, a free citizen and an example to democrats everywhere. (Applause)You must be careful with the flashlights, it is making my eyes red! (Laughter and applause) It has been a funny year for me. First, it was Stalin. Then it was Kim Il Sung. And now it is the devil with the demon eyes. Can\u2019t we just go back to Bambi? (Laughter and applause) Or I have a better idea - maybe Kim Il Sung\u2019s official title - the Great Wise Leader, President for Life, Dearly Beloved and Sagacious Leader. Laughter) Why not? It is what John Prescott calls me! (Applause) Sometimes.I will tell you something. In John Prescott I have the best deputy any leader could have. (Applause) If I am fighting in the jungle there is nobody I would rather have with me than John Prescott, and if John Major is fighting in the jungle there is nobody I would rather have him with than Michael Heseltine!I ask you, this Tory government - has there ever been a government in this country\u2019s history that has put itself before the British people with less to merit its re-election than this one? Just mouth the words \u2018five more Tory years\u2019 and you feel your senses and reason repulsed by what they have done to our country. (Applause) Look at them - the tax-cutting party that gave us the biggest tax rises in peacetime history; the law-and-order party that doubled crime and gave us a Home Secretary in court more often than the people he is supposed to be locking up; the farmer\u2019s party that gave us BSE; the party that set up the Scott Report, then, when it found ministerial deceit, tried to ignore it and would have got away with it but for the brilliance of that man Robin Cook. (Applause)And then Nolan - cash for questions, and this morning more revelations. Do you know, the Tories changed the law to let Mr Hamilton put his case? Well, we will change the law to make the Tories clean up their act. (Applause)To coin a phrase, we will be tough on sleaze and tough on the causes of sleaze. We will ask that Nolan Committee to investigate political funding, and we will legislate so as to make the Tories tell us where the money comes from for these negative and deceitful advertising campaigns. (Applause)I say this, too, to John Major. If he wants to be seen as an honest man, fight an honest campaign. (Applause) By the way, Matthew Harding sends his regards. Here he is, this Prime Minister, so weak, so utterly incapable of stamping his authority on the government he nominally leads, that he has given birth to the first \u2018ism\u2019 in politics to denote not the existence of a political philosophy but the absence of one. \u2018Majorism\u2019 - holding your party together while your country falls apart. (Applause)Still, he has his secret weapon. And I have mine. Kenneth Clarke! Mr Feelgood Factor! Let us tell Kenneth Clarke and John Major, the real feelgood factor will arrive when the people of this country say goodbye to this government for good. (Applause)Time to change. The Tories never did have the best vision for Britain. They just took the best words - freedom, choice, opportunity, aspiration, ambition. I can vividly recall the exact moment that I knew the last election was lost. I was canvassing in the Midlands on an ordinary suburban estate. I met a man polishing his Ford Sierra, self-employed electrician, Dad always voted Labour. He used to vote Labour, he said, but he bought his own home, he had set up his own business, he was doing quite nicely, so he said I\u2019ve become a Tory. He was not rich but he was doing better than he did, and as far as he was concerned, being better off meant being Tory too.In that moment the basis of our failure - the reason why a whole generation has grown up under the Tories - became plain to me. You see, people judge us on their instincts about what they believe our instincts to be. And that man polishing his car was clear: his instincts were to get on in life, and he thought our instincts were to stop him. But that was never our history or our purpose.I know in my own constituency, the miners in 1945 who voted Labour did so so that their sons would not have to go down the pit and work in the conditions that they had. (Applause) And in 1964 their children voted Labour because they saw the next generation\u2019s chance to go to university and do better than their parents had done. The true radical mission of the Labour Party, new and old, is this: not to hold people back but to help them get on - all the people. (Applause)Is that not the essence of what we believe? Each generation doing better than the last, the heritage of hope passed from parents to their children - now, for the first time in this generation, at risk under this Conservative government. Our task is to restore that hope, to build a new age of achievement in a new and different world.Today we compete in the era of global markets, and I say this to our Conservative opponents. There is no future for Britain as a low-wage, low-skill, low-technology economy. (Applause) We will compete on the basis of quality or not at all. This means a stable economy, long-term investment, the enterprise of our people set free.First, let us get the fundamentals right. Look at the Tories - two recessions, one of which wiped out a third of our manufacturing base; borrowed their way into the record books; the pound devalued; North Sea oil money gone; all the money from asset sales gone. It is sometimes said, you know, that the Tories are cruel but they are efficient. In fact, they are the most feckless, irresponsible, incompetent managers of the British economy in this country\u2019s history. (Applause)Labour will be the party of sound finance and good housekeeping. World interest rates and inflation rates are low; in Britain we will keep them this way. There will be defined targets set and kept to. Losing control of public finance is not radical, it is just reckless, and we will not do it. Gordon Brown, the Iron Chancellor (Applause) - it can be a tough job and he does it brilliantly. They say it is easier to get past security at our Conference without a pass than to get a spending commitment past Gordon! And in case anyone is in any doubt, that is how it is going to stay.We need a tax regime, too, though, that is fair and encourages work and business. Sure, the few at the top have become wealthy under the Tories. But they have put up the taxes of ordinary families in Britain by the largest amount in peacetime history. We are not going to add to their burden. Those families have suffered enough. Instead, a new Labour government should be trying to get tax down for the lowest income earners, some of them paying 80-90 per cent marginal tax rates. If incentives through lower tax rates is the key for the director on £200,000 a year, then why should it not work for people on £5,000 or £10,000 a year? (Applause)Next, in this new world many more people will be self employed or in small businesses, and we are going to help them. The Federation of Small Businesses has just welcomed our programme as the basis of a real partnership between a Labour government and small businesses. So move over again the Tories; Labour is the party of small businesses in Britain today. (Applause)We will give Britain the modern, integrated transport network, built in partnership between public and private finance, and restoring a unified system of railways with a publicly-owned, publicly-accountable British Rail at its core. (Applause) Good for Britain and good for business.Leading Britain into an age of achievement means Britain leading in Europe, and for business and for Britain we will build that new, constructive relationship with our European partners. Let me make one thing plain. I will not scrap Britain\u2019s veto in Europe. Our options on a single currency should remain open, to be determined according to our national interest. Any change will only come with the full consent of the people. But make no mistake: leave Europe, or retreat to its sidelines, as these Tories want to do, and this country will lose its influence and its inward investment. It would be a disaster for jobs and for industry. The Tories may glory in perpetual isolation but I say that is not standing up for Britain; that is a betrayal of British interests. (Applause)With a good relationship in Europe we can get more out of it. Britain has the Presidency of the European Union in the first half of 1998. One of our key priorities in that Presidency will be the completion of the single market. Today, even in opposition, I set a deadline - June 1998, the end of the British Presidency, for the completion of the single market in Europe. And I will begin discussions with other European leaders now so that we can get ready to meet that deadline. New opportunities for our firms and new jobs for our people. Our aim is that by the end of the first term of a new Labour government in gas and electricity, in telecommunications, in public procurement, in financial services, we will have a genuine single market in Europe open to British goods and services. That is the way to get the best out of Europe for Britain. (Applause)And a new age of achievement in our industry, too. Support for manufacturing as well as for services; support for research and development, for science and engineering; and a new era of industrial relations in Britain. There will be fairness, not favours, for employers and employees alike. The Labour government today is not the political arm of anyone other than the British people. But let us settle these arguments about industrial laws once and for good. There will be no return to the 70s, but there should and there will be basic civil rights for all at work legislated on early in a Labour government. (Applause)What are they? They are merely the due claim of civilisation - a statutory minimum wage. Like every other industrial country the world over, we will have one under a Labour government in Britain. (Applause) We will be part of the European social chapter, as every other government, Tory or Labour, is in the rest of Europe. There will be a right for any individual to join a trade union (Applause) and if a majority of the workforce wanted, for the union to represent those people. (Applause) Basic human rights.On GCHQ I hear people say we have changed our mind. I have not. I have made a personal commitment to those people to restore their trade union rights in full and I will keep it. (Applause)You applaud, and rightly. But let me tell you something that I believe in the end is even more important. I make a plea to both sides of industry. A couple of weeks ago I visited the JCB plant in Staffordshire. The man who runs it, in the past at least, donated to the Tory party. I don\u2019t give a damn. He has got good union relations there, the work force is valued and invested in, stakeholders in the enterprise, the product is the best. That is the future. We are on the same side, we are in the same team.I visited Raytheon Jets in North Wales, too, not so far from here. A plant which the unions helped, with management, to save from relocation to the United States. I ask in the name of this country\u2019s future - forget the past, no more bosses versus workers - we are on the same side, the same team, and Britain united will win! (Applause)These are the foundations of this new age of achievement. And for all our people it can be made a reality. There is only one lasting route to higher living standards, better wages, more secure jobs in today's world. We will win by our brains and our skills or not at all. In Britain we are still in the 30-30-40 economy: 30 per cent do very well, 30 per cent just getting by, 40 per cent struggling or worse.When the Tories talk about the spirit of enterprise they mean a few self-made millionaires. Well, best of luck to them. But there should be a spirit of enterprise and achievement on the shop floor, in the office as well: in the 16 year-old who starts as an office girl with the realistic chance of ending up as the office manager; in the young graduate with the confidence to take initiatives; in the secretary who takes time out to learn a new language and comes back to search for a new and better job. These people have enterprise within them. They have talent and potential within them. Ask me my three main priorities for government and I tell you: education, education and education. (Applause)The first wonder of the world is the mind of a child. I sometimes sit reading a newspaper, watching TV, and you look up and you see your children at a computer, and you marvel at what they can do, using that computer as easily as we would read a book. Yet we are 35th in the world league of education standards today - 35th. They say give me the boy at seven, I\u2019ll show you the man at 70. Well give me the education system that is 35th in the world today and I will give you the economy that is 35th in the world tomorrow. (Applause)So let us set about this task at every level - radical improvement and reform for our children; a teaching profession trained, able to stand alongside the best in the world and valued as such. No to Tory nursery vouchers, yes to proper nursery places for all our children. (Applause) Tomorrow David Blunkett will set out how to ensure that every primary school child leaves school able to read to the adequate standard. (Applause) A literacy guaranteed by establishing three-week intensive literacy summer schools for all those falling behind, with the aim of ensuring that every 11 year-old is up to the standard in reading and adding up that they need.It is a choice of priorities, isn\u2019t it? The Tories choose to spend those millions of pounds on the assisted places scheme to subsidise a small number of children at private school. Under Labour that scheme will be phased out, that money will be used to make sure that every five, six and seven-year-old is in a class of a size of 30 or under. Those are the priorities for us. (Applause)There will be no return to the 11-plus. The comprehensive system will stay, modernised for today\u2019s world. (Applause) Modernised, taking account of children\u2019s different abilities but not setting them apart. Continual assessment, targets set, instant action where they are not met. There should be zero tolerance of failure in Britain\u2019s schools. That is if we want to be serious about our task. I will tell you my vision of the future. I would like a state education system in Britain so good, so attractive, that the parents choose to put behind us the educational apartheid of the past, private and state, and I do not believe anything would do more to break down the class divides that have no place in a modern country in the 21st century. (Applause)Education should not be about wealth. And the age of achievement will be built on the new technology. Last year I announced an agreement with British Telecom to cable up schools, colleges, universities, libraries to the information superhighway for free. To their credit, the cable companies have followed suit. That was an historic beginning. But it was only a beginning. Today we go further. The cable industry and British Telecom have now given us a commitment to keep costs to our schools for access to the Internet and superhighway as low and as predictable as possible, and they have given a commitment to achieve real reductions in prices for those schools.We have agreed with them to put this into practice. So we have got the wires, we have got the low-cost connections. But now we need more - the hardware, the computers themselves. In January, again even in opposition, we appointed Dennis Stevenson, a leading businessman in the country, to chair a commission of independent experts to examine how we get that computer hardware and the training for teachers to use it. His final report, to be published later this year, will lay down the third building block to show how in time no child will be without access to a computer and no school unable to use them properly.The cables for free, the connections at low cost, plans for computers, and then the final piece. What matters in the end is the educational material that comes down from those cables into those computers and into the mind of the child. Just as schools have to buy books, they will pay for the various courses and services on offer. But we are going to make sure the quality is high. Competition will ensure that prices are low. In government we will be inviting bids for a franchise to provide the specialised education network that the superhighway needs. Our aim is for every school to have access to the information superhighway, the computers to deliver it, the education programmes to go on it. With the university for industry, for adult skills, this adds up to a national grid for learning for Britain. That is the age of achievement come alive. (Applause)Just think of it - Britain, the skills superpower of the world. Why not? Why can\u2019t we do it? Achievement, aspiration fulfilled for all our people. Because a great people equals a Great Britain. Run a country where a few winners take all rather than all of us as winners, and see what happens. It is not right, it is not in people\u2019s interests. Huge costs of unemployment, crime, social decay, higher taxes to pay for it. Welfare bills doubled under the Tories, even as poverty rises. And the type of society we have - what kind of world is it where fathers who do not work have sons who do not work, where the young take to drugs and the debased culture of despair because no job beckons on leaving school? What kind of world is it where there are more second homes but more homeless and the streets paved with fear? (Applause) What kind of world is it where the best education, jobs and skills are available only to the few? It is a world in which some can succeed. But I ask you, is it a world of which anyone can be proud? That, Mr Major, is the moral question of our times. (Applause)When I was growing up the family was strong, the sense of social responsibility was strong, crime was low. There was a national ethos and spirit that had won us the war and stayed with us in peace. What was strong then is fragile now. National purpose faltering, our feeling of collective responsibility starved of expression, the family unsupported. It is right to want to get on. It is right to want to do well. But if all we have is what we own, not what we share, we are all the losers for it. (Applause)Today I offer you, and we offer the country, a new vision. If we are to build this new age of achievement, you and I and all of us together must build first the decent society to deliver it. A society in which every individual is valued, every person given the chance to fulfil their potential; a society to which we contribute and which then contributes to us; a society based not on outdated prejudices but on the common duty of humanity, our belief that we owe an obligation to each other to improve the lives of us all; a society of opportunity; a society of responsibility; a society which gives to us because we give to that society. History will call it the decent society, the new age of achievement in Britain.These will be its principles. We will respect family life. We will develop it and encourage it in any way that we can, for strong families are the foundation of strong communities. We will provide opportunities for those without. As a first step, we will implement a Programme to take 250,000 young people off benefit and into work, funded by a one-off windfall levy on the excess profits of the privatised monopoly utilities. (Applause)  We will put a roof over the heads of the homeless by releasing those capital receipts from the sale of council houses and let homes be built for our people. (Applause) We will cherish and enhance the environment, ease congestion, reduce pollution, develop our quality of life, and in the countryside as much as cities and towns.In return for those opportunities, responsibility. I am proud that new Labour has taken the mantle of the party of law and order in Britain today. (Applause) I began that process, Jack Straw has carried it on. I simply say to people who tell us it is wrong to want to crack down on violent crime, drug pushers, anti-social neighbours, hooligans - try living next door to them. (Applause)It is the weak and the vulnerable who suffer most from crime. So we will be tough on the causes of crime, but tough on crime too. You saw in that film review of the year the day when John Major and I visited Dunblane together. It was a searing, chilling and dreadful day. Conservative MPs complain that our response has been emotional. If they had been in that gym, if they had talked to those parents, sitting on those tiny chairs where once their children had sat, they would have been emotional, too. I believe that we should ban the private ownership and possession of handguns. (Applause)We will do more. We will give the disabled the civil rights that the Tories have denied them. Nobody should be excluded from this age of achievement. We will work with the voluntary sector, and tomorrow David Blunkett will announce our plans for a national network of millennium volunteers.We will provide security in old age. Let me say this to you: previous Labour governments did their duty by British pensioners, and so will the next Labour government. (Applause) The review that we have announced will be set up under a Labour government on the terms we have announced to see how we fulfil that duty for modern times. It will review also the whole issue of community care where those elderly people have to sell their homes to pay the cost of nursing care. (Applause) That I can say. But I will not make promises on money until I know they can be kept. That is our guiding rule; there can be no exceptions to it, and I ask you to understand that. Making promises we do not keep does not help anybody. (Applause)One thing I can promise to pensioners and to everyone else gladly - gladly. The next Labour government will scrap the Tory internal market of the National Health Service and will improve and renew the health service as a decent public service for the people. (Applause) Now you can see why it is worth winning, why it is worth making a difference. No more hospitals fighting hospitals. No more doctor competing with doctor. No more bogus red tape and expensive bureaucracy, and, in place of a Tory who does not care about the health service, Chris Smith, who does. (Applause) And we will improve it, not just keep it as it is. Of course things will be done in a different way. It is a new world. There is no switching the clock back on anything. New challenges, new ideas. But ours can be, and will be, a great radical, reforming government, giving Britain the welfare state it needs in the 21st century.The great reforms should not stop with the welfare state. Let us modernise government itself so that it serves the interests of the people. (Applause) Not bigger government; better government. So local people decide how to run local services. A parliament for Scotland, an assembly for Wales, legislated for in the first year of a Labour government. And let me say this to you - achievable precisely because we will have the clear consent of the Scottish and Welsh people before doing it. (Applause) A directly elected authority for London, our capital city. (Applause) Local democracy reborn, the quango state in the dustbin of history where it belongs. (Applause)More than that. Today I can make another announcement on our plans for the National Lottery. It has been a great success, but has all the money gone to good causes? No. We want to fund specific environment, education and public health projects through the proceeds of the National Lottery. I want the people\u2019s money to go on the people's priorities. (Applause) Equipping all our teachers to use the new technology that will improve children\u2019s education; working with the voluntary sector; insulating homes; supporting national talent and potential; reclaiming public space for pedestrians. The millennium stream of lottery money, one-fifth of the total, should be focused on giving Britain a head start in the 21st century, and under us it will be.There is more that we can do with government. If Clem Attlee came back today he would think pretty much everything was changed, including a few things about this, I suppose. But not the way that we run government or Parliament. We spend £300 billion a year in the public sector. But a lot of what government does is not about helping us achieve; it is actually stopping us achieving. If you are a young person, for example, leaving school, leaving home, looking for a job, you have to contact 11 government offices, not one. Finding care for an elderly relative can take four stops, not one. It can take you two weeks to get your first Income Support payment, and then one in seven will be wrong. It takes a month to get your first Child Benefit cheque. A small engineering firm in Blackpool spends as much on dealing with inspectors as it would hiring an extra member of staff. And it is getting worse.The fraud in the system? Probably as much as £8 billion a year or more. We will therefore make it a priority to introduce a programme to reform this system of government. Our aim is to co-ordinate services across government departments, using the advantages of the technology now available to provide a modern and up-to-date service for the customers of the state. Government for the people, not government for government. (Applause)But we should reform Parliament too. One reform we have already achieved - more women Members of Parliament than ever before. (Applause) Another we can - reforming Prime Minister\u2019s Question Time so that it actually does Parliament credit; ending the greatest symbol of privilege of any democracy in the world by ensuring that hereditary peers are not voting in the House of Lords. (Applause)We will clean up the political funding in Britain. It is surely right we know where these types of money come from. I simply say that it is important that we ensure that everyone recognises their responsibility to make our politics better.The age of achievement, at home and abroad. We will be strong in defence, in NATO, with our allies the United States; we will be the bridge across the Atlantic between them and Europe. But we will also fight for democracy and civil rights the world over. (Applause) There is no greater pride to me than our total unequivocal, unrelenting battle to end apartheid and see Nelson Mandela freed from his chains. So we salute the Bob Hugheses, the Joan Lestors, the Neil and Glenys Kinnocks who played their part in that, and we put to one side the nausea we felt at those Tories who had propped up apartheid and worn shirts calling for Nelson Mandela to be hanged - yes, hanged - then flocked to be seen with him. (Applause)Imagine Britain a leading player in Europe once more, a force for good promoting democracy and civil rights and free trade between nations, dealing with the debt burden at the heart of any strategy for overseas development, helping fashion the United Nations and the institutions of international co-operation for a new world.It can happen. It can happen. The British people want change; I am sure of that. But they need to trust us. I want them to trust us.Recently, the boss of one of Britain\u2019s biggest and most successful companies said to me that companies do not just have prospectuses, they have performance contracts too: a contract that sets out targets and priorities and allows public and company to measure success or failure. And he dared me to publish a performance contract for a new Labour government. Today I do that. These are the vows that I make to my country.By the end of the term of a five-year Labour government:This is my covenant with the British people. Judge me upon it. The buck stops here. For the future, not the past, for the many, not the few, for trust, not betrayal, for the age of achievement, not the age of decline - that is my covenant with the British people.I can make this promise - I can make it because you have helped me transform our party into a great party of reform for the modern age. Four hundred thousand members, and growing! A new constitution that we can actually, leader included, quote in our speeches. A party open and in touch. New Labour, new members. And I am proud of them. But let me say this to you. I don\u2019t forget that this party only survived for new members to join because the old members stuck with it through thick and thin. (Applause)Let me try to explain this to you. I was not born Labour, I became Labour. When you look back on your past you try to think of the things that shaped you. My father was a very ambitious man. He was ambition personified, successful, he was a go-getter. One morning I woke to be told that he had had a stroke in the middle of the night and might not live through the day. My whole world then fell apart. And it taught me something. It taught me the value of the family, because my mother worked for three years to help him talk and walk again. But it taught me something else too. When that happened the fair-weather friends went; that is not unusual. But the real friends, the true friends, stayed with us; they helped us and they stuck with us for no other reason than that it was the right thing to do.I do not pretend to you that I had a deprived childhood; I did not. But I learned a sense of values in my childhood. A year ago or more, John Prescott and I went up to Sam McCluskie\u2019s funeral. A lot of you will remember Sam McCluskie, he was a great guy, great stalwart of the Labour movement. I think it would be fair to say that we did not always absolutely agree on everything! And as I left the church service, one of the sisters came up to me and pressed a little strip of red ribbon into my hand - it is something I keep with me still - and said this is a keepsake that Sam used to have and I want you to have it. I was embarrassed and I turned round to her and said look, I didn\u2019t know Sam that well and, quite honestly, a lot of the time we didn\u2019t see eye to eye. And she said to me I know that, but in your souls you want the same thing, a better world.That is it. That is what we believe in. Yes, we are a democratic socialist party. Indeed, it says so in the words of Clause IV, the new Clause IV, the one I drafted and the party overwhelmingly supported. (Applause) But it stands in a tradition bigger than that - bigger than European social democracy, bigger than any \u2018ism,\u2019 bigger than any of us. It stands in a tradition whose flame was alive in human hearts long before the Labour Party was ever thought of; a tradition far above ideology but not beyond ideals.We are not a sect or a cult. We are part of the broad movement of human progress, the marriage of ambition with justice, the constant striving of the human spirit to do better, to be better. It is that which separates us from the Conservatives. And it was there long ago, there even when the ancient prophets of the Old Testament first pleaded the cause of the marginal, the powerless, the disenfranchised. It was there when Wilberforce fought the slave trade against the vested interests of Tory money. It was there when the trade union movement began as an instrument against abuse in the work place. It was there when the young Jack Jones went to fight in the Spanish civil war for another people\u2019s freedom out of nothing more than the goodness of his heart. (Applause)It was there when we said, having conquered the evil of Hitler, that the welfare state must be built so that the destitution of the 30s never returned to our country. And it is here now, in this room, as we build around the Labour Party the new force for progress in British politics to bring in the new age of achievement for all our people. A thousand days - yes - to prepare for that thousand years.Consider a thousand years of British history and what it tells us. The first parliament of the world, the industrial revolution ahead of its time, an empire, the largest the world has ever known, relinquished in peace, the invention of virtually every scientific device of the modern world, two World Wars in which our country was bled dry, in which two generations perished but which in the defeat of the most evil force ever let loose by man showed the most sustained example of bravery in human history.This is our nation, our characteristics - common sense, standing up for the underdog, fiercely independent. But the outstanding British quality is courage - not just physical bravery but the courage to think anew, to break convention when convention is holding us back, to innovate while others conform; to do it our way. I say to the British people: have the courage to change now. We are coming home to you. We are back as the party of the people, and that is why the people are coming back to us. When Alan Howarth has the courage to tear up the ties of a lifetime because he can no longer stomach today\u2019s Tory party and he sees his home as new Labour, I say welcome to him, and welcome to those others. (Applause)When businessmen say to me, \u2018Tony, I never thought I\u2019d be doing this but here\u2019s a big cheque to help you beat the most dishonest, negative campaign in history,\u2019 I say thank you to them. We need that. (Applause) And when former Tory voters write and tell me they never thought in a million years that they would vote Labour but they hate the Tories and they think we are worth more than a shot, I write back and say welcome, thank you. Thank you for giving us that chance. Thank you for seeing the changes we have made are real. Thank you for having the courage to change your vote. And when a 76 year-old widow from Liverpool, a party member since before I was born, sends me a Christmas card that says \u2018Tony, please, for me, win,\u2019 then I tell you we have a duty to win, a duty for her and millions like her. (Applause)I don\u2019t care where you are coming from; it is where your country is going that matters. If you believe in what I believe, then join our team. Labour has come home to you, so come home to us. Labour\u2019s coming home! (Applause) Seventeen years of hurt never stopped us dreaming. Labour\u2019s coming home! (Applause) As we did in 1945 and 1964, I know that was then, but it could be again \u2013 Labour\u2019s coming home. (Applause) Labour\u2019s coming home.The people are coming home. Because Britain is their team and they are part of it, and they know that if we unleash the potential of our people Britain comes alive with the new energy, the new ideas, the new leadership, and Britain can take on the world and win. We will be envied throughout the world, not just because of our castles and our palaces and our glorious history, but because we gave back that heritage of hope to the generations, we turned round this country by the will of the people in unity with the party of the people, and we built this age of achievement in our lifetime.This is our mission for Britain today. We knew we could do better. And we did. We knew we could be better, we the Labour Party. And we are. Britain, too, can do better. Britain can be better than this. A thousand days to prepare for a thousand years - not just turning a page in history but writing a new book, building the greatness of our nation through the greatness of its people. Think of the possibility of change. No more squandering the nation\u2019s assets. No more sleaze. No more cash for questions. No more lies. No more broken promises. I say to the Tories: enough is enough! Be done, be gone! (Applause) The glory days of Britain are not over, but the Tory days of government are. (Applause)We have the programme. We have the people to make decent change in our country. Let us call our nation now to its destiny. Let us lead it to our new age of achievement and build for us, for our children, their children, a Britain - a Britain united to win in the 21st century. (Prolonged applause)

aVAfter 18 long years of Opposition, of frustration and despair, I am proud, privileged, to stand before you as the new Labour Prime Minister of our country. I believe in Britain. I believe in the British people. One cross on the ballot paper. One nation was reborn.Today I want to set an ambitious course for this country. To be nothing less than the model 21st century nation, a beacon to the world. It means drawing deep into the richness of the British character. Creative. Compassionate. Outward-looking. Old British values, but a new British confidence. We can never be the biggest. We may never again be the mightiest. But we can be the best. The best place to live. The best place to bring up children, the best place to lead a fulfilled life, the best place to grow old.14 years ago our Party was written off as history. This year we made it. Let our first thanks be to the British people. You kept faith with us. And we will keep faith with you. Thank you to the Party organisation, the volunteers, the professionals who fashioned the finest political fighting machine anywhere in the world. And thanks to those that led before me. To Neil Kinnock: the mantle of Prime Minister was never his. But I know that without him, it would never have been mine. To John Smith: who left us a fine legacy, and to whom we can now leave a fitting monument - a Scottish Parliament in the city where he lived, serving the country he loved and the people who loved him. To Jim Callaghan: who was attending Labour Party Conferences before I was born; and by the look of him, will be attending long after I\u2019ve gone. My own debt of honour to Michael Foot: you led this Party when, frankly, it was incapable of being led and without ever losing a shred of your decency or your integrity. Thank you.I should also say a final word of thanks to the Tory Party. Let\u2019s be honest, we\u2019d never have done so well without them. So thanks to Michael Howard, to John Redwood, to Peter Lilley, to Brian Mawhinney. Of course, it\u2019s a fresh start now - with Michael Howard, John Redwood, Peter Lilley, Brian Mawhinney. Sorry \u2013 \u2018Sir\u2019 Brian Mawhinney - knighted for services to the Conservative Party. John Prescott wanted to give him a peerage - for services to the Labour Party.As for Government, well, it beats the hell out of Opposition. They really do say \u2018Yes, Prime Minister.\u2019 You have to learn a whole new language. They\u2019re not in the habit of calling anything a good idea, which given the last 18 years is hardly surprising. When they describe a proposal as \u2018ambitious,\u2019 or, even worse, \u2018interesting,\u2019 what they really mean is they think it was a stupid idea, dreamed up at the last minute for the manifesto. When they describe it as \u2018challenging,\u2019 they mean there's not a hope in hell of making it work. And when they say of a policy \u2018that it really is quite a brave proposal Prime Minister,\u2019 it means they\u2019ve got the doctor outside waiting to sign the certificates and they\u2019ve just applied for a transfer to a senior job administering one of our few remaining dependent territories.It\u2019s not the titles and the cars and the trappings that make government worthwhile. It\u2019s letters like this from 11 year old Emma O\u2019Brien from Ellesmere Port. \u2018Summer School was a good idea. I have started to read more books. I have learned more spellings. We\u2019ve had fun. All of us have made new friends. I think you and parliament have done the right thing. I have got a better education.\u2019 Or this one from Mrs Patricia Lewis, of South London. \u2018Each afternoon I collected him from school. By the fourth day the change was showing in Stephen. His enthusiasm grew, confidence gained, his ability to read, write, spell, speak, and question politely, was amazing.\u2019 That is why we are here. That is what made winning worth the fight.Ours was not a victory of politicians but of people. The people took their trust, and gave it to us. I want them to say, this week as they watch us here in Brighton: we did the right thing. I want the British people to be as proud of having elected us as we are to serve them. We won because we are New Labour, because we had the courage to change ourselves, and the discipline to take hard decisions, whilst remaining united. The lessons we learned in Opposition we carry on applying in Government. The moment we stop that is the moment we will stop being in government. Even now, especially now, no complacency.I know I\u2019m obsessive about this. But I will admit now that I perhaps went over the top when I phoned Millbank Tower on election night to say people were behaving as though it was in the bag. \u2018Look,\u2019 I was told, \u2018We\u2019ve got 150 seats. The Tories have got 6. It\u2019s hard to persuade the media this thing\u2019s on a knife edge.\u2019 But still, no complacency.May 1st was the beginning, not the end. We have never won two full consecutive terms of office. Never. That is one more record I want to break. No cockiness about the Tories even now. They\u2019re not dead. Just sleeping.Let their fate serve as a warning to us. What the people give, the people can take away. We are the servants. They are the masters now. To govern Britain is a privilege not a right. Never forget it.Last year we were talking about what we would do. This year we\u2019re doing it. That ten point contract with the British people - we are honouring.We said we would get more money into schools and hospitals. We have - 2.2 billion more than Tories planned to spend next year.We said we\u2019d sign the Social Chapter. We did.We said we\u2019d restore trade unions at GCHQ. On May 19, free and independent trade unions came back to GCHQ.We said we\u2019d set up a Low Pay Commission. We have, and the national minimum wage is on its way.We said we\u2019d legislate to release the money from selling council homes in order to house the homeless. We\u2019ve done it.We said we\u2019d cut class sizes, by scrapping the Assisted Places Scheme. The law to do it has been passed.We\u2019ve given the people of Scotland and Wales the devolution referendums we promised, and they have voted: yes, yes, and yes again.We said we\u2019d reform the Lottery to address the people\u2019s priorities. We have, and today more proposals on how we'll reform it further and get more money to more local projects, the length and breadth of Britain, preparing for the millennium.We said we\u2019d cut VAT on fuel. We have.We never said we\u2019d cut corporation tax. But we did anyway, to the lowest level it\u2019s ever been. And we have brought Britain's top business brains right into the heart of Government.And we said we\u2019d force the water companies to give a better deal to their customers. A few hours of quiet diplomacy by Mr John Prescott did the necessary, and the companies did the business.We owed a debt to the people of Dunblane. We said MPs would vote to ban handguns. MPs have had that vote. The people have spoken. Parliament has spoken. Handguns are banned. We have honoured our debt.We said we\u2019d ban landmines. They\u2019re banned in Britain and we\u2019ll keep working until they are banned the world over.Of all we have done, ask me what has taken the most time, the most effort, it\u2019s probably Northern Ireland. There is no tougher job in Government than Northern Ireland Secretary, and there is no better person to do it than Mo Mowlam. The effort has been worth it. The cease-fire has been renewed. Republicans and Unionists are talking for the first time since 1921. There is a long, long way to go. Every step is fragile. But in the name of humanity, I ask that ancient enmities be put aside. Talking is no treachery. Agreeing is no betrayal. The real betrayal would be to let violence take the place of democracy in Northern Ireland again.But I want to do more than keep our promises. I sense the British people demand more of us, too. People ask me the highlight of the election. Mine was driving from home to Buckingham Palace, along streets we had driven hundreds of times, past soulless buildings and sullen faces on their way to work. This drive was so different. As we turned into Gower Street, people watching our journey on TV came pouring out of the doorways, waving and shouting and clapping, with an energy and excitement that went beyond anything I imagined would happen. They were liberated. Theirs were the smiles of tolerant, broad-minded, outward-looking, compassionate people and suddenly they learned that they were in the majority after all. As one woman put it to me: \u2018We\u2019ve got our Government back.\u2019 And with them I could sense confidence returning to the British people, compassion to the British soul, unity to the British nation, and that all three would give us new-found strength. The people were yearning for change in their country, at a time when they could see we had had the guts to modernise our party. The two came together. The result is a quiet revolution now taking place. Led by the real modernisers - the British people.The size of our victory imposes a very special responsibility on us. To be a government of high ideals and hard choices. Not popular for one time but remembered for all time. Not just a better government than the Tories but one of the great, radical, reforming Governments of our history. To modernise Britain as we modernised the Labour Party. To build a Britain, not for a few, but for all the people. And it will require change. Hard choices. I know this country can make them if we show how and why.The British don\u2019t fear change. We are one of the great innovative peoples. From the Magna Carta to the first Parliament to the industrial revolution to an empire that covered the world; most of the great inventions of modern times with Britain stamped on them: the telephone; the television; the computer; penicillin; the hovercraft; radar. Change is in the blood and bones of the British we are by our nature and tradition innovators, adventurers, pioneers. As our great poet of renewal and recovery, John Milton, put it, we are \u2018A nation not slow or dull, but of quick, ingenious and piercing spirit, acute to invent, subtle and sinewy to discourse, not beneath the reach of any point that human capacity can soar to.\u2019Even today, we lead the world, in design, pharmaceuticals, financial services, telecommunications. We have the world\u2019s first language. Britain today is an exciting, inspiring place to be. And it can be much more. If we face the challenge of a world with its finger on the fast forward button; where every part of the picture of our life is changing. Today I say to the British people: the chains of mediocrity have broken, the tired days are behind us, we are free to excel once more. We are free to build that model 21st Century nation, to become that beacon to the world.Creative. Compassionate. Confident of our place in the world.And when people say sorry, that\u2019s too ambitious, it can\u2019t be done, I say: this is not a sorry country, we are not a sorry people. It can be done. We know what makes a successful creative economy. Educate the people. Manage the country\u2019s finances well. Encourage business and enterprise. But each bit requires us to modernise and take the hard choices to do it. We have been a mercantile power. An industrial power. Now we must be the new power of the information age. Our goal: to make Britain the best educated and skilled country in the world; a nation, not of a few talents, but of all the talents. And every single part of our schools system must be modernised to achieve it.Nearly 40 per cent of 11 year olds can\u2019t read, write or add up properly. 42nd in the world education league. This is the scandalous legacy not just of 18 years of Tory Government but of a country too often content to educate the elite and ignore education for all. Education, education, education. Remember? In just 5 months, we made a remarkable beginning, under the brilliant leadership of David Blunkett. But we will do more.Equipping our schoolsWe are publishing today details of agreements involving Government and the private sector, for the biggest public/private partnership in any education system, anywhere in the world, which will mean:By 2002 every one of the 32,000 schools in Britain will have modern computers, the educational programmes to go on them, the teachers skilled to teach on them, the pupils skilled to use them, connected to the superhighway for free and with phone bills slashed to as low as £1 per pupil per year.We are setting a new target of £2 billion for this parliament for our school repairs and equipment programme. A list of the first 2,300 schools to benefit is being published today. The money is being allocated today. One of the head-teachers is here with us. By 2002 up to 10,000 schools will have benefited.Getting the basics rightWe are launching the biggest assault on poor literacy and numeracy standards this country has seen. We are setting a target of 80% up to the standard in literacy, 75% for numeracy by the year 2002, and we\u2019ll keep on until every 11 year old in every school in every part of Britain gets the start in life that they deserve. And I repeat the promise I made at the election, that over the lifetime of this parliament, we will reverse the Tory policy of cutting spending on education as a proportion of our national income and raise it once again, beginning with £1billion extra next year.Nursery vouchers have gone and instead we\u2019ll get nursery places for all four year olds and we\u2019re on the way to places for all three year olds too. The money will be there, but in return hard choices and modernisation. No failure. No muddling through. No second best. High standards. The pursuit of excellence. Discipline and leadership. Support from home. Not for some children in some schools. But for all children in all schools. Each school that needs it, and every LEA, will be set targets for improvement. Failing schools and LEAs will be taken over. Teacher training will be reformed. Head teachers will have a proper qualification. Poor teachers will go.People say my job\u2019s pressurised. So is teaching. And don\u2019t let anybody think that we are tough on bad teaching because we don\u2019t value teachers. We are tough on bad teachers precisely because we DO value good teachers who need high quality teachers working alongside them. And parents have to play their part. There will be home school contracts for all pupils. Sign them. There will be new measures to tackle truancy and disruptive children, new homework requirements. Support them. When a school disciplines a child, back the teacher. The high ideal of the best schools in the world. Reached through hard choices.Universities in Britain had their funding cut by 40% per student under the Tories. The science and research base - once the envy of the world - under threat. The Tories put a cap on student numbers. Only 30% of youngsters in Britain admitted to go to university. Fewer not just than France or the USA, but fewer than South Korea. The hard choice: stay as we are and decline. Or modernise and win. Under our proposals, no parent will have to pay more. Low income families will be entirely exempt from tuition fees. All students will repay only as they can afford to.And if we reform, I am going to pledge to you, that by the end of this parliament, we will put resources saved through reform into frontline provision in universities and further education; and the first 165 million pounds is already in next year\u2019s budgets. We will lift the cap on student numbers and set a target for an extra 500,000 people into higher and further education by 2002. Our education system - a beacon to the world.Within days of taking office, we took one of the hardest choices of all: we gave the Bank of England the right to decide interest rates and take the politics out of mortgages. And in the short term it\u2019s tough. Interest rates have gone up. But I say to people, better to go up now, still only by 1%, than to go back to the days of the last Tory government when mortgages were at 15% for a year, 1 million homes in negative equity, a whole swathe of industry wiped out. We are cutting the Tory deficit too. We are sorting out the public finances. Borrow only for investment. Hold debt down. Earn before you spend. Don\u2019t live on tick. I want this to be the New Labour Government that ended Tory boom and bust for ever.Twenty years ago, the IMF came to bury us. Now they come to praise us. Yes, new Labour\u2019s got new friends everywhere. I want Britain to be a country of enterprise and ambition where small businesses grow, manufacturing and engineering revive, where we learn the lessons of British industrial relations over the past 100 years. Fairness at work yes. But flexibility will remain. For business, this will be a Government on your side not in your way. And I say to both sides of industry, there is no place for militant trade unionism or uncaring management today. Partnership is the key. That is the only language this New Labour Government will respect.It\u2019s pretty simple the type of country I want. It\u2019s a country where our children are proud and happy to grow up in, feeling good not just about themselves, but about the community around them. I don\u2019t want them living in a country where some of them go to school, hungry, unable to learn because their parents can\u2019t afford to feed them; where they can see drugs being traded at school gates; where gangs of teenagers hang around street corners, nothing to do, but spit and swear and abuse passers-by; I don\u2019t want them brought up in a country where the only way pensioners can get long-term care is by selling their home, where people who fought to keep that country free are now faced every winter with the struggle for survival, skimping and saving, cold and alone, waiting for death to take them. And I will not rest until that country is gone and all our children live in a Britain where no child goes hungry, the young are employed, and the old are cherished and valued to the end of their days.But let me spell out some facts. After eighteen years of Tory Government, of cuts and closures, of declining public services, the country was taxed more than under the last Labour Government. This country, any country, will not just carry on paying out more in taxes and getting less. Our new society will have the same values as it ever did. Fighting poverty and unemployment. Securing justice and opportunity. It should be a compassionate society. But it is compassion with a hard edge. A strong society cannot be built on soft choices. It means fundamental reform of our welfare state, of the deal between citizen and society. It means getting money out of social breakdown and into schools and hospitals where we want to see it.The new welfare state must encourage work, not dependency. We are giving young people and the long-term unemployed the opportunity. A £3.5 billion investment. We are adding today the option of self employment as part of the new deal. But they have to take one of the options on offer. We want single mothers with school age children at least to visit a job centre, not just stay at home waiting for the benefit cheque every week until the children are sixteen. Modern welfare means a better balance between public and private money. We need to invest more as a country in savings and pensions. But government\u2019s role is going to be to organise provision - like new stakeholder pensions not fund it all through ever-higher taxes. And our number one duty is to get help to the poorest pensioners first.Housing benefit, in some areas, is virtually designed for fraud. It has to change. We will not be that beacon to the world in the year 2005 with a welfare state built for the very different world of 1945. Our tax system should reward hard work. In the 80s the Tories took down high marginal tax rates for high earners. It is time we did the same for Britain\u2019s working poor.And the same drive for reform applies to the NHS. I\u2019m tired of hearing the NHS described as if it were a relic. It isn\u2019t. It was the greatest act of modernisation any Labour Government ever did. My vision is not just to save the NHS but make it better. The money will be there. I promise you that. This year. Every year. Millions saved from red tape, millions more into breast cancer treatment already. The values will remain. From next April, the two-tier NHS of the Tories will go. And I tell you. I will never countenance an NHS that departs from its fundamental principle of health care based on need not wealth. The hospitals will be built. 14 of them, the biggest hospital building programme in the history of the NHS. It will mean an extra £1.3 billion in 14 towns and cities serving 5 million people. And as of today, it is 15.But money is not the only problem with healthcare in Britain. The NHS itself needs modernisation and hard choices.We appointed the first Minister for Public Health because the NHS should not lose millions every year because of avoidable illnesses like those from smoking. Barriers between GPs, social services and hospitals must be broken down. Hospitals cannot stand still. Increasingly, general hospitals will provide routine care, supported by specialist centres of excellence in treatment, research and education. GPs and nurses will do more of what hospitals used to do, often working on the same site in partnership with chemists, dentists, opticians and physiotherapists.New technology offers huge opportunities in healthcare but we haven\u2019t yet begun to seize them properly. We will get the money in. But in return, I want reform. From next April, there will be up to ten specially-funded Health Action Zones set up in Britain. Their remit: to experiment with new ideas in the way healthcare is delivered, so that patients get a better deal from their health service for the 21st century. The NHS was a beacon to the world in 1948. I want it to be so again. It will always be safe with us. But I want it to be better with us.I say to the country in all honesty. You can have the education revolution, the health revolution, the welfare revolution. But it means hard choices. It means us all getting involved. And it means modernisation. And we need to bring a change to the way we treat each other. I tell you: a decent society is not based on rights. It is based on duty. Our duty to each other. To all should be given opportunity, from all responsibility demanded. The duty to show respect and tolerance to others. I make no apology. I back zero tolerance on crime. I back powers to tackle anti-social neighbours; to make parents responsible for their children; to overhaul the youth justice system so that youngsters stop thinking they can commit a crime, get a caution and carry on being a criminal. At every level of the fight against crime - today acting on serious organised crime - this New Labour Government is taking it on. It will take time. And it will be tough. But to those who say it\u2019s all a threat to our civil liberties, I say the threat to civil liberties is of women afraid to go out, and pensioners afraid to stay at home, because of crime and the fear of crime, and we\u2019re going to help them.And we cannot say we want a strong and secure society when we ignore its very foundation: family life. This is not about preaching to individuals about their private lives. It is addressing a huge social problem. Attitudes have changed. The world has changed. But I am a modern man leading a modern country and this is a modern crisis. Nearly 100,000 teenage pregnancies every year. Elderly parents with whom families cannot cope. Children growing up without role models they can respect and learn from. More and deeper poverty. More crime. More truancy. More neglect of educational opportunities. And above all more unhappiness. I give you this pledge. Every area of this Government\u2019s policy will be scrutinised to see how it affects family life. Every policy examined, every initiative tested, every avenue explored to see how we strengthen our families and there will be a Ministerial group to drive it through.Don\u2019t think we\u2019re asking everyone to change but not Government itself. We will publish a White Paper in the new year for what we call Simple Government, to cut the bureaucracy of Government and improve its service. We are setting a target that within five years, one quarter of dealings with Government can be done by a member of the public electronically through their television, telephone or computer. Our politics are being reformed. We will deliver the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly after one hundred years of trying, and I say to the House of Lords, before it is reformed, don\u2019t try to wreck this legislation: we have the votes of the people, you\u2019ve got the votes of nobody.We will have a strategic authority and elected Mayor for London if the people vote for it. I can announce to you we are going to bring forward a Bill to ban foreign donations to political parties and to compel all parties to make contributions above £5,000 public. And we will ask the Nolan Committee to look at the wider question of Party funding. At the next election all political parties will at last compete on a level playing field. And I know some of you are a bit nervous about what I am doing with the Liberal Democrats. Though not half as nervous as they are. Since this is a day for honesty, I\u2019ll tell you: my heroes aren\u2019t just Ernie Bevin, Nye Bevan and Attlee. They are also Keynes, Beveridge, Lloyd George. Division among radicals almost one hundred years ago resulted in a 20th century dominated by Conservatives. I want the 21st century to be the century of the radicals.We cannot be a beacon to the world unless the talents of all the people shine through. Not one black High Court Judge; not one black Chief Constable or Permanent Secretary. Not one black Army officer above the rank of Colonel. Not one Asian either. Not a record of pride for the British establishment. And not a record of pride for the British Parliament that there are so few black and Asian MPs. I am against positive discrimination. But there is no harm in reminding ourselves just how much negative discrimination there is.On taking office, we discovered that the last Government planned to cut from £83m to £43m the Home Office section 11 budget and make redundant 7,000 teachers and classroom assistants who help children for whom English is a second language. Today I announce; that Tory cut will not stand. I\u2019ll tell you why. That money is not a cost, it is an investment. And it\u2019s one a civilised nation should make. A nation tolerant and open. Free from prejudice but not from rules. A beacon for good at home and abroad. There is huge interest in Britain now. Because people know that this is a country changing for the better. A go-ahead place. The gates of xenophobia falling down. This Government can be the Government of enlightened patriotism.Again my vision for post-Empire Britain is clear. It is to make this country pivotal, a leader in the world. To use the strengths of our history to build our future. With the US our friend and ally. Within the Commonwealth. In the United Nations. In NATO. To use the superb reputation of our Armed Forces, not just for defence, but as an instrument of influence in a world of collective security and cooperation. And to lead in Europe again. Not so that we \u2018don't get left behind.\u2019 That is a weak reason. It is because for four centuries or more, we have been a leading power in Europe. And we have at times been absolutely critical to the survival of not just Europe but the world. It is our destiny.And Europe needs us. For we have a vision of Europe. We want a people\u2019s Europe: free trade, industrial strength, high levels of employment and social justice, democratic. Against that vision is the bureaucrat\u2019s Europe: the Europe of thwarting open trade, unnecessary rules and regulations, the Europe of the C.A.P. and the endless committees leading nowhere. But we cannot shape Europe unless we matter in Europe. I know there will be a hard choice to come over a single currency. And our policy, based on the British national interest, remains unchanged. But in or out, we will be affected by it and must remain able to influence the way it works. Next year Britain now takes on the Presidency of the EU and it will do so as, once again, a respected leading European nation. That is an achievement of the new Labour government of which I am proud.And elsewhere too, new respect and influence. In tackling Third World debt. On the environment. Today in London the Government\u2019s Chief Scientific Adviser is issuing a report on global warming which I commissioned on coming into government. Read it and you will see why I am so passionate in my commitment to action not just in Britain but throughout the world, which is why we will take that action and get the rest of the world to take that action too. So much to do. So much to change. So hard to do it. But the vision is as old as humanity.Modernisation is not an end in itself. It is for a purpose.Modernisation is not the enemy of justice, but its ally.Progress and justice are the two rocks upon which the New Britain is raised to the heights. Lose either one and we come crashing down until we are just another average nation, scrabbling around for salvation in the ebbing tide of the 20th Century.That is why we changed the Labour Party. To make New Britain. It is why we will carry on changing. It is why it was right yesterday to take another historic step on the road to reform of our Party so that never again will a Labour government be torn about by divisions between leadership in Parliament and Party in the country. Yes, we are New Labour. Yes, our policies and attitudes have changed. But there are no Old Labour or New Labour values. There are Labour values. They are what make us the Party of compassion; of social justice; of the struggle against poverty and inequality; of liberty; of basic human solidarity; and the day we cease to be those things is the day we keep the name of the Labour Party but lose the reason for its existence. And these are indeed the best of British values too. The point of modern Britain is not to dishonour the past. But to honour it by improving it, by taking the best of it and adding to it. Ours is a simple enough vision. But it will require a supreme national effort. It is a task for a whole people, not just a government.Great challengesBut great rewards for all of us if we rise to them as we can. As one nation. Held together by our values and by the strength of our character. We are a giving people. In the face of crisis or challenge we pull together, strengthened by unity. It says nothing about our politics. It speaks volumes about our character. You remember how your parents, like mine, used to say to you: Just do your best. Well let\u2019s do our best.On May 1, the people entrusted me with the task of leading their country into a new century. That was your challenge to me. Proudly, humbly, I accepted it. Today, I issue a challenge to you. Help us make Britain that beacon shining throughout the world. Unite behind our mission to modernise our country. There is a place for all the people in New Britain, and there is a role for all the people in its creation. Believe in us as much as we believe in you. Give just as much to our country as we intend to give. Give your all. Make this the giving age. \u2018By the strength of our common endeavour we achieve more together than we can alone.\u2019On 1st May 1997, it wasn\u2019t just the Tories who were defeated. Cynicism was defeated. Fear of change was defeated. Fear itself was defeated. Did I not say it would be a battle of hope against fear? On 1st May 1997, fear lost. Hope won. The Giving Age began.Now make the good that is in the heart of each of us, serve the good of all of us. Give to our country the gift of our energy, our ideas, our hopes, our talents. Use them to build a country each of whose people will say that \u2018I care about Britain because I know that Britain cares about me.\u2019 Britain, head and heart, can be unbeatable. That is the Britain I offer you. That is the Britain that together can be ours.

aVThank you very much indeed and thank you, Richard, for that very kind introduction. One of the oddest things, talking about foreign countries, is that when you become Prime Minister, the first thing they do \u2013 that\u2019s after they tell you how to launch the nuclear bomb - is to take your passport away from you. Seriously! Then they spend the rest of the time trying to take you travelling around the world. You have to be very careful. I do not know whether you remember seeing me make the speech to the French National Assembly in French. It went well and I got a bit cocky and the next time I was with the French Prime Minister, I agreed to do the press conference in 'French. Half way through the conference I got my French muddled up and instead of saying: \u2018I admire Lionel Jospin in many different ways.\u2019 (laughter) I announced to the people of France: \u2018I desire Lionel Jospin in many different positions.\u2019 (Applause) Still, the French are quite relaxed about that sort of thing. (Laughter)A book I was reading recently told me about Philip of Macedonia who was a ruler many thousands of years ago. He employed a bloke who had a stick with a pig\u2019s bladder on the end of it. The sole job of this bloke was to walk into Philip\u2019s quarters, at any hour of the day or night, and belt him on the head with it, to tell him that he was only mortal and shouldn\u2019t get above himself. (Laughter) What do I need a bloke with a stick and a pig\u2019s bladder for? I've got John Prescott \u2013 he\u2019s much better. (Applause and laughter) I\u2019m afraid history doesn\u2019t tell us who Philip of Macedonia\u2019s deputy was, but I bet he wasn\u2019t half as good as my deputy. (Applause)Friends, this, year will be the year of challenge. Last year we celebrated victory. This year we meet in more mature and sober reflection. We have pride in what we have done, but we have the wisdom to accept there is much more to do. No longer novices in government, we carry more visibly its burdens and responsibilities. As Mario Cuomo once said: \u2018In politics we campaign in poetry, but we govern in prose.\u2019Work is in progress. After years of rising health service waiting lists, in May, in June, in July, month by month they are falling - a pledge kept by this Labour government. (Applause)For ten Tory years, class sizes rose. Today the latest figures are published. They show that already, this September, over 100,000 more children aged five, six and seven are in class sizes under 30 under this Labour government. (Applause)The New Deal is up and running and 140,000 young men and women are on it. For years in opposition we railed against youth unemployment. Now, in government, in that first year it is down by more than a third since the election. That is a Labour government delivering for the people of this country. (Applause)Over these next three years, £40 billion extra will go into our schools and hospitals - a figure every one of you should never tire of repeating - and with it comes 15,000 more nurses, 6,000 more nursing trainees, 7,000 more doctors. The £8 billion programme to build and renovate hospitals, modernise surgeries and get patients treated more quickly.Every school being wired up to the Internet. 500,000 young people over three years to go into higher and further education. The school building programme: 7,000 schools already benefiting from it. New investment in literacy and numeracy.And today, because we changed the law on how lottery money could be used, we can announce an extra £400 million for specialist health, education and environment projects, starting with a nation-wide programme to make our cancer services the best anywhere in the world. (Applause)We have done more than we ever promised and where we have made promises, we are keeping them. Where we are accused of breaking them, it is over promises we never made. Yet this is a country rightly with very great expectations of us. People are posing questions far more fundamental than about what is in the manifesto. They ask: \u2018How can I be sure about my job, about my family\u2019s safety, about the future prosperity of my country?\u2019This is the challenge of this year of challenge. Finding security and stability in a world pushed ever faster by the irresistible forces of history and human invention. A world so fast, so competitive that today 90 per cent of new products are off the market within two years of being launched. Markets so powerful that they trade literally every day $1.3 trillion, more than the reserves of every country in the world put together. A world where 40 of the top 100 economies today are not countries by companies and a world where the spectre of global economic crisis - 25 per cent of the world in recession - now leaps on the back of change, spinning the world ever faster.It is as if capitalism had found its own version of the permanent revolution and with it traditional society fractured and torn. Getting out to work, making ends meet, bringing up kids, looking after an elderly mum or dad - it isn\u2019t easy. The change is profound. The challenge is real and there are only three choices: resist change - futile; let it happen - laissez-faire - each person for themselves, each country for itself; or, the third way, we manage change, together. We accept the challenge of the future but we refuse to consider ourselves powerless to overcome it. Modernise, reform, equip our country for the future. This way we face the challenge together and if the spirit of the nation is willing, it can make the body of the nation strong. One nation, one community, each and every one of us playing our part.So I challenge business: you are the wealth creators; vital to the success of everything we do. We will work in partnership with you as a pro-business, pro-enterprise government pursuing policies for the long-term. But be honest: your fundamental problem is not high interest rates or a high pound. It is too few first class managers, too little investment, too little productivity, too much instability in economic management. (Applause)What we inherited was not the golden legacy of Tory propaganda but the shiny gold wrapping of a pre-election boomlet. Inside was the reality: productivity 20-40 per cent beneath that of the USA, France or Germany; low investment; massive skills shortages; the science and research base of our country crumbling; above all, the hopeless addiction to boom and bust. I say to you, the very course urged on us by the Conservatives today is what gave us the 15 per cent interest rates, the disaster of Black Wednesday, the record repossessions, record job losses, record bankruptcies, record debt of the Tory years and we never want to return our country to that humiliation again. (Applause)There is only one answer to the challenge. The rock of stability, not the shifting sands of stop-go. Then we can build the future upon it - a high-tech, high-wage, high-skill, high-productivity economy. not the low-wage, low-skill route this country has taken for far too long. (Applause)So we have set a tough inflation target. We will meet it. There will be no backing down. We have taken politics out of interest rates - a tough decision, but the right decision - and there will be no backing down. We have set tough new rules on public spending and borrowing. We will stick to them - no backing down. We have an iron Chancellor and an iron commitment. To the Tories and anyone else who urges me to scrap the Bank of England's independence and intervene to devalue the pound, I say in all candour: we have sacrificed long-term strength playing that game far too often in the past. No backing down - backbone, not back down is what Britain needs. (Applause)I challenge, too, those in our schools. There is no task more important than yours, for in your hands lies the future of our children. We are rising as a government to that challenge with £19 billion extra spending. But, again, let us be honest. Money is not the only problem. There are too few good state schools, too much tolerance of mediocrity and too little pursuit of excellence. So when, later this year, we propose the most fundamental reform of the teaching profession since state education began, where there will be increased rewards, but tied to higher performance, help us get it through. Because I have been to dozens and dozens of schools since becoming leader of this party. The minute you meet the head, you know if it is a good school. If a head teacher rises to the challenge of turning round a failing school, why should they not earn £60,000 or £70,000 a year? (Applause)Equally, if they cannot run the school properly, they should not be running the school at all. (Applause) When, alongside the money, we insist that schools that fail are shut down and re­opened with a new head, that if education authorities are letting our children down we will send in rescue teams or even partnerships involving the private sector, I say, work with us to get it done. Do not tell us we are unprincipled and unjust, for there is no greater injustice to inflict upon a child than a poor education. (Applause)I challenge each and every one of us, too, over our welfare state. We are spending more but getting less, failing to help those who need it and sometimes helping those who do not. Billions are wasted every year through fraud and abuse. We have a system of unemployment benefit that still asks first not how to get people into work, but how to get them onto benefit. So when we announce today our long-term reforms of the gateway into unemployment benefit, support us.The system of disability benefits is often chaotic and unfair in their assessment and administration. A system of pensions so out of date that unless we reform, half of those retiring in 25 years time will need a means-tested benefit at some point during their retirement.I did not come into politics to dismantle the welfare state, I believe in it. But it is because I believe in its principles, its purpose, its values, that I know it needs change. So when we bring forward those proposals for change in our welfare reform bill in the coming Queen's Speech, do not tell us it is a betrayal of the welfare state when, in truth, welfare reform is the welfare state\u2019s salvation. (Applause)I challenge our health service, the greatest creation of a Labour government. You challenged us to find more money, and we have - £21 billion more. Of course we know how important it is to recruit and motivate staff, but with the money we put in must come modernisation. So when we introduce from next year long-term agreements for the delivery of services, the very first 24-tour nursing helpline, a new booking system to help patients get treated faster and when they want, a new £1 billion information technology programme, linking all the hospitals and GPs, all of which require big changes in the way the health service works, help us to get it done. When a new regime of inspections for hospitals and doctors comes in, the results are published, the failures remedied and we launch the biggest ever hospital building programme, but do it through private finance as well as public - because that is the best way to do it in the modern world - and we cap it all with a 3 per cent efficiency target so that the £21 billion actually goes to improve the service, work with us.Just remember, that 1945 Labour manifesto proposing the National Health Service wasn\u2019t called \u2018remember the past.\u2019 It was called Let us face the future and 50 years on it is time to stop preserving the National Health Service and time to start renewing it for the next 50 years. (Applause)I challenge our police officers, too. We depend on you. We salute your bravery. But we need your help. Today we are announcing an agreement between police, car manufacturers and government on a target to cut car crime by 30 per cent over five years. It is one of the boldest partnerships in fighting crime this country has seen and it is being done under a Labour government. (Applause)But we could do so much more. From tomorrow, thanks to new laws passed by this government, kids can be picked up for truancy, young children alone on the streets can be subject to curfews and parents made responsible for their children's behaviour. From April, anti-social neighbours who make life hell for people can be taken to court and punished. I say to the police, use those powers, and to the public, help the police to make them work. And when I announce today that we will be introducing, first in 20 of the worst crime spots in the country, then across the whole length of Britain, targeted policing that has cut burglary in Huddersfield by 30 per cent and crime in one. Leicester estate by almost 30 per cent, do not tell us it cannot be done, because some of you are doing it already. Do not show zero imagination. Help us to have zero tolerance of crime. That is what we need. (Applause)I challenge us too, to accept that a strong family life is the basic unit of a strong community. For strong families mean a strong Britain. It will not be done by travelling back in time. I know family life has changed, for good reasons as well as bad. But the family is central to our vision of a modern Britain, built on the kinds of rights and responsibilities we learn in the home. Responsibilities like the belief that if you father a child, that child has got something to do with you and the child\u2019s mother has every right to expect support. (Applause)In October, we are going to publish the first ever government paper on the family. It will put forward ideas to give practical support to parents and children, help in dealing with poverty, help in balancing work and family, action on domestic violence, teenage pregnancies, supporting marriage. And I challenge our media too: do not use it as an excuse to dredge through the private lives of every public figure. Accept that whatever our individual weaknesses are, our collective strength lies in making the institution of the family work for the good of Britain. (Applause)Not a single one of these challenges is easy, but we have faced already a challenge as hard as any other. Imagine the pride I felt in this country when I took a call from no less a person than Nelson Mandela, saying that Northern Ireland cast a beacon of hope across the globe. Of course, we are not there yet - decommissioning, setting up the new executive - a lot to sort out, and we will never forget the tragedy of Omagh. But it was there that the terror finally lost its power to divide and instead it unified. And how was it done? It took the British, the Irish and the Americans standing together as never before and I thank Bertie Ahern for what he has done and I thank Bill Clinton too. (Applause)It took our one and only Mo of course. (Standing ovation) I think I can say without fear of contradiction that that is the first time there has been a standing ovation in the middle of a speech - and the person getting the ovation is not even the person making the speech. (Laughter) And, of course, it took the people. Even in the final hours of those Good Friday talks, with the deadline passing, black coffee on tap, tables being thumped, exhausted bodies lying on sofas, strewn with drafts and redrafts - at 4.30 in the morning I remember standing with my back to the door saying to one side about to walk out \u2018You\u2019re not going until we have sorted this\u2019 - I could feel the will of that vast decent majority of people in Northern Ireland urging us on. The only road they really want to march down is the road to the future. (Applause)It takes people to lead them: people like David Trimble, John Hume and Seamus Mallon, and, yes, it takes Gerry Adams, David Ervine and Gary McMichael too. (Applause) It takes them to close their ears to the prejudices of their own parties and to listen to the prayers of the people for peace. Most of all, it takes us all to work together as a community; to set a course and stick to it, not get deflected; listen to criticism, but not be paralysed by it; state our destination and march with a firm step toward it, through the thickets of disillusion, the ambushes of the oppositionalists, for whom all change is betrayal and who long for our failure.It is that same spirit of determination and the power of community that should be the country\u2019s guide now in this year of challenge. And let me warn you - warn us, the Labour Party - when we make reform, people will oppose you. They will stand up at public meetings and be applauded for attacking you. When you reform welfare, they will say you are betraying the poor. When you tackle crime, it will be an affront to civil liberties. When you take on inflation, you will be destroying industry. When we give the new London Mayor the power to introduce congestion charging and invest that money in public transport, so that London, one of the greatest capital cities in the world, can get the transport system it needs, they will say we are anti-car.And the Tories will go for you with an opportunism that would make a Liberal Democrat blush (laughter and applause), like their health and education spokesmen condemning us for not spending enough, while their leader denounces us for spending too much; or the two extra-terrestrials in charge of Tory economic policy - Mr Maude and Mr Redwood - if you remember, accusing Gordon of snubbing the unions by not going to the TUC and claiming our policy on the coal industry was betraying miners\u2019 jobs. (Laughter)Yes, there will be attacks to the left of you, attacks to the right of you, attacks from behind and in front. Welcome to government. (Applause) Success in life, as you know, never comes without a struggle and this is our challenge - to hold firm, to show the same resolution in changing the country as we did when we changed the Labour Party, to do what is right.Of course we would rather be popular than unpopular, but it is better to be unpopular than wrong. (Applause) And realise this: last May they voted for new Labour, not just against the Tories. Loathing of the Tories was never enough for a landslide. They wanted a new Labour Party: not in the pocket of the trade unions; not taxing them through the roof; not chasing after every passing fad of the political fringe; but, modern, principled, in touch; tough enough to take the decisions they know in their heart of hearts are necessary for the future of Britain. Decisions the Tones ducked and, you see, you cannot say you want more people at university but oppose reform of student finance. (Applause) You cannot say you want £40 billion of extra spending on schools and hospitals and not defend the two tough years that made it possible.I am proud we had the courage to take those decisions. I am proud that it is a Labour government that has cut corporation tax to the lowest it has ever been; proud that it is under a Labour government today that long-term interest rates are at their lowest level for 30 years. I am proud, too, that after years of Tory muddle, it was this party in government that conducted the strategic defence review, the most difficult exercise in reform in our armed forces since the war and the world's foremost defence magazine called it an object lesson in modern defence capability that puts the rest of the world to shame. I am proud of that, and you should be proud of it too. (Applause)I am proud that it is a Labour government that is giving more for rural transport, more protection for village schools, shops and services than the Tories ever did. And I understand the plight of farmers. We are doing our level best to get the BSE ban lifted. We are giving public support already worth £50 for every man; woman and child in this country. We will do what we can and the way to put your case is by peaceful persuasion and no other. (Applause)Yes, we are new Labour and we are proud of it. But do not give me this nonsense that we\u2019re simply a more moderate or competent Tory government. What Tory government would ever have put £800 million into our poorest estates in order to give them a future of hope? (Applause) What Tory government would have raised-child benefit by over 20 per cent or given free eye tests to pensioners, or given four weeks' minimum holiday entitlement to Britain\u2019s workers? What Tory government would have been prepared to increase by 25 per cent our spending on art and museums, not for what the sneer squad call \u2018luvvies\u2019, but because we believe art and culture are a liberating, wonderful addition to human experience and an integral part of the country we are trying to create. (Applause)Then, you tell me what Tory government would have introduced, as we have, from 1 April next year, the first British statutory minimum wage - a pay rise for two million workers (applause) - and backed it up with the working families tax credit, which means that no family earning less than £220 a week pays a penny in income tax? Or, for the first time, to give people the right to be represented by a trade union where the majority of the workforce want it, (applause) something campaigned for during more than a century, promised by every Labour government there has ever been, but which will be delivered by this one.And you tell me what Tory government would have given the peoples of Africa and Asia a 25 per cent increase in aid and development. (Applause) Thousands of communities, tens of thousands of people, many starving and destitute, will live not die, have hope, not despair and may never know it was a new Labour government in Britain that had the courage to say: \u2018You are our brothers and sisters and we accept our duty to you as members of the same human race.\u2019 (Applause)But more than that, we have done all this with the public behind us. Why? For a reason that should give every one of you confidence. The centre-left may have lost the battle of ideas in the 1980s, but we are winning now and we have won a bigger battle today - the battle of values.The challenge we face has to be met by us together: one nation; one community; social justice; partnership; co-operation; the equal worth of all; the belief that the best route to individual advancement and happiness lies in a thriving society of others. These were words and concepts derided in the 1980s; these are the values of today, not just here but round the world. At long last, \u2018It's up to me\u2019 is being replaced by \u2018It\u2019s up to us.\u2019 (Applause) That crude individualism of the 1980s is the mood no longer. The spirit of the times today is community. Consider the Tories in their 18 years. How was it that a Tory party that in 1979 came to power as the party of law and order, of attacking welfare scroungers, of the family, ended up presiding over a crime rate that doubled, welfare spending that tripled and the family in greater decline than ever before? Because they really did think there was no such thing as society. That is why.I remember the young guy I met in Scotland recently - a \u2018new dealer\u2019, intelligent, confident, clear about his future - now promoted in the firm that took him on. I said to him, \u2018How could you ever have been without a job?\u2019 He said: \u2018You didn\u2019t know me six months ago. Six months ago you wouldn\u2019t have employed me, but I\u2019ve discovered I\u2019m better than I ever thought I was.\u2019 There are millions of people in that position - children with talent they will never use, ability they will never develop, achievements within them that the world will never see. Deny opportunity, leave injustice or discrimination unchecked and we lay waste the genius of the nation. When a young black student, filled with talent, is murdered by racist thugs and Stephen Lawrence becomes a household name, not because of the trial into his murder, but because of an inquiry into why his murderers are walking free, it isn't just wrong, it weakens the very bonds of decency and respect we need to make our country strong. (Applause)For we stand stronger together.On Sunday I spoke to Gerhard Schroeder. His victory, like ours, shows what people around the world already know. We have passed the end of one era and entered a new one. Five years ago, people said the politics of fairness were finished, that only losers cared about social justice. Today, of 15 European Union countries, 13 have centre-left governments in politics to combat injustice; in power because their people support them and their countries need them; ending the century with the clock going forward again, not turning back.In this era, a new agenda: economies that compete on knowledge, on the creative power of the many, not the few; societies based on inclusion not division; countries that are internationalist not isolationist. This is the third way, our way of reconnecting people to political idealism in an age where political ideology is distrusted.It is no coincidence that the debates on devolution and Europe are happening together. Round the world, nations are reshaping their identity as national states look at their future place in the world. I am a patriot. I want Britain strong. I want the UK strong. But strength comes not from saying our constitution is perfect when the people know that it needs reform. Strength will come from reform - from facing up to its challenge. Strength won't come from isolation - not in today's world. From Kyoto to Kosovo, the challenge can only be met by standing stronger together. (Applause)That is what makes the anti-Europeanism of the Tories so depressingly backward. When we balloted our members on Clause IV, we did it to move the Labour Party back to the centre. They are doing it to leave the centre behind. For a whole century, they had members with no ballots. Now they have ballots with no members. (Laughter and Applause)But if Russia, with whom our trade is tiny, can affect our economy\u2019s confidence, think what a crisis in Europe could do, with whom we do 60 per cent of our trade. Of course we should be positive and constructive in Europe. Britain is stronger for it. And though Britain will take the decision on the Euro in our own time and in our own national interest, meanwhile we work to make the Euro succeed, we prepare our business, we educate our people so that we will be free to join, if we wish to, if the economic benefits are clear.Sure, we have to reform Europe. We are winning that battle because when the European Union helps us trade, promote prosperity, save our environment or co-operate on cross-border crime, it is doing what the European Union should be doing. When it starts interfering with every last detail of our national life, that is a Europe we can do without. Decentralise where possible, integrate where necessary. Believe me, those are sentiments that would win support anywhere today in the European Union. We can play a leading role with others in Europe in getting reform. The others in Europe want us to. But we cannot be leaders without being partners. (Applause)And do not fall for this right-wing myth about choosing the United States over the European Union. Stronger in Europe means stronger with the US and the stronger we stand with the United States, the stronger the bridge we build between our European partners and our American friends. Community values beyond our national boundaries and within our United Kingdom, the same. Standing stronger together.To those who say devolution has let the genie out of the bottle, I say, look at the Tories. They clung to the status quo; they do not have a single seat in Scotland or Wales to show for it. (Applause) The enemies of the Union are the advocates of the status quo and the separatists alike. We have defeated the one and we will defeat the other. (Applause)There is the SNP; they want Scotland wrenched out of the UK and relations with England, can you believe it, run by a minister for external affairs, as if we lived on separate planets. Forget for a moment the threat to jobs, to industry, when 50 per cent of Scottish trade is with the rest of the UK. It is wrong in principle. It is the wrong set of values. Instead of solidarity, it is separatism, isolation. They look at England as the Tories look at Europe and I say, enough of this narrow chauvinism, masquerading as idealism. Scotland stronger with England - England stronger with Scotland. Standing stronger together. (Applause) That is how the challenge of change is conquered, not by failing to make change, but by changing in a way that gives us strength for the future.You know, when we have devolved power to Scotland with PR, to Wales, with PR, to Northern Ireland, with PR, I find it odd that I have been called a control freak by the Liberal Democrats. (Applause) Paddy, you have been in Downing Street often enough now to know that all major speeches have to be cleared through my press office. (Laughter) This one was not, so I declare it inoperative. (Laughter)I believe in the co-operation we have had between Labour and Liberal Democrats, where we agree - and there are many issues where we do so. Our politics should be grown up enough to say so. Lord Jenkins is due to report on PR for Westminster. Let us listen to what is said, but be assured: this government will decide its response in the interests of the country, not in the interests of the Liberal Democrats. (Applause)Now, this government is giving more power back to people than any government this century. Yet still, you know, the Tories call us arrogant. People say there is no Tory opposition any more. Well, there is. It is alive and well and unelected, in the House of Lords with a three to one majority over us. (Applause) Not a vote to their name, but able to vote down the plans that the people voted for in our manifesto. I call that arrogance. (Applause) And when we use the mandate the British people gave us at the ballot box to get rid of the power of those hereditary peers, I call that democracy. (Applause) And what is more, this supposed control freak will be the first Prime Minister to remove from himself the sole power of patronage in appointing peers. No - those Tories do not really think we are arrogant in what we are doing. They think we are arrogant in being in government at all. (Applause)But ours is a mission to modernise for a purpose; to build a Britain strong and prosperous. Strong because it is just, prosperous because it uses the talents of all the people. Confident because the challenge is being taken on not by each of us in isolation from each other, but together, one nation, sure of its values and therefore sure of its future. Look at our country through the eyes of a child growing up today. They are anxious too - more anxious than we were at their age, and no wonder. More violence, more crime, drugs, families breaking down, the old moral order under strain.I want for my children the Britain that you want for yours. Of course I want them to be successful and to go on and make a decent living. But I want more than that. I want them to grow up in a country of which they feel proud. I want to build for them a country in which their children can play safely in the park and can walk home at night without fear. A country in which every school is a good school and every child able to fulfil their potential. A country in which every colour is a good colour and every member of every race able to fulfil their potential. A country in which the sick are cared for and the weak are tended by the strong. A country in which every parent treasures their children when young and every child cherishes their parents when old. That is a country to be proud of. That is a community worth the name. And as our children\u2019s prospects rise, so our country\u2019s prospects rise. As our children grow in confidence, so our country grows in confidence. And as our country grows in confidence, that challenge I described does not seem so daunting after all.By the strength of our common endeavour we achieve more than we achieve alone. Clause IV, part 4 of our new constitution. (Applause) Now is the time to practise it. No retreat from the road to the future. We build our party, we serve our country, we rise to that challenge and rise to it together. (Standing ovation)

aVToday at the frontier of the new Millennium I set out for you how, as a nation, we renew British strength and confidence for the 21st century; and how, as a Party reborn, we make it a century of progressive politics after one dominated by Conservatives.A New Britain where the extraordinary talent of the British people is liberated from the forces of conservatism that so long have held them back, to create a model 21st century nation, based not on privilege, class or background, but on the equal worth of all. And New Labour, confident at having modernised itself, now the new progressive force in British politics which can modernise the nation, sweep away those forces of conservatism to set the people free.100 years in existence, 22 in power, we have never, ever won a full second term. That is our unfinished business. Let us now finish it and with it finish the Tory Party\u2019s chances of doing as much damage in the next century as they\u2019ve done in this one. Today\u2019s Tory party - the party of fox hunting, Pinochet and hereditary peers: the uneatable, the unspeakable and the unelectable.There\u2019s only one thing you need to know about today\u2019s Tory Party.Clarke and Heseltine: outcasts.Hague, Widdecombe, Redwood and Portillo in charge.The only Party that spent two years in hibernation in search of a new image and came back as the Addams family.Under John Major, it was weak, weak, weak.Under William Hague, it's weird, weird, weird.Far right, far out.But not far enough for some. Like the letter I got last week from a man who said did I know the Tories had been listening to Britain. They can\u2019t have been listening too hard, he said. They\u2019re still here. The more useless they get, the more extreme they get.In the last few months alone, I\u2019ve been compared to Hitler, Mussolini and Milosevic. Maybe they think I should be indicted for war crimes - the crime of leading the Labour Party into government, and disturbing the natural order of things.By convention, Prime Ministers start with all the good things their Government has done. I want to start where the British people start: with all we have still to do.More than 1 million still unemployed.Schools and hospitals still needing investment.Pensioners still living in hardship.People still petrified by crime and drugs.3 million children still in poverty.A century of decline, 20 years of Conservative Government still not put to rights. Do you think I don\u2019t feel this, in every fibre of my being?The frustration, the impatience, the urgency, the anger at the waste of lives unfulfilled, hopes never achieved, dreams never realised. And whilst there is one child still in poverty in Britain today, one pensioner in poverty, one person denied their chance in life, there is one Prime Minister and one Party that will have no rest, no vanity in achievement, no sense of mission completed, until they too are free.So I do not claim Britain is transformed. I do say the foundations of a New Britain are being laid. After decades of Tory boom and bust, it is New Labour which is the party of economic competence today and for that we can be proud; and proud of our Chancellor too. Indeed, I can stand here today, leader of the Labour Party, Prime Minister, and say to the British people: you have never had it so... prudent.As we think back to 1985, and to Neil Kinnock, wasn\u2019t it brilliant yesterday, in this hall of all places, to see a Labour Chancellor, \u2018scuttling\u2019 back from Washington to hand out the best economic news in a generation, to his own party\u2019s Conference. 650,000 more jobs in the economy, long-term youth unemployment halved and \u2013 here\u2019s one for us to put back down a few Tory throats - fewer days lost in strikes than any of the 18 years of Tory Government. Who says Labour\u2019s not working now?All employees with the right to a paid holiday. Leave for parents to take time off work for a family crisis. And after 100 years of trying, the right for union members to have their union recognised, not on the whim of an employer, but as a democratic right in a fair and free society. Maternity grant doubled. 7 million families with the largest ever rise in Child Benefit Britain has seen. And I say to Britain\u2019s pensioners: I know when you get an extra £100 for every pensioner household this November - not just those on benefits, everyone \u2013 it\u2019s not the end of your worries, but it\u2019s £100 more than you got under any Conservative Government; and they\u2019d take the £100 back off you if they were ever elected again.Half-way through one Parliament. Nothing like half-way towards meeting all our goals. And all around us the challenge of change.A spectre haunts the world: technological revolution. 10 years ago, a fifteen year old probably couldn\u2019t work a computer. Now he\u2019s in danger of living on it. Over a trillion dollars traded every day in currency markets and with them the fate of nations. Global finance and Communications and Media. Electronic commerce. The Internet. The science of genetics. Every year a new revolution scattering in its wake, security, and ways of living for millions of people. These forces of change driving the future:Don\u2019t stop at national boundaries.Don\u2019t respect tradition.They wait for no one and no nation.They are universal.We know what a 21st century nation needs. A knowledge-based economy. A strong civic society. A confident place in theworld. Do that and a nation masters the future. Fail and it is the future\u2019s victim.The challenge is how?The answer is people.The future is people.The liberation of human potential not just as workers but as citizens.Not power to the people but power to each person to make the most of what is within them.People are born with talent and everywhere it is in chains. Look at Britain. Great strengths. Great history. English, the language of the new technology. The national creative genius of the British people. But wasted. The country run for far too long on the talents of the few, when the genius of the many lies uncared for, and ignored.Fail to develop the talents of any one person, we fail Britain. Talent is 21st century wealth. Every person liberated to fulfil their potential adds to our wealth. Every person denied opportunity takes our wealth away. In the 18th century land was our resource. In the 19th and 20th century it was plant and capital. Today it is people.The cause we have fought for, these 100 years, is no longer simply our cause of social justice. It is the nation\u2019s only hope of salvation. For how do you develop the talent of all, unless in a society that treats us all equally, where the closed doors of snobbery and prejudice, ignorance and poverty, fear and injustice no longer bar our way to fulfilment. Not equal incomes. Not uniform lifestyles or taste or culture. But true equality: equal worth, an equal chance of fulfilment, equal access to knowledge and opportunity.Equal rights. Equal responsibilities.The class war is over. But the struggle for true equality has only just begun. To the child who goes to school hungry for food, but thirsting for knowledge, I know the talent you were born with, and the frustration you feel that it\u2019s trapped inside. We will set your potential free. To the women free to work, but because they are also mothers, carers, helpers barely know how to get through the day, we will give you the support to set your potential free. To the 45 year old who came to my surgery a few months ago, scared he\u2019ll never work again, I say: you didn\u2019t become useless at 45. You deserve the chance to start afresh and we will set your potential free. And to those who have wealth, but who say that none of it means anything if my children can\u2019t play in the park, and my mother daren\u2019t go out at night. We share your belief in a strong community. We will set your potential free.And it is us, the new radicals, the Labour Party modernised, that must undertake this historic mission. To liberate Britain from the old class divisions, old structures, old prejudices, old ways of working and of doing things, that will not do in this world of change. To be the progressive force that defeats the forces of conservatism.For the 21st century will not be about the battle between capitalism and socialism but between the forces of progress and the forces of conservatism. They are what hold our nation back. Not just in the Conservative Party but within us, within our nation. The forces that do not understand that creating a new Britain of true equality is no more a betrayal of Britain\u2019s history than New Labour is of Labour\u2019s values. The old prejudices, where foreign means bad. Where multiculturalism is not something to celebrate, but a left-wing conspiracy to destroy their way of life. Where women shouldn\u2019t work and those who do are responsible for the breakdown of the family. The old elites, establishments that have run our professions and our country too long. Who have kept women and black and Asian talent out of our top jobs and senior parts of Government and the Services. Who keep our bright inner city kids from our best universities. And who still think the House of Lords should be run by hereditary peers in the interests of the Tory Party. The old order, those forces of conservatism, for all their language about promoting the individual, and freedom and liberty, they held people back. They kept people down. They stunted people\u2019s potential. Year after year. Decade after decade.Think back on some of the great achievements of this century. To us today, it almost defies belief that people had to die to win the fight for the vote for women. But they did. That battle was a massive, heroic struggle. But why did it need such a fight? Because Tory MPs stood up in the House of Commons and said: \u2018voting is a man\u2019s business.\u2019 And that is why we can be so proud that it is this Labour Party that has more women MPs and more women Ministers than any Government before us until our record is bettered by a future Labour Government.Look at this Party\u2019s greatest achievement. The forces of conservatism, and the force of the Conservative Party, pulled every trick in the book - voting 51 times, yes 51 times, against the creation of the NHS. One leading Tory, Mr Henry Willink, said at the time that the NHS \u2018will destroy so much in this country that we value,\u2019 when we knew human potential can never be realised when whether you are well or ill depends on wealth not need. The forces of conservatism allied to racism are why one of the heroes of the 20th Century, Martin Luther King, is dead. It\u2019s why another, Nelson Mandela, spent the best years of his life in a cell the size of a bed. And though the fact that Mandela is alive, free and became President, is a sign of the progress we have made: the fact that Stephen Lawrence is dead, for no other reason than he was born black, is a sign of how far we still have to go. And they still keep opposing progress and justice.What did they say about the minimum wage? The same as they said right through this century.They tried the employment argument - it would cost jobs.They tried the business argument - it would make them bankrupt.They then used the economic argument - it would cause inflation.They then resorted to the selfish argument - businesses wouldn't want to pay it.Well, businesses are paying it. Inflation is low. Unemployment is falling. There are one million job vacancies in the country.And two million people have had a pay rise because we believe they are worth more than poverty pay.These forces of conservatism chain us not only to an outdated view of our people\u2019s potential but of our nation\u2019s potential. What threatens the nation state today is not change, but the refusal to change in a world opening up, becoming ever more interdependent. The old air of superiority based on past glory must give way to the ambition to succeed, based on the merit of what Britain stands for today.For the last half century, we have been torn between Europe and the United States, searching for our identity in the post-Empire world. I pose this simple question: is our destiny with Europe or not? If the answer is no, then we should leave. But we would leave an economic union in which 50 per cent of our trade is done, on which millions of British jobs depend. Our economic future would be uncertain.But what is certain is that we would not be a power. Britain would no longer play a determining part in the future of the continent to which we belong. That would be the real end of one thousand years of history. We can choose this destiny. But we should do it with our eyes open and our senses alert, not blindfold and dulled by the incessant propaganda of Europhobes. The single currency is, of course, a decision that must be dependent on the economic conditions; and on the consent of the British people in a referendum. If we believe our destiny is with Europe, then let us leave behind the muddling through, the hesitation, the half-heartedness which has characterised British relations with Europe for forty years and play our part with confidence and pride giving us the chance to defeat the forces of conservatism, economic and political, that hold Europe back too.There is no choice between Europe and America. Britain is stronger with the US today because we are strong in Europe. Britain has the potential to be the bridge between Europe and America and for the 21st century the narrow-minded isolationism of right-wing Tories should not block our path to fulfilling it.The nation-state is changing. The Tory policy on devolution left them without a single seat anywhere in Scotland and Wales. Delivering our promise of a Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly has strengthened the UK not weakened it, and now having defeated the force of conservatism in granting devolution, let us continue to defeat the separatism which is just the forces of conservatism by another name.And don\u2019t let the forces of conservatism stop devolution in Northern Ireland too. Those who are addicted to violence. Those who confuse any progress with selling out. They shouldn\u2019t determine Northern Ireland\u2019s future. Walk through Belfast. No armed soldiers. Drive through it. No road blocks. In the last year, the first time in 30 years, not a single member of the security forces killed. 1996, 8,000 plastic bullets fired. This year 99. Yes, there is violence and any violence is unacceptable. But don\u2019t throw away all that has been achieved. And I ask the Conservative Party: we supported you when you were in Government; don\u2019t make our task harder now because that would be the real betrayal of the children of Northern Ireland.It would be comforting to think the forces of conservatism were only Tories. But wrong. There were forces of conservatism who said changing Clause 4 would destroy the Labour Party, when in truth it was critical to our renewal. Who said a referendum on devolution was a ploy to stop it happening, when I knew it was the only way to make it happen. Who said that making young people take a job that was offered to them was a denial of social justice, when our attack on youth unemployment is the route to social justice.The Third Way is not a new way between progressive and conservative politics. It is progressive politics distinguishing itself from conservatism of left or right. New Labour must be the new radicals who take on both of them, not just on election day, but every day.People say in our first two years we ran a Tory economic policy. Nonsense. If we had run a Tory economic policy Britain would be in recession by now which is no doubt why they predicted it.We gave the Bank of England independence.We cut the borrowing.We cut unemployment. We are at long last reforming welfare, making work pay more than benefit for hard-working families through the Working Families Tax Credit. They would scrap each and every one of these reforms.Slowly the Tory general election strategy is emerging.To 2 million people given a pay rise through the minimum wage. Tory pledge 1: we\u2019ll cut it.To 1.5 million families helped by the working families tax credit. Tory pledge 2: we\u2019ll scrap it.To 250,000 young people getting through the New Deal, Tory pledge 3: you\u2019ll go back on the dole.I say: roll on the next General Election.Our reforms are why we are spending £4bn less on interest payments this year. Saving £2bn by cutting unemployment. Why, thanks to economic growth, billions of pounds of wealth has been created, not lost in Tory boom and bust. And as a result, the next three years show the biggest ever investment in schools and hospitals. Not just one year. But the year after and the year after that. And, if we carry on running this New Labour economic policy, I can tell you today we will continue to get more money into schools and hospitals in a way we can sustain year on year on year. We are rewriting some of the traditional rules of politics.Now after a century of antagonism, economic efficiency and social justice are finally working in partnership together. We are demonstrating that it is possible to cut poverty and run the economy well. At last our historic reputation for compassion is being matched with a hard won reputation for economic competence. From now on people will vote Labour with their head as well as their heart. The political landscape of Britain has changed forever. That\u2019s why Prudence\u2019s chastity belt stays on, even for the Liberal Democrats.And then we open up the UK economy. Open it up to electronic commerce, so we cut the cost of buying and selling. Open it up to competition so we can stop the consumer being ripped off. And private capital alongside public investment. In transport, to read some of the papers you would think John Prescott had created Britain\u2019s transport problems. Thanks to him, and the new Strategic Rail Authority, the next 10 years will see the largest investment in the railways for 100 years. Let\u2019s be honest. When it comes to transport we are all the forces of conservatism. But the real anti-car policy is staying as we are.Let us take on the forces of conservatism in education, too, the greatest liberator of human potential there is.No more nursery vouchers.No return to 11+.No freeze on student numbers in our universities.No more Assisted Places Scheme.Not the right. But not the old Left either: no tolerance of failing LEAs.No truce on failing schools.No pupils condemned to failure.We owe it to every child to unleash their potential. They are of equal worth. They deserve an equal chance.A failed education is a life sentence on a child.If we are to succeed in the knowledge economy, we need - as parents, as teachers, as a country - to get a whole new attitude to learning. What other country in the world sees being \u2018too clever by half\u2019 as a fault? In today\u2019s world, there is no such thing as too clever. The more you know, the further you\u2019ll go.The forces of conservatism, the elite, have held us back for too long.Why is it only now that we are getting nursery places for all three and four year olds?Why has it taken this government to realise that 5, 6 and 7 year olds need that extra attention that smaller classes give them?Why, when we have known all our lives the importance of the 3 Rs, is it only now that we have put in place the literacy and numeracy strategies to get those basics taught properly? And look at the results for 11 year olds: maths up 10 per cent, reading up five per cent - a tribute to our children, to their teachers and to David Blunkett.Why has it taken this government to set about ending the culture of failure in our inner city comprehensives? Doubling the number of specialist schools; creating 1,000 beacon schools; every run down school getting help with buildings, equipment, facilities from the £5bn modernisation programme: LEAs with a track record of failure taken over and run by people with a track record of success.Why is it only now, we have lifted the cap on student numbers and 100,000 more will go to university in the next 2 years, 700,000 more to further education. So today I set a target of 50 per cent of young adults going into higher education in the next century.Why if education is the key to success do we allow so many children to leave school at 16 when we should be doing all we can to get them to stay on. Today we are announcing a smartcard to offer all 16-18 year olds who stay in education cut price deals at shops, in theatres and cinemas and on trains and buses.Only now can this happen because there is a Labour Government that cares about educating the many and a Labour Party with the courage to reform the system to do it.And critical to reform are our teachers. I appeal to them. You do a great job in our schools. We know how important it is for you to work as a team. But if we are to get the real step change in your pay you and we both want, we have to link it to performance. We have to raise standards, and we have to remove those who really cannot do the job. And if a Head Teacher transforms a school and so transforms the life chances of our children, aren\u2019t they worth as much as a good doctor, banker or lawyer?In 10 years we will have transformed our schools. And our NHS too. And I know the impatience here is at its highest. After all, we created the NHS. It has to be us that rebuilds it. And yes it needs money. And yes, the first two years were tough. But the money is now starting. And money is not all it needs. A predecessor of mine famously said she wanted to be able to go into the hospital of her choice, \u2018on the day I want, at the time I want, with the doctor I want.\u2019 That was Margaret Thatcher\u2019s argument for going private.I want to go to the hospital of my choice, on the day I want, at the time I want. And I want it on the NHS.I say in all frankness to the BMA. You want our reforms to slow down. I want them to speed up.Already: 4,000 more student nurses and midwives.4,000 more nurses returning to nursing.27 new hospitals being built.20 million people now covered by NHS Direct.And the dreaded Tory internal market finally banished for good.And over the next 3 years:There will be 7000 more doctors 15,000 more nurses 37 hospitals builtThe whole country covered by NHS Direct.Every casualty department that needs it refurbished.And waiting times and waiting lists lower at the end of our time in Government than at the beginning.And will that be enough?No. But in time, if we are returned to power:We will have booked appointments for everyone.Walk-in NHS centres in all our major towns and cities.Primary care surgeries that offer you all services on one site.And everyone with the chance to go back on the NHS to see their dentist.And just to show you it\u2019s not impossible. Today I can tell you: we will start next year with booked appointments for cancer and cataract patients.And working with the British Dental Association, everyone within the next 2 years will be able once again to see an NHS dentist just by phoning NHS Direct.So much more to do. But it will be done.We aren\u2019t just workers. We are citizens proud to say there is such a thing as society and proud to be part of it. Yet, today, we feel our social fabric torn. Respect for law and order broken. My grandfather\u2019s generation was strong on values. Respect for people. Good manners. Horror of crime. But it was a generation also of deference and of prejudices: racial, sexual, social. The modern world is different. There is less prejudice, less deference, but also less respect. It is time to move beyond the social indifference of right and left, libertarian nonsense masquerading as freedom. This generation wants a society free from prejudice, but not from rules, from order.A common duty to provide opportunity for all.An individual duty to be responsible towards all.There will be a new Crime Bill in The Queen\u2019s Speech.With the new DNA technology we have the chance to match any DNA at any scene of crime with those on police records. Already thousands of criminals are being caught that way. But less than a fifth are on record. I can announce we will provide the extra resources for a database where every known offender will have their DNA recorded, and evidence from any scene of crime will be matched with it.And I saw that we said on drugs and new powers was attacked by civil liberties groups. I believe in civil liberties too: The liberty of parents to drop their kids off at school, without worrying they\u2019re dropping them straight into the arms of drug dealers. The liberty of pensioners to live without fear of getting their door kicked in by someone thieving to pay for their habit. The liberty of young people to live a full life, not die young, the victim of the most chilling, evil industry the world has to confront. Civil liberty to me means just that: the liberty to live in a civil society founded on rights and responsibilities, and in dealing with the drugs menace, that is the society we can help to build.So when I speak of the need for a new moral purpose and some on the right and left rise up and say this is nothing to do with politics, leave it all to the bishops, I tell you these people know exactly what I\u2019m talking about. That\u2019s what I mean by fulfilling our potential as citizens as well as workers.We don\u2019t live by material goods alone. That\u2019s why today we set out more plans to boost arts, culture, competitive sports in schools. It\u2019s why John Prescott puts his heart and soul in the battle to protect our environment, so we leave to our children a safer, healthier planet than the one into which they were born. Yes we are three times richer than our grandparents. But are we three times happier?Ours is a moral cause, best expressed through how we see our families and our children. To our children, we are irreplaceable. If anything happened to me, you\u2019d soon find a new leader. But my kids wouldn\u2019t find a new Dad. There is no more powerful symbol of our politics than the experience of being on a maternity ward. Seeing two babies side by side. Delivered by the same doctors and midwives. Yet two totally different lives ahead of them. One returns with his mother to a bed and breakfast that is cold, damp, cramped. A mother who has no job, no family to support her, sadder still \u2013 no one to share the joy and triumph of the new baby... a father nowhere to be seen. That mother loves her child like any other mother. But her life and her baby\u2019s life is a long, hard struggle. For this child, individual potential hangs by a thread.The second child returns to a prosperous home, grandparents desperate to share the caring, and a father with a decent income and an even larger sense of pride. They\u2019re already thinking about schools, friends she can make, new toys they can buy. Expectations are sky high, opportunities truly limitless.A child is a vulnerable witness on life.A child sees her father hit her mother.A child runs away from home. A child takes drugs. A child gives birth at 12.If we are in politics for one thing - it is to make sure that all children are given the best chance in life. That the moment they are born, their potential and individuality can sparkle. That every child can grow up with high hopes, certainty, love, security and the attention of their parents. Strong families cherished by a strong community. That is our national moral purpose. So when I pledge to end child poverty in 20 years, I do so not just as a politician, but as a father.Can I tell you something? And there are only four other people alive who know this \u2013 it\u2019s actually a bit odd being Prime Minister. Everyone has views about you, and no hesitation giving them to you. You read things about yourself, on a daily basis, that are a complete mystery. And you find that a lot of strange new people want to be your friend, and lots of other strange people want to be your enemy.We\u2019re only flesh and blood in the end. Sometimes can\u2019t sleep. Worry about the job. Worry about the kids. Worry about growing old. Worry about interest rates going up. Worry about Newcastle going down. Then you\u2019ve got these big worries \u2013 when\u2019s the health money really going to make a difference? Why are there still people sleeping in doorways? Can\u2019t we turn round failing schools more quickly? How many of our pensioners will go cold this winter?It\u2019s a big job. A lonely job. The red boxes really do come at you day and night, papers to read, decisions to make. Sometimes life and death decisions. Often decisions, after all the advice and the consultation, that only the Prime Minister can make. So it\u2019s a pressure. But it\u2019s a privilege too. There is no greater privilege than serving your country. And there is no greater purpose than realising your potential. I was lucky. A good education, a loving home, a great family, strong beliefs, a great Party in which to give them expression. Everyone has talent. Everyone has something to offer. And this country needs everyone to make a contribution.You\u2019ll see me on the TV, getting on and off planes, meeting Presidents and Prime Ministers, Kings and Queens. It\u2019s all part of the job. But the part that matters most to me is getting my sleeves rolled up and pushing through the changes to our country that will give to others by right, what I achieved by good fortune. Let me read to you the words of someone else who thought ours was a moral purpose, and said this about the people in our Party. \u2018The men and women who are in it are not working for themselves; they know perfectly well that all they can do is but to create the beginning of a condition of things which will one day bring peace and happiness and freedom and a fuller life for those who are to come after us.\u2019 Our very first leader, Keir Hardie.But 100 years ago, the circumstances of our birth and our political childhood was such we never realised our potential. Born in separation from other progressive forces in British politics, out of the visceral need to represent the interests of an exploited workforce, our base, our appeal, our ideology was too narrow. People were made to feel we wanted to hold them back, limit their aspirations, when in truth the very opposite was our goal.We were chained by our ideology.We thought we had eternal doctrines.When they are in truth eternal values.Solidarity, social justice, the belief not that society comes before individual fulfilment but that it is only in a strong society of others that the individual will be fulfilled. That it is these bonds of connection that make us not citizens of one nation but members of one human race. And wouldn\u2019t Keir Hardie have been proud when under Britain\u2019s leadership, this week we cancelled the debt of those African nations deep in poverty so that their people too can realise their potential, have the hopes and dreams for their children we want for ours? And wouldn\u2019t Clem Attlee and Ernie Bevin have applauded when in Kosovo, faced with racial genocide in Europe for the first time since they fought fascism in the Second World War, it was Britain and this Government that helped defeat it and set one million people free back to their homeland? And wouldn\u2019t it bring a smile to the faces of all Labour leaders to see how confident our Party is today?Today we stand here, more confident than at any time during our 100 years, more confident because we are winning the battle of ideas; we are putting our values into practice; we are the only political force capable of liberating the potential of our people. Knowing what we have to do and knowing how to do it.Arrayed against us: the forces of conservatism, the cynics, the elites, the establishment. Those who will live with decline. Those who yearn for yesteryear. Those who just can\u2019t be bothered. Those who prefer to criticise rather than do.On our side, the forces of modernity and justice. Those who believe in a Britain for all the people. Those who fight social injustice, because they know it harms our nation. Those who believe in a society of equality, of opportunity and responsibility. Those who have the courage to change. Those who have confidence in the future.The battleground, the new Millennium.Our values are our guide. Our job is to serve. Our workplace, the future.Let us step up the pace. Be confident. Be radical.To every nation a purpose.To every Party a cause.And now, at last, Party and nation joined in the same cause for the same purpose: to set our people free.

aVNo prime minister, no party leader, could have a better deputy than John Prescott. You know why the Tories hate him: because he started out as a seaman, steward on a ship, rose to be deputy prime minister and has never hidden or been anything other than totally proud of where he came from. And you know why I like him: because not once in the last two weeks has he reminded me that when he was in charge in August we were 20 points ahead in the polls.I set out today the next steps of our journey to renew our country.Prosperity spreading to all parts of Britain.Secondary schools transformed.A modern NHS.A 21st century transport system.The yob culture tackled.On the way to ending child poverty.On the road to full employment.The people\u2019s priorities our priorities.That is a second term vision worth fighting for.Our destination: a Britain where, in a world of change, everyone not just a few gets the chance to succeed.For me, the large majority we won was never a reason to do the job quickly; but to do it properly. We knew: first base was getting the fundamentals in place. We said we would sort the economy out. We have. The strongest British economy for decades, delivered by this New Labour government. We said we\u2019d get people off benefit and into work. We are. 1 million more jobs. We said we\u2019d invest in schools and hospitals. It is happening. And because we chose to invest; because we have in this country tens of thousands of dedicated hard working teachers as determined as we are to give every child a chance to succeed, last week, Britain had the best primary school results it has ever seen. That is what I call: delivering on the fundamentals.And I could go on and give a list of all the other promises kept and change delivered.Over a million children out of poverty.This government leading the way on the environment at Kyoto.Devolution to the people of Scotland, Wales and London.Progress in Northern Ireland. Free eye tests for pensioners.Higher benefits for disabled children. 150,000 lone parents into work.Lowest business taxes. Record rises in child benefit.I could go on and on. Because we should be proud of our record. Not self-satisfied. Never complacent. But plain proud because the firm foundations we promised to lay are in place.But this is not a time for lists. But for setting out the big choices facing Britain and for dialogue.I\u2019m the prime minister that\u2019s supposed to be the great reader of public opinion. After the events of two weeks ago, it\u2019s no wonder the government has taken a knock. It happened on my watch and I take responsibility. So: what do we make of it?Three years ago, Britain was desperate to get the Tories out. The people liked the look of us. We were a breath of fresh air. New faces, new ideas, new policies. In some areas we\u2019ve exceeded expectations. Let us be honest, a few people doubted the economy would be stronger under Labour. But it is. They like the 1m new jobs. They believe we are trying to make progress on schools and hospitals.But for many families life\u2019s still a struggle. It\u2019s tough, balancing work and family. Jobs can be insecure. There\u2019s the mortgage to pay; the holiday to save for. Inflation may be lower but the kids\u2019 trainers don\u2019t get any cheaper. Then, people hear the 20 second clip on the news. They see the ding-dong at prime minister\u2019s questions. They try to make sense of the swirling mass of news and comment in the 24-hour media age. And they think: you\u2019re not listening. What\u2019s it got to do with me? Where is this journey\u2019s end? And a fog descends on the very dialogue between Government and people necessary to get there.And, yes, there are things we have done that have made people angry and we should be open enough to admit it.The dome. Hindsight is a wonderful thing, and if I had my time again, I would have listened to those who said governments shouldn\u2019t try to run big visitor attractions.75p. I tell you now, as Gordon made crystal clear yesterday, we get the message.But I believe that when people reflect, on the big fundamentals that determine our future - the economy, jobs, public services - we are doing the right thing, and we are on the right track for Britain; and the last thing this country needs is a return to Tory government.Let me come direct to the fuel crisis. I owe you an explanation. Yes, petrol is expensive. But of the 14p rise since the Budget last year, 12 pence has been in the world oil price. Which is why these protests have taken place all over the world.It\u2019s true that it\u2019s cheaper elsewhere in Europe. But VAT is often higher there. Income tax is higher. Business taxes are higher. There are road tolls and higher national insurance charges. All in all, Britain has the lowest overall tax burden of any large industrialised nation in the world except Japan and the USA. In the USA, you don\u2019t have the NHS. It\u2019s true that there will be extra revenues coming to government as a result of higher oil prices. But they nowhere near cover the protesters\u2019 demands.And there\u2019s something more. I am listening to people\u2019s anger over fuel duties. For hauliers and farmers to say nothing of ordinary motorists, there is real hardship.But I have also had to listen over under-funding in the NHS.Over extra investment in schools.Over more police on the beat.Over public transport.I am listening over mortgages, where low interest rates can only be maintained if disciplined public finances are kept.I am also listening to pensioners who believe the government should give them a greater share of the country\u2019s prosperity.Our first priority was to help the 2 million pensioners, many of them elderly women, who depend on income support. I make no apology for helping the poorest first and neither should this Party. Through the winter allowance, now £150, and free TV licences for over 75s, we helped people with their most pressing costs.We rejected returning to the earnings link. For the next two or three years we could afford it; but 10, 15 years down the line, it would have imposed a huge financial burden on a future generation that would have been unfair to them. We want to do more for middle and lower income pensioners. You do not meet long term need by giving the wealthiest the same help as the poorest.But I know there are pensioners not on benefit, who have saved all their lives but are not by any stretch of the imagination wealthy, and for whom the basic state pension and other government help is essential. It is right they share in the nation\u2019s wealth.I am listening. I hear. And I will act.The point I\u2019m making is this. The real world is full of competing causes. Most of them good. Most of them deserving. Many of them heart-rending. And it\u2019s not an arrogant government that chooses priorities. It\u2019s an irresponsible government that fails to choose.The test of leadership in politics is not how eloquently you say yes. It\u2019s how you explain why you\u2019re saying no.To be in touch is to be in sympathy.To be in government is to decide.And would it ever be right to choose a priority simply on the basis of a fuel blockade? What of those who can\u2019t protest; whose voice isn\u2019t supported by the media; who go neglected unless we speak for them?So I am listening.But I was also elected to lead.And if we want to reach our journey\u2019s end - that strong, fair and prosperous Britain for all - there are choices to be made. There are forks in the road, where which way we take determines the future lives of millions of people. They are decisions of destiny and I would like to explain them.The first big choice: a government with the strength to deliver stability, or a government that takes the country back to boom and bust. Without economic strength, there will never be a Britain where everyone can succeed. Remember the late 80s/early 90s, interest rates at 10% for four years, 15% for a year. One million families in negative equity. Record repossessions.Contrary to the myth, we inherited an economy trapped in a cycle of boom and bust; interest rates above those in our main competitors; and a big budget deficit. That was them after 18 years. After 3 years of us, ask yourselves this. Why has this country now got the lowest inflation rate in Europe?Employment and vacancies at record levels?The budget deficit, turned into the highest surplus in any major European country?It is not luck that we enjoy this economic strength. It is not coincidence.It is the result of choices, hard choices, taken by this government. By Gordon Brown, one of the most inspired chancellors this country has seen. Bank of England independence. Opposed by the Conservatives.Sorting out the nation\u2019s finances. Opposed by the Conservatives.The cheek of these Tories arguing about how we spend the surplus.Let us remind them.In May 1997, we didn't have a surplus. We had a national debt so large we were paying as much in interest payments on the debt as on schools and police put together.Today the Tories are back with exactly the plan of 10 years ago. You don\u2019t need me to predict it. We all experienced it. Don\u2019t ever let them con us into boom and bust again.The second big choice: a government with the strength to help people through change, or a government that leaves you to fend for yourself.Never forget: in 18 Tory years, unemployment trebled. Families of three generations with nobody bringing in a wage. Record youth unemployment. And what did they say: it was a price worth paying. Unemployment is never a price worth paying. The New Deal has helped nearly a million people with work or training, the largest ever jobs programme Britain has seen. The Working Families\u2019 Tax Credit makes work pay for over a million families. Childcare and training has helped 150,000 women find work or get a better job.A woman wrote to me recently and said that, for the first time in her life, thanks to the Working Families\u2019 Tax Credit, she could afford a holiday and thanks to the Social Chapter, she was entitled to one.And at long last a national statutory minimum wage has given 1½ million people the dignity of a decent living wage.And we have introduced the democratic right, delivered after 100 years of trying, to be represented by a trade union should you want it.That was our choice. Not to leave you at the mercy of markets. Not to walk by. Not to say: tough, sink or swim.Every single one of those measures was opposed by the Conservatives.Every single one fought against, tooth and nail.That was their choice. And though they say they support the national minimum wage now, does anyone believe them? Their policies may change every five minutes. Their prejudices will never change.And in the next stage we need to do more. Because the pace of change will quicken. It\u2019s not just poorer families that need help. To give everyone the chance to succeed, right in the heartlands of middle Britain, there are families and businesses that will need that helping hand.And because of the scale of what we are doing, and the scale of our ambition, let me set out in detail what we are doing, and what we will do in the future.Because 90% of new jobs will need skills with computers, there will be 6000 centres round Britain, giving access to the internet and help with technology. Everyone will get an 80% discount on computer courses, the unemployed will get it for free. There will be 1000 more technology centres for small businesses or the self-employed.Because we want to stay ahead in the new technologies we are investing £2¼ billion over five years in British science, the largest investment since the 1960s.Because we know small businesses are a big part of the future, we are setting up venture capital funds in every region, tax breaks for investment, cuts in small business tax and the new Small Business Service to act as their advocate and protector in government.And because we know the danger that in a changing world new forms of inequality and social exclusion are created: the Sure Start programme - £500 million - to help children in poverty; a new Careers Service for school leavers; cutting homelessness and helping the homeless get jobs; a £1 billion programme to renew deprived neighbourhoods; and extending the New Deal in the unemployment blackspots of Britain.I want to be the first prime minister in 40 years to stand up and say; Britain is back at full employment.But it all depends on having the strength to make the choice.Not by leaping aboard every passing bandwagon.There\u2019s Mr Hague. Standing around waiting for a bandwagon. Then three come along at once. There he was, week after week, glued to the box, to see who was voted out of Big Brother. And then announced it had always been Tory policy to throw them out.Opportunism always knocks for William Hague.You want tax cuts? Have them.Spending rises? Have them too.It all makes sense after 14 pints. Everything makes sense after 14 pints.John Redwood looks sane. Michael Portillo looks loyal.After 14 pints, even William Hague looks like a prime minister.The third big choice: a government with the strength to invest for the long term, or a government that cuts our public services.For 18 years, Britain suffered chronic under-investment in our public services. It held people back; it reduced opportunity. How could we reach a Britain where everyone can succeed, when, in May \u201997 half, literally half, of all 11-year-olds failed their basic tests?Or the NHS was on its knees.Or our transport system was the poor man of Europe?So to get to the next stage of our journey.Our education, health and transport plans represent the most radical reform in public services over ten years any government has produced since the War.So again, let me set out in detail the journey so far, and the plans for a second term.So far, 11,000 schools with new buildings.120,000 more free nursery places.As well as the best ever primary school tests, three hundred thousand fewer infants in classes of more than 30.300 more specialist secondary schools, improving their results at twice the average for other schools.A £200m reform programme to improve inner city comprehensives.A billion pound investment in our teachers to reward excellence in the classroom.But this is only the beginning. The next stage on the journey requires not only excellent primary schools but first-class secondary schools.By 2004, there will be one thousand specialist schools.An extra billion pound investment in ICT, to ensure one computer to every five children in our secondary schools.Catch-up tuition for all 11- and 12 year-olds who arrive without good literacy and numeracy.New targets for 14- and 16-year-olds.Better incentives for staying on at school, and an overhaul of further education to raise standards.New bursaries for student teachers of up to £10,000, with already a 50% rise in graduate applications.And all these are policies that flow from our central belief that every single child deserves an equal chance. That every child is a unique asset to be brought to their fullest potential. It is why we are in this party. It is why education is the passion of this government.In our manifesto, line one of our contract with the people promised to increase the share of our national wealth spent on education during this Parliament.A promise made. A promise kept.Today I make a further commitment.Line one of the contract in the next manifesto will be a promise to increase the share of our national wealth spent on education in the next Parliament.Education. Education. Education. Then. Now. And in the future.Again, on health, let me set out the scale of our plans, for now and for a second term.The waiting list pledge has been met.There are 10,000 more nurses in the NHS.Every A&E that needs it is being modernised.The biggest ever hospital building programme is under way.But we all know. 18 years of neglect isn\u2019t put right in three years.Earlier this year we got the money to plan for a five year record rise in NHS spending. But we are New Labour. We don\u2019t just spend. Alan Milburn and I sat down with people in the NHS and said it's a deal: we provide the cash, you rise to the challenge of modernising the NHS. They responded magnificently.Our NHS plan is something the party can be proud of. The NHS was the greatest achievement of the post-war Labour government. It was based on a single, clear, enduring value: that healthcare should be based on need not ability to pay. Some objected to that principle then. Some urge us to abandon it now. But this party, the Labour party will never abandon what was one of the greatest civilising acts of emancipation this country has ever known.Under the plan, for the first time a system of inspection and accountability for all parts of the NHS, with new money to reward good performance.For the first time, nurses and other health professionals given the bigger roles that their qualifications and expertise deserve.For the first time local health services and local social services brought closer together in one organisation.For the first time, the NHS and the private sector in a proper partnership to deliver healthcare.For the first time, money set aside specifically to get rid of the dirty corridors, the poor food, the mixed sex wards which demoralise patients and staff.For the first time, new consultants trained within the NHS, paid for by the taxpayer, will give the early years of their service exclusively to National Health Service patients.Today, as we set out the next steps, I want to focus on cancer.There will be nobody in this hall, or watching from their homes, who has not seen a friend or family member struck down by cancer.As things stand, one in every four people in this country will die of cancer.Under the plan we publish tomorrow, there will be 1000 more cancer specialists over the next six years - up nearly a third.295 new scanners and radio-therapy machines so that for the first time the NHS can meet proper equipment standards for diagnosing and treating cancer.By 2003 for the first time the government will be matching pound for pound charity funding for cancer research.Cancer patients in all parts of the country will get the right drugs at the right time, regardless of where they live. The postcode lottery ended. Waiting times will be cut. Maximum two weeks from GP appointment to first hospital appointment for suspected urgent cases. And, as we increase the number of specialists, a maximum wait of one month from diagnosis to treatment starting.And because breast cancer kills 11,000 women every year, because it causes so much pain and suffering among Britain's families, we will extend breast cancer screening to all women aged over 65, helping an extra 400,000 women by 2004.Then on transport, in July John Prescott and Gus Macdonald set out in detail Britain's first ever transport plan, a unique 10 year £180 billion partnership between public and private sector to renew our transport system.A massive programme for the second term. It will take time. Investment. And a Labour government to see it through.The Conservatives have made their choice.They are committed to £16bn of cuts in our investment.When they made this commitment, I asked for research on what sort of things you'd have to cut over a 12 month period to deliver on a £16bn cuts guarantee. Back came the answer.20,000 doctors. Cut.Plus 20,000 prison officers. Cut.Plus 40,000 nurses. Cut.Plus 40,000 teachers. Cut.Plus 40,000 police officers. Cut under the Tory cuts guarantee.And then: 20 hospitals. Shut.150 secondary schools. Shut. 500 primary schools. Shut under the Tory cuts guarantee.And we\u2019ve still got five billion pounds to go. How will they get there?The biggest ever rise in child benefit. Cut.Free TV licences for 3 million pensioners. Cut.The £150 winter fuel allowance. Cut under the Tory cuts guarantee.1200 intensive care beds. Cut.Free eye tests for pensioners. Cut. 250 cancer scanners. Cut.Half a million nursery places. Cut. 100,000 childcare places. Cut under the Tory cuts guarantee.And just to round it up to £16 billion, the country's entire arts and sports budget. Cut under the Tory cuts guarantee.And in every constituency, in every part of this country, we will force every Tory candidate to say where the cuts will fall.The fourth big choice: a government with the strength to build strong communities, or a government that believes there is no such thing in society.Crime, anti-social behaviour, racial intolerance, drug abuse, destroy families and communities. They destroy the very respect for others on which society is founded. They blight the life chances of thousands of young people and the quality of life of millions more. Fail to confront this evil and we will never build a Britain where everyone can succeed.So we invest to give opportunity. Not just in jobs and services.Today we set out plans to invest £750million of lottery money in schools and community sport as part of a £1billion investment over three years. It\u2019s a policy we have put together with Trevor Brooking, chairman of Sport England, who has flown here from Sydney and who believes passionately, as I do, that this is not just a sports policy. It\u2019s a health policy, an education policy, an anti-crime policy, an anti-drugs policy.By acknowledging the duty to care, we earn the right to be tough on crime. 4 out of 10 violent crimes are alcohol related. Half of property crime drug-related.It is time for zero tolerance of the yob culture. Time to stand up for the pensioner afraid to go out. Time to stand up for the single mothers scared to walk to the shops. Time to stand up to the thugs and the bullies. Time to tighten bail to deal with the absurdity of people released in the morning committing offences in the afternoon. Time to give the police powers to close pubs where there is fighting. Time to give them powers to ban drink in public places. Time to give them the power to impose curfews on children up to 16 and time to use them. Time to give them the power without the hassle of endless forms and court bureaucracy, to issue fixed penalty fines for loutish behaviour. Time to give offenders on drugs a choice: get treatment or lose your liberty because society needs protection from you.These measures require legislation. So will the new and sweeping powers we intend to give to the police and customs to investigate organised crime and to confiscate their assets. If they need further powers, they will get them.You don\u2019t beat today\u2019s drug gangs by applying the Queensberry rules. It is time the law enforcement agencies were able to do as much damage to organised crime as organised crime does to our communities.We have increased funding for victim support, and given special help to victims of rape and sexual offences, but we need to do more.- They should get full information about the progress of the case.- About the sentence, and about the release of the criminal.- Proper compensation, backed by a Victims\u2019 Ombudsman.And, I believe that the victim of a crime should be able to give a written assessment of the impact of the crime upon them, which should be presented in open court, and taken into account when sentencing decisions are made.Standing up to criminals. Standing up for victims. Another big project for the second term of a Labour government.The fifth choice: a government that leads in the world, or a government that retreats into isolation.This is a world moving closer together. In money and trade; the environment; defence and security; the war against drugs and crime; even today the call for lower oil prices: strength comes through partnership; influence through international engagement.Standing up for Britain means standing up for our armed services.Standing up for Britain means know we are stronger with the US if we are stronger in Europe, and stronger in Europe if we are stronger with the US.Standing up for Britain means standing up for British jobs and British industry.On the Euro, standing up for Britain means taking the decision in the interests of Britain, not the interests of the internal warfare inside the Tory party.I believe we should join if the economics are right. At present, they aren\u2019t.But the choice at the election is not whether we join: that decision is for the people in a referendum.The issue is: do we rule out joining? Do we rule out even the option?How is that standing up for Britain, Britain\u2019s jobs, Britain\u2019s industry, the living standards of Britain\u2019s people?And standing up for Britain means standing up for our values overseas, in Sierra Leone, in Kosovo. And I say to Milosevic. You lost. Go. Your country and the world has suffered enough.These are the choices we make.These are our second term plans.A ten-year plan for a modern NHS. The transformation of secondary education.A cradle to grave poverty strategy.A plan to harness new technology to spread prosperity to all. A plan to make our streets safe and our society strong. A 10 year plan for modern transport.The next steps to full employment.This is a programme worth fighting for. A second term more radical than the first. A quickening of the pace of reform. The next steps on our journey. All based on our enduring mission, to offer everyone, not just the privileged few, the chance to succeed.And lighting our path is this belief: that today a strong economy and a strong society are two sides of the same coin.To succeed as an economy we develop the talents of all.To be a fair society, we give opportunity to all.The political consequences are historic; self-interest and the common good are at long last in alliance.Look at the irony of the Tory years. The Tories who said only they could manage the economy ended up with boom and bust. The Tory party that said it would get tough on benefit claimants, ended up spending more on social security than schools and hospitals put together. The Tory party that said it would stand up for the family, presided over more instability, more single parents on benefit, more truancy, more juvenile crime than any in history.Why? Because they offered short-term tax cuts that could not be sustained rather than investing for the long-term.Because they thought there was no such thing as society.In the world of the 80s that might have been cruel; in the 21st century it simply won\u2019t work.Do you know how much we save from almost 1 million fewer welfare claimants since we took power. £4 billion per annum. Enough for 75,000 nurses and 70,000 teachers.Do you know how much it would cost to take out private medical insurance, as the Tories want? Over £1500 a year for the average family.Do you know the cost to the British economy of transport congestion a year? The equivalent of 8p on your income tax.Do you know why we say this is a learn more, earn more world? Because a graduate earns 40 % more than the average.On your side for the Tories means nodding along with your prejudices - English language lessons for foreign doctors - you know they\u2019re not talking about the Swiss.But really being on your side is to be there with you on the big questions, on the fundamentals.What began as a moral crusade is now also the path to prosperity. What started as a belief in the equal worth of all is also a programme for wealth creation.Realism and idealism at last in harmony.So when the Tories say: we\u2019ll cut Labour\u2019s investment and give you tax cuts, it\u2019s a fool\u2019s game. We will cut tax for people as we can, but will do it in a way that lasts not at the expense of the very stability and investment on which the wealth and security of millions of families depend.So that is my explanation. That\u2019s why I won\u2019t take the easy way. Because that way we cannot reach our journey\u2019s end.And all that really stands between us and our destination is confidence. And trust.The confidence that gives us strength to make the choices; the trust that there is a vision, an end to believe in.Don\u2019t tell me that a country with our history and heritage, that today boasts six of the top ten businesses in the whole of Europe, with London the top business city in Europe, that is a world leader in technology and communication and the businesses of the future, that under us has overtaken France and Italy to become the fourth largest economy in the world, that has the language of the new economy, more brilliant artists, actors and directors than any comparable country in the world, some of the best scientists and inventors in the world, the best armed forces in the world, the best teachers and doctors and nurses, the best people any nation could wish for.Don't tell me with all that going for us that we do not have the spirit to meet all the challenges before us.For that is another choice; confidence or cynicism. All we need is the confidence to make the right choice for the future.Just as we did in the party so, on a larger scale, the same is true for Britain. We are on a journey of renewal. Before us lies a path strewn with the challenges of change.But the purpose of our journey is not to lose our values as a nation: but to make them live on.And for us, this government, this party that believes passionately in a Britain where everyone not just a few get a chance to succeed, and knows the Tories will only take us backwards, we now know:We are in a fight and it\u2019s a fight I relish.For it is a fight for the future, the heart and the soul of our country.A fight for fairness. A fight for jobs. A fight for our schools. A fight for our hospitals. A fight for a new vision in which the old conflict between prosperity and social justice is finally banished to the history books in which it belongs.We do not lie down in the testing times.We hold firm. We listen and we lead.We can be confident in our policies, confident in the record we will put before the British people.Confident that we will repay the trust the British people put in us.Confident that we share their basic decent instincts and values.Confident that we are winning the big arguments on the big issues.Stability. Or boom and bust.Jobs. Or unemployment.Investment in schools and hospitals. Or cuts.Leadership and engagement in the world. Or weakness and sour isolation.Our journey\u2019s end: a Britain where any child born in this millennium, whatever their background, race or creed, wherever they live, whoever their parents, is able to make the most of the God-given ability they bring into this world.That journey is a journey worth making.A fight worth fighting.A fight we must win.

aVIn retrospect, the Millennium marked only a moment in time. It was the events of September 11 that marked a turning point in history, where we confront the dangers of the future and assess the choices facing humankind.It was a tragedy. An act of evil. From this nation, goes our deepest sympathy and prayers for the victims and our profound solidarity with the American people.We were with you at the first. We will stay with you to the last.Just two weeks ago, in New York, after the church service I met some of the families of the British victims.It was in many ways a very British occasion. Tea and biscuits. It was raining outside. Around the edge of the room, strangers making small talk, trying to be normal people in an abnormal situation.And as you crossed the room, you felt the longing and sadness; hands clutching photos of sons and daughters, wives and husbands; imploring you to believe them when they said there was still an outside chance of their loved ones being found alive, when you knew in truth that all hope was gone.And then a middle-aged mother looks you in the eyes and tells you her only son has died, and asks you: why?I tell you: you do not feel like the most powerful person in the country at times like that.Because there is no answer. There is no justification for their pain. Their son did nothing wrong. The woman, seven months pregnant, whose child will never know its father, did nothing wrong.They don't want revenge. They want something better in memory of their loved ones.I believe their memorial can and should be greater than simply the punishment of the guilty. It is that out of the shadow of this evil, should emerge lasting good: destruction of the machinery of terrorism wherever it is found; hope amongst all nations of a new beginning where we seek to resolve differences in a calm and ordered way; greater understanding between nations and between faiths; and above all justice and prosperity for the poor and dispossessed, so that people everywhere can see the chance of a better future through the hard work and creative power of the free citizen, not the violence and savagery of the fanatic.I know that here in Britain people are anxious, even a little frightened. I understand that. People know we must act but they worry what might follow.They worry about the economy and talk of recession.And, of course there are dangers; it is a new situation.But the fundamentals of the US, British and European economies are strong.Every reasonable measure of internal security is being undertaken.Our way of life is a great deal stronger and will last a great deal longer than the actions of fanatics, small in number and now facing a unified world against them.People should have confidence.This is a battle with only one outcome: our victory not theirs.What happened on 11 September was without parallel in the bloody history of terrorism.Within a few hours, up to 7000 people were annihilated, the commercial centre of New York was reduced to rubble and in Washington and Pennsylvania further death and horror on an unimaginable scale. Let no one say this was a blow for Islam when the blood of innocent Muslims was shed along with those of the Christian, Jewish and other faiths around the world.We know those responsible. In Afghanistan are scores of training camps for the export of terror. Chief amongst the sponsors and organisers is Usama Bin Laden.He is supported, shielded and given succour by the Taliban regime.Two days before the 11 September attacks, Masood, the leader of the opposition Northern Alliance, was assassinated by two suicide bombers. Both were linked to Bin Laden. Some may call that coincidence. I call it payment - payment in the currency these people deal in: blood.Be in no doubt: Bin Laden and his people organised this atrocity. The Taliban aid and abet him. He will not desist from further acts of terror. They will not stop helping him.Whatever the dangers of the action we take, the dangers of inaction are far, far greater.Look for a moment at the Taliban regime. It is undemocratic. That goes without saying.There is no sport allowed, or television or photography. No art or culture is permitted. All other faiths, all other interpretations of Islam are ruthlessly suppressed. Those who practice their faith are imprisoned. Women are treated in a way almost too revolting to be credible. First driven out of university; girls not allowed to go to school; no legal rights; unable to go out of doors without a man. Those that disobey are stoned.There is now no contact permitted with western agencies, even those delivering food. The people live in abject poverty. It is a regime founded on fear and funded on the drugs trade. The biggest drugs hoard in the world is in Afghanistan, controlled by the Taliban. Ninety per cent of the heroin on British streets originates in Afghanistan.The arms the Taliban are buying today are paid for with the lives of young British people buying their drugs on British streets.That is another part of their regime that we should seek to destroy.So what do we do?Don't overreact some say. We aren't.We haven't lashed out. No missiles on the first night just for effect.Don't kill innocent people. We are not the ones who waged war on the innocent. We seek the guilty.Look for a diplomatic solution. There is no diplomacy with Bin Laden or the Taliban regime.State an ultimatum and get their response. We stated the ultimatum; they haven't responded.Understand the causes of terror. Yes, we should try, but let there be no moral ambiguity about this: nothing could ever justify the events of 11 September, and it is to turn justice on its head to pretend it could.The action we take will be proportionate; targeted; we will do all we humanly can to avoid civilian casualties. But understand what we are dealing with. Listen to the calls of those passengers on the planes. Think of the children on them, told they were going to die.Think of the cruelty beyond our comprehension as amongst the screams and the anguish of the innocent, those hijackers drove at full throttle planes laden with fuel into buildings where tens of thousands worked.They have no moral inhibition on the slaughter of the innocent. If they could have murdered not 7,000 but 70,000 does anyone doubt they would have done so and rejoiced in it?There is no compromise possible with such people, no meeting of minds, no point of understanding with such terror.Just a choice: defeat it or be defeated by it. And defeat it we must.Any action taken will be against the terrorist network of Bin Laden.As for the Taliban, they can surrender the terrorists; or face the consequences and again in any action the aim will be to eliminate their military hardware, cut off their finances, disrupt their supplies, target their troops, not civilians. We will put a trap around the regime.I say to the Taliban : surrender the terrorists; or surrender power. It's your choice.We will take action at every level, national and international, in the UN, in G8, in the EU, in Nato, in every regional grouping in the world, to strike at international terrorism wherever it exists.For the first time, the UN security council has imposed mandatory obligations on all UN members to cut off terrorist financing and end safe havens for terrorists.Those that finance terror, those who launder their money, those that cover their tracks are every bit as guilty as the fanatic who commits the final act.Here in this country and in other nations round the world, laws will be changed, not to deny basic liberties but to prevent their abuse and protect the most basic liberty of all: freedom from terror. New extradition laws will be introduced; new rules to ensure asylum is not a front for terrorist entry. This country is proud of its tradition in giving asylum to those fleeing tyranny. We will always do so. But we have a duty to protect the system from abuse.It must be overhauled radically so that from now on, those who abide by the rules get help and those that don't, can no longer play the system to gain unfair advantage over others.Round the world, 11 September is bringing Governments and people to reflect, consider and change. And in this process, amidst all the talk of war and action, there is another dimension appearing.There is a coming together. The power of community is asserting itself. We are realising how fragile are our frontiers in the face of the world's new challenges.Today conflicts rarely stay within national boundaries.Today a tremor in one financial market is repeated in the markets of the world.Today confidence is global; either its presence or its absence.Today the threat is chaos; because for people with work to do, family life to balance, mortgages to pay, careers to further, pensions to provide, the yearning is for order and stability and if it doesn't exist elsewhere, it is unlikely to exist here.I have long believed this interdependence defines the new world we live in.People say: we are only acting because it's the USA that was attacked. Double standards, they say. But when Milosevic embarked on the ethnic cleansing of Muslims in Kosovo, we acted.The sceptics said it was pointless, we'd make matters worse, we'd make Milosevic stronger and look what happened, we won, the refugees went home, the policies of ethnic cleansing were reversed and one of the great dictators of the last century, will see justice in this century.And I tell you if Rwanda happened again today as it did in 1993, when a million people were slaughtered in cold blood, we would have a moral duty to act there also. We were there in Sierra Leone when a murderous group of gangsters threatened its democratically elected Government and people.And we as a country should, and I as Prime Minister do, give thanks for the brilliance, dedication and sheer professionalism of the British Armed Forces.We can't do it all. Neither can the Americans.But the power of the international community could, together, if it chose to.It could, with our help, sort out the blight that is the continuing conflict in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, where three million people have died through war or famine in the last decade.A Partnership for Africa, between the developed and developing world based around the New African Initiative, is there to be done if we find the will.On our side: provide more aid, untied to trade; write off debt; help with good governance and infrastructure; training to the soldiers, with UN blessing, in conflict resolution; encouraging investment; and access to our markets so that we practise the free trade we are so fond of preaching.But it's a deal: on the African side: true democracy, no more excuses for dictatorship, abuses of human rights; no tolerance of bad governance, from the endemic corruption of some states, to the activities of Mr Mugabe's henchmen in Zimbabwe. Proper commercial, legal and financial systems.The will, with our help, to broker agreements for peace and provide troops to police them.The state of Africa is a scar on the conscience of the world. But if the world as a community focused on it, we could heal it. And if we don't, it will become deeper and angrier.We could defeat climate change if we chose to. Kyoto is right. We will implement it and call upon all other nations to do so.But it's only a start. With imagination, we could use or find the technologies that create energy without destroying our planet; we could provide work and trade without deforestation.If humankind was able, finally, to make industrial progress without the factory conditions of the 19th Century; surely we have the wit and will to develop economically without despoiling the very environment we depend upon. And if we wanted to, we could breathe new life into the Middle East Peace Process and we must.The state of Israel must be given recognition by all; freed from terror; know that it is accepted as part of the future of the Middle East not its very existence under threat. The Palestinians must have justice, the chance to prosper and in their own land, as equal partners with Israel in that future.We know that. It is the only way, just as we know in our own peace process, in Northern Ireland, there will be no unification of Ireland except by consent - and there will be no return to the days of unionist or Protestant supremacy because those days have no place in the modern world. So the unionists must accept justice and equality for nationalists.The Republicans must show they have given up violence - not just a ceasefire but weapons put beyond use. And not only the Republicans, but those people who call themselves Loyalists, but who by acts of terrorism, sully the name of the United Kingdom.We know this also. The values we believe in should shine through what we do in Afghanistan.To the Afghan people we make this commitment. The conflict will not be the end. We will not walk away, as the outside world has done so many times before.If the Taliban regime changes, we will work with you to make sure its successor is one that is broad-based, that unites all ethnic groups, and that offers some way out of the miserable poverty that is your present existence.And, more than ever now, with every bit as much thought and planning, we will assemble a humanitarian coalition alongside the military coalition so that inside and outside Afghanistan, the refugees, millions on the move even before September 11, are given shelter, food and help during the winter months.The world community must show as much its capacity for compassion as for force.The critics will say: but how can the world be a community? Nations act in their own self-interest. Of course they do. But what is the lesson of the financial markets, climate change, international terrorism, nuclear proliferation or world trade? It is that our self-interest and our mutual interests are today inextricably woven together.This is the politics of globalisation.I realise why people protest against globalisation.We watch aspects of it with trepidation. We feel powerless, as if we were now pushed to and fro by forces far beyond our control.But there's a risk that political leaders, faced with street demonstrations, pander to the argument rather than answer it. The demonstrators are right to say there's injustice, poverty, environmental degradation.But globalisation is a fact and, by and large, it is driven by people.Not just in finance, but in communication, in technology, increasingly in culture, in recreation. In the world of the internet, information technology and TV, there will be globalisation. And in trade, the problem is not there's too much of it; on the contrary there's too little of it.The issue is not how to stop globalisation.The issue is how we use the power of community to combine it with justice. If globalisation works only for the benefit of the few, then it will fail and will deserve to fail.But if we follow the principles that have served us so well at home - that power, wealth and opportunity must be in the hands of the many, not the few - if we make that our guiding light for the global economy, then it will be a force for good and an international movement that we should take pride in leading.Because the alternative to globalisation is isolation.Confronted by this reality, round the world, nations are instinctively drawing together. In Quebec, all the countries of North and South America deciding to make one huge free trade area, rivalling Europe.In Asia. In Europe, the most integrated grouping of all, we are now 15 nations. Another 12 countries negotiating to join, and more beyond that.A new relationship between Russia and Europe is beginning.And will not India and China, each with three times as many citizens as the whole of the EU put together, once their economies have developed sufficiently as they will do, not reconfigure entirely the geopolitics of the world and in our lifetime?That is why, with 60 per cent of our trade dependent on Europe, three million jobs tied up with Europe, much of our political weight engaged in Europe, it would be a fundamental denial of our true national interest to turn our backs on Europe.We will never let that happen.For 50 years, Britain has, uncharacteristically, followed not led in Europe. At each and every step.There are debates central to our future coming up: how we reform European economic policy; how we take forward European defence; how we fight organised crime and terrorism.Britain needs its voice strong in Europe and bluntly Europe needs a strong Britain, rock solid in our alliance with the USA, yet determined to play its full part in shaping Europe's destiny.We should only be part of the single currency if the economic conditions are met. They are not window-dressing for a political decision. They are fundamental. But if they are met, we should join, and if met in this parliament, we should have the courage of our argument, to ask the British people for their consent in this Parliament.Europe is not a threat to Britain. Europe is an opportunity.It is in taking the best of the Anglo-Saxon and European models of development that Britain's hope of a prosperous future lies. The American spirit of enterprise; the European spirit of solidarity. We have, here also, an opportunity. Not just to build bridges politically, but economically.What is the answer to the current crisis? Not isolationism but the world coming together with America as a community.What is the answer to Britain's relations with Europe? Not opting out, but being leading members of a community in which, in alliance with others, we gain strength.What is the answer to Britain's future? Not each person for themselves, but working together as a community to ensure that everyone, not just the privileged few get the chance to succeed.This is an extraordinary moment for progressive politics.Our values are the right ones for this age: the power of community, solidarity, the collective ability to further the individual's interests.People ask me if I think ideology is dead. My answer is:In the sense of rigid forms of economic and social theory, yes.The 20th century killed those ideologies and their passing causes little regret. But, in the sense of a governing idea in politics, based on values, no. The governing idea of modern social democracy is community. Founded on the principles of social justice. That people should rise according to merit not birth; that the test of any decent society is not the contentment of the wealthy and strong, but the commitment to the poor and weak.But values aren't enough. The mantle of leadership comes at a price: the courage to learn and change; to show how values that stand for all ages, can be applied in a way relevant to each age.Our politics only succeed when the realism is as clear as the idealism.This party's strength today comes from the journey of change and learning we have made.We learnt that however much we strive for peace, we need strong defence capability where a peaceful approach fails.We learnt that equality is about equal worth, not equal outcomes.Today our idea of society is shaped around mutual responsibility; a deal, an agreement between citizens not a one-way gift, from the well-off to the dependent.Our economic and social policy today owes as much to the liberal social democratic tradition of Lloyd George, Keynes and Beveridge as to the socialist principles of the 1945 Government.Just over a decade ago, people asked if Labour could ever win again. Today they ask the same question of the Opposition. Painful though that journey of change has been, it has been worth it, every stage of the way.On this journey, the values have never changed. The aims haven't. Our aims would be instantly recognisable to every Labour leader from Keir Hardie onwards. But the means do change.The journey hasn't ended. It never ends. The next stage for New Labour is not backwards; it is renewing ourselves again. Just after the election, an old colleague of mine said: "Come on Tony, now we've won again, can't we drop all this New Labour and do what we believe in?"I said: "It's worse than you think. I really do believe in it."We didn't revolutionise British economic policy - Bank of England independence, tough spending rules - for some managerial reason or as a clever wheeze to steal Tory clothes.We did it because the victims of economic incompetence - 15 per cent interest rates, 3m unemployed - are hard-working families. They are the ones - and even more so, now - with tough times ahead - that the economy should be run for, not speculators, or currency dealers or senior executives whose pay packets don't seem to bear any resemblance to the performance of their companies.Economic competence is the pre-condition of social justice.We have legislated for fairness at work, like the minimum wage which people struggled a century for. But we won't give up the essential flexibility of our economy or our commitment to enterprise.Why? Because in a world leaving behind mass production, where technology revolutionises not just companies but whole industries, almost overnight, enterprise creates the jobs people depend on.We have boosted pensions, child benefit, family incomes. We will do more. But our number one priority for spending is and will remain education.Why? Because in the new markets countries like Britain can only create wealth by brain power not low wages and sweatshop labour.We have cut youth unemployment by 75 per cent.By more than any government before us. But we refuse to pay benefit to those who refuse to work. Why? Because the welfare that works is welfare that helps people to help themselves.The graffiti, the vandalism, the burnt out cars, the street corner drug dealers, the teenage mugger just graduating from the minor school of crime: we're not old fashioned or right-wing to take action against this social menace.We're standing up for the people we represent, who play by the rules and have a right to expect others to do the same.And especially at this time let us say: we celebrate the diversity in our country, get strength from the cultures and races that go to make up Britain today; and racist abuse and racist attacks have no place in the Britain we believe in.All these policies are linked by a common thread of principle.Now with this second term, our duty is not to sit back and bask in it. It is across the board, in competition policy, enterprise, pensions, criminal justice, the civil service and of course public services, to go still further in the journey of change. All for the same reason: to allow us to deliver social justice in the modern world.Public services are the power of community in action.They are social justice made real. The child with a good education flourishes. The child given a poor education lives with it for the rest of their life. How much talent and ability and potential do we waste? How many children never know not just the earning power of a good education but the joy of art and culture and the stretching of imagination and horizons which true education brings? Poor education is a personal tragedy and national scandal.Yet even now, with all the progress of recent years, a quarter of 11-year-olds fail their basic tests and almost a half of 16 year olds don't get five decent GCSEs.The NHS meant that for succeeding generations, anxiety was lifted from their shoulders. For millions who get superb treatment still, the NHS remains the ultimate symbol of social justice.But for every patient waiting in pain, that can't get treatment for cancer or a heart condition or in desperation ends up paying for their operation, that patient's suffering is the ultimate social injustice.And the demands on the system are ever greater. Children need to be better and better educated.People live longer. There is a vast array of new treatment available.And expectations are higher. This is a consumer age. People don't take what they're given. They demand more.We're not alone in this. All round the world governments are struggling with the same problems.So what is the solution? Yes, public services need more money. We are putting in the largest ever increases in NHS, education and transport spending in the next few years; and on the police too. We will keep to those spending plans. And I say in all honesty to the country: if we want that to continue and the choice is between investment and tax cuts, then investment must come first.There is a simple truth we all know. For decades there has been chronic under-investment in British public services. Our historic mission is to put that right; and the historic shift represented by the election of June 7 was that investment to provide quality public services for all comprehensively defeated short-term tax cuts for the few.We need better pay and conditions for the staff; better incentives for recruitment; and for retention. We're getting them and recruitment is rising.This year, for the first time in nearly a decade, public sector pay will rise faster than private sector pay.And we are the only major government in Europe this year to be increasing public spending on health and education as a percentage of our national income.This Party believes in public services; believes in the ethos of public service; and believes in the dedication the vast majority of public servants show; and the proof of it is that we're spending more, hiring more and paying more than ever before.Public servants don't do it for money or glory. They do it because they find fulfilment in a child well taught or a patient well cared-for; or a community made safer and we salute them for it.All that is true. But this is also true.That often they work in systems and structures that are hopelessly old fashioned or even worse, work against the very goals they aim for.There are schools, with exactly the same social intake. One does well; the other badly.There are hospitals with exactly the same patient mix. One performs well; the other badly.Without reform, more money and pay won't succeed.First, we need a national framework of accountability, inspection; and minimum standards of delivery.Second, within that framework, we need to free up local leaders to be able to innovate, develop and be creative.Third, there should be far greater flexibility in the terms and conditions of employment of public servants.Fourth, there has to be choice for the user of public services and the ability, where provision of the service fails, to have an alternative provider.If schools want to develop or specialise in a particular area; or hire classroom assistants or computer professionals as well as teachers, let them. If in a Primary Care Trust, doctors can provide minor surgery or physiotherapists see patients otherwise referred to a consultant, let them.There are too many old demarcations, especially between nurses, doctors and consultants; too little use of the potential of new technology; too much bureaucracy, too many outdated practices, too great an adherence to the way we've always done it rather than the way public servants would like to do it if they got the time to think and the freedom to act.It's not reform that is the enemy of public services. It's the status quo.Part of that reform programme is partnership with the private or voluntary sector.Let's get one thing clear. Nobody is talking about privatising the NHS or schools.Nobody believes the private sector is a panacea.There are great examples of public service and poor examples. There are excellent private sector companies and poor ones. There are areas where the private sector has worked well; and areas where, as with parts of the railways, it's been a disaster.Where the private sector is used, it should not make a profit simply by cutting the wages and conditions of its staff.But where the private sector can help lever in vital capital investment, where it helps raise standards, where it improves the public service as a public service, then to set up some dogmatic barrier to using it, is to let down the very people who most need our public services to improve.This programme of reform is huge: in the NHS, education, including student finance, - we have to find a better way to combine state funding and student contributions criminal justice; and transport.I regard it as being as important for the country as Clause IV's reform was for the Party, and obviously far more important for the lives of the people we serve.And it is a vital test for the modern Labour PartyIf people lose faith in public services, be under no illusion as to what will happen.There is a different approach waiting in the wings. Cut public spending drastically; let those that can afford to, buy their own services; and those that can't, will depend on a demoralised, sink public service. That would be a denial of social justice on a massive scale.It would be contrary to the very basis of community.So this is a battle of values. Let's have that battle but not amongst ourselves. The real fight is between those who believe in strong public services and those who don't.That's the fight worth having.In all of this, at home and abroad, the same beliefs throughout: that we are a community of people, whose self-interest and mutual interest at crucial points merge, and that it is through a sense of justice that community is born and nurtured.And what does this concept of justice consist of?Fairness, people all of equal worth, of course. But also reason and tolerance. Justice has no favourites; not amongst nations, peoples or faiths.When we act to bring to account those that committed the atrocity of September 11, we do so, not out of bloodlust.We do so because it is just. We do not act against Islam. The true followers of Islam are our brothers and sisters in this struggle. Bin Laden is no more obedient to the proper teaching of the Koran than those Crusaders of the 12th century who pillaged and murdered, represented the teaching of the Gospel.It is time the west confronted its ignorance of Islam. Jews, Muslims and Christians are all children of Abraham.This is the moment to bring the faiths closer together in understanding of our common values and heritage, a source of unity and strength.It is time also for parts of Islam to confront prejudice against America and not only Islam but parts of western societies too.America has its faults as a society, as we have ours.But I think of the Union of America born out of the defeat of slavery.I think of its Constitution, with its inalienable rights granted to every citizen still a model for the world.I think of a black man, born in poverty, who became chief of their armed forces and is now secretary of state Colin Powell and I wonder frankly whether such a thing could have happened here.I think of the Statue of Liberty and how many refugees, migrants and the impoverished passed its light and felt that if not for them, for their children, a new world could indeed be theirs.I think of a country where people who do well, don't have questions asked about their accent, their class, their beginnings but have admiration for what they have done and the success they've achieved.I think of those New Yorkers I met, still in shock, but resolute; the fire fighters and police, mourning their comrades but still head held high.I think of all this and I reflect: yes, America has its faults, but it is a free country, a democracy, it is our ally and some of the reaction to September 11 betrays a hatred of America that shames those that feel it.So I believe this is a fight for freedom. And I want to make it a fight for justice too. Justice not only to punish the guilty. But justice to bring those same values of democracy and freedom to people round the world.And I mean: freedom, not only in the narrow sense of personal liberty but in the broader sense of each individual having the economic and social freedom to develop their potential to the full. That is what community means, founded on the equal worth of all.The starving, the wretched, the dispossessed, the ignorant, those living in want and squalor from the deserts of Northern Africa to the slums of Gaza, to the mountain ranges of Afghanistan: they too are our cause.This is a moment to seize. The Kaleidoscope has been shaken. The pieces are in flux. Soon they will settle again. Before they do, let us re-order this world around us.Today, humankind has the science and technology to destroy itself or to provide prosperity to all. Yet science can't make that choice for us. Only the moral power of a world acting as a community, can."By the strength of our common endeavour we achieve more together than we can alone".For those people who lost their lives on September 11 and those that mourn them; now is the time for the strength to build that community. Let that be their memorial.

aVThe paradox of the modern world is this:We've never been more interdependent in our needs; andWe've never been more individualist in our outlook.Globalisation and technology open up vast new opportunities but also cause massive insecurity.The values of progressive politics - solidarity, justice for all - have never been more relevant; and their application never more in need of modernisation.Internationally, we need a new global partnership, that moves beyond a narrow view of national interest.At home, it means taking the great progressive 1945 settlement and reforming it around the needs of the individual as consumer and citizen for the 21st century.What we did for the Labour party in the new clause IV, freeing us from outdated doctrine and practice, we must now do, through reform, for Britain's public services and welfare state.We are at a crossroads: Party, Government, country.Do we take modest though important steps of improvement?Or do we make the great push forward for transformation?I believe we're at our best when at our boldest.So far, we've made a good start but we've not been bold enough.Interdependence is obliterating the distinction between foreign and domestic policy.It was the British economy that felt the aftermath of 11 September.Our cities who take in refugees from the 13 million now streaming across the world from famine, disease or conflict.Our young people who die from heroin imported from Afghanistan.It is our climate that is changing.Today, a nation's chances are measured not just by its own efforts but by its place in the world.Influence is power is prosperity.We are an island nation, small in space, 60 million in people but immense in history and potential.We can take refuge in the mists of Empire but it is a delusion that national identity is best preserved in isolation, that we should venture out in the world only at a time of emergency.There is a bold side to the British character.And there is a cautious side.Both have their time and season.Caution is often born of common sense, a great British trait.But there are times when caution is retreat and retreat is dangerous.Now, at the start of the 21st Century, is a time for reaching out.The cold war is over.The US is the only superpower.The Americans stand strong and proud, but at times resented.Europe is economically powerful but not yet politically coherent.Russia is breaking free from its past but still carrying the burden.For China and India, power is only a matter of time.For the moment,Japan is changing,South America struggling, Asia emerging;Africa impoverished; the Middle East unstable.The world can go in two ways.Countries can become rivals in power, or partners.Partnership is the antidote to unilateralism.For all the resentment of America, remember one thing.The basic values of America are our values too, British and European and they are good values. Democracy, freedom, tolerance, justice.It's easy to be anti-American.There's a lot of it about but remember when and where this alliance was forged: here in Europe, in World War II when Britain and America and every decent citizen in Europe joined forces to liberate Europe from the Nazi evil.My vision of Britain is not as the 51st state of anywhere, but I believe in this alliance and I will fight long and hard to maintain it.I'm not saying we always apply our values correctly.But I've lost count of the number of supposedly intelligent people who've said to me.You don't understand the Serbs. They're very attached to Milosevic. No they weren't.The Afghans are different. They like religious extremism. No they didn't.The Iraqis don't have the same tradition of political freedom. No they don't but I bet they'd like to.Our values aren't western values.They're human values, and anywhere, anytime people are given the chance, they embrace them.Around these values, we build our global partnership.Europe and America together.Russia treated as a friend and equal.China and India seeking not rivalry but cooperation and for all nations the basis of our partnership not power alone but a common will based on common values.Applied in an even-handed way.Some say the issue is Iraq. Some say it is the Middle East Peace Process. It's both.Some say it's poverty. Some say it's terrorism. It's both.I know the worry over Iraq. People accept Saddam is bad.But they fear it's being done for the wrong motives.They fear us acting alone.So the United Nations route.Let us lay down the ultimatum.Let Saddam comply with the will of the UN.So far most of you are with me.But here is the hard part.If he doesn't comply, then consider.If at this moment having found the collective will to recognise the danger, we lose our collective will to deal with it, then we will destroy not the authority of America or Britain but of the United Nations itself.Sometimes and in particular dealing with a dictator, the only chance of peace is a readiness for war.But we need coalitions not just to deal with evil by force if necessary, but coalitions for peace, coalitions to tackle poverty, ignorance and disease.A coalition to fight terrorism and a coalition to give Africa hope.A coalition to re-build the nation of Afghanistan as strong as the coalition to defeat the Taliban.A coalition to fight the scourge of AIDS, to protect the planet from climate change every bit as powerful as the coalition for free trade, free markets and free enterprise.And yes what is happening in the Middle East now is ugly and wrong.The Palestinians living in increasingly abject conditions, humiliated and hopeless; Israeli civilians brutally murdered.I agree UN resolutions should apply here as much as to Iraq.But they don't just apply to Israel. They apply to all parties.And there is only one answer.By this year's end, we must have revived final status negotiations and they must have explicitly as their aims:an Israeli state free from terror, recognised by the Arab world and a viable Palestinian state based on the boundaries of 1967.For Britain to help shape this new world, Britain needs to be part of it.Our friendship with America is a strength.So is our membership of Europe.We should make the most of both.And in Europe, never more so than now.The single currency is a fact, but will Europe find the courage for economic reform?Europe is to become 25 nations, one Europe for the first time since Charlemagne, but will it be as a union of nation states or as a centralised superstate?It has taken the first steps to a common defence policy, but will it be a friend or a rival to NATO?The answers to these questions are crucial to Britain.They matter to the British economy, our country, our way of life.And the way to get the right answers, is by being in there, vigorous, confident, leading in Europe not limping along several paces behind.That's why the Euro is not just about our economy but our destiny.We should only join the Euro if the economic tests are met.That is clear.But if the tests are passed, we go for it.Interdependence is the core reality of the modern world.It is revolutionising our idea of national interest.It is forcing us to locate that interest in the wider international community.It is making solidarity - a great social democratic ideal - our route to practical survival.Partnership is statesmanship for the 21st Century.We need now the same clarity of vision for our country.I have learnt this in 5 years of government.The radical decision is usually the right one.The right decision is usually the hardest one.And the hardest decisions are often the least popular at the time.The starting point is not policy. It's hope.I sometimes think the whole of politics can be reduced to a battle between pessimism and hope.Because from hope comes change.At times, in Britain we lack self- belief.Britain is a great country. On the way up.Fourth largest economy in the world.The best mortgage, inflation and unemployment figures for a generation.Long-term youth unemployment now down to 5,400 for the whole of Britain.Compare that with three million unemployed under the Tories and then understand the difference a Labour Government can make.As a result, the welfare bills of failure are falling; so we can spend£6 billion a year more today on pensioners than in 1997 and that's also the difference a Labour Government makes.In arts and culture, we lead the world in awards, prizes and talent.Our armed forces are the best anywhere.Our school system has now been judged, by the most authoritative international analysis, among the top eight in the world, above France and Germany.More students than ever before go to university. Our universities are widely regarded as the best in Europe.I understand the anxiety of students affected by the marking down of their A levels.We are totally committed to helping them.But perhaps mistakes like this can be avoided if in future, when our students do well, we praise the students, thank the teachers instead of thinking we must have failed, when actually we've done better.For all the attacks on the NHS, listen to this story of a woman who has breast cancer.Screened because she was one of the 140,000 extra now checked a year.Who saw a consultant within 2 weeks.Saw him because now every urgent patient suspected of cancer has to be seen within 2 weeks.Treated within four weeks because that is now the maximum time for breast cancer treatment.Five years ago, even two years ago, none of that would have been guaranteed.That's what we meant when in 1997 we said Britain was going to get better.That's what the Tories hate.They sneer at the investment.Pessimism about Britain is now the official strategy of the Tories.The purpose is not just to undermine the Government, but to undermine Government, to destroy the belief that we can collectively achieve anything, to drench progress in cynicism, to sully the hope from which energy, action and change all spring.Now they've gone "compassionate".Know what it means?We are going to run down your schools but we feel really bad about it.We're going to charge you to see a GP but we really wish we weren't.We're going to put more children in poverty but this time we'll honestly feel very guilty about it.In Opposition, Labour was trying to escape policies we didn't believe in. It was a journey of conviction.Today's Tories are trying to escape policies they do believe in.Theirs is a journey of convenience and it fools no-one least of all themselves.There's no cause for pessimism, we should believe in ourselves and use that self-beliefto choose now and irrevocably the path of reform.The 20th Century was a century of savage slaughter, insane ideology, and unparalleled progress.Progress won in the end.Governments used collective power through the state, to provide opportunity for the masses.But in time the institutions of that power became huge interests in their own right.And the people became more prosperous, more assertive, more individualist.Eventually, the 1980s saw a reaction by the individual against collective power in all its forms.Now with globalisation, a new era has begun. People are no less individualist, but they are insecure.Modern prosperity may be greater but modern life is pressure and stress.20th Century collective power was exercised through the Big State.Their welfare was paternalistic, handing down from on high.That won't do today.Just as mass production has departed from industry, so the monolithic provision of services has to depart from the public sector.People want an individual service for them.They want Government under them not over them.They want Government to empower them, not control them.And they want equality of both opportunity and responsibility.They want to know the same rules that apply to them, apply to all.Out goes the Big State. In comes the Enabling State.Out goes a culture of benefits and entitlements. In comes a partnership of rights and responsibilities.That's why we need reform.Reform is just a word.It has no meaning in itself. It's the purpose of it that matters.I will tell you why I am passionate about reform.Because poor public services and welfare are usually for the poorest.The better-off can buy a better education or move to a better area or know a better doctor; or find a better job.Those great Governments of 1906 and 1945 did great things.They inherited a situation where the majority were have-nots and made them haves.But prosperity never reached all the way down.We went from being a30-70 country to being a 70-30 one.Today it's not enough. Not morally.Not economically where we need every last drop of potential to be fulfilled, if Britain is to succeed.Let me spell it out.In education, we need to move to the post-comprehensive era, where schools keep the comprehensive principle of equality of opportunity but where we open up the system to new and different ways of education, built round the needs of the individual child.We need an NHS true to the principle of care on the basis of need, not ability to pay, but personalised, built around the individual patient.Both require an end to the "one size fits all" mass production public service.The purpose of the 20th century welfare state was to treat citizens as equals.The purpose of our 21st century reforms must be to treat them as individuals as well.And we can't make that change by more bureaucracy from the centre, by just flogging the system harder.We need to change the system.It means putting power in the hands of the patient or parent, which is what Alan and Estelle are doing.Why shouldn't an NHS patient be able to book an appointment for an operation at their convenience, just like they could if they paid for it? "At the time I want, with the doctor I want" was Margaret Thatcher's reason for going private.Why shouldn't it be the right for every citizen and why shouldn't it be done within the NHS?Why shouldn't our best hospitals be free to develop their services within the NHS as foundation hospitals?Why shouldn't there be a range of schools for parents to choose from: from specialist schools to the new City Academies, to faith schools, to sixth forms and sixth form colleges offering excellent routes into university and skilled employment?Why shouldn't good schools expand or take over failing schools or form federations?It means power in the hands of the professionals.Why shouldn't nurses prescribe medicines or order x-rays?Why shouldn't classroom assistants and IT specialists be every bit as important as teachers in the future?Why should a consultant who does 30 NHS operations a week not be paid more than one who does 10?Why should a teacher who wants to stay in the classroom and is superb at it not be paid the same as a Head of Department?Every time, the reform is tough, just keep one thing in mind: the child in a school where barely any pupils take "A" levels, where only 20 per cent get good GCSEs and where the majority know they will just end up as one of the 7 million British adults who can't even read or write properly.The only difference between that child and mine is one had a chance in life and the other had none.If the status quo was good enough, that child would be a figment of our imagination.The fact that such children do exist - thousands of them every year in Britain - is why reform is the road to social justice, not its denial.Do you know what really holds back change?The pessimism that says: go on, you can't really have top quality services for all.It's like the Tories who argue you dumb down if 50% of young people go to university though of course three quarters of middle class children already do.As if God distributed ability by class background.I visited the Beswick estate in East Manchester on Saturday with John Prescott. Three years ago going down.Now on the way up. Massive investment.The primary school results dramatically improved.Were the boys and girls in 2002 brighter than their brothers and sisters in 1999? Rubbish.All that's changed is that for the first time in their lives, people are giving them a bit of hope, a bit of belief, a bit of confidence that they're every much as entitled to a start in life as the middle class child five miles up the road.We reject old Tory pessimism.But we on the left have our own pessimism.It's that if we change a cherished institution, we betray it. If we deliver a service in a different way, we trash its founding principles.I agree competition should not be on the basis of cutting wages or employment protection. Demoralised staff don't perform at their best.We should value our public servants.I don't just mean the doctors, nurses, teachers and police.I mean the porters, cleaners, secretaries, administrators, the dinner ladies, the care assistants who day in and day out give time and effort and commitment way beyond their contractual duty.I say to the trade unions: work with us on the best way of delivering the service and we will work with you on ending the two-tier workforce.But let me make one thing plain.We are the only Government anywhere in the Western world that this year, next year, the year after, is increasing both health and education public spending as a percentage of national income. The only one.That is our commitment to public services.We said schools and hospitals first.We're building them. Lots of them.And I am not going to go to parents and children and patients in my constituency or any other and say I'm sorry because there is an argument going on about PFI we're going to put these projects on hold.They don't care who builds them.So long as they're built.I don't care who builds them.So long as they're on cost, on budget, and helping to deliver a better NHS and better State schools for the people of Sedgefield and every other constituency in the land.Between 1979 and 1997, ten new hospitals were built.Through PFI since 1997, 15 new hospitals built and 100 on the way.550 schools are being re-built or modernised.In Glasgow, the whole of the secondary school system is being re-built with 12 brand new schools.All under PFI.And every single part of the service remains universal and free at the point of use.Come on: this isn't the betrayal of public services. It's their renewal.All that is happening is that here, as round the rest of the world, we are dividing means and ends. The ends, universal provision remain the same.The means of delivery, partnership between public, private and voluntary sectors and between state and citizen, change.Pensions is probably the biggest current worry for the workforce.And transport probably the worst area of public services.Over the coming months, we will present long-term proposals for both.But there is no way Government through the general taxpayer can do it all.People still have 1945 expectations of Government.They want it to do things for them.In fact today, Government can only do things with them.It's the same for the economic role for Government.We can empower but we can't run people's lives or their business.In fact the greatest hope for social democracy is the coming together of the social and the economic case for developing human potential.Investment in people, helping them to learn new skills and technology, to start a business or help their business to grow.But it has to be a partnership.And that applies to all walks of life. I know the plight of the farming community.It is serious.I have spent 5 years working on it.We are putting more money into it than the rest of British industry combined.We'll carry on doing it.But it's time this money is used to reform farming so that it has a future, rather than to prop up the failed practices of the past.And I want to stress our commitment to British science.We face a choice.We can use our huge strengths in this area to become world leaders. Or we can be deterred by the Luddite tirades.I have made that choice for Britain. £2bn extra over three years.And I was proud to have made that choice when I sat waiting to be interviewed by David Frost on Sunday, watching an interview with the American actor Christopher Reeve who said he wanted to thank Britain and the British people for taking a lead on research which could help him and others like him all over the world.But the other side of Government helping the citizen is the citizen's responsibility to others.Partnership is also citizenship for the 21st Century.I don't have the toughest job in Government. David Blunkett does.On asylum, where big reform is needed urgently. And on crime.I still hear from time to time this nonsense that crime is not a real Labour issue, and all we have to do is deliver on poverty and opportunity.Of course we have to do that.But try telling a 92 year old pensioner, a Labour supporter for the last 70 years, that she'll have to wait for the Tories to get tough on the young thugs who battered her.That's not a conversation I'm prepared to have.We're the first Government since the war under which crime has fallen not risen.Does that reassure everyone?No.There is less of a chance today of being a victim of crime than at any time for 20 years.Does everyone believe it? No.We have increased the numbers of police to record numbers, toughened the law on everything from rape to benefit fraud.Does that mean everyone feels safer? No.Why? Because the problem is not just crime.It is disrespect.It is anti-social behaviour.It is the drug dealer at the end of the street and no-one seems to be able to do anything about it.This is not only about crime. It is about hard-working families who play the rules seeing those who don't, getting away with it.The street crime initiative has been one of the most successful exercises in partnership between Government and police in living memory.Not my words, but those of the Chief Constables.But what was fascinating was not the initiative itself, but what it uncovered.Outdated identity parades taking weeks if not months to organise. Defendants who didn't answer to their bail and never got punished for it.Police officers told it was a breach of civil liberties to check whether defendants were obeying bail conditions.It's not civil liberties.It's lunacy.Drug addicts with previous offences routinely bailed though everyone knew what they would be doing between bail and trial.Magistrates unable to remand persistent young offenders in custody because no places existed in prison or secure accommodation.The whole system full of excellent people, worn down and worn out.Step by step David and his team, working with the police are putting it right.Later this year we will introduce the Criminal Justice and Sentencing Reform Bill.It will re-balance the system emphatically and in favour of the victims of crime.Old rules will be swept away; court procedures simplified; sentencing built round the offender as well as the offence, with those on drugs getting treatment or custody.More police on the beat. More Community Support Officers.Instant fines for anti-social behaviour.Parents of truants who refuse to cooperate with the school will be fined or lose benefit.Anti-social tenants and their anti-social landlords who make money out of abusing Housing Benefit, while making life hell for the community, should lose their right to it.Those who assault teachers or nurses should go to jail.And from early next year, wealthy drug dealers or organised criminals with money in their bank account or a home or an asset of any sort but no lawful means of support will have it taken from them unless they show it was come by lawfully not through crime.For 100 years, our Criminal Justice System like our welfare system was based on a messy compromise between liberals and authoritarians.The liberals tended to view crime as primarily about social causes and the welfare system primarily about giving to the poor.The authoritarians wanted harsh penalties and as ungenerous a benefit system as possible.The compromise was a Criminal Justice System weighted in favour of the defendant but with harsh penalties for the convicted; and a passive welfare system with mean benefits.In short, the worst of all worlds.In its place, a new contract between citizen and community.We give opportunity to all.We demand responsibility from all.We are investing heavily in the biggest anti-poverty strategy of any Government for half a century.On top of record investment in education, we've introduced the New Deal, the Working Families Tax Credit, record increases in Child Benefit and Income Support, Sure Start.To the majority who are reasonably well off, these are just words.To people who need them, they can be transforming.I saw it last week in Hackney, where a woman said till Sure Start came along she felt trapped in her council flat, looking after her child.Now the child had a creche to go to; the mother had a network of friends and contacts; she got a job.She was happy.I've seen it at Ferryhill in my own Sedgefield constituency.It is a great feeling.You're the local MP.But you're also the Prime Minister.And the government you lead has created centres like those all over the country.And you can see the impact for the better on the lives of people who elected you.And what was brilliant about Sure Start at Ferryhill wasn't just the fantastic new facilities, the creche and nursery, the help and advice for families.It was the buzz of mums and dads, staff and helpers taking control, not just of their own lives but of the community, making those lives and that community better.That is what we mean by the redistribution of power, wealth and opportunity to the many not the few.The modern Welfare State must be active, not passive, put partnership in place of paternalism.That's what a modern civic society, with reformed public services and welfare can do.But it also means changes to politics itself.The same issues that confront our public services - collapse of deference, rise of individualism, a desire for involvement apply in equal measure to the conduct of politics.I don't have all the answers.I don't have all the levers. The other parties.Local politicians.The media.Pressure groups. Anyone with a vested interest in a healthy democracy has a role to play here.For us, I accept a big majority means a big responsibility to make Parliament more relevant and do more in Parliament.And our very political strength means that when voters get disengaged the challenge is for us to find out why and do something about it.Next time, we want to win but we want to do it on a turn out of more than 59%.Our relations too, Party leadership and members, has to change.You've lost your love of discipline for its own sake.I've lost my love of popularity for its own sake.Soon, we will present proposals to you for the renewal of our membership base, policy discussion and our links with other parties around the world.The alternative is a return to self destruction, the perennial disease of centre-left Governments. Never let us fall for the far left's eternal delusion: that if there is dissatisfaction with a moderate centre-left Government this can be manipulated into support for a far-left Government.It results only in one thing. Always has. Always will: the return of a right-wing Tory Government.Displeasing people; pockets of disillusion; impatience and frustration.These are not the hallmarks of this Labour Government.They are the hallmarks of Government.The test is to listen, adapt and move forward.Up to 1997, do you know how many years of the 20th century Labour was in power with a substantial majority?Nine. By the end of this Parliament, we will have doubled it.We learnt the hard way.But now we have to show that we have the capacity not only to learn but to transform, to show what a liberated modern social democracy can do.We can do it. I'm an optimist.Why?Because there is change happening.Ten years ago people asked would Labour ever win again.Now, they ask it of the Tories.Ten years ago, they asked if we were fit to manage the economy.Now thanks to the vision and brilliance of Gordon Brown, we have succeeded beyond any previous Labour or Tory Government. Not by chance.Every part of it - from the first years of discipline, through to Bank of England independence through to reform of tax and benefits to make work pay - was a bold choice.The right-wing never deserved their reputation for economic competence.And we've made sure they'll never have exclusive rights to it again.Ten years ago, claims that the minimum wage would cost a million jobs were the centrepiece of John Major's election campaign: now it's the law, business and trade unions agree it, and the Tories have to pretend they were in favour of it all along. At our best when at our boldest.For four elections, anyone who said investment before tax cuts was brave but doomed.In 2001, we did it and it is those who oppose the investment who are on the run.The New Deal was savaged by the Tories, challenged politically, challenged legally, challenged by business.Now it's in its sixth year, over a million people have been helped by it and not one Tory candidate dares to stand up and say we should abolish it. At our best when at our boldest.Remember how devolution would break-up Britain?And now there is a Scottish Parliament and a Welsh Assembly, the nationalists are running from their separatism and not a single party in Britain proposes going back. And in Northern Ireland, for all the difficulties, Republicans and Unionists sit in Government together and the principle of consent is accepted North and South on the island of Ireland for the first time in 80 years.At our best when at our boldest.And remember how for 100 years we tried to reform the House of Lords and now the reform is happening, the hereditary peers are leaving and the attack is that it doesn't go far enough?The equal age of consent passed massively in the House of Commons.The first black Cabinet Minister. Record numbers of women Cabinet Ministers.Record numbers of women MPs.From progress here to life and death, abroad, it is happening.A month ago I visited Beira District Hospital in Mozambique. There are as many doctors in the whole of Mozambique as there are in Oldham. I saw four children to a bed, sick with malaria. Nurses dying of AIDS faster than others can be recruited. Tens of thousands of children dying in that country needlessly every year.I asked a doctor: what hope is there? Britain is our hope, he said. Thanks to you we have debt relief. Thanks to you we have new programmes to fight AIDS and malaria. Thanks to you the docks at Maputo are being rebuilt and we can sell our goods abroad.When you tire of knocking on the door, putting the leaflet in the envelope, wonder what its all about and what its all for, reflect on that doctor, feel proud of what you do, and understand that's what we elect a Labour government for.We haven't just nailed the myths about Labour of old; we've created some legend of achievement about New Labour too.We've been at our best when we've been at our boldest.And now we need to be again.And all it takes, is for us to do what we believe in.We believe in a school system of equal opportunity for all. But we don't yet have it.We believe in an NHS with equal access for all; but not all get it.We believe in punishing the guilty and acquitting the innocent but it's not what happens.We believe in ridding Britain of child poverty but children are still poor.We believe in Europe but we're not yet at the centre of it.There's nothing wrong with the old principles but if the old ways worked, they'd have worked by now.If you believe in social justice, in solidarity, in equality of opportunity and responsibility, then believe in the reforms to get us there.Now is the time.To quicken the march of progress not mark time.What started with the renewal of the Labour Party only ends with the renewal of Britain.Pessimism or hopeDespair or confidenceDecline or renewalAt our best when at our boldest.This is not the time to abandon our journey of modernisation but to see it through.

aVIt's my privilege to be the first Labour leader in 100 years to speak to our conference six and half years into Government.We've never been here before. We've never come this far. Never governed for so long. Now with the prospect of a full third term.But it's a testing time.I now look my age. You feel yours. I've had plenty of advice over what I should say in this speech. Some of it I have even asked for. One suggestion was leading you all in chorus of "Always look on the bright side of life."So what do we do. Give up on it. Or get on with it? That's the question.Yes the cynics say, New Labour's been a great electoral machine but you've done little with it.I could recite you the statistics: The lowest inflation, mortgage rates, and unemployment for decades. The best ever school results, with over 60,000 more 11 year olds every year now reaching required standards in English and Maths. Cardiac deaths down 19 per cent since 1997, cancer deaths 9 per cent. Burglaries down 39 per cent.But it's not statistics that tell us what has changed, it's people.The lone parent I met, for years unemployed and unemployable. Now not just in work through the New Deal but winning promotion.What mattered to her most? Not the money alone but the respect her child gained for her, seeing her work, grow in confidence, becoming a role model. One of two million people the New Deal has helped since 1997. That's what this Labour government has done for Britain.Or the children I met this month at a brand new academy in Thamesmead in one of the most deprived estates in the country.In the past, children skipped their old school as often as attending. And 2 years ago, just three pupils, yes three out of an entire year of 114, got 5 good GCSE passes.That failing school now empty. In its place a new £31m building, on time. Where teachers want to teach. Young people want to learn and parents want their children to go.In one year attendance has now reached over 90% and GCSE results have soared.The new school, its new attitude was summed up by one young student who told me she had been badgering her mum all week to buy an alarm-clock, as she was scared of sleeping in case she missed a single lesson. What better symbol of the opportunities we are giving our children.Or the young boy on Merseyside I met having treatment for cancer - every parent's nightmare - but whose parents can't praise enough the care and treatment he's received from the NHS.No complaints from them. Just astonishment and admiration at the commitment and compassion of NHS staff and pride in our health service.The money isn't wasted. It's not disappearing down some black hole. It's there in bricks and mortar, in computers and machines.In 1997, nearly half, yes half of the hospital buildings in the NHS were built before it came into existence, and now it is down to a quarter and falling fast. That's the difference we are making in this country. And most of all, we should be proud of every single teacher, doctor, nurse and police officer we have recruited. Proud we have increased public service pay. It means we will recruit the thousands of extra staff we need but it also means we are beginning to reward properly the staff we already have for the superb job they do.Add to that our constitutional change, devolution in Scotland and Wales, with nationalism now in disarray, self-government for London, the Freedom of Information Act, the Human Rights Act, the first open and transparent rules on Party funding.And there is one piece of unfinished business which we will soon be completing. The abolition of the remaining hereditary peers. Never again in Britain will someone have the right to make laws which affect the lives of ordinary families solely because their ancestor was a duke, an earl or a viscount.Add to that what we achieved for peace in Northern Ireland.And let none of us forget, it is your Government that even in harsher economic times, is growing our aid budget, leading the way on cutting Third World debt, $70 billion already committed globally, and has just helped broker the deal that will give HIVAIDS patients in Africa improved access to drugs.In a host of ways, from a strengthening of the law against racial violence, to equal rights for same sex couples, setting up the Disability Rights Commission, action on domestic violence, changes that will never be reflected in an opinion poll, rarely hit a headline, rarely be heard outside those who benefit from it, in a world where a grain of sensation gets more attention than a mountain of genuine achievements - that's the difference you have made to Britain.So why is it so tough?Government's tough. Fulfilling but tough. Opposition was easy.All our MPs had to do was to go back to their constituencies and blame it on the Government. Some of them still do.May 1997 was a unique moment. An abundance of expectation surrounded our arrival. A sense of hope beyond ordinary imagining. The people felt it. We felt it. Instead of reining in the expectation, we gave it free rein. It was natural, but born of inexperience. We thought change was a matter of will. Have the right programme, spend the right money and the job is done. But experience has taught us: the job is never done.If we expected bouquets every day, we should have stayed in Opposition. We shouldn't want thanks. It's a privilege to do the job, however tough.And in Government, you expect things to happen but the things that happen are not the things you expect, at least not on 1 May 1997.Iraq has divided the international community. It has divided the party, the country, families, friends. I know many people are disappointed, hurt, angry. I know many profoundly believe the action we took was wrong . I do not at all disrespect anyone who disagrees with me. I ask just one thing: attack my decision but at least understand why I took it and why I would take the same decision again.Imagine you are PM. And you receive this intelligence. And not just about Iraq. But about the whole murky trade in WMD. And one thing we know. Not from intelligence. But from historical fact. That Saddam's regime has not just developed but used such weapons gassing thousands of his own people. And has lied about it consistently, concealing it for years even under the noses of the UN Inspectors.And I see the terrorism and the trade in WMD growing. And I look at Saddam's country and I see its people in torment ground underfoot by his and his sons' brutality and wickedness. So what do I do? Say "I've got the intelligence but I've a hunch its wrong?" Leave Saddam in place but now with the world's democracies humiliated and him emboldened?You see, I believe the security threat of the 21st century is not countries waging conventional war. I believe that in today's interdependent world the threat is chaos. It is fanaticism defeating reason.Suppose the terrorists repeated September 11th or worse. Suppose they got hold of a chemical or biological or nuclear dirty bomb; and if they could, they would. What then?And if it is the threat of the 21st century, Britain should be in there helping confront it, not because we are America's poodle, but because dealing with it will make Britain safer.There was no easy choice. So whatever we each of us thought, let us agree on this. We who started the war must finish the peace. Those British soldiers who died are heroes. We didn't regret the fall of Milosovic, the removal of the Taliban or the liberation of Sierra Leone and whatever the disagreement Iraq is a better country without Saddam.And why do I stay fighting to keep in there with America on the one hand and Europe on the other? Because I know terrorism can't be defeated unless America and Europe work together. And it's not so much American unilateralism I fear. It's isolation. It's walking away when we need America there engaged. Fighting to get world trade opened up. Fighting to give hope to Africa. Changing its position for the future of the world, on climate change. And staying with it in the Middle East, telling Israel and the Palestinians: don't let the extremists decide the fate of the peace process, when the only hope is two states living side by side in peace.And it's not Britain being swallowed up in some European federal nightmare as if Britain wasn't strong enough to hold its own, that I fear. It's Britain leaving the centre of Europe retreating to its margin at the very moment when the fate of Europe is being decided, 10 new nations and Britain's leadership has never been more essential. That's why apart from all the good economic reasons it is madness for Britain to give up the option of joining the Euro.And I know both on terrorism and on Europe my views cause offence. But I can no more concede to parts of the left on the one than I can genuflect to the right over the other. Because I believe both positions are vital in delivering justice in a modern world.The original Conference title read "Fairness For All". We changed it to "A Future Fair For All". Let us be absolutely clear about where we are today and why. Everything we have done has led up to this moment. To bring new hope and opportunity to the lives of all our citizens we always knew we would have to do something that Labour Governments have never succeeded in before - to renew in power, as we renewed to achieve power.People ask me if I am surprised that things have got so tough. I say I am surprised it has taken so long. Why? I've been trying to say this to you for the best part of 10 years but never quite found the words.But now I've hit the rough patch, its time to try again.Up to now there has been a ritual to Labour Governments, Euphoria on victory. Hard slog in Government. Tough times. Party accuses leadership of betrayal. Leadership accuses Party of ingratitude. Disillusion. Defeat. Long period of Tory Government before next outbreak of euphoria. We've been far better at defeating ourselves than the Tories have ever been.Apart from 1974-79, which was fragile from the first, each Labour Government has been a spasmodic interval punctuating otherwise unbroken Conservative rule. For too many of our 100 years we have been a well-intentioned pressure group. We fight injustice. We argue our causes. But our psychology has been that of people who know, deep down, someone else is the governing party and we are the ones championing the grievance.So, after a time, after we have righted the most obvious wrongs of the Conservatives, we fold up. We return to our comfort zone.Then came New Labour. From the outset, our opponents hated and feared us. They believe the Tories have a divine right to rule Britain and we are usurpers. They look at their own Party and feel contempt. And they hate us even more because they think we're responsible. And in a sense we are. By occupying the centre ground, by modernising, by reaching out beyond our activists, we helped turn the Tories into a replica of what we used to be. A narrow base. Obsessed about the wrong things. Old fashioned. In retreat.When the Tories lose an election now anywhere in the country, they say it's not their natural territory. Like Scotland is not natural Tory territory. Like Wales is not natural Tory territory. Like the North of England is not natural Tory territory. Like the big cities are not natural Tory territory. Like Harwich, Hastings and Hove aren't natural Tory territory. If I was a Conservative I would be wondering where on earth is our natural territory. We always knew the Tories didn't have a heart. Their problem now is they haven't got a heartland.No wonder they keep trying to reinvent themselves. From cuddly Conservatives to compassionate Conservatives to caring Conservatives. When are they going to realise it's not the first word that's the problem, it's the second.But one thing they have succeeded in. As they always do. Right from the beginning of New Labour they set up the eternal false choice of progressive politics. That in Government we either revert to the past; or we stand for nothing. That we are either incompetent or compromised. That if policy is modernised, belief is betrayed. And it plays to our own fears. Yes, New Labour a clever piece of marketing, good at winning elections, but hollow where the heart should be.New Labour for me was never a departure from belief. It is my belief. The just society in which each person is a full and equal citizen of our land, irrespective of birth, class, wealth, race or sex. Where through solidarity we build a society in which collective strength compensates for individual weakness.Where privilege cannot just be handed down from generation to generation but success has to be earned on merit. Where self respect and respect for others is the hallmark of our communities and where the fight against poverty and oppression is Britain's mission in the wider world. These are my values and yours. They are the key. But the door they must unlock is the door to the future.Because values not put to work in the real world are mere words, lying idle, there to console us but not to change lives for the better.When almost 10 years ago we ditched the old Clause IV, we didn't do it just to ditch nationalisation. The new Clause IV was a fundamental restatement of ideology. "by the strength of our common endeavour we achieve more than we achieve alone.... a community in which power, wealth and opportunity are in the hands of the many not the few."From now on, we said: we stand for certain values. The values are unchangeable. But the policies are open to change. We made the ends sacrosanct. We put the means up for discussion so that each time could find the right expression for values that are for all time.In the first phase of our transformation, we took the millstones off our neck. We became a Party of economic competence, strong on defence, concerned on law and order. And we won power. And then in our first term we recovered the credibility to govern. We laid foundations.But now, is where we show whether we have the mettle not just to be a longer or even a better Labour Government than those that went before us, but whether we usher in a political era where progressive politics is to the 21st century what conservative politics was to the 20th. I do not just want an historic third term. Our aim must be an historic realignment of the political forces shaping our country and the wider world.Here we are poised, 6½ years in, with a fantastic opportunity, to use or to lose. Yes, this is a testing time. But it is a test not just of belief but of character. And the time is for renewal, not retreat.A delegate said to me last night. "I know what you want really to say", she said: "you want to say: I know what I'm doing. Just let me get on with it." Then she said: "You do know what you are doing don't you?" It's a fair question. I know the old top down approach won't work any more. I know I can't say "I am the leader, follow me". Not that that was your strong point anyway.Over the coming months, I want our Party to begin a new discussion with the people of Britain. Across major policy areas the Government will publish a prospectus, discussing the progress we have made and the challenges our country still faces. We should have the confidence to open up the debate, be honest about the challenges, lay out the real choices.But this must not just be a discussion between us. Because if we want a Government in touch with the Party, we must have a Party in touch with the people.And so let us make this the biggest policy consultation ever to have taken place in this country. The Ministers from me down, our MPs out in every constituency hosting discussions that engage with the whole community.So, when we begin our manifesto process, when the policy forum draws our thinking together, I want it to address the big questions, engage with ordinary people's hopes and fears. A progressive, imaginative, vibrant public debate about how we together build a future fair for all.Not the daily diet of froth; not turning serious politics into soap opera, debasing it, turning it into an endless who knew what, when, as if politicians simply competed on villainy. The British people deserve better from the politicians and with respect, from parts of the media too. But real politics about real people. And in the programme we set out, let our idealism be undimmed, but let us show what experience has taught it.What have we learnt? That from Bank of England independence, to primary school standards, from street crime to PFI hospital building, no change without controversy, no progress without change, no prospect of social justice without reform.We're proud of economic stability. 1½ million more jobs since 1997. A hundred years ago we campaigned for a minimum wage. Tomorrow our minimum wage, the one we introduced in the teeth of Tory opposition is going up again - to £4.50. That means that since its introduction this Labour government has increased the earnings of the lowest pay workers, by over £1,500 a year. Whilst the Tories said it would cost millions of jobs, we can say today that Britain's historic minimum wage is here to stay and it comes with the best record on jobs for 30 years.But we know it's not enough, not in the economy of the future. The fight for a fair future must begin with our number one priority education. At every age, at every stage, education is the surest guarantee of a fair future. At every age and every stage we are breaking down the barriers that hold people back.At birth: a year's maternity leave, paid paternity leave for the first time and now a new trust fund for every child; their own stake in the future. For toddlers, childcare places, nursery places, child tax credits, and Sure Start giving mothers the confidence and support they need. At primary school the basics, so now our children are in the top three in the world for reading. At secondary school, personalised learning for every child in new specialist schools and City Academies. For teenagers, grants to stay on at school, modern apprenticeships, not a thing of the past but a part of the future. And then throughout adult life, new opportunities through Learn Direct to learn more - a language, new skills - every individual the chance to fulfil their potential.At every age, at every stage, opening opportunity not for a privileged few but for all.And we need a modern industrial base, doubling investment in science, leading Europe in the biosciences and technology, more high tech spins off from universities than ever before - not just world beating British ideas but world beating products, British profits, British jobs. And yes new manufacturing jobs - high skills, high tech, exactly the kind of jobs we need for the future.In the economy of the 21st, knowledge, human capital, is the future and fairness demands it is open to all.But a big challenge faces us. As our children are helped at every stage to learn - we are going further than any country in Europe in turning higher education from a privilege for the few to a right for the many. But how do we finance education through life and also get more children into university education that competes with the best in the world?To pretend it will all come from the taxpayer is dishonest. It won't and it wouldn't be fair if it did.And yes the Tories have an alternative to student fees. To cut money going to universities by cutting student numbers. 100,000 fewer students. Is that fair? Who do you think will be the students cut? Their children? And when the universities need more money, do you think they'll raise taxes? No, they'll cut numbers again, when our very economic future depends on us developing people's potential not squandering it.And the Lib Dems? They say they will spend more and it will all come out of raising the top rate of tax to 50 per cent. Except that extra university funding is not all that's to come from the top rate taxpayer. They have commitments to spend more on forty different items running into billions of pounds.All this from the top rate taxpayer. We used to have that policy. Remember squeezing the rich 'til the pips squeaked? Except in the end, it wasn't only the rich that were squeezed; and it wasn't the pips that squeaked, it was us.We can be proud of the new money in our schools and health service, proud that this year, last year and next year spending on health and education is rising faster here than in any other major country. 55,000 more nurses. 25,000 more teachers. 80,000 more classroom assistants. Tremendous.But in the future how can it be fair when for all the advances we have made, a wealthy pensioner waiting on a consultant's list for her hip operation can go to the same consultant and get it done next week if she is able to pay, but a poor pensioner cannot?And how is it fair that well off parents, for all our improvements, who can't get their child into a decent secondary school, can choose to buy a good education but poor parents can't?Choice has always been there for the well off. Excellence has always been at the service of the wealthy. What is unfair is not the right to choose, not the pursuit of excellence but where that choice and that excellence depends on your wealth not your need.Take the case of an elderly woman in the north west, who looked after her dying husband despite her ill-health. After his death, she agreed to have the serious heart operation she needed. But though she was listed as urgent, she was placed on a year-long waiting list. Once she would have had no choice. Now she did. Because of our policies, she was offered the chance to travel to get her heart operation done much more quickly. She jumped at it. After the operation, she said: "I'd go to the ends of the earth to get my health back. It saved me six months of anxiety. Really I feel it saved my life". Choice for her is not a betrayal of our principles. It is our principles.And what progress it was in the 1960s when the comprehensive ended the division of children into successes and failures age 11. What a breakthrough in 1948 when the NHS gave people, who used to scrimp and save and fret to pay, care free at the point of use.But progress in the 21st century demands more, much more. Teaching tailored to each child's ability. A Health Service that brings the benefits of new genetic knowledge to everyone, not a lottery. The patient not at the convenience of the system but the system at the convenience of the patient. And because the world changes we have to change. No longer "one size fits all". Recognising that in the 21st century you can't run a personalised service by remote control.That's the reason for change. Not to level down but to level up. Not to privatise but to revitalise a public service we all depend on.I don't want the middle class fighting to get out of the state system. I want them fighting to get into it but on equal terms with working class patients and children. That's what the founders of socialism dreamt of.And when I read a resolution saying Foundation Hospitals are opposed by an alliance of the BMA and the House of Lords, and yes Tories and Lib Dems too, what are we: a progressive party? If we had listened to that alliance, we would never have had an NHS in the first place.And of course the criminal justice system with its rules and procedures was a vital step of progress when poor people were without representation unjustly convicted by corners cut. But today in Britain in the 21st century it is not the innocent being convicted. It's too many of the guilty going free. Too many victims of crime and always the poorest who are on the front line.And its great we've made a start on reform with record numbers of police officers. But I tell you. We will not hit organised crime until we treat them with the ruthlessness they treat us. We won't tackle crime if we bail drug abusers back on the streets without treatment. And we cannot say we live in a just society, if we do not put an end to the anti-social behaviour, the disrespect, the conduct which we wouldn't tolerate from our own children and shouldn't have to tolerate from someone else's.Responsibility and opportunity. That's why we are investing in our poorest communities. And it's the whole basis of tax credits. If you work, we will help you with the working tax credit. If you are bringing up kids we will support you with child benefit and child tax credit. If you save, we will help you with pension credit that will boost the incomes of half of Britain's pensioners by an average of £400 a year - the biggest advance in combating poverty in old age in a generation but in the future given to those that need it most.And fairness in a future where millions are on the move. Britain should always be open to refugees. We can be proud of the part immigration has played in this country.But economic migrants should come in through a proper immigration process.Changing the law on asylum is the only fair way of helping the genuinely persecuted - and its best defence against racism gaining ground. We have cut asylum applications by a half. But we must go further. We should cut back the ludicrously complicated appeal process, de-rail the gravy train of legal aid, fast-track those from democratic countries, and remove those who fail in their claims without further judicial interference.And in a world of mass migration, with cheaper air travel, and all the problems of fraud, it makes sense to ask whether now in the early 21st century identity cards are no longer an affront to civil liberties but may be the way of protecting them.These are some of the challenges. What's fair when we want not a basic but a good standard of life in retirement that is bound to last longer than ever before. What's fair when the users of universal services want to be treated not as grateful welfare recipients but demanding 21st century consumers. What's fair for the mother who a generation ago would have expected to stay at home but now wants the chance to work flexibly. What's fair in a world in which, in a strong economy, rail and tube are used so much more than in 1997, where we desperately need a 21st century transport system and cannot fairly fund it all from the taxpayer. What's fair in a world where the insecurities multiply so fast and the wheels of government turn so slow. Where we have to pick our way to sanity through a cacophony of pressure and hassle which are not the product of any one moment in time but of the times in which we live.Fairness remade. A Britain without poverty. First class public services. Community renewed. A progressive future within our grasp. The dreams of generations who came to conferences like this becoming real, hopes that were once utopian becoming everyday.The reason I bang the drum for change is I get so angry that it takes so long, restless at how much there is to do. I want us to go faster, further.I think of the people I meet. Holly in Southampton. Teenage mum. Now through Sure Start with childcare. Given help to study so she can become a midwife so she can work in the NHS so another mother can benefit. Why does it take so long for us to realise when we invest in people like her, it's not a cost, it's an investment in our future? Or the NHS manager in Newcastle, 30 years working in the NHS, telling me only in the last three has he done anything other than managing decline or the Chief Police Officer telling me after a lifetime in the service, that it was only with the recent legislation on crime he felt Government understood.And, I stick at it, because I know what's there if we stumble. Not the Government of some hallucination, where no tough decisions have to be taken, the money grows on trees, the Ministers all hold hands and sing Kum-bay-ah, also known as the Lib Dems - what's round the corner is the old Tory days.It's not that long ago that we've all forgotten, is it? The 3m unemployed. The two recessions. The negative equity. The double figure inflation. The 15% interest rates. The cuts in schools and hospitals. The privatising of the railways.And when we get to the next election, believe me. We won't be fighting for votes with the hard left. We'll be fighting the hard right. The Tories. And they'll fight us on immigration, on Europe and above all on tax. And they'll say: you put the money in and nothing happened. That's why they run down the NHS. Because they know if we can change our state schools and our NHS for the better, then they're back where they've never been in 100 years 'til now, a Party of opposition and not even a good one at that.When do Tories succeed? They succeed when people believe politics can't change lives. But we know it can because we see in the faces of the New Dealer and the pupils and the patients and the poorest of our world that politics can make a difference.I remember when our journey to Government began. Here in this Hall in 1985, with Neil Kinnock, here with us today. And, of course today it seems, absurd, doesn't it? Militant, Arthur, all that nonsense. But I tell you. At the time, I remember up there, where the MPs used to be penned in, getting to my feet in the middle of his speech, the Hall split asunder, my heart pounding, wondering if this was the beginning or the end.And what I learnt that day was not about the far left. It was about leadership. Get rid of the false choice: principles or no principles. Replace it with the true choice. Forward or back. I can only go one way. I've not got a reverse gear. The time to trust a politician most is not when they're taking the easy option. Any politician can do the popular things. I know, I used to do a few of them.I know it's hard for people to keep faith. Some of the people may have a different take on me. But I have the same take on them. I trust their decency. I trust their innate good sense. I know I am the same person I always was, older, tougher, more experienced, but basically the same person believing the same things. I've never led this Party by calculation. Policy you calculate. Leadership comes by instinct. I believe the British people will forgive a government mistakes; will put the media onslaught in more perspective than we think; but what they won't forgive is cowardice in the face of a challenge.The answer to any of these challenges is not easy.During the past months on Iraq, I have received letter from parents whose sons have died as soldiers. One believing their son had died in vain and hating me for my decision. Another, a beautiful letter, said they thought Iraq was the right thing to do and though their son was dead, whom they loved dearly, they still thought it was right. And don't believe anyone who tells you when they receive letters like that they don't suffer any doubt. All you can do in a modern world, so confusing with its opportunities and its hazards, is to decide what is the right way and try to walk in it.It's not being out of touch. After 6 years, more battered without but stronger within. It's the only leadership I can offer. And it's the only type of leadership worth having.The purpose: to rebuild the public realm, to discover amongst all the modern pressures, the virtues of community, of tolerance, of decency, of respect. To bring to the self interested consumer age, the value of solidarity. Not to cease to want the best for oneself but to wish it for all. To build a country not just proud of their own achievements, but proud of what we can do together. Proud not just of how they get and spend but what we in friendship with each other can do for each other.This is our challenge.To stride forward where we have always previously stumbled. To renew in government. Steadfast in our values. Radical in our methods. Open in our politics. If we faint in the day of adversity, our strength is small. And ours isn't. We have the strength, the maturity, now the experience to do it.So let it be done.

aVSo here we are facing the possibility unique in our 100 year history, of governing Britain for a third successive term. Never done it before. Never debated it before. Never imagined it before. Progressive parties, like the Labour Party, rarely fail because of their values. Fairness, justice, solidarity, opportunity for all. These are the impulses of any decent human spirit. No. We almost always fail when we don't foresee the future in which those values must be applied. The values require steadfast conviction. But the future requires restless courage to know and act upon the coming reality however hard the challenge it holds. And when the two, conviction and courage combine their strength and take on the challenges, they beat them and in time what was a challenge, becomes part of the new consensus. Reflect on the things once the passionate subject of controversy, people no longer talk about. Remember the march for jobs.No-one talks of mass unemployment now. When two weeks ago it fell to its lowest level for 30 years, it passed without notice. Who did it? The British people, by voting for change. There are people who a decade ago could tell you of interest rates double what they are today, of homes repossessed, of families who didn't know from one week to the next where the mortgage payments were going to come from. But who talks of boom and bust economics today? Who did it? The British people by voting for change. And when was the last time you heard of a winter crisis in the health service or the scandal of outside toilets in primary schools, now that this country, Britain, is the only one anywhere in the developed world increasing public spending on health and education every year, year on year, as a proportion of our national income? And who did it? The British people by voting for change. When did you last hear of pensioners freezing to death in the cold because they couldn't afford the heating? Or how great a debate is there today about the break-up of the United Kingdom, now that Scotland has its Parliament and Wales its Assembly? But twelve years ago an election was fought on it. A week ago, after the talks at Leeds Castle on Northern Ireland, an eighteen year old asked me: "how come we never hear much about Northern Ireland"? But we used to wake up every morning to it, didn't we? And remember when to be in favour of gay rights was to be a loony leftie, race relations was political correctness, and Red Ken frightened people even as brave as your own leadership? Now the parties compete for the gay vote, unite against the BNP and Ken has led and won the debate on congestion charging and community policing. So many things that used to divide our country bitterly, now unite it in healthy consensus. Who did it? The British people, by voting for change. Or when the next election comes, will they say Labour can't run the economy; there'll be a run on the markets; that Labour can't defend Britain or won't support the police? No. Labour is working. Britain is working. The longest period of economic growth since records began, an economy now bigger than that of Italy and France. The lowest unemployment and highest employment rate of any of our competitors for the first time since the 1950s. Living standards up, for everyone, and for the poorest up most. The biggest reductions in child poverty and biggest increases in investment for decades. This isn't a country in decline. The British people aren't a people on the way down. We are winning. They are winning. And why did they vote for change? Because we had the courage of our convictions and we dared to change. So why is Government so tough? Because for all the progress, life's still tough for many hard-working families: if you're a young married couple trying to buy a house; if you're trying to balance home and family life; if you're worried about saving for retirement; if you're scared to walk out at night; if you, the taxpayer, see people who don't deserve it getting benefits, when you can't get the help you need and do deserve. Modern life is being perpetually stressed out. You can do more, travel more, consume more, live longer. But nothing stays still. It's always changing. And for the politicians, it's like having a conversation with people in an area where your mobile phone doesn't work properly. You know what it's like. You hear scraps of the conversation, most of it distorted and it's all intensely irritating. The public think the politicians don't know or care about their lives; and the politicians feel misunderstood. But I am an optimist about Britain; and the difference between an optimist and a pessimist is not that the optimist believes the world is wonderful and the pessimist believes it's beset by challenges; the difference is the pessimist believes we will be defeated by them; the optimist thinks the challenges can be overcome. And meanwhile think how lucky we are. Lucky to have been able to change our Party from one of permanent opposition to one that can compete for government on equal terms. Lucky to be in a country as great as this serving a people as decent as the British people. Lucky to have a Cabinet of talented men and women I'm proud to call friends as well as colleagues. I won't list them all. You know who they are. They know how much I value what they do. But I will mention the two who have been with me, in Opposition and in Government in the same jobs every step of the way. Gordon and John, the one a personal friend for twenty years and the best Chancellor this country has ever had and the other the strongest, most loyal deputy any leader could ever wish for. And we are lucky in our Opposition. I know people say we should take the Lib Dems seriously. But I can't. I like Charles incidentally. But recently he asked "The Lib Dems are doing well but we have to answer the question: what do you stand for?" Charles, my strong advice is: don't go there. The great advantage of the Lib Dems is precisely that no-one knows what they stand for. If they ever find out it'll be the end of you. The Lib Dems voted against every single measure for action against ASB; against withdrawing benefits from failed asylum seekers even when all their appeals were finished; and they believe you can get an extra £30 billion in tax in one Parliament just from top-rate taxpayers, to pay for spending pledges they can't possibly afford. Meanwhile the other part of their Party wants to change our NHS for a system of compulsory private medical insurance. Believe me, Charles, leave the public in blissful ignorance. The Tories by contrast, don't need to ask what they stand for. They know what they stand for. Unfortunately for them, so do the British people. Two recessions, 10 per cent mortgage rates, the poll tax, 3 million unemployed, opposition to the minimum wage and crime doubled. Michael Howard did well at first because people had forgotten him. Now they've remembered. All you need to know is that when his advisers told him the Tories had to become a Party of the future, he brought back John Redwood. It is New Labour that now wears the one nation mantle. And the daftest thing said about New Labour is not the usual "What have the Romans ever done for us?" Like someone I met at the TUC who said what have you ever done for trade unionists? I said "what about the right to union recognition?" "Yeah, but apart from that?" "The first ever minimum wage" "Yeah, alright, but..." "Or the Social Chapter, paid holidays, restoration of union rights at GCHQ, an end to blacklisting, information and consultation rights". Then he said: "Yeah, but no-one knows about it". I said "Well, try telling them." It's not that. Someone showed me an article recently about how: "Tony Blair has marginalised the Tories". I thought it's a change to read something nice. Then I realised it was a criticism. Like, after years in which people thought the Labour Party was unfit to govern, now they think the Tories are. And I should be really sorry about it. The trouble is even now, even after the lessons of 18 years of opposition followed by two terms of Government, we still think they're the Party of Government, they're the ruling class and we're not part of it. And we're not. Neither should we be. But the point is: Britain doesn't need a ruling class today. The rulers are the people. The reason the Tories are marginalised is they refuse to accept we're equals. They still think they don't need to ask any fundamental questions about today's Tory Party. They just hope that we'll buckle. Well we won't. If we have the heart to hold true to our values; and the head to understand the future in which they have to work. What have we learnt in Government? The present is thrown out with scarcely time to become familiar; before a new future emerges to assert itself. Sure, we're proud of our record. Record economic stability in the first term. Record investment in the second. Record numbers of jobs in both. A fairer Britain, yes. Better than Tory Britain, I should hope so. But not yet a Britain in which as our constitution puts it: power, wealth and opportunity are in the hands of the many not the few. If you have professional parents you are five times more likely to go to university. If you live in a smart part of town you are half as likely to be the victim of crime. Company directors aren't the ones losing their pension. There is a glass ceiling on opportunity in this country. We have raised the ceiling. We haven't broken it. It's great we introduced 2½ hours free nursery education. But if your job means working til 5pm what good is that? The New Deal gave half a million youngsters a job. But what happens when they want a career? No inner city London borough now gets fewer than 40 per cent of its pupils with good GCSEs, up from as low as 25 per cent in 1997. That's still 60 per cent not good enough. It's wonderful that maximum waiting times have come down from 18 months in 1997 to six months by the end of next year. But I would not want a member of my family to wait in pain, let alone for 6 months. And we may have a stable economy, but every business I visit tells me however well Britain does now, within a decade hundreds of thousands of UK jobs will go to China and India unless we build a wholly new platform of economic opportunity in knowledge, skills and science. For the wealthy few, every one of those challenges of the future can be overcome. The third term mission is to overcome them for the many. Changing Britain for better. For good. Not a society where all succeed equally - that is utopia; but an opportunity society where all have an equal chance to succeed; that could and should be 21st century Britain under a Labour Government. Where nothing in your background, whether you're black or white, a man or a woman, able-bodied or disabled stands in the way of what your merit and hard work can achieve. Where hard working families who play by the rules are not going to see their opportunities blighted by those that don't. And where if any of our citizens, no matter how poor, is in sickness or need, they get the best care available without any regard to their wealth. Power, wealth and opportunity in the hands of the many not the few. Not our hands.But theirs. Fairness in the future will not be built on the state, structures, services and government of times gone by. Their values remain. But the reality of life has changed. The relationship between state and citizen has changed. People have grown up. They want to make their own life choices. Their expectations, their ambitions, their hopes are all different and higher. The 20th century traditional welfare state that did so much for so many has to be re-shaped as the opportunity society capable of liberation and advance every bit as substantial as the past but fitting the contours of the future. And this will be a progressive future as long as we remember that the reason for our struggle against injustice has always been to liberate the individual. The argument is not between those who do and those who do not love freedom. It is between the Conservatives who believe freedom requires only that Government stand back while the fittest and most privileged prosper. And we who understand, that freedom for the individual, for every individual, whatever their starting point in life, is best achieved through a just society and a strong community. In an opportunity society, as opposed to the old welfare state, government does not dictate; it empowers. It makes the individual - patient, parent, law-abiding citizen, job-seeker - the driver of the system, not the state. It sets free the huge talent of our public servants and social entrepreneurs whose ability is often thwarted by outdated rules and government bureaucracy. It changes how government works, to open up the means of delivery to every resource, public, private and voluntary that can deliver opportunity based on need not wealth. Sometimes I hear people describe "choice" as a Tory word. It reminds me of when I first used to knock on doors as a canvasser and was told if they owned their own home they were Tories. Choice a Tory word? Tell that to 50 per cent of heart patients who have exercised it to get swifter operations and help bring cardiac deaths down 16,000 since we came to power. Or to the parents who have made the new City Academy Schools so popular in areas of the greatest social disadvantage. Or the people I met in Teesside a couple of weeks ago who have transformed their neighbourhood, yes with Government money but most of all, by making their decisions, their choices about how it was spent and how their community was run. Choice is not a Tory word. Choice dependent on wealth; those are the Tory words. The right to demand the best and refuse the worst and do so not by virtue of your wealth but your equal status as a citizen, that's precisely what the modern Labour Party should stand for. So here are ten things a future Labour third term can do for Britain's hard-working families. 1. Widen the circle of opportunity by low mortgage rates, rising living standards and more jobs in every region of the UK; special help for first time homebuyers and in a week where the Tories are advocating an inheritance tax cut which gives £2 billion to the richest 5 per cent of estates, Labour's priority will be tax relief for the millions of hard-working families not tax cuts for the wealthy few. 2. A society where we put the same commitment to quality vocational skills as we do academic education, with new vocational courses at school, every adult given skills free of charge up to level 2 and further support for level 3, and 300,000 Modern Apprenticeships at the workplace. 3. Every parent with the choice of a good specialist school, 200 new City Academies all in areas of deprivation, but with no return to selection at 11; new powers for heads to tackle disruptive pupils; all secondary schools part of the Building Schools for the Future programme, and as each wave of schools is rebuilt, modern sports facilities in every one, with a guaranteed number of hours of sport per week. And let's work to bring the Olympics to London in 2012 and have a sporting legacy not just for the capital but for the whole country. 4. All patients able to choose their hospital, to book the time and date for treatment. Maximum waiting times down from eighteen months to eighteen weeks. 100 new hospital schemes, 2,700 GP premises improved and modernised already with more to come, life expectancy up, cardiac and cancer deaths down.The NHS safe in the patient's hands. 5. Life made easier for families. More choice for mums at home and at work. Universal, affordable and flexible childcare for the parents of all 3-14 year-olds who want it from 8am in the morning to 6 at night and a Sure Start Children's Centre in every community of Britain. 6. Security and dignity for everyone in retirement. Year by year we will work to increase the numbers who can move off benefit and into work, whether from Job Seekers Allowance, Incapacity Benefit or any other benefit, and with the money saved, design a pension system that has the basic state pension at its core; gives special help to the poorest and provides incentives to save for hard-working families whatever their wealth or income. 7. Our country and its people prospering in the knowledge economy. Increasing by £1 billion the investment in science, boosting support to small businesses and ending the digital divide by bringing broadband technology to every home in Britain that wants it by 2008. 8. On the back of the success of the ASB legislation and record numbers of police, we will take a new approach to the whole of law and order.By the end of the next Parliament, all communities with their own dedicated policing team ; and the local community as well as the police have a say how it is policed.There will be a radical extension of compulsory drug testing for offenders; a doubling of investment in drug treatment; summary powers to deal with drug dealers and with the violence from binge-drinking; and those believed to be part of organised crime will have their assets confiscated, their bank accounts opened up and if they intimidate juries, face trial without a jury. 9. We will introduce identity cards and electronic registration of all who cross our borders. We have cut radically the numbers of failed asylum seekers. By the end of 2005, and for the first time in Britain, we will remove more each month than apply and so restore faith in a system that we know has been abused. But we will welcome lawful migrants to this country; we will praise not apologise for our multicultural society and we will never play politics with the issue of race. 10. A fair deal for all at work. An opportunity society is one in which we stop ignoring the lives of the millions of hard working low paid families who do the jobs that we all rely on. The jobs that get overlooked, the workers who we too often see right through, walk straight past, take for granted. The office cleaners who do the early morning shift, clearing away the mess before the office is filled. The security guards staying vigilant through the night. The dinner ladies, who cook meals for hundreds of kids in the school canteen five days a week. The hospital porters who often do as much for patient care as the nurse. For them, we offer not just the respect they deserve, but the guarantee of a decent income, a rising minimum wage, equal pay between men and women, four weeks paid holidays from now on plus bank holidays. There they are: ten pointers to what a third term Labour government would do for Britain's hard-working families.Don't tell me that's not worth fighting for. A stronger, fairer, more prosperous nation.And now we have to go out and win the trust of the people to do it. When people talk of trust, I say this:I know manifestos rarely make best sellers. But any party activist who wants an answer to the question about trust go and read what we said we would do in 1997 and 2001. It's a happy ending because rarely has a political party been able to deliver so much of what it promised. And if you can't be bothered with the whole manifesto, get out those pledge cards. 1997, five pledges. All delivered. Except its not now 100,000 off the waiting lists, its 300,000 and it's not 250,000 young people off the dole but 500,000. 2001, five pledges. All delivered. Except it isn't 10,000 teachers, it's almost 20,000 and not 20,000 nurses but 60,000. And the minimum wage is not £4.50 but now £4.85 and set to rise still further. So a new manifesto is being written. A new pledge card is being prepared for insertion into John Prescott's wallet.And then into the hands of everyone of us as we knock on doors, visit the factories, tour the shops, get out and campaign with some fire in our bellies, with some pride in what we have done. And of course, every change will be hard - change always is; every time we act on the reality of the future, people will accuse us of reneging on the values of the past. But on the issues we have just discussed - the normal run of politics, you feel, the country feels reasonably confident. The problem of trust isn't primarily that, is it? It is over the decisions I have taken, the judgements about our future security I have made since I stood here in this hall, about to address the TUC on September 11th three years ago. And since then, as with every other country and its leaders the world over, those with America, those against it, political life has been dominated in a way we never foresaw. There was talk before this Conference that I wanted to put aside discussion of Iraq. That was never my intention. I want to deal with it head on. The evidence about Saddam having actual biological and chemical weapons, as opposed to the capability to develop them, has turned out to be wrong. I acknowledge that and accept it. I simply point out, such evidence was agreed by the whole international community, not least because Saddam had used such weapons against his own people and neighbouring countries. And the problem is I can apologise for the information that turned out to be wrong, but I can't, sincerely at least, apologise for removing Saddam. The world is a better place with Saddam in prison not in power. But at the heart of this, is a belief that the basic judgment I have made since September 11th, including on Iraq, is wrong, that by our actions we have made matters worse not better. I know this issue has divided the country. I entirely understand why many disagree. I know, too, that as people see me struggling with it, they think he's stopped caring about us; or worse he's just pandering to George Bush and what's more in a cause that's irrelevant to us. It's been hard for you. Like the delegate who told me: "I've defended you so well to everyone I've almost convinced myself." Do I know I'm right? Judgements aren't the same as facts. Instinct is not science. I'm like any other human being as fallible and as capable of being wrong. I only know what I believe. There are two views of what is happening in the world today. One view is that there are isolated individuals, extremists, engaged in essentially isolated acts of terrorism. That what is happening is not qualitatively different from the terrorism we have always lived with. If you believe this, we carry on the same path as before 11 September. We try not to provoke them and hope in time they will wither. The other view is that this is a wholly new phenomenon, worldwide global terrorism based on a perversion of the true, peaceful and honourable faith of Islam; that's its roots are not superficial but deep, in the madrassehs of Pakistan, in the extreme forms of Wahabi doctrine in Saudi Arabia, in the former training camps of Al Qaida in Afghanistan; in the cauldron of Chechnya; in parts of the politics of most countries of the Middle East and many in Asia; in the extremist minority that now in every European city preach hatred of the West and our way of life. If you take this view, you believe September 11th changed the world; that Bali, Beslan, Madrid and scores of other atrocities that never make the news are part of the same threat and the only path to take is to confront this terrorism, remove it root and branch and at all costs stop them acquiring the weapons to kill on a massive scale because these terrorists would not hesitate to use them. Likewise take the first view, then when you see the terror brought to Iraq you say: There, we told you; look what you have stirred up; now stop provoking them. But if you take the second view, you don't believe the terrorists are in Iraq to liberate it. They're not protesting about the rights of women - what, the same people who stopped Afghan girls going to school, made women wear the Burka and beat them in the streets of Kabul, who now assassinate women just for daring to register to vote in Afghanistan's first ever democratic ballot, though 4m have done so? They are not provoked by our actions; but by our existence. They are in Iraq for the very reason we should be. They have chosen this battleground because they know success for us in Iraq is not success for America or Britain or even Iraq itself but for the values and way of life that democracy represents. They know that. That's why they are there. That is why we should be there and whatever disagreements we have had, should unite in our determination to stand by the Iraqi people until the job is done. And, of course, at first the consequence is more fighting. But Iraq was not a safe country before March 2003. Few had heard of the Taleban before September 11th 2001. Afghanistan was not a nation at peace. So it's not that I care more about foreign affairs than the state of our economy, NHS, schools or crime. It's simply that I believe democracy there means security here; and that if I don't care and act on this terrorist threat, then the day will come when all our good work on the issues that decide people's lives will be undone because the stability on which our economy, in an era of globalisation, depends, will vanish. I never expected this to happen on that bright dawn of 1 May 1997. I never anticipated spending time on working out how terrorists trained in a remote part of the Hindu Kush could end up present on British streets threatening our way of life. And the irony for me is that I, as a progressive politician, know that despite the opposition of so much of progressive politics to what I've done, the only lasting way to defeat this terrorism is through progressive politics. Salvation will not come solely from a gunship. Military action will be futile unless we address the conditions in which this terrorism breeds and the causes it preys upon. That is why it is worth staying the course to bring democracy Iraq and Afghanistan, because then people the world over will see that this is not and has never been some new war of religion; but the oldest struggle humankind knows, between liberty or oppression, tolerance or hate; between government by terror or by the rule of law. And let us demonstrate to Muslims here in Britain that these are values we apply to all our citizens, and change the law to make religious discrimination unlawful as we do with race, gender and disability. This party knows the depth of my commitment to the Middle East peace process and shares my frustration at the lack of progress. After November I will make its revival a personal priority.Two states, Israel and Palestine, living side by side in an enduring peace would do more to defeat this terrorism than bullets alone can ever do. Britain is now, committed for the first time in our history to the UN aid target of 0.7 per cent. Next year as President of the G8 along with action on climate change, we will try for consensus on a new plan for Africa, that not only on aid and trade but on conflict resolution, on fighting corruption, on the killer diseases Aids, malaria and TB, on education, water, infrastructure - a plan to lift that continent in hope and lift from ourselves the shame that so many human beings live and die in misery when we know together we could stop it; and when unchecked this misery some time, somewhere in the future will threaten us. But understand this reality. Little of it will happen except in alliance with the United States of America. And here am I, told by the pro-Europeans to give up on America and the Atlanticists to forget about Europe. And yet I know Britain must be at the centre of a Europe now 25 nations reunited after centuries of conflict the biggest economic market and most powerful political union in the world and I know that to retreat from its counsels would be utter self-defeating folly. And I know to cast out the transatlantic alliance would be disastrous for Britain. And I believe so strongly that if Europe and America could only put aside their differences and united around a common cause, the future could be different and better. So the decisions I've been called on to make are stark. When I hear people say "I want the old Tony Blair back, the one who cares". I tell you something. I don't think as a human being, as a family man, I've changed at all. But I have changed as a leader. I have come to realise that caring in politics isn't really about "caring". It's about doing what you think is right and sticking to it. So I do not minimise whatever differences some of you have with me over Iraq and the only healing can come from understanding that the decision, whether agreed with or not, was taken because I believe, genuinely, Britain's future security depends on it. There has been no third way, this time. Believe me, I've looked for it. But nor should we minimise the strength that unites this Labour Government and this Labour Party as we seek to win a third mandate for change. It is the lasting change we make to the lives of the British people that matters. It is the residents of Somers Town in Camden who told me how they are using the powers we have given them to fight back against the yobs who had made their lives a misery. It is the mothers I met at Dean Bank Sure Start in my own constituency delighted and proud that their children were getting so much better a start in life than they had. It was Natalie Barney I met in Nottingham, able to stay on at school and do A levels because of the Educational Maintenance Allowance - and last week Natalie started at Nottingham Trent University with 4 A levels to her name. It is talking to the decent hard working people of this country that gives me strength. And when I read out to you that long list of policies for the third term, I did so with absolute confidence that we will deliver them. Why? Because, whatever the events, unexpected as well as planned, along the way, on the central mission and purpose of our politics, on our plan to modernise our country, give a fair deal to everyone, build our economy on the talents of all, we are delivering as promised, and will deliver much more if we win that third term. It means having the courage of our convictions. Knowing that it we are to make the NHS deliver what it was created to deliver, free, universal, decent health care for all, we have to modernise it to meet the demands of a new age. Knowing that unless we offer more than the standard comprehensive, parents will desert our state schools and the whole of our society will suffer. Knowing that we will not solve our transport problems by traditional methods of funding or our pensions challenge without altering the rest of our welfare state. And there are the easy bits and hard bits of leadership. There's no doubt which is preferable. But true leadership means doing both. Without the climb, you don't hit the peak. And we can reach it. Our ambition is to make the change in our country and in our world lasting, irreversible. In the last century brief periods of progressive governments were rapidly extinguished. In this century we must ensure that the progressive case once made is maintained, and the periods of conservatism are the punctuation marks not the sentences in which our history is written. For so long, we knew only the importance and futility of Opposition. But because we dared to change, we dared to dream that we could win again. And we did. And now we stand, in a position no Labour Party ever dared to dream of standing before, with a third term Labour Government beckoning. With the values for today and the ideas for tomorrow, and a policy programme that will change the country for better and for good. Power, wealth and opportunity in the hands of the many not the few. That was and is our mission and our purpose. I want us to win a third term not so that we can go in the history books. But so that we can consign Britain's failings to the history books. Build on the progress we have made.Give everyone the chance to make the most of themselves.Deliver better lives for working families. United in our values,Proud in our record,Optimistic about the future,With the courage of our convictions, we can win the third termDeliver the lasting change.It is worth the fight.Now let's get out and do it.

aVThank you for the hard work, faith and courage that means I stand before you as the first leader in the Labour party's history to win three full consecutive terms in office.Amid all the change and progress since our first election victory, it was interesting to see in the film there the pictures of the Good Friday agreement in April 1998, and then finally, yesterday, the completion of IRA decommissioning. It has taken many years, and a lot of hard work, but every minute of every hour of every all-night negotiation will have been worth it if it brings lasting peace to Northern Ireland.And there is a lesson from Northern Ireland: nothing good comes easy. And in government, whatever the noise around you, you just have to persevere with the things that really matter. The question now: how do we secure the future for our party and for our country? The answer lies in understanding why we can celebrate these victories.New Labour was never just a clever way to win; it was a fundamental recasting of progressive politics so that the values we believed in became relevant to the time we lived in. In the late 20th century, the world had changed, the aspirations of the people had changed; we had to change. We did. We won. And Britain is stronger, fairer, better than on 1st May 1997.So what now? The world is on the move again, the change in the early 21st century even greater than that of the late 20th century. So now in turn, we have to change again - not step back from New Labour but step up to a new mark, a changing world is setting for us. The danger of government is fatigue; the benefit, experience.I tell you my conclusion after eight years of being prime minister: the challenge we face is not in our values; it is how we put them into practice in a world fast forwarding to the future at unprecedented speed.Over these eight years we have won the battle of values. The age we live in is democratic not deferential. We believe in solidarity. We believe in social justice, in opportunity not for a privileged few but for all, whatever their start in life. We believe in tolerance and respect, in strong communities standing by and standing up for the weak, the sick, the helpless.We all believe this. It's what makes us Labour, from Dennis Skinner through to Tony Blair - though there, I'm sure Dennis would want me to say, the similarity ends. In our values, we are united. And the British people share these values. Values don't change. But times do. And now, as before, our values have to be applied anew in changing times.The challenge is policy, and not just item by item but attitude by attitude, direction by direction, in the bold strokes that define the picture, not only the small movements that paint the detail. And here the battle is not yet won to secure the future. It is here that the new realities come upon us, snuffing out the lights of victory celebration and urging us to renew yet again.It is true: we have laid sound foundations. There is only one government since the war that has cut unemployment, created 2m more jobs, had eight years of growth without recession and halved interest rates from the previous government, and cut waiting lists in hospitals, improved cancer and heart care, achieved the best ever school results, halved the number of failing schools, seen a five-fold increase in the best ones, achieved record numbers of police and cut crime.Only one Chancellor to have delivered that economic record: this one. Only one cabinet to have delivered these changes: this one. Only one government to do it all: your third term Labour government.By the end of 2008, for the first time in decades, Britain will be investing twice as much in our schoolchildren and three times as much in the NHS than 10 years before. Only a Labour government would have done it. No government but a Labour one would have introduced the New Deal and given 1 million young people the chance of a decent job. Only a Labour government would have stopped the scandal of pensioner poverty or introduced the winter fuel allowance.Only a Labour government would have made a record increase to child benefit or made Sure Start a vital part of some of the poorest communities in the country. Only a Labour government would ever have brought in a minimum wage, and increased it, and made it such a part of our national life that no Tory will ever dare or even threaten to get rid of it.And wasn't it an inspiration to hear the prime minister of Mozambique yesterday pay tribute to your Labour government and think that only this Labour government would have put Africa at the heart of the summit of the richest nations on earth, agreed action on HIV/Aidss and malaria, on debt relief and trade and got them to double aid, trebling it ourselves.I want to make one thing clear: when we resume the talks on world trade this December, our job - Europe's job, America's job - is to be on the side of opening the markets of the rich to the poorest of the world. Look at Britain's cities, a decade ago in decline. Today, for all the problems that remain: thriving waterfronts and canals renewed; business up, employment down; and slowly, part by part, the regeneration of the inner city under way.Visit the centre of Birmingham. See Liverpool, European City of Culture for 2008. Or Manchester, site of the Commonwealth Games. Visit the Tyne by the Baltic Centre or Glasgow's magnificent Pacific Quay or Cardiff Bay.And then London, scene of triumph and tragedy in successive days in July. And throughout both, it remained indomitable. It is a privilege to be Prime Minister of such a country with such a capital city. The city of the Olympic Games for Britain in 2012.And let me tell you what won the bid. Yes, we had a magnificent team led by Seb Coe, a great London mayor who backed it to the hilt, a country behind us. But what won it was London itself. A London with pride in its past, but with eyes fixed on the future. A London that said to the world: we're proud of our diversity, proud to stand before you on our merits, proud we are an open, dynamic, outward-going city full of life, locking horns with modernity and doing it with enthusiasm.And when terrorism struck, the same pride and confidence asserted itself, to the envy and awe of the watching world. London, that day, did Britain proud.This is a country today that increasingly sets the standard: not for us the malaise of France or the angst of Germany. It's a national pastime to run ourselves down, so occasionally it's worth saying: Britain is a great country and we are proud of it.So what is the challenge? It is that change is marching on again. Perhaps our children more readily understand this and embrace it than we do. How quickly has the iPod entered the language and the reality of our lives? With what sense of near wonder was the fax machine greeted, just a few years ago, and already overtaken?A baby is born. The father takes a photo on his mobile. In seconds relatives around the world can see, and celebrate. A different world to the one we were born into. Faster, more exciting, yet with that come threats, too.The pace of change can either overwhelm us, or make our lives better and our country stronger. What we can't do is pretend it is not happening.I hear people say we have to stop and debate globalisation. You might as well debate whether autumn should follow summer. They're not debating it in China and India. They are seizing its possibilities, in a way that will transform their lives and ours. Yes, both nations still have millions living in poverty. But they are on the move. Or look at Vietnam or Thailand. Then wait for the South Americans, and in time, with our help, the Africans.All these nations have labour costs a fraction of ours. All can import the technology. All of them will attract capital as it moves, trillions of dollars of it, double what was available even 10 years ago, to find the best return. The character of this changing world is indifferent to tradition. Unforgiving of frailty. No respecter of past reputations. It has no custom and practice.It is replete with opportunities, but they only go to those swift to adapt, slow to complain, open, willing and able to change. Unless we "own" the future, unless our values are matched by a completely honest understanding of the reality now upon us and the next about to hit us, we will fail. And then the values we believe in become idle sentiments ripe for disillusion and disappointment.In the era of rapid globalisation, there is no mystery about what works: an open, liberal economy, prepared constantly to change to remain competitive. The new world rewards those who are open to it. Foreign investment improves our economy. Or take immigration. We know we need strict controls. They are being put in place, along with identity cards, also necessary in a changing world. But one of the most satisfying things about the election was that the country saw through the Tories' nasty, unprincipled campaign on immigration. People who come to work and make their lives here make Britain not weaker but stronger.But there is a lesson here, too. The temptation is to use government to try to protect ourselves against the onslaught of globalisation by shutting it out - to think we protect a workforce by regulation, a company by government subsidy, an industry by tariffs. It doesn't work today.Because the dam holding back the global economy burst years ago. The competition can't be shut out; it can only be beaten. And the greatest error progressive politics can make is to think that somehow this more open and liberal world makes our values redundant, that the choice is either to cling onto the European social model of the past or be helpless, swept along by the flow.On the contrary, social solidarity remains the only way to secure the future of a country like Britain. However, today its purpose is not to resist the force of globalisation but to prepare for it, and to garner its vast potential benefits.That's why education is government's number one priority. Why we are investing seven times the amount the Tories were each year in school buildings and in computers and teachers and skills? Why we are doubling the science budget? Why we reformed universities' funding so they had the resources to keep up with the world's best?And yes, it was tough. And yes, the Lib Dems exploited it with their usual ruthless opportunism. But it was the right thing to do. Because the only secure economic future for Britain lies in one thing: not low wages, not old-fashioned conflict, but knowledge - skills, intelligence, the talents Britain has in abundance if only we set them free.In the first two terms we corrected the weaknesses of the Tory years: boom-and-bust economics, chronic underinvestment in public services, mass unemployment. But our job was never simply to repair the Tory damage; it was to create an inheritance for future generations by taking the tough decisions needed to secure our future. That is the task in the years ahead. We know how hard it is for families to balance work and home life. Over the next few years, we will open up for the first time ever a new frontier of the welfare state: affordable, wraparound childcare between the hours of 8am-6pm for all who need it. We will get more people off benefit and into work.Let's be frank about why so many people are on incapacity benefit: under the Tories it was used to conceal unemployment. Next month we will publish proposals radically to reform the benefit for the future and help people who can work back into the workforce, where they belong.In December, we receive the report of the Pensions Commission. Next year we will publish our plans for reform. There will be a proper basic state pension, and alongside it - because in the modern world the state cannot provide it all - a simple, easy way for people to save and to reap the rewards of their savings.Next year too, building on Britain's Kyoto commitments, we will publish proposals on energy policy. Global warming is too serious for the world any longer to ignore its danger or split into opposing factions on it. And for how much longer can countries like ours allow the security of our energy supply be dependent on some of the most unstable parts of the world?For both reasons the G8 agreement must be made to work so we develop together the technology that allows prosperous nations to adapt and emerging ones to grow sustainably; and that means an assessment of all options, including civil nuclear power.In transport, we will continue to develop proposals for a fundamental change in its funding, including road pricing. And next year, too, we will address the future of local government: a new and ambitious blueprint strengthening the leadership of our cities, giving good councils new freedoms and devolving more power to neighbourhoods.Over the parliament, our aim is to increase home ownership by 1m and in particular help young families struggling to be first-time buyers. Twenty years ago we gifted the ground of aspiration to the Tories; today we've got it back, and we'll never yield it up to them again.And to back all this up, to ensure our future priorities in spending can be secured, we will publish next July the Fundamental Savings Review of all government spending: where we can save, where we need to spend more; how we keep investment flowing in to our priorities but keep our tax system competitive for our economy and help hardworking families to increase their prosperity.The truth is, command public services today are no more acceptable than a command economy. The 21st century's expectations in public services are a world away from those of 1945. People demand quality, choice, high standards. Why? Because in every other walk of life they demand them. And they are paying their taxes, so they feel they are entitled to them. If we misunderstand this, we will make a mistake of the proportions of council house sales in the 1980s. We know what makes a good school: good leadership, great teachers, strong discipline, a love of learning. We know what makes good healthcare: quick access, committed care, clean, comfortable surroundings. But what happens if you can't get them? If you've the money, you buy better. That is an affront to every progressive value we believe in. There's a great myth here, which is that we don't have a market in services now; we do. It's called private schools and private healthcare. But it's only open to the well-off. There is another myth: choice is a New Labour invention. Wrong. Choice is what wealthy people have exercised for centuries. The Tories have always been comfortable with that. But for Labour, choice is too important to be the monopoly of the wealthy.A final myth: the way to keep universal services universal is to make them uniform. Again, wrong. The way to keep services universal is to make them of such quality that enough of those who can afford to go private opt to stay in the public service.I will never return us to selection aged 11 in our schools. I will never allow the NHS to charge for treatment.Under the Warwick accord, we are ending the two-tier workforce. But it isn't fair when parents have no option but to send their child to a poor local school, or a patient can't get diagnostic tests done in six months when the technology and the capacity exist to deliver it in days.The wealthy, by their wealth, can change that in their lives. I want decent, hardworking families to have the same power. Every time I've ever introduced a reform in government, I wish in retrospect I had gone further.Specialist schools, denounced at the time, have performed better than traditional comprehensives. Fact. City Academies are massively oversubscribed. Fact. And the beneficiaries are not fat cats. They are some of the poorest families in the poorest parts of Britain.We only got big falls in waiting times after introducing competition for routine surgery. Fact. That is why the NHS reforms, to break down the old monolith, bring in new providers, allow patients choice, must continue. Money alone won't work; money and reform will, and if we stick with it, by 2008 we will for the first time in the NHS's history offer booked appointments at the patient's convenience and a maximum wait of 18 weeks from the GP to the operating theatre with an average wait of nine weeks - not the 18 months just to get off the consultants' list we inherited from the Tories but 18 weeks for the whole thing.Now, if reform delivers that change for our people, regardless of wealth, tell me how we justify refusing to do it?This autumn we will publish our education white paper. It will open up the system to new providers and new partners, allow greater parental choice, expand foundation, academy and extended schools. Again reform, again some of it difficult. But all with one purpose: to let nothing block the way to higher standards and greater achievement for our children. The greatest injustice I know is when good education is the preserve of the privileged. We are changing that injustice.Yes, we have lifted many children out of poverty - many families, too. But we haven't decisively altered the balance of advantage away from background to merit. The wealth of your parents is still the biggest decider of your future.If there's one thing above all that motivates me it is to redeem the pledge I made to give the chance of a first-class education not only for Britain's elite but for all Britain's children. The same adjustment to the modern world challenges traditional thinking on law and order. It is true: crime, overall, is down, burglary and car crime by big numbers. But it's not the point.Respect is about more than crime. It's about the loss of a value which is a necessary part of any strong community: proper behaviour, good conduct, the unselfish notion that the other person matters. The roots of this are deep and are formed partly by the same forces of change at work in our economy: the break up of traditional communities and family structures, changing lifestyles.The bonds of cohesion have been loosened. They cannot be tied again the same way. But, in a different way, they can. And, again based on my experience, I want to say how I think it can be done.For eight years I have battered the criminal justice system to get it to change. And it was only when we started to introduce special ASB laws, we really made a difference. And I now understand why: the system itself is the problem. We are trying to fight 21st-century crime - ASB, drug-dealing, binge-drinking, organised crime - with 19th-century methods, as if we still lived in the time of Dickens.The whole of our system starts from the proposition that its duty is to protect the innocent from being wrongly convicted. Don't misunderstand me: that must be the duty of any criminal justice system. But surely our primary duty should be to allow law-abiding people to live in safety.It means a complete change of thinking. It doesn't mean abandoning human rights; it means deciding whose come first.I believe three things work. First, a radical extension of summary powers to police and local authorities to take on the wrongdoers. We will publish plans to do this by the end of the year. They will tackle, specifically, binge drinking, drug dealing and organised crime and develop existing laws on ASB.Second, we need a uniformed presence on the street in every community. Officers on the beat is what the public have wanted for years, and they're right. I have seen teams of police and CSOs in action. It works. We want them across the whole of Britain over the next few years.Third, give our young people places to go so that they're off the street. Invest in our youth services: more competitive sport in schools; give headteachers the full disciplinary powers they want; end the farce of half a dozen agencies all spending hundreds of thousands of pounds on problem families. Identify these families early, have them handled by one lead agency and give it whatever powers it needs to affect change or impose sanctions. And give local communities the powers they need to hold people to account.Today is not the era of the big state, but a strategic one: empowering, enabling, putting decision making in the hands of people, not government. One day, when I am asked by someone whose neighbourhood is plagued with antisocial behaviour or whose local school is failing or hospital is poor, "What are you going to do about it?" I want to be able to reply: "We have given you the resources. We have given you the powers. Now tell me what you are going to do about it."Today, of course, we face a new challenge: global terrorism. Let us state one thing: these terrorists do not, never have and never will represent the decent, humane and principled faith of Islam.Muslims, like all of us, abhor terrorism; like all of us, are its victims. It is, as ever, only fringe fanatics we face.But we need to make it clear: when people come to our country they have and should have the full rights we believe in. There should be no second-class citizens in Britain. But citizenship comes with a duty: to give loyalty to our nation, its values and our way of life.If people have a grievance, politics is the answer, not terror. Terrorism brings home to us this now obvious truth of the modern world. Nations, even the largest, need to work together for their common good. Isolationism is as backward as protectionism. For a country the size of Britain, there is no securing our future without strong alliances.When I became prime minister I took a decision: always be at the forefront where decisions are made not at the back where they're handed down. That is why at every point, no matter how difficult, we remain strong partners in Europe. By all means let us fight for reform in Europe; but to isolate ourselves from the world's largest commercial market in which over 50% of our trade is done is just a crazy policy for Britain in the 21st century.Britain should also remain the strongest ally of the United States. I know there's a bit of us that would like me to do a Hugh Grant in Love Actually and tell America where to get off. But the difference between a good film and real life is that in real life there's the next day, the next year, the next lifetime to contemplate the ruinous consequences of easy applause.I never doubted after September 11 that our place was alongside America and I don't doubt it now. And for a very simple reason. Terrorism struck most dramatically in New York but it was aimed then, and is aimed now, at us all, at our way of life.This is a global struggle. Today it is at its fiercest in Iraq. It has allied itself there with every reactionary element in the Middle East. Their aim: to wreck this December's first ever direct election for the government of Iraq.I know there are people, good people, who disagreed with the decision to remove Saddam by force. But for two years, British troops whose bravery and dedication we salute, along with those of 27 other nations, have been in Iraq with full United Nations authority and in support of the Iraqi government.Yes, several hundred people stoned British troops in Basra. Yes, several thousand run the terrorist insurgency around Baghdad. And yes, as a result of the fighting, innocent people tragically die. But 8.5 million Iraqis showed which future they wanted when they came out and voted in January's elections.And the way to stop the innocent dying is not to retreat, to withdraw, to hand these people over to the mercy of religious fanatics or relics of Saddam, but to stand up for their right to decide their government in the same democratic way the British people do.Ten days ago, after years of struggle, finally in Afghanistan, 6 million people voted freely to decide their own future. How dare the terrorists justify their campaign of hate by claiming they are angry about Afghanistan? Was it better under their Taliban?They use Iraq and Afghanistan, just as they use the cause of Palestine, whilst trying to destroy by terror the only solution that will ever work: a secure Israel living side-by-side with a viable independent and democratic Palestine.Just as they chose the day of the G8, when the world was trying to address the heartbreaking poverty of Africa, to kill innocent people in London. Strip away their fake claims of grievance and see them for what they are: terrorists who use 21st century technology to fight a pre-medieval religious war that is utterly alien to the future of humankind.I know we could have hidden away at the back after September 11 and let others take the strain. But that is not Britain at its best. Nor is it this party.When we campaign for justice in Africa, that is a progressive cause. When we push for peace in Palestine, it is a progressive cause. When we act against global warming, it is a progressive cause. And when we fight behind the standard of democracy in Afghanistan or Iraq or Kosovo or Sierra Leone, for me that too is a progressive cause.In each case, Britain in these last eight years has been at the front. Not always succeeding, but never a spectator. In the modern world, for all the pain it can bring, it is the only place to be.It's a daunting agenda, isn't it? And in every area of policy we are called upon to adjust our sights, rethink, renew. But have confidence. We are well up to it. no-one else is.The Conservatives remain lost in the fog of ancient memories, though at some point, be warned, they will emerge. Who would have thought that the Conservatives would still be debating which way to go after eight years in opposition? Or the Liberals still debating which way to go after 80 years in opposition? The Tories without a leader; the Lib Dems, too.I say this to any true social democrat in the Lib Dems: "You've lost. You're in the old Liberal party now": street fighters in local politics, utterly unserious on the national stage.The seats we lost to them at the last election will not be won back by aping them but by exposing them for what they are: a party of protest. Never a party of government. My advice: never underestimate the Tories; never overestimate the Lib Dems.We are a party of government, a third-term government. Without New Labour we might have won once, even twice, but not three times, and now still dominant. Why? New Labour was first and foremost about disentangling ends and means.Political parties love to tie themselves up in doctrine. They develop comfort zones. Policy becomes ideology, sometimes theology. To challenge it is heresy; to agree it is a sign you belong.But real people in the real world think instinctively, free from doctrine. Not free from values, but free to apply them differently in different times. New Labour reconnected us to them.We have become a grown up party capable of leading a grown up nation. But that is not all New Labour stands for. One thing I've learnt, and I learnt it from Neil Kinnock and it is now so ingrained it's like a strip of granite running through my being. It's about leadership. Not mine alone. Ours together. It's about facing hard challenges and meeting them. Without it you can govern as a reflex to an unpopular Conservative government but you can't lead a generation in the progressive way.Government is not a state of office but a state of mind. A willingness to accept the burden of true leadership. And when you govern, so much can be done.Think of the things the headlines rarely touch. The first ever proper law on domestic violence. 1 million pensioners homes insulated. 350,000 miners with compensation. Paid holidays for all workers. Equalising the law on consent and civil partnerships.And do you know how many visits to Britain's museums last year? 34m. Why? Free museum entry. The achievements of government are not always measured by the causes that decide elections but in the quiet advances that decide the character and culture of a nation.In government, we can change lives. When I listened on Sunday to the tributes to Jim Callaghan, I recalled the 90th birthday party we gave for him in Downing Street a few years backAround the room: Denis Healey talking to Roy Jenkins; Tony Benn with Shirley Williams. Michael Foot, Jack Jones. What brilliance; and what a pity. Because the seeds of 18 years of opposition were not sown in 1979, but in the 1960s, when great challenges came upon us. And instead of understanding we were simply being tested by the forces of change, we lived out a sad episode of charges of betrayal, questioning integrity and motives.They were great people. But we were not ready then to see change was coming, accept it and then shape it to progressive ends. United, we should have been the advocates of economic and industrial change in the changing world. And if we had been, how many fewer lives would have been destroyed? How much harsh and bitter medicine for some of the poorest in our society might have been avoided?People suffered in those 18 years because we let them down. We did so not because we meant to, but because we forgot that the first rule of any party with aspirations to government is to understand first the aspirations of people and how they change with time.Today, the fresh challenges beckon. In 1997, we responded. In 2005, we have to respond again. Some day, some party will make this country at ease with globalisation. Let it be this one.Some day, we will forge a new consensus on our public services. Let it be us who believe in them and let us do it now.Some day, some party will respond to the public's anger at the defeatism that has too often gripped our response to social disorder. Let it be the Party that understands compassion as well as firmness is the only way a true community can be made. Let ours be the party, the one with the values of social justice, equality, fairness, that helps Britain turn a friendly face to the future.When we made a decision about bidding for the Olympics, I'll be honest. I didn't think we could do it. But I also thought, come on, at least give it a try. And it was a risk. But we proved something important in taking it: that Britain was a country not just with memories but with dreams.But such nations aren't built by dreamers. They rise by the patient courage of the change-maker. That's what we have been in New Labour: the change-makers. That's how we must stay. Then the fourth election can be won and the future will be ours to share.

aVI\u2019d like to start by saying something very simple. Thank you.Thank you to you, our party, our members, our supporters, the people who week in, week out do the work, take the flak but don\u2019t often get the credit. Thank you, the Labour party, for giving me the extraordinary privilege of leading you these past 12 years.I know I look a lot older. That\u2019s what being leader of the Labour party does to you.Actually, looking round some of you look a lot older.That\u2019s what having me as leader of the Labour party does to you. Nobody knows that better than John Prescott, my deputy these last 10 years, author of \u2018traditional values in a modern setting.\u2019I may have taken New Labour to the country but it was you that helped me take it to the party, so thank you.Something I don\u2019t say often enough - thank you to my family.It\u2019s usual after you thank the family, you thank your agent and yes I do want to thank him and through him the wonderful people of Sedgefield.When I went to Sedgefield to seek the nomination, just before the 1983 election, I was a refugee from the London-based politics of that time.I knocked on John Burton\u2019s door. He said \u2018come in; but shut up for half an hour, we\u2019re watching the Cup Winners\u2019 Cup final.\u2019I sat in the company of the most normal people I had met in the Labour party.They taught me that most of politics isn\u2019t about politics in the sense of meetings, resolutions, speeches or even parties. It starts with people.It\u2019s about friendship, art, culture, sport. It\u2019s about being a fully paid up member of the human race before being a fully paid up member of the Labour party.But above all else, I want to thank the British people.Not just for the honour of being prime minister but for the journey of progress we have travelled together. Leaders lead but in the end it\u2019s the people who deliver.In the last few months I\u2019ve seen new hospitals like University College in London, the new Queen Elizabeth Hospital planned in Birmingham or Whiston Hospital in Knowsley, where I laid the foundation stone.But without the talents and dedication of the NHS staff, they would be just empty shells.It is their efforts which have cut waiting, improved care, transform and save tens of thousands of lives every day. Thank you.And we in government can help put in place the new academy in Liverpool or the ground-breaking Education Village in Darlington which I have visited recently.But it\u2019s the commitment and love of learning of their teachers and their pupils, and the support of parents, which have given our country the best educated children in our history. Thank you.And what about Manchester?A city transformed. A city that shows what a confident, open, and proud people with a great Labour council can do.So thank you...In 1994, I stood before you for the first time and shared the country\u2019s anger at crumbling school buildings, patients languishing, sometimes dying in pain, waiting for operations, of crime doubled, of homes repossessed, of pensioners living in poverty; and told you of our dismay at four election defeats and how it was not us who should feel betrayed but the British people.That such a speech seems so dated today is not through the passage of time but through progress.In 1997, we faced daunting challenges.Boom and bust economics.Chronic under-investment in our public services.Social division, with millions living in poverty, including over 3 million children.And more than all this, a country culturally and socially behind. No black ministers and never a black cabinet minister.Parliament, supposedly the forum of the people, with only one in 10 women MPs.Gay people denied equal rights.Trade unionists able to be sacked for joining a union.Workers on £1.20 an hour, legally. London the only major capital city in the world without city government.Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland all run from Whitehall. Inner cities depleted, a refuge for the dispossessed.This was a country aching for change.Now, for all that remains to be done, dwell for a moment on what has been achieved.We have had the longest period of sustained economic growth in British history.Mortgage repossession, like mass unemployment, are terms we have to be reminded of.The last NHS winter crisis was six years ago.Heart patients wait on average less than three months. Cancer deaths are down by 43,000.You are more likely to see a new school building than a crumbling one.There are virtually no long-term young unemployed.Today we ask: can we meet our ambitious targets on child poverty when, before 1997, the idea of a child poverty target would have been laughable?We have black ministers and the first woman and then the first black woman leader of the Lords. Not enough women MPs but twice what there were.A London mayor, thankfully Labour again. Devolution in Scotland and Wales. But not just this.Free museum entry that has seen a 50% rise in visitors.Banning things that should never have been allowed: handguns, cosmetic testing on animals, fur farming, blacklisting of trade unionists and from summer next year, smoking in public places.Allowing things that should never have been banned: the right to roam; the right to request flexible working; civil partnerships for gay people.And in 2012 it is London that will host the Olympic games.Of course, the daily coverage of politics focuses on the negative.But take a step back and be proud: this is a changed country.Above all, it is progressive ideas which define its politics. That is the real result of a third term victory.And the Tories have to pretend they love it.The Bank of England independence: they never did in 18 years, the minimum wage: they told us would cost a million jobs. The help for the world\u2019s poor, they cut. They fall over themselves saying how much they agree with us.Don\u2019t lose heart from that; take heart from it.We have changed the terms of political debate.This Labour government has been unique.First time ever two full terms; now three. Why? How?We faced out to the people, not in on ourselves. We put the party at the service of the country.Their reality became our reality. Their worries, our worries.We abandoned the ridiculous, self-imposed dilemma between principle and power.We went back to first principles, to our values, our real values, those that are timeless, and separated them from doctrine and dogma that had been ravaged by time.In doing so, we freed Britain at long last from the reactionary choice that dominated British politics for so long: between individual prosperity and a caring society.We proved that economic efficiency and social justice are not opposites but partners in progress.We defied conventional political wisdom and so changed it.Around that we built a new political coalition.The USP of New Labour is aspiration and compassion reconciled.We reach out not just to those in poverty or need but those who are doing well but want to do better; those on the way up, ambitious for themselves and their families.These are our people too.Not to be tolerated for electoral reasons.But embraced out of political conviction.The core vote of this party today is not the heartlands, the inner city, not any sectional interest or lobby.Our core vote is the country.It was they who made us change.The beliefs of the Labour party of 2006 should be recognisable to the members of 1906. Full employment; strong public services; tackling poverty; international solidarity.The policies shouldn\u2019t.The trouble was for a long time they were.In the 1960s, re-reading the cabinet debates of In Place of Strife, everyone was telling Harold Wilson not to push it. They said it was divisive, unnecessary, alienated core support. In the end he gave up, but so did the public on Labour.Even in 1974, the Labour government spent two years renationalising shipbuilding and the public spent two years wondering why.In the 1980s, council house sales had first been suggested by Labour people. It was shelved. Too difficult. Too divisive. We lost a generation of aspiring working class people on the back of it.In the 1980s we should have been the party transforming Britain.We weren\u2019t.The lesson is always the same.Values unrelated to modern reality are not just electorally hopeless, the values themselves become devalued. They have no purchase on the real world.We won not because we surrendered our values, but because we finally had the courage to be true to them.Our courage in changing gave the British people the courage to change.That\u2019s how we won.10 years after, government has taken its toll. It does. It\u2019s in the nature of the beast.In the harsh climate of the 24/7 media, in which gossip and controversy are so much more newsworthy than real news, people forget.I spoke to a woman the other day, a part-time worker, complaining about the amount of her tax credit.I said: hold on a minute: before 1997, there were no tax credits - not for working families, not for any families; child benefit was frozen; maternity pay half what it is; maternity leave likewise and paternity leave didn\u2019t exist at all. And no minimum wage, no full time rights for part time workers, in fact nothing.\u2018So what?\u2019 she said \u2018that\u2019s why we elected you. Now go and sort out my tax credit.\u2019 And, of course, she\u2019s right.In government you carry each hope, each disillusion. And in politics it\u2019s always about the next challenge.The truth is, you can\u2019t go on forever.That\u2019s why it is right that this is my last conference as Leader.Of course it is hard to let go. But it is also right to let go. For the country, and for you, the party.Over the coming months, I will take through the changes I have worked on so hard these past years.And I will help build a unified party with a strong platform for the only legacy that has ever mattered to me - a fourth term election victory that allows us to keep changing Britain for the better.And I want to heal. There has been a lot of talk of lies and truths these past few weeks.In no relationship at the top of any walk of life is it always easy, least of all in politics which matters so much and which is conducted in such a piercing spotlight.But I know New Labour would never have happened, and 3 election victories would never have been secured, without Gordon Brown.He is a remarkable man. A remarkable servant to this country. And that is the truth.So now, 10 years on, this party faces the real test of leadership: not about what we\u2019ve achieved in the past; but what we can achieve for Britain\u2019s future.Not just how do we win again; but how does Britain carry on winning?I won\u2019t be leading you in the next election.But I\u2019ve sat in the hot seat for 10 years.Here\u2019s my advice.The scale of the challenges now dwarf what we faced in 1997. They are different, deeper, bigger, hammered out on the anvil of forces, global in nature, sweeping the world.In 1997 the challenges we faced were essentially British. Today they are essentially global.The world today is a vast reservoir of potential opportunity. New jobs in environmental technology, the creative industries, financial services. Cheap goods and travel. The internet. Advances in science and technology.In 10 years we will think nothing of school-leavers going off to university anywhere in the world.But with these opportunities comes huge insecurity.In 1997 we barely mentioned China. Not any more. Last year China and India produced more graduates than all of Europe put together.10 years ago, energy wasn\u2019t on the agenda. The environment an also-ran.10 years ago, if we talked pensions we meant pensioners.Immigration hardly raised.Terrorism meant the IRA.Not any more.We used to feel we could shut our front door on the problems and conflicts of the wider world. Not any more.Not with globalisation. Not with climate change. Not with organised crime. Not when suicide bombers born and bred in Britain bring carnage to the streets of London. In the name of religion.A speech by the Pope to an academic seminar in Bavaria leads to protests in Britain.The question today is different to the one we faced in 1997.It is how we reconcile openness to the rich possibilities of globalisation, with security in the face of its threats.How to be open and secure.And again, there is a third way. Some want a fortress Britain - job protection, pull up the drawbridge, get out of international engagement.Others see no option but to submit to global forces and let the strongest survive.Our answer is very clear. It is, once again, to help people through a changing world by using collective power to advance opportunity and provide security for all.To reconcile openness and security as we reconciled aspiration and compassion, not as enemies but as partners in progress.The British people today are reluctant global citizens.We must make them confident ones.The danger in all this, for us, is not ditching New Labour. The danger is failing to understand that New Labour in 2007 won\u2019t be New Labour in 1997.10 years ago I would have described re-linking the BSP with earnings as \u2018Old Labour.\u2019 Our aim is by 2012, but by the end of the next Parliament at the latest - we are going to do it. Rodney Bickerstaffe has become New Labour. Or have I become Old Labour?10 years ago, if you had asked me to put environmental obligations on business, I would have been horrified. Now I\u2019m advocating it.I would have baulked at restrictions on advertising junk food to children. Today I say: unless a voluntary code works, we will legislate for it.10 years ago I parked the issue of nuclear power. Today, I believe without it, we are going to face an energy crisis, and we can\u2019t let that happen.Over the next year we are reviewing every aspect of our economic policy, not because we were wrong in the past, but because whether in tax and spending, regulation, planning, enterprise, the question is not about our competitiveness in the last 10 years, but in the next 10.Developing financial services and the City of London; the creative industries and modern manufacturing. How to be the world\u2019s number one place of choice for bio-science - if America does not want stem-cell research - we do.How to fund transport through road-pricing.Skills. I say to business: you have a responsibility to train your workforce. To trade unions: here is the chance to be the learning partners for the workforce of the next generation. Take the chance.Global warming is the greatest long-term threat to our planet\u2019s environment. Scarce energy resources mean rising prices and will threaten our country\u2019s economy.In 15 years we will go from 80% self-sufficient in oil and gas to 80% imported.We need therefore the most radical overhaul of energy policy since the War.We will increase the amount of energy from renewable sources fivefold; ensure every major business in the country has a responsibility for greenhouse gas reduction; treble investment in clean technology, including clean coal; and make sure every new home is at least 40% more energy efficient.We will meet our Kyoto targets by double the amount; and we will take the necessary measures, step by step by step, to meet one of the most ambitious targets on the environment set anywhere in the world - a 60% reduction in emissions by 2050.In the future, as people live longer, we can\u2019t afford good pensions and help for disabled people who can\u2019t work, with 4 million people on benefit, many of whom could work. Almost a million less than there were. But too many.That is why we need more radical welfare reform, getting more disabled people, more lone parents, more on unemployment benefit, into work, not to destroy the welfare state. But to preserve it.And why is reform so important in public services?Over the past 10 years Britain has invested more in our public services than any comparable nation in the world. From near the bottom in Europe to the average in a decade.300,000 more workers, treble the money, 25% more pay in real terms and the largest ever hospital programme; that is an NHS being re-built not privatised.Refurbishing or rebuilding every state secondary school in the country. 92,000 more classroom assistants, 36,000 more teachers, pay also up 17% in real terms. This isn\u2019t privatising state education; it\u2019s producing the best schools results ever.But what happens?Expectations rise. People want power in their own hands.Two thirds of the country has access to the internet. Millions of people are ordering flights or books or other goods online, they are talking to their friends online, downloading music, all of it when they want to, not when the shop or office is open.The Google generation has moved beyond the idea of 9-5, closed on weekends and bank holidays. Today\u2019s technology is profoundly empowering.Of course public services are different. Their values are different. But today people won\u2019t accept a service handed down from on high. They want to shape it to their needs, and the reality of their lives.The same global forces changing business are at work in public services too. New ways of treating. New ways of teaching. New technologies.There will be no selective trust schools or city academies. But if, as at the academy I visited in Lewisham, good GCSE results doubled in a year, and a school once under-subscribed, now five times over-subscribed, how is that a denial of public service values? Surely it is the most vivid affirmation of them.And if an old age pensioner who used to wait 2 years for her cataract operation now gets it on the NHS in an independent treatment centre in 3 months, free at the point of use, that is not damaging the NHS; it is fulfilling its purpose.My advice: at the next election, the issue will not only be who is trusted to invest in our public services, vital though that is.It will be who comes first.And our answer has to be:The patient; the parent.Meeting the 18 weeks maximum for waiting in the NHS with an average of 9 weeks from the door of the GP to the door of the operating theatre. Booked appointments. The end of waiting in the NHS. Historic.Transforming secondary schools in the way we have done for primary schools. Schools with three quarters of children getting good results the norm. Historic.Both within reach.Do this and we will have earned the right to be custodians of our public services for the next generation.If we fail, and without change we will, then believe me: change will still be done; but in a regressive way by a Conservative Party.I want change true to progressive values, done by a fourth term Labour Government.I always said the Home Office was the toughest job in government. It hasn\u2019t got easier.We should get a few facts straight. Crime has fallen not risen. We are the only government since the war to do it. Asylum applications are dealt with faster, removals are greater, the system infinitely better than the chaos we inherited in 1997.But the fact is that the world is changing so fast that the reality we are dealing with - mass migration, organised crime, ASB - has engulfed systems designed for a time gone by.30 million people now come to Britain every year. Visitors, tourists, workers, students. Our economy needs them. 227 million pass through our airports.Yet we have no means of checking who is here lawfully.The fundamental dilemma: how do we reconcile liberty with security in this new world?I don\u2019t want to live in a police state, or a Big Brother society or put any of our essential freedoms in jeopardy. But because our idea of liberty is not keeping pace with change in reality, those freedoms are in jeopardy.When crimes go unpunished, that is a breach of the victim\u2019s liberty and human rights.When organised crime gangs are free to practice their evil, countless young people have their liberty and often their lives damaged.When ASB goes unchecked, each and every member of the community in which it happens has their human rights broken.When we can\u2019t deport foreign nationals even when inciting violence the country is at risk.Immigration has benefited Britain.But I know that if we don\u2019t have rules that allow us some control over who comes in, goes out, who has a right to stay and who has not, then instead of a welcome, migrants find fear.We can only protect liberty by making it relevant to the modern world.That is why Identity Cards using biometric technology are not a breach of our basic rights, they are an essential part of responding to the reality of modern migration and protecting us against identity fraud.I remember when I introduced the DNA database. On it go all those who are arrested. We were told it was a monstrous breach of liberty.But it is now matching 3,000 offences a month including last year several hundred murders, and thousands of rapes and other violent offences.Difficult reform leading to real progress in the fight against crime.In the next parliamentary session, the centre-piece will be John Reid\u2019s immigration and law and order reforms.I ask people of all parties to support them.Let liberty stand up for the law-abiding.And of course, the new anxiety is the global struggle against terrorism without mercy or limit.This is a struggle that will last a generation and more. But this I believe passionately: we will not win until we shake ourselves free of the wretched capitulation to the propaganda of the enemy, that somehow we are the ones responsible.This terrorism isn\u2019t our fault. We didn\u2019t cause it.It\u2019s not the consequence of foreign policy.It\u2019s an attack on our way of life.It\u2019s global.It has an ideology.It killed nearly 3,000 people, including over 60 British, on the streets of New York before war in Afghanistan or Iraq was even thought of.It has been decades growing.Its victims are in Egypt, Algeria, Indonesia, India, Pakistan, Turkey.Over 30 nations in the world.It preys on every conflict.It exploits every grievance.And its victims are mainly Muslim.This is not our war against Islam.This is a war fought by extremists who pervert the true faith of Islam. And all of us, Western and Arab, Christian or Muslim, who put the value of tolerance, respect and peaceful co-existence above those of sectarian hatred, should join together to defeat them.It is not British soldiers who are sending car bombs into Baghdad or Kabul to slaughter the innocent.They are there along with troops of 30 other nations with, in each case, a full UN mandate at the specific request of the first ever democratically elected Governments of those countries in order to protect them against the very ideology also seeking the deaths of British people in planes across the Atlantic.If we retreat now, hand Iraq over to al-Qaida and sectarian death squads and Afghanistan back to al-Qaida and the Taliban, we won\u2019t be safer; we will be committing a craven act of surrender that will put our future security in the deepest peril.Of course it\u2019s tough.Not a day goes by, or an hour in the day when I don\u2019t reflect on our troops with admiration and thanks - the finest, the best, the bravest, any nation could hope for.They are not fighting in vain. But for this nation\u2019s future.But this is not a conventional war. It can\u2019t be won by force alone.It\u2019s not a clash of civilisations.It\u2019s about civilisation, about the ideas that shape it.From 9/11 until now I have said again and again. If we want our values to be the ones that govern global change, we have to show that they are fair, just and delivered with an even hand.From now until I leave office I will dedicate myself, with the same commitment I have given to Northern Ireland, to advancing peace between Israel and Palestine. I may not succeed. But I will try because peace in the Middle East is a defeat for terrorism.We must never again let Lebanon become the battleground for a conflict that neither Israeli or Lebanese people wanted, though it was they who paid the price for it.Peace in Lebanon is a defeat for terrorism.Action in Africa is a defeat for terrorism.What is happening now in the Sudan cannot stand. If this were in the continent of Europe we would act.Showing an African life is worth as much as a Western one - that would help defeat terrorism too.Yes it\u2019s hard sometimes to be America\u2019s strongest ally.Yes, Europe can be a political headache for a proud sovereign nation like Britain.But believe me there are no half-hearted allies of America today and no semi-detached partners in Europe.And the truth is that nothing we strive for, from the world trade talks to global warming, to terrorism and Palestine can be solved without America, or without Europe.At the moment I know people only see the price of these alliances.Give them up and the cost in terms of power, weight and influence for Britain would be infinitely greater.Distance this country and you may find it\u2019s a long way back.So all these changes of a magnitude we never dreamt of, sweeping the world, are calling for answers of equal magnitude and vision.All require leadership. And here is something else I\u2019ve learnt. The danger for us today is not reversion to the politics of the 1980s. It is retreat to the sidelines.To the comfort zone. It is unconsciously to lose the psychology of a governing party.As I said in 1994, courage is our friend. Caution, our enemy.A governing party has confidence, self-belief. It sees the tough decision and thinks it should be taking it.Reaches for responsibility first.Serves by leading.The most common phrase uttered to me - and not at rallies or public events but in meetings of chance, quietly, is not \u2018I hate you\u2019 or \u2018I like you,\u2019 but \u2018I would not have your job for all the world.\u2019The British people will, sometimes, forgive a wrong decision.They won\u2019t forgive not deciding.They know the choices are hard.They know there isn\u2019t some fantasy government where nothing difficult ever happens. They\u2019ve got the Lib Dems for that.Government isn\u2019t about protests or placards, shouting the odds or stealing the scene. It\u2019s about the hard graft of achievement.There are no third-term popular governments. Don\u2019t ignore the polls but don\u2019t be paralysed by them either.10 years on, our advantage is time, our disadvantage time.Time gives us experience. Our capacity to lead is greater.Time gives the people fatigue; their willingness to be led is less.But they will lose faith in us only if first we lose faith in ourselves.Polls now are as relevant as last year\u2019s weather forecast for tomorrow\u2019s weather. It\u2019s three years until an election.The first rule of politics: there are no rules. You make your own luck.There\u2019s no rule that says the Tories have got to come back.David Cameron\u2019s Tories? My advice: get after them.His foreign policy. Pander to anti-Americanism by stepping back from America. Pander to the Euro-sceptics through isolation in Europe. Sacrificing British influence for party expediency is not a policy worthy of a prime minister.His immigration policy. Says he\u2019ll sort out illegal immigration, but opposes identity cards, the one thing essential to do it.His energy policy. Nuclear power \u2018only as a last resort.\u2019 It\u2019s not a multiple choice quiz question, Mr. Cameron. We need to decide now, otherwise in 10 years\u2019 time we will be importing expensive fossil fuels and Britain\u2019s economy will suffer.He wants tax cuts and more spending, with the same money.He wants a bill of rights for Britain drafted by a committee of lawyers. Have you ever tried drafting anything with a committee of lawyers?And his policy for the old lady terrorised by the young thug is that she should put her arm round him and give him a nice, big hug.Built to last? They haven\u2019t even laid the foundation stone. If we can\u2019t take this lot apart in the next few years, we shouldn\u2019t be in the business of politics at all.The Tories haven\u2019t thought it through. They think it\u2019s all about image. It\u2019s true we changed our image. We created a professional organisation.But if I\u2019d stood in 1997 on the policies of 1987, I would have lost. Period.And it\u2019s the same now. Enough talk of hung parliaments.The next election won\u2019t be about image unless we let it be.It\u2019ll be about who has the strength, judgment, weight and ideas for Britain\u2019s future in an uncertain world.And if we show belief in ourselves, the British people will feel that belief and be given confidence.Something else I\u2019ve learnt.It\u2019s about a party\u2019s character.I\u2019ll give you two examples.Dennis Skinner. Watching from his sick bed. Get well soon.Never agreed with a policy I\u2019ve had.Never once stopped him knowing the difference between a Labour government and a Tory one.People like Janet Anderson, George Howarth, Mike Hall.Good ministers, but I asked them to make way. They did. Without a word of bitterness.They never forgot their principles when in office; and they never discovered them when they left office.This is the party I am proud to lead.From the day I was elected until the day I leave, they will always try to separate us.\u2018He\u2019s not Labour.\u2019 \u2018He\u2019s a closet Tory.\u2019In the 1980s some things done were necessary for the country. That\u2019s the truth.Saying it doesn\u2019t make you a Tory.I\u2019m a progressive.The true believer believes in social justice, in solidarity, in help for those not able to help themselves.They know the race can\u2019t just be to the swift and survival for the strong.But they also know that these values, gentle and compassionate as they are, have to be applied in a harsh, uncompromising world, and what makes the difference is not belief alone, but the raw courage to make it happen.They say I hate the party and its traditions.I don\u2019t.I love this party.There\u2019s only one tradition I hated: losing.I hated the 1980s not just for our irrelevance but for our revelling in irrelevance.And I don\u2019t want to win for winning\u2019s sake, but for the sake of the millions here that depend on us to win, and throughout the world.Every day this government has been in power, every day in Africa, children have lived who otherwise would have died because this country led the way in cancelling debt and global poverty.That\u2019s why winning matters.So keep on winning.Do it with optimism.With hope in your hearts.Politics is not a chore.It\u2019s the great adventure of progress.I don\u2019t want to be the Labour leader who won three successive elections.I want to be the first Labour leader to win three successive elections.So: it\u2019s up to you.

aVOPENING REMARKS - EARLY CHALLENGES Honoured and humbled by the trust you have given me, I speak to you for the first time at our conference as prime minister and leader of this party.No one could have foreseen all the events that Britain has been through since June.But tested again and again the resilience of the British people has been powerful proof of the character of our country.Early on a June morning, two cars were found parked and packed with explosives in Haymarket, London.They were put there to bring terror and death to men and women who would do nothing wrong but be out with their friends, walk on our streets and visit our capital.But from the bomb disposal experts who courageously risked their lives, to the Londoners who defiantly went on with their lives, that day the world witnessed the resolve and strength of the British people.And when the terrorists tried to attack Scotland's biggest airport, they were answered by the courage of the police and firefighters and a baggage handler named John Smeaton. He came to the aid of a policeman under assault from one of the terrorists.Later John told me it was instinctive, he was doing what was right.That man, that hero John Smeaton is here with us today and on behalf of our country - John, we thank you.Every citizen who answered the call of the country - policemen and women, our security and emergency services, our health services - all left their mark on this island's story by keeping us safe. They are the pride of Britain.Just as our armed services with bravery and heroism every single day also make us proud. We mourn those who have been lost and we honour all those who in distant places of danger give so much to our country.It was in these early weeks, in the wake of the worst flooding in almost 150 years, in county after county, we saw British people pull on their boots and pull out their boats to rescue neighbours and strangers.And together they went to work to clean up the streets, sweep out the shops and reopen the schools. Long after the waters have receded the memory of their quiet strength remains.They too showed the character of Britain: communities where buildings can be damaged and even destroyed but our spirit is indestructible. They too make us proud of the extraordinary resilience of ordinary British people.And then on an early August morning in Surrey, a farmer went out to tend to his livestock and what he saw terrified him, made him remember back to 2001 when all across our countryside clouds of smoke scarred the sky and for many in farms and villages, family dreams were turned to ash.During the outbreak this summer, our vets, scientists, and public officials in DEFRA cancelled their holidays. To fight the contagion farmers worked day and night. And they have done it all over again this month and continue to do so. Their actions live out our shared understanding that our countryside is more than the space that surrounds, it is the oxygen for our towns and cities.And in order to be the country we should be, Britain must protect and cherish not just our cities, but our countryside too.And as we saw again this summer there is no Scotland-only, no Wales-only, no England-only answer to the spread of disease or to terrorist attacks that can strike at any time, anywhere in any part of our country.And sharing this same small island, we will meet our environmental, economic and security challenges not by splitting apart but when we as Great Britain stand united together.So my sense of talking to people in all parts of these islands is that instead of leaving us pessimistic, these three months make us more optimistic about what we the British people at our best can do.Our response was calm and measured. We simply got on with the job.Britain has been tested and not found wanting.This is who we are.And there is no weakness in Britain today that cannot be overcome by the strengths of the British people.So don't let anyone tell us Britain is not equal to every challenge.BRITISH VALUES We all know that in our society we do have real problems to solve, real needs to meet, but don't let anyone tell us - the British people - that this country of ours, which has over centuries given so much to the world, has ever been broken by anyone or anything.I am proud to be British.I believe in British values.My father and my mother taught me about family and the great virtues of hard work, doing your duty and always trying to do the right thing.And I have never forgotten my father telling me to "treat everyone equally with respect".His optimism led him to find goodness in everyone.My father was a minister of the church, and his favourite story was the parable of the talents because he believed - and I do too - that each and everyone of us has a talent and each and everyone of us should be able to use that talent.And the values I was brought up with are not just what I learned; they are part of the fabric of the life I have led.Not just where I come from but the experiences that have shaped me.I attended the local state primary school in Kirkcaldy a few streets away from where I lived - and then I took the school bus to the local secondary school up the hill.And I have school friends I have kept in touch with all my life who have shared the good times and comforted me in the bad times.Today I have the greatest privilege of all - to have been chosen by them to represent in Parliament the place where we all grew up together.The office where I hold my constituency surgeries is just across the road - a few yards from the house where I lived as a child.I benefited from great and dedicated teachers.And I was fortunate enough to get to university.But as a teenager I saw close friends of mine who might have gone to college or an apprenticeship or to university who never did.I know some could not to afford to stay on at school.For others, their potential had never been nurtured.When they heard about further education, they thought, or their parents thought, it was not for people like them.And the reason I am here - the real reason I am here - is that I want their children and their grandchildren whom I also represent to have all the chances that were not available to my school friends when we were growing up.That's the reason I am here: I want the best of chances for all families.GUIDING PRINCIPLES So what first made me want to do something in public service?I don't recall all the sermons my father preached Sunday after Sunday.But I will never forget these words he left me with: "we must be givers as well as getters".Put something back.And by doing so make a difference.And this is my moral compass.This is who I am.I am a conviction politician.I stand for a Britain where everyone should rise as far as their talents can take them and then the talents of each of us should contribute to the well being of all.I stand for a Britain where all families who work hard can build a better life for themselves and their children.I stand for a Britain where every young person who has it in them to study at college or university should not be prevented by money from doing so.I stand for a Britain where public services exist for the patient, the pupil, the people who are to be served.I stand for a Britain where it is a mark of citizenship that you should learn our language and traditions.I stand for a Britain where we expect responsibility at every level of society.I stand for a Britain that defends its citizens and both punishes crime and prevents it by dealing with the root causes.I stand for a Britain where because this earth is on loan to us from future generations, we must all be stewards of the environment.So I stand for a Britain where we all have obligations to each other and by fulfilling them, everyone has the chance to make the most of themselves.ASPIRATIONS And these are the principles which I believe can guide us as we, the British people, meet all the new challenges ahead: global economic competition, the terrorist and security threat, climate change, the yearning for stronger communities, the pressures to balance work and family life, and most of all - something you can hear and sense in every part of the country - the rising aspirations of the British people.Our purpose has always been to be the party of progressive change.Once our struggle was to secure minimum standards, then to extend opportunity.But we need to be honest: today the rising aspirations of the British people summon us to set a new direction.As the world changes so we must change too.And I believe that when you get something right, you build on it. But part of experience and judgement is to recognise that when you fall short, you listen, you learn and then you are confident enough to change.In Britain today too many still cannot rise as far as their talents can take them.Yet this is the century where our country cannot afford to waste the talents of anyone.Up against the competition of two billion people in China and India, we need to unlock all the talent we have.In the last century the question was can we afford to do this?In the face of economic challenge, I say: in this century we cannot afford not to.And the country that brings out the best in all its people will be the great success story of the global age.Now think of the communities from where we have travelled here to Bournemouth. How many young people - young boys in particular - fail to develop the potential they have?How many women still come up against a glass ceiling that blocks their advance?How many men and women who hope to move up the ladder in mid career are deprived of the chance to upgrade their skills and jobs?How much talent that could flourish is lost through a poverty of aspiration: wasted not because young talents fail to reach the stars but because they grow up with no stars to reach for?And how many of our youngest children are still deprived of the early learning they need.Why should we accept so many children destined to fail even before their life's journey has begun?So this is the next chapter in our progress. The next stage of our country's long journey to build the strong and fair society.I want a Britain where there is no longer any ceiling on where your talents and hard work can take you.Where what counts is not what where you come from and who you know, but what you aspire to and have it in yourself to become.Past generations unlocked just some of the talents of some of the people.In the new Britain of this generation, we must unlock all the talents of all of the people.Not the old equality of outcome that discounts hard work and effort.Not the old version of equality of opportunity - the rise of an exclusive meritocracy where only some can succeed and others are forever condemned to fail.But a genuinely meritocratic Britain, a Britain of all the talents.Where all are encouraged to aim high.And all by their effort can rise.A Britain of aspiration and also a Britain of mutual obligation where all play our part and recognise the duties we owe to each other.New Labour: now the party of aspiration and community. Not just occupying but shaping and expanding the centre ground. A strong Britain; a fairer Britain.Putting people and their potential first.EDUCATION You know, there was another day in the past few months, one that did not make the news.It was a day I went to Hackney to Lauriston Primary School where I met a six year old boy called Max.We walked through the library and then the classrooms. He sat with his teacher, Eddie O'Brien, and me.He had a book in his hand and his hair was a little uncombed - which as far as I am concerned may be a good sign.Max had been falling behind at school, struggling to read. But because of the 'Every Child a Reader' programme, he was now receiving one to one coaching, and he wanted to read us a story.He did brilliantly as he read from a gripping narrative about "The Gingerbread Man" and he smiled as he finished.In that classroom our mission for change was as clear and strong as the words being read by Max.What he was really telling us is that every child has potential if given the chance.Today in education, private schools offer one to one tuition. But why shouldn't all pupils and not just some benefit from extra personal help?And because I want every child to be a reader, every child to be able to count, we have decided that one-to-one tuition will be there in our schools not just for Max, but for 300,000 children in English and 300,000 in maths.And because we want to unlock all the potential, not just the three R's, for every pupil as we look ahead with pride to the Olympics we aim for the first time for five hours a week sport and time for arts and music too.So whenever we see talent under-developed; aspirations unfulfilled; potential wasted; obstacles to be removed; this is where we - new Labour - will be.Hear me when I say: No matter where you come from. No matter your background. No matter what school you go to. My message, our message, is and must be: if you try hard, we will help you make the most of your talents.So for every secondary pupil a personal tutor throughout their school years - and starting with 600,000 pupils, small group tuition too.Learning personal to each pupil.Education available to all - not one size fits all but responding to individual needs.This is the future for our public services. Accessible to all, personal to you. Not just a basic standard but the best quality tailored to your needs. Education is my passion.And as we expand specialist, trust and academy schools it's also time to make the biggest change in education in decades, a ten year children's plan to make our schools, colleges and universities world class.Instead of education from 5 to 16, we will be offering free universal education to every child - from nursery school at 3 to advanced studies or training right up to 18.In just one decade we are doing what no government has ever done: moving the right to education from 11 years free education to 15 years.But we will only make the most of this if every teenager who leaves at 18 can graduate with a good qualification.So for every apprentice, a certificate of completion. For every college or school student, A-levels and diplomas and for all a clear pathway into skilled work. And we offer teenagers national youth community service - I want every young person in Britain to be able to say: this is my country. I contribute to it. I help make it better.It's wrong that anybody should be put off going to college or university by the fear it will cost too much.So when the big new changes we are now making are fully in place, 300,000 students will receive full grants. 600,000 - that's two thirds of students - will have grants. That's the change: more students with grants than at any time in the history of university education.And to those who say more going to university must mean worse standards, let us stand up for opportunity. In many other countries the majority of young people now go to university. In Britain just 42 per cent; just 10 per cent from low income backgrounds.So for 16 year olds from low income families who stay on at school, we will make a new five year offer - we will finance you through college or university, right through to 21.Merit rewarded in a Britain not divided by class but united by aspiration. Showing a class-free society is not a slogan but in Britain can become a reality.FAMILIES Every fifty seconds in Britain a child is born.Who knows what might happen to that child? Who knows if they could someday start a thriving business, become a proud nurse, a good football player, or a great scientist? Who knows if they will exceed all of their parents' hopes to see them get on, have a good job and a loving family?So every child deserves the best possible start in life.We have lifted 600,000 children out of poverty. We are doubling child benefits. We have trebled maternity allowances. And 6 million families now benefit from the Child Tax Credit.None of this happened before a Labour Government.But we are not satisfied.And the Pre Budget Report will set out our next steps because our goal for this generation is to abolish child poverty and let me reaffirm that goal today.And I say to the children of two parent families, one parent families, foster parent families; to the widow bringing up children: I stand for a Britain that supports as first class citizens not just some children and some families but supports all children and all families.We all remember that biblical saying: "suffer the little children to come unto me." No Bible I have ever read says: "bring just some of the children."Because no child should ever be written off, for mothers of infants, we will expand the help of nurse-family partnerships.And for families and teenagers in trouble, new one-to-one support led by the voluntary sector that, up and down the country, we know can make all the difference.And because its unfair to the children that fathers walk away from their responsibilities, we will insist on new powers to name absent fathers on birth certificates and to pay their share: maintenance deducted from benefits as we return them to work.And let me also say that I am now understanding the daily pressures all families and all parents are under to do everything on time: make breakfast, get the kids to school with their homework done, make sure no one forgets their P.E. kit or a school play rehearsal. And of course fit in your own life and work and make sure it all fits in 24 hours.I have heard the call for change and we must respond to the rising aspirations of parents.Because we, a Labour government, introduced six months paid maternity leave, the take up has risen from 25 per cent to 90 per cent. And so it is right this year to raise it to nine months for all mothers on the road to 12 months paid maternity leave.All this is part of the revolution in services for parents and the under fives: now 7,000 extended schools, moving from zero to 3,500 sure start children's centres, the doubling of nursery education - two-thirds of a million more child care places.This is the next stage in the transformation of public services. Our aim high quality care not just available to some but to all and tailored to parents needs when they need it and at a price they can afford.A growing number of parents who care for their children now also care for elderly relatives. I want our new carers commission to hear the call for change from millions of carers - and this government will now do more for respite care, for training of carers, for better pension rights and to give new priority to caring for disabled children.And I pay tribute to our Deputy Leader Harriet Harman who by her campaigning work is pioneering this cause of equality. No discrimination on the basis of race, gender, sexuality, age, or faith. And no discrimination against the disabled.We know that all parents are under more than the pressure of time.Today amongst the biggest influences on children are the Internet, TV, commercial advertising. And like many parents I feel I'm struggling to set the boundaries so that children can be safe - and that's why we have asked Dr Tanya Byron to look at how families can make the most of the opportunities new technology gives while doing our duty to protect children from harmful material.And to honour those who raised us, I can affirm our commitment to restore the link between the Basic State Pension and earnings.It's time also to make public services personal to the needs of the elderly: more control over personal social care budgets; more choice managing chronic care; a wider range of services from home helps to district nurses. Better personal care so that older people can choose to stay in their own homes.I want to ensure for all those who have served the community all their lives - respect, dignity and security in old age.And everything we build -- we build on a strong foundation of economic stability.ECONOMY Our commitment to stability has been tested again and again over ten years: the Asian crisis; the Russian crisis; the American recession; the trebling of oil prices. And in the last month a wave of financial turbulence that started in America and then Germany and has impacted on all countries including the United Kingdom and tested the stability of our financial system.Yesterday Alistair Darling set out how we will continue to respond with the same calm vigilance that he has demonstrated over recent weeks.And it is because of the strength of the British economy that we are able to steer a path of low inflation, low interest rates and stable growth.Ten years ago before a Labour government we were 7th in the G7 for income per head. Now we are second only to the USA - above Germany, above France, above Italy, above Japan, above Canada - with the longest uninterrupted period of economic growth in the history of our country.And in Britain where once there were three million unemployed, there are today more men and women in jobs than ever in our history - for the first time over 29 million people in work.And we will continue to intensify the reform of the new deal, remove every barrier, show we can have flexibility and fairness together to advance to a Britain of full employment in our generation.And we will build on one of the greatest achievements of our Labour and trade union movement - the National Minimum Wage. Next week we will again raise the National Minimum Wage to £5.52 an hour and because we will do more for vulnerable workers, in all companies and in all places the minimum wage will be enforced without exception.And next week for the first time on top of holiday entitlement 4 days paid public holidays guaranteed.We should take pride that, under a Labour government, Britain - this small number of people on this small island - is the fifth largest economy in the world.As we set out on the next stage of our journey this is our vision: Britain leading the global economy - by our skills and creativity, by our enterprise and flexibility, by our investment in transport and infrastructure - a world leader in science; a world leader in financial and business services; a world leader in energy and the environment from nuclear to renewables; a world leader in the creative industries; and yes - modern manufacturing too - drawing on the talents of all to create British jobs for British workers.HOUSING There is another aspiration I have heard across the country.I've met too many young couples who've told me - we work hard, we save, we play by the rules, we want to get on and yet we can't afford to buy or even rent our first home.So we plan to help first time buyers and we will increase house-building to 240,000 new homes a year - in places and ways that respect our green spaces and the environment. My aim by 2010 two million more homeowners than in 1997.And for the first time in nearly half a century we will show the imagination to build new towns - eco-towns with low and zero carbon homes. And today because of the response we have received we are announcing that instead of just 5 new eco towns, we will now aim for ten eco towns - building thousands of new homes in every region of the country.And for affordable housing and for social housing we will now invest £8 billion. This will mean a 50 per cent increase in funds for social housing.I call on all housing associations and councils of all political parties not only to support shared equity for first time buyers, but to help us build more social homes for rent, more homes for key workers and more homes to cut the unacceptable levels of overcrowding. Good homes to rent and buy for the British people.CRIME A strong Britain is a Britain of strong communities where by accepting our mutual obligations to each other we can make our homes, our streets and our neighbourhoods safe.Those who choose to disobey the laws of our land - their crimes, the pain they inflict, that danger and immorality - threaten the rights and security of every citizen.No parent should ever have to endure the suffering of the family of Rhys Jones, the young boy callously murdered in Liverpool on Wednesday August 22nd.And the reason the people of Britain have been so shocked is that amongst the vast majority of us there is an abhorrence of guns in our society.That is why we took the right decision to ban handguns. And now we need to deal with the illegal supply of guns.Two thirds of deaths from gun crime occur in just four cities. In the last few weeks Jacqui Smith and I have focussed on the specific areas in these cities where as I saw on Saturday at first hand the police will now: match intensive uniformed patrolling and extensive undercover work; with the use of stop and search powers and dispersal powers; reinforced by new hand-held weapon detectors; and all backed up at a national level by the work of the organised crime agency and our border force rigorously targeting and stopping the illegal entry of guns.My answer to crime and disorder - our policy - is to both punish and prevent.To punish: for anyone over 18 illegally carrying a gun, a five-year sentence.To prevent: in our schools intensive education warning about guns and knives and teachers encouraged to use new powers to confiscate weapons. And in our communities ex gang members helping us pull young people out of gangs.To punish the evil of drug pushers who poison our children: I want the tough new powers that have already closed over one thousand crack houses in some areas of the country to be used in all areas of the country.And to encourage local police to use new powers to confiscate drug profits, more of the confiscated funds will go direct to the police and local communities.To prevent addiction: we will extend drug education and expand drug treatment and we will send out a clear message that drugs are never going to be decriminalised.There are now 139,000 police officers and 16,000 Community Support Officers - more officers than ever before.And by April 7th next year, every community will have its own neighbourhood policing team. And I can announce that we will provide hand held computers - 1,000 now, by next year 10,000 right across the country - cutting paper work so that officers can log crimes on the spot, stay on the beat and not waste time returning to the station to fill out forms.So yes we will strengthen the police. Yes we will strengthen our laws. But preventing crime for me also means all of us as a community setting boundaries between what is acceptable and unacceptable behaviour - with clear penalties for stepping over the line.ANTI-SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR Boundaries that reflect the words I was taught when I was young - words upon which we all know strong communities are founded: discipline, respect, responsibility.Bullying is unacceptable - and unacceptable too is disrupting a classroom.So to punish: we will give teachers the support they need to exclude.To prevent: parents held accountable - fined if they fail to supervise. And so that these young people are not left to hang around street corners, councils and authorities obligated to maintain their education and supervision.Binge drinking and underage drinking that disrupt neighbourhoods are unacceptable.To punish: let me tell the shops that repeatedly sell alcohol to those who are under age - we will take your licences away.To prevent: councils should use new powers to ban alcohol in trouble spots and I call on the industry to do more to advertise the dangers of teenage drinking.I've met young people and pensioners alike who say they want to feel safe when they go out but also that young people need somewhere to go and something to do.So respect must be a two way street.As we take action against anti-social behaviour, so too we must take action that could transform our communities, by providing the kind of facilities young people want and need.So we will use unclaimed assets in dormant bank accounts to build new youth centres, and we will invest over £670 million pounds so that in every community there are places for young people to go.With youth budgets let us say to young people: for the first time you will have a say over how the money is spent.I believe we have not done enough in the last ten years to emphasise that in return for the rights we all have, there are responsibilities we all owe.New rights to better health care but you have to show up and not miss your appointment. New rights to educational maintenance allowances but you have to show you are working hard.New rights to higher maternity allowances but you have to meet with a health visitor.The right for company boards to make their own decisions, but obligations to the rest of society too.And an understanding that if you come to our country you not only learn our language and culture: you must play by the rules.IMMIGRATION In July I announced a new unified border force. And already the first elements are in place - a stronger uniformed presence at ports, customs officers targeting illegal immigration, stronger security checks at passport control, by next year ID cards for foreign nationals and we will start to count people in and out.And we will move forward with our new Australian-style points-based approach to immigration. So Britain will continue to benefit from skilled workers from abroad and they will understand their responsibilities to earn the right to settle in Britain.But let me be clear any newcomer to Britain who is caught selling drugs or using guns will be thrown out. No-one who sells drugs to our children or uses guns has the right to stay in our country.POLITICS And to achieve a Britain of mutual obligation, I am convinced that we need a new kind of politics.I continue to reach out to all those who work hard and play by the rules, who believe in strong families and a patriotic Britain who may have supported other parties but who like me want to defend and advance British values and our way of life.All of the challenges we have to face can only be met by listening to and involving the British people themselves. And I have no doubt that the best answer to disengagement from our democracy is to renew our democracy.And that means more change:Change to make the executive more accountable. That's why parliament will make the final decisions about peace and war;Change to strengthen our liberties to uphold the freedom of speech, freedom of information and the freedom to protest;Change to strengthen local democracy with new powers for economic development and bus services and I pay tribute to the work of our local Labour councillors across the country.Change within our own party, now for the first time to decide our policy one member one vote;And yes: change to the House of Lords - and we will in our manifesto commit to introduce the principle of elections for the second chamber.ENVIRONMENT Perhaps the biggest challenge for the new politics is to show how we as a community can join together to safeguard the environment, to turn the silent, rising tide of global warming.And I am proud that Britain will now become the first country in the world to write into law binding limits on carbon emissions. But I am not satisfied: so I am asking the new independent climate change committee to report on whether the 60 per cent reduction in emissions by 2050, which is already bigger than most other countries, should be even stronger still.And by investing in energy efficiency, renewables, carbon capture, clean fuels and new environmental technologies, I want Britain to lead in carbon-free vehicles, carbon-free homes and carbon-free industry. And I want the new green technologies of the future to be the source of British jobs in British businesses.And I commit to work tirelessly for a new post-Kyoto UN climate change agreement with - yes - to help the poorest, binding targets for all the richest countries.And let me say: we in Britain cannot be good stewards of the environment unless we are good internationalists and that means being good Europeans too.EUROPE At all times we will stand up for the British national interest.And I accept my responsibility to write in detail into the amended European Treaty the red lines we have negotiated for Britain.And whether it's environmental, economic or security cooperation, we will hold fast to the partnerships with our closest ally America, our membership of the European Union, the Commonwealth and our commitment to the United Nations.HUMAN RIGHTS You know, there is a golden thread of common humanity that across nations and faiths binds us together and it can light the darkest corners of the world. And the message should go out to anyone facing persecution anywhere from Burma to Zimbabwe: human rights are universal and no injustice can last forever.People will look back on events in Darfur as they did in Rwanda and say why did you the most powerful countries in the world fail to act, to come to the aid of those with the least power?Who can fail to be moved by the mother in Darfur who saved her two youngest children from militias and hid them away? She rushed back to her village to find her husband and older son murdered - and then was repeatedly raped by the Janjaweed.All for being a member of the wrong tribe, all for acting upon that shared human impulse to protect her own children.Her story touches our deepest conscience and summons us to act. In my first weeks I went to the United Nations where we fought for and secured a clear and unequivocal UN-resolution.We have sent a message directly to the government of Sudan: make progress or face tougher new sanctions. And we will not rest until there is an end to the aerial bombings, a ceasefire, a lasting political settlement and justice for the women and children of Darfur.TONY BLAIR One of the great challenges we now face is to work for peace and security in the Middle East. Tony Blair - for thirteen years the Leader of our Party - is now leading in the middle east peace effort and let me here acknowledge the contribution he is making now and the debt we owe as a party and as a country to Tony Blair.And as the Northern Ireland Assembly meets, thanks also to the work of Tony Blair, let us celebrate that Northern Ireland is now building prosperity because it is now enjoying peace.And working internationally for understanding and reconciliation across borders, Neil Kinnock, here with us today, is chairing the British Council and let me also acknowledge the debt of gratitude we in this party owe to him.FOREIGN POLICY Because we will do our duty and discharge our obligations, we will work in Iraq and Afghanistan for three objectives: security, political reconciliation and economic reconstruction, and at all times we will do everything to ensure the security of our dedicated armed forces.Let me say: there should be no safe haven, no hiding place anywhere in the world for Al Qaeda and terrorism.To prevail in this struggle will require more than military force and we will work with our allies to isolate extremism and win the battle of hearts and minds.I tell you today: there is a global poverty emergency.Today 80 million children do not go to school. I want us, inspired by Nelson Mandela's lead to take a campaign to every corner of the world - so that we will be the first generation to ensure every child in every country in every continent has the right to go to school.Every year 10 million die from diseases we could have the medicine and science to prevent and cure. If in the 20th century human ingenuity could put a man on the face of the moon, then surely in this 21st century human compassion can lift the pain from the face of a suffering child.So let us be the first generation to ensure that every infant child and mother is protected against, and that we eliminate, the scourges of tuberculosis, polio, diphtheria, malaria - and HIV/aids.HEALTHCARE For sixty years Britain has shown the way to health care not as a privilege to be paid for but as a fundamental human right.Better than any other endeavour the NHS expresses our mutual obligation to each other: because all of us need help some of the time, it is the best insurance policy in the world.I've been round the country and I've been visiting hospitals, GP surgeries, health centres.I have listened to and I have heard the British people.They know when they have a medical emergency the NHS is there for them and at its best. They tell me of their huge admiration for our doctors, our nurses and our NHS staff - and we do not thank them enough, and we should do so now.I know too there are real concerns about basic things that need to change: getting in to see your GP when you need to; being confident the ward in your hospital will be clean; and at every stage being treated as an individual with respect.So yes there is work to do.But let us be clear: the British people do not want to remove the NHS bit by bit; they want to improve the NHS year by year.And why shouldn't all British people and not just some be able to see their Doctor at the time they want, at the hospital or clinic they want - not at a time someone else wants.So let me set out how we take the NHS into a new era.Our great achievement of the 1940s was a service universal to all. In 2007 we need a service that is accessible to all and personal to all.Our great ambition now: a National Health Service that is also a personal health service.And we now have to make big practical changes to set a new standard of service.MRSA and C-Difficile are this century's hospital diseases which every modern country is now having to root out.And to make sure every hospital is clean and safe, following best practice around the world, there will be new funds direct to every hospital for a deep clean of our wards.We will more than double the number of hospital matrons to 5,000. We will give matrons and ward sisters in all 10,000 wards the powers to report cleaning contractors and safety concerns directly to hospital boards and a stronger health care commission.And I can announce that matrons will have the power to order additional cleaning and send out a message - meet the highest standards of cleanliness or lose your contract.I want an NHS: personal to you because you are seen by a consultant in a matter of days, not months; personal to you because there is a right to be given x-ray results quickly and time to discuss your treatment; personal to you because we know that being unwell is not just a nine to five problem.And so we will make GP hours more friendly to families, open up opportunities to see a GP near your place of work as well as your home, expand walk in centres, medical services at pharmacies and ensure a better service from NHS Direct.I know the most worrying time for women is whenever breast cancer is suspected. That's when you need an NHS personal to you.On best medical advice, we will now extend the ages for breast cancer screening by six years, treat every suspected breast cancer as urgent and guarantee your consultant can fast track you.And we will also extend colon cancer screening right up the age scale into your seventies.I can also say that, following the review by Professor Darzi, my aim for the next stage of an NHS personal to you: for every adult a regular check up on the NHS.In July I met Liam Fairhurst, a twelve year old boy who won the Diana Princess of Wales medal for raising money for cancer and leukaemia research. And he was raising money in memory of a childhood friend who died from cancer even as he himself is fighting the disease.And I believe this too is a mission for our generation.Over the next ten years: I am proud to announce that through the medical research council and the NHS together, Britain will invest more than ever before - £15 billion of public money - financing the genius of British researchers and doctors as they convert breakthroughs in genetics, stem cell research and new drugs into cures and vaccines to combat cancer and the deadliest of diseases.My vision of the NHS - an NHS that is both pioneering new cures and personal to you.And why do I believe so strongly in the NHS?When I was at school it was football, rugby, running, sports: these were what I did all the time and so I was fitter then.But when I was sixteen, when I was playing for my school rugby team against our former pupils, someone accidentally kicked me near my eyes. And from the age of 16 to 21, I spent a lot of time in hospital as the NHS worked to save my sight.I learned that with a simple twist of fate life can change.It was the skills of a surgeon, the care of wonderful nurses, the attention and yes, the love and care of the NHS staff that managed to save one of my eyes.And it is because of the NHS that I can see the words I read today.The experiences we live through shape the way we think of the world. Experiences like these have made me the person I am.Sometimes people say I am too serious and I fight too hard and maybe that's true.But these experiences taught me what families all across Britain know: that things don't always come easy and there are things worth fighting for.Like so many people across this country I have the best of reasons to believe in the life-saving power of the NHS - and the liberating power of education - and for making them both the best they can be.So this is my pledge to the British people:I will not let you down.I will stand up for our schools and our hospitals.I will stand up for British values.I will stand up for a strong Britain.And I will always stand up for you.

aVI want to talk with you today about who I am, what I believe, what I am determined to lead this party and this great country to achieve.As we gather here today I know people have real concerns about the future of the country, the future of the economy and people in this hall have concerns about the future of our party too.And so I want to answer your questions directly, to talk with you about how amidst all the present difficulties we should be more confident than ever that we can build what I want to talk to you about today.  A new settlement for new times.  A fair Britain for the new age.  But let me start with something I hope you know already.I didn't come into politics to be a celebrity or thinking I'd always be popular. Perhaps, that's just as well.  No, 25 years ago I asked the people of Fife to send me to parliament to serve the country I love.And I didn't come to London because I wanted to join the establishment, but because I wanted and want to change it.So I'm not going to try to be something I'm not.And if people say I'm too serious, quite honestly there's a lot to be serious about - I'm serious about doing a serious job for all the people of this country.What angers me and inspires me to act is when people are treated unfairly.So when people share with me stories about the hard time they're having with bills, I want to help, because I was brought up seeing my parents having to juggle their budget like the rest of us.And when I talk to parents about schools, I'm determined that every child should have a good school, because while I got my break in a great local secondary, not all my friends got the chance to get on.And when I speak to victims of crime I get angry - because like them I know the difference between right and wrong.  And so here I am - working for this incredible country, while trying as far as possible to give my children an ordinary childhood. Some people have been asking why I haven't served my children up for spreads in the papers. And my answer is simple.  My children aren't props; they're people.And where I've made mistakes I'll put my hand up and try to put them right. So what happened with 10p stung me because it really hurt that suddenly people felt I wasn't on the side of people on middle and modest incomes - because on the side of hard-working families is the only place I've ever wanted to be. And from now on it's the only place I ever will be.  And so I want to give the people of this country an unconditional assurance - no ifs, no buts, no small print - my unwavering focus is taking this country through the challenging economic circumstances we face and building the fair society of the future.  The British people would not forgive us if at this time we looked inwards to the affairs of just our party when our duty is to the interests of our country.The people of Britain would never forget if we failed to put them first - and friends, they'd be right.And because this is a time of greater than ever change around us, it must be a time of higher ambition from us. And because the world of 2008 is now so different from the world of 1997 I want to talk about the new settlement we must build for these new times.You know, each generation believes it is living through changes their parents could never have imagined - but the collapse of banks, the credit crunch, the trebling of oil prices, the speed of technology, and the rise of Asia - nobody now can be in any doubt that we are in a different world and it's now a global age.In truth, we haven't seen anything this big since the industrial revolution. This last week will be studied by our children - as the week the world was spun on its axis - and old certainties were turned on their heads.And in these uncertain times, we must be, we will be, the rock of stability and fairness upon which people stand.And friends, it's a calling that summons us because in every time of profound change those with great wealth and privilege have always been able to look after themselves.But our duty, what gives us moral purpose, is serving the people who need us most- Britain's vast majority - people on middle and modest incomes who need to know that they are not on their own amidst this change - we are on their side.Where there are new risks and new pressures our duty is and will be security for all. And where there are new opportunities, our duty is and will be fair chances for everyone matched by fair rules applied to everyone.And insuring people against the new risks and empowering people with new opportunities is the mission of the hour. And those who say that governments should walk away when people face these risks and need these opportunities will be judged to be on the wrong side of history.And when the country is asking their government to meet these new challenges I say to our opponents: those who don't believe in the potential of government shouldn't be trusted to form one.So this is a defining moment for us - a test not just of our judgement but of our values. Today once again we are called to apply our enduring beliefs to completely new conditions.New Labour has always been at its best when we have applied our values to changing times.  In the 1990s Tony and I asked you to change policy to meet new challenges.We are and will always be a pro-enterprise, pro-business and pro-competition government. And we believe the dynamism of our five million businesses large and small is vital to the success of our country.  But the continuing market turbulence shows why we now need a new settlement for these times - a settlement that we as a pro-market party must pursue.A settlement where the rewards are for what really matters - hard work, effort and enterprise.A settlement where both markets and government are seen to be the servants of the people, and never their masters,Where what counts is not the pursuit of any sectional interest but the advancement of the public interest - and where at all times we put people first.Let us be clear the modern role of government is not to provide everything, but it must be to enable everyone.And just as we know that governments cannot and should not do everything, so too we know markets cannot deliver it all on their own.And just as those who supported the dogma of big government were proved wrong, so too those who argue for the dogma of unbridled free market forces have been proved wrong. And so it falls to this party and to this government, with its commitment both to fairness and to business, to propose and deliver what after recent events everyone should now be willing to accept - that we do all it takes to stabilise the still turbulent financial markets and then in the months ahead we rebuild the world financial system around clear principles. And friends the work begins tomorrow.I and then Alistair will meet financial and government leaders in New York to make these proposals:First, transparency - all transactions need to be transparent and not hidden.Second, sound banking, a requirement to demonstrate that risks can be managed and priced for bad times as well as good.Third, responsibility - no member of a bank's board should be able to say they did not understand the risks they were running and walk away from them.Fourth, integrity - removing conflicts of interest so that bonuses should not be based on short term speculative deals but on hard work, effort and enterprise.I know that the British people think it's hard work, effort and enterprise we need to reward. And fifth, global standards and supervision because the flows of capital are global, then supervision can no longer just be national but has to be global.And if we make these changes I believe London will retain its rightful place as the financial centre of the world.And we know that the challenges we face in this new global age didn't begin in the last week, or in the last months, but in fact reflect deeper changes in our world. For all its benefits, the global age has revealed not just financial instability but another major pressure - a rising global population demanding more energy.So the new settlement also requires another great and historic endeavour to end the dictatorship of oil and to avert catastrophic climate change, a transformation in our use of energy. New nuclear power, an unprecedented increase in renewables and investment in clean coal.And I am asking the climate change committee to report by October on the case for, by 2050 not a 60% reduction in our carbon emissions, but an 80% cut - and I want British companies and British workers to seize the opportunity and lead the world in the transformation to a low carbon economy and I believe that we can create in modern green manufacturing and service one million new jobs.And it's not just our duty but our basic philosophy that we do everything we can to help families through the world downturn. And while the Conservatives did nothing to help people with their gas and electricity bills in the last world downturn, this winter, millions of people will receive the help with heating bills, insulation, social tariffs - help they never received from the Conservatives.But you know, when it comes to public spending you can't just wave a magic wand to conjure up the money - not even with help from Harry Potter.And so there are tough choices and I have to say that as a result of the events of recent weeks there are going to be tougher choices we will have to make and priorities we will have to choose. And just as families have to make economies to make ends meet, so this government must and will ensure that we get value for money out of every single pound of your money that is spent.  But I say to you that we will invest it wisely, continuing our record investment in schools, Sure Start centres, transport and hospitals.And if we make the right decisions to take people through the world downturn fairly we will find that, despite the current troubles, British firms and British workers can reap the rewards of a world economy set to double in size.With Britain's great assets - our stability, our openness, our scientific genius, our creative industries, and yes our English language - I know that this can be a British century and I'm determined it will be.But my argument today is that the new settlement for the global age must do even more to empower people with new opportunities  insure people against new risks and as a result value hard work effort and enterprise. It's the economy that's been making the headlines, but there are other big changes too.People feel their communities are changing before their eyes and it's increasing their anxiety about crime and anti-social behaviour. And so we will be the party of law and order.And for the first time ever we've got more British pensioners than British children - more people living longer on fixed incomes and worried about whether they'll need long term care. And so we will be the party that will ensure security and dignity for pensioners.And there are new pressures on parents - worrying about balancing work and family life but also about advertising aimed straight at their children and what their children are watching or downloading from the internet. And so we will be the party of the family.And so the new settlement for our times show how Britain can meet all these challenges too and its more than about a fair prosperity - it must be about fair chances and fair rules too.You know some people say that there's an inevitable political cycle in this country - as sure as night follows day. I don't agree. The challenge of these new times demands a truly progressive government to help people cope with the new risks and make the most of the new opportunities. That's why I believe that now more than ever - even more than in 1997- this country needs a Labour government.You know to govern is to choose - and it's what a government chooses to do when it's tested that demonstrates its priorities and reveals its heart.It is not the arithmetic of statistics but the fabric of people's lives.When we talk about three million more people in work since 1997 - that's not just a number, that's a life that's been changed - three million times over. That's the young woman laid off in the mid 90's who's now built a booming business of her own. Three million new jobs not by accident, but by our actions. And in the years to come we will demonstrate again that real power of Labour to change lives.And when we talk about the one million small and medium-sized businesses set up in the last eleven years, that's not just a number - that's the entrepreneur who can treat her parents to a summer holiday, and the local businessman who's taken on two local teenagers as apprentices. One million new businesses demonstrating yet again the real power of Labour to change lives.And when we talk about one million people benefiting from new Labour's minimum wage that's not just a number - that's a dad doing security shifts who can now afford a birthday party for his child and it's a mum who doesn't have to go to a loan shark to pay for her kids' Christmas. One million people freed from exploitation- and now the minimum wage rising year on year - that's the real power of Labour to change lives.And when we talk about the 240,000 lives that are saved by the progress Labour's NHS has made in fighting cancer and heart disease, that's not just a number - that's the dad who lives to walk his daughter up the aisle and the gran who is there to clap and cry at her grandson's graduation. 240,000 families still together - and now thousands more with new and better treatments from an expanding NHS -- we're changing the world the only way it can ever really change - one life, one family, one hope at a time. That's the real power of Labour to change lives.And why do we always strive for fairness?Not because it makes good soundbites.Not because it gives good photo opportunities.Not because it makes for good P.R.No.We do it because fairness is in our DNA.It's who we are - and what we're for.It's why Labour exists.It's our first instinct, the soul of our party.It's why when things get tough, we get tougher. We stand up, we fight hard - for fairness. We don't give in, and we never will.For me fairness is treating others how we would be treated ourselves. So it isn't levelling down but empowering people to aspire and reach ever higher. And to take advantage of all the opportunities of the global economy I want to unleash a new wave of rising social mobility across our country.For too long we've developed only some of the talents of some people - but the modern route to social mobility is developing all the talents of all the people....helping those who are working their way up from very little and  lifting up those in the middle who want to get on. It means supporting what really matters - hard work and effort and enterprise. This is not just the new economic necessity, it is the modern test of social justice and the radical centre ground we occupy and will expand. And fairness is why Harriet is introducing the first ever equalities bill.  And let me thank her for her tireless work as deputy party leader. Fairness is why Ed Miliband is ensuring that community and third sector organisations can play their proper part in every neighbourhood.And it is why our whole party is leading the fight against the British National Party. Fairness is why John Denham is extending university access, why Ruth Kelly has introduced for the first time free bus travel for pensioners and why John Hutton and our Labour Members of the European Parliament but are fighting to free agency workers from the scourge of exploitation.But fairness for the future also means a big change that I want to explain today. We have always stood for public services that are universal, available to all. Now we must stand for public services that are not only available to all, but personal to each.For me, the fairer future starts with putting children first - with the biggest investment in children this country has ever seen. It means delivering the best possible start in life with services tailored to the needs of every single precious child.In 1997 there were no Sure Start centres and nursery education for only the few. Today, thanks to the work of Beverley Hughes there are children's centres opening in every community to serve 3 million children who a few years ago had nothing, and free nursery education for every three and four year old.But our ambitions must be greater still. I want Britain to take its place among the leading nations in pre-school services, and so I pledge here today in Manchester starting in over 30 communities, and then over 60, we will, stage by stage, extend free nursery places for two year olds for every parent who wants them in every part of the country backed by high quality, affordable childcare for all.That's the fairness parents want - and that's the fairness every Labour party member will go out and fight for.And because child poverty demeans Britain, we have committed our party to tackle and to end it. The measures we have taken this year alone will help lift two hundred and fifty thousand children out of poverty. The economic times are tough of course that makes things harder - but we are in this for the long haul - the complete elimination of child poverty by 2020. And so today I announce my intention to introduce ground-breaking legislation to enshrine in law Labour's pledge to end child poverty.And Ed Balls and I will never excuse, explain away or tolerate low standards in education. So we will keep up the pace of reform:  more academies, trust and specialist schools, more of the brightest and best graduates becoming teachers, more investment in building schools for the future - state of the art schools for world class schooling.Fairness demands nothing less than excellence in every school, for every child. So today I guarantee to parents two fundamental rights:Because every child should leave primary school able to read, write and count, any child who falls behind will not be left behind - but will now have a new guaranteed right to personal catch up tuition.And because all parents should see their children taught in schools which achieve good results at GCSE, our pledge today is that any parents whose local state school falls below the expected standard will have the right to see that school transformed under wholly new leadership, or closed and new school places provided.And we want to enable all families to use the internet to link back to their children's school - and so Jim Knight is announcing that we will fund over a million extra families to get online, on the way to our ambition of Britain leading the world with more of our people than any other major economy able to access the internet and broadband.And now as we celebrate the 60th anniversary of the NHS let me on behalf of all of us here, and all the people of the country - thank all the NHS staff - the cooks and cleaners, the paramedics and porters, the doctors and midwives and nurses.You have served our country and served a great ideal - the principle that in a fair society healthcare should not be a commodity to be bought by some but a right to be enjoyed by all. Labour is the party of the NHS - we created it, we saved it, we value it and we always will support it.And you know already that for me, this isn't a political agenda but a personal mission.  Last year in Bournemouth I told you how when I was 16, I got injured playing rugby and lost the sight forever in my left eye. I knew I couldn't play football or rugby anymore. But I could still read.But what I didn't tell you last year was that then one morning I woke up and realised my sight was going in my good eye. I had another operation and lay in the darkness for days on end. At that point my future was books on tape.But thanks to the NHS, my sight was saved by care my parents could never have afforded. And so it's precisely because I know and have heard from others about the miraculous difference a great surgeon and great nurses and great care can make that I'm so passionate about the values of the NHS and so committed to reforming it to serve these values even better.That's why in just one year in the fight against hospital infections, we have doubled the number of matrons and achieved a 36 percent reduction in MRSA.And let us remember what a Labour government has now achieved: the lowest ever waiting times in the whole history of the NHS.And now to respond to new times and higher aspirations we want to make the National Health Service more personal to people's needs - patients more involved in their own health care with more choice and more control than ever before.And I've always found it unfair that we cannot offer on the NHS the comprehensive services that private patients can afford to buy. And so in April a Labour Britain will become the first country in the whole world to offer free universal check ups for everyone over 40.And I say that there is no vested interest, no matter how powerful, that we are not prepared to take on when change is needed for the sake of the nation's health.We have already made it easier for busy families to go to the doctor. Whilst a year ago only 1 in 10 patients had access to GPs at weekends and in the evening. Now almost half of all practices are open and by the end of next year the majority will be open even longer. And today I want to show how this government will pursue what I believe to be one of the noblest and boldest contributions of this country to our shared human fortunes.Since the war nearly one third of Britain's Nobel prizes have been for our genius in medicine. We should now aspire to stretch the boundaries of human knowledge and human health ever further.I want Britain to lead the world in beating the diseases which cause so much heartbreak for families. Over the last few years we've made major breakthroughs in research relevant to cancer, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and strokes and many more.But these are yet to be turned into treatments from, which we can all benefit from. And so let me tell you today that the unprecedented 15 billion pounds we are investing in medical research will be directed to turning the major advances of the last few years into actual treatments and cures for NHS patients.Over the next decade we can lead the way in beating cancer and other diseases - a great endeavour worthy of a great country: proud because we have a health service focused on 21st century needs.A NHS that is available to all and personal to each means meeting another challenge of the future: offering, for the first time, every patient with a long term condition their own care plan.But alongside new patient responsibilities will be new rights. And because we know that almost every British family has been touched by cancer, Alan Johnson and I know we must do more to relieve the financial worry that so often goes alongside the heartache. And so I can announce today for those in our nation battling cancer from next year you will not pay prescription charges.And this is not the limit of our commitment to a fair NHS in a fair society. As over the next few years the NHS generates cash savings in its drugs budget we will plough savings back into abolishing charges for all patients with long-term conditions. That's the fairness patients want and the fairness every Labour party member will go out and fight for.And in a fair society the fact that older people are living longer should be a blessing for their families not a burden. We are committed to linking pensions to earnings.And I am proud that we will now be implementing for the first time equality for women in their retirement.No-one should live in fear of their old age because they worry their social care will impose financial burdens they could never afford to face and that the minute they need care puts the family home at risk.The generation that rebuilt Britain from the ashes of the war deserves better and so I can tell you today that Alan Johnson and I will also bring forward new plans to help people to stay longer in their own homes and provide greater protection against the costs of care - dignity and hope for everyone in their later years.That's the fairness older people deserve - and the fairness every Labour party member will go out and fight for.So when people say in these tough times there's nothing we can do, there's nothing higher to aim for, no great causes left worth fighting for, my reply is our ideas are the ideas that will realise the hopes of families for a better future.  Providing free nursery care for more children who need it is a cause worth fighting for.Providing better social care for older people who need it is a cause worth fighting for. Delivering excellence in every single school is a cause worth fighting for. Universal check-ups and new help to fight cancer - these are all causes worth fighting for. This is the future we're fighting for.And in this world of vast economic and social change, new opportunity for all must be matched with a new responsibility from all. Our aim is a something for something, nothing for nothing Britain. A Britain of fair chances for all, and fair rules applied to all.So our policy is that everyone who can work, must work. That's why James Purnell has introduced reforms so that apart from genuine cases of illness, the dole is only for those looking for work or actively preparing for it. That's only fair to the people pulling their weight. And let me be clear about the new Labour policy on crime; taking action on the causes of crime will never mean indulging those who perpetrate it. Fairness demands that we both punish and prevent.Jacqui Smith and Jack Straw are introducing a landmark reform in our justice system - to put victims first.  In consultation with victim support we will create an independent commissioner who will stand up for victims, witnesses and families - the people the courts and police exist to serve.  And Damilola Taylor's father Richard is with is here today.He's an inspiring example of the determination to see some good come out of personal tragedy.  Last weekend he led thousands on a march through our capital, sending a united message.  We will take the knives off our streets.And justice seen is justice done - so you will be seeing more neighbourhood policing on the street, hearing more about the verdicts of the court, able to see the people who offended  doing community payback which will be what it says; hard work for the public benefit at the places and times the public can see it. That's only fair to the law abiding majority.Nobody in Britain should get to take more out of the system than they are willing to put in. I am proud that Britain will honour our obligations to provide refuge from persecution. And we recognise the contribution that migrants make to our economy and our society, but the other side of welcoming newcomers who can help Britain is being tough about excluding those adults who won't and can't. That's why we have introduced the Australian-style points-based system, the citizenship test, the English language test and we will introduce a migrant charge for public services.That's only fair to the public who play by the rules and to the new citizens who uphold the rules.So across the board, we will create rules that reward those who play by them and punish those who don't. That's what fairness means to me.You know our party so often in its history has been home to the big ideas - ideas later taken for granted, but revolutionary in their time. Just think, the vote for working men, and then for women, the NHS, legal protection from race or sex discrimination. These are no longer just Labour policies, they are established British values - they are the common sense of our age.And we should never forget one thing - that every single blow we have struck for fairness and for the future has been opposed by the Conservatives. And just think where our country would be if we'd listened to them. No paternity leave, no New Deal, no Bank of England independence, no Sure Start, no devolution, no civil partnerships, no minimum wage, no new investment in the NHS, no new nurses, no new police, no new schools.And so let's hear no more from the Conservatives - we did fix the roof while the sun was shining.And just think if we'd taken their advice on the global financial crisis. Their policy was to let Northern Rock fold and imperil the whole financial system, our Labour government saved Northern Rock so not a single UK depositor lost out.Their policy said, in this week of all weeks, that speculative short selling should continue. We acted decisively to end reckless speculation.And the conservative policy would mean that at this very moment, there would be no regulation at all to protect homeowners.  We are the party of protecting of homeowners rights.Do you know what their Shadow Chancellor really said? In the week that banks were collapsing the man who wants to run our economy not only said: this is not a problem caused by the financial markets but went on to say and, I quote, that it\u2019s \u201ca function of financial markets\u201d that people make \u201cloads of money out of the misery of others\u201d.Just imagine where we'd be if they'd been in a position to implement their beliefs - no rescue of Northern Rock, no action on speculation, no protection for mortgages, doing nothing to stop banks going under.What has become clear is that Britain cannot trust the Conservatives to run the economy.Everyone knows that I'm all in favour of apprenticeships, but let me tell you this is no time for a novice.But I believe in giving credit where it's due. The Conservative leader's team are smart - they've got a plan, and they are implementing it ruthlessly.Their strategy is to change their appearance, to give the appearance of change, and to conceal what they really think.And when salesmen won't tell you what they are selling, it's because they are selling something no-one should buy.But I'm a man for detail and I've discovered some clues about what would be in store in a Conservative Britain. They want us to believe that, like us, they now care about public services. But when Mr Cameron actually talks to his party about their spending plans he says the difference between Labour and Tory levels of public investment will be "dramatic" and "fundamental".They want to tell us we're all progressives now but the day that Hazel Blears and Caroline Flint were announcing a one billion pound package to support millions of homeowners, the Conservatives were confirming that their first tax priority is to take that one billion pounds from hard working families and hand it over to the 3,000 richest estates in Britain.And they want to tell us they now believe in investing in education, but they are committed to slashing 4.5 billion from the schools building programme, axing the educational maintenance allowances that help poorer students stay on and opposing the raising the education leaving age to eighteen and stopping training programmes. And yes friends, they would even take away Sure Start from infants and their parents. One of our greatest gifts to the future - one of the first priorities for Tory cuts.The Conservatives may want to represent the future, but whether its Europe or energy, planning or tax credits,  university places or 42 days, whenever they are tested on substance they have nothing to offer to meet the big challenges of tomorrow, because they are prisoners of their past.If you look beneath the surface, you'll see that the Conservatives might have changed their tune, but they haven't changed their minds.The Conservatives say our country is broken - but this country has never been broken by anyone or anything. This country wasn't broken by fascism, by the cold war, by terrorists.Of course there are problems, but this is a country being lifted up every day by the people who love it.We've got 4 million people helping neighbourhood watch, 6 million sports volunteers and over 5 million people doing amazing work as carers.And just as we celebrated our national triumph when we won the 2012 games for London, so too were Andy Burnham, Tessa Jowell and I, along with all of you, filled with pride this summer as our Olympic and Paralympics heroes showed British brilliance at its best.That's why for all the challenges, I don't believe Britain is broken - I think it's the best country in the world.  I believe in Britain. And stronger together as England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland we can make our United Kingdom even better.And ours is a country full of heroes.And we pay special tribute to the heroism of our armed forces, as Des Browne said yesterday - to their service and sacrifice in Iraq and in Afghanistan and in peacekeeping missions around the globe. Quite simply the best armed forces in the world.The whole lesson of the new world I described earlier is that we must work together to meet the great shared challenges vital to our future.And unlike the Conservatives who are extremists and isolationists on Europe, we will work with our partners in the European Union and we will work with America not just to deal with the immediate security challenges in Georgia and in Iran.And I tell you that what we do together for the poor and vulnerable is an act of compassion, but it is more than that.  It is what will determine whether this new global society succeeds or fails.And David Miliband, Douglas Alexander and I will do everything in our power to bring justice and democracy, to Burma, to Zimbabwe and to Darfur.And I promise you I will work with other countries to bring a permanent settlement - a secure Israel and a viable Palestine - to deliver peace for the people of the Middle East. And this week at Britain's request the United Nations has summoned the leaders of the world to a special summit on what we know is a global poverty emergency.You know, in the museum in Rwanda which commemorates the millions who lost their lives as the world looked the other way, there is a picture of a young boy called David - a ten year old who was tortured to death. His last words were "don't worry - the United Nations will come for us".But we never did. That child believed the best of us only to discover that the pieties repeated so often meant in reality nothing at all. The words "never again" became just a slogan and not what it should be - the crucible in which are values are tested. I tell you, this Labour government will not allow the world to stand by as more than 20,000 children die today from diseases we know how to cure. We will not pass by as 100 million men, women and children face a winter of starvation.So the poor will not go unheard tomorrow at the United Nations, because we the British people will speak up for them and for justice.The fair society. Fairness at home. Fairness in the world - that's the new settlement for new times.I know what I believe.I know who I am.I know what I want to do in this job.And I know that the way to deal with tough times is to face them down.Stay true to your beliefs.Understand that all the attacks, all the polls, all the headlines, all the criticism, it's all worth it, if in doing this job I make life better for one child, one family, one community.Because this job is not about me, it's about you.And I'll tell you what else I've learned - that tough times don't weaken the determination of people who believe in what they're doing but strengthen our resolve.You know when I talk to the people who do the tough jobs - nurses, teachers, police officers, soldiers, carers - about why they do what they do, so often they say to me "because I want to make a difference".And doesn't each of us want to say of ourselves:That I helped someone in need.That I come to the aid of a neighbour in distress.That I will not pass by on the other side.That I will give of myself for something bigger than myself.And each of us can make a contribution - but together we are even more than that.United we are a great movement led by hopes not fears, gathered person by person - one individual, and then a few more, then hundreds, then thousands, then finally millions strong, a movement where I want each of us to say to each other:This is our country, Britain. We are building it together, together we are making it greater;Together we are building the fair society in this place and in this generation.The mission of our times - the fair society, the cause that drives us on - and we will win, not for the sake of our party, together we will win for the future of our country.

aVYou know friends, it is the fighters and believers who change the  world. We\u2019ve changed the world before, and we\u2019re going to change the world again. And you know, our country faces the biggest choice  for a generation. So we need to fight; not bow out, not walk away, not give in, not give up, but fight. Fight to win for Britain.  Because if anyone says that to fight doesn\u2019t get you anywhere, that politics can\u2019t make a difference, that all parties are the same, then look what we\u2019ve achieved together since 1997: the winter fuel allowance, the shortest waiting times in history, crime down by a third, the creation of Surestart, the Cancer Guarantee, record results in schools, more students than ever, the Disability Discrimination Act, devolution, civil partnerships, peace in Northern Ireland, the social chapter, half a million children out of poverty, maternity pay, paternity leave, child benefit at record levels, the minimum wage, the ban on cluster bombs, the cancelling of debt, the trebling of aid, the first ever Climate Change Act; that\u2019s the Britain we\u2019ve been building together, that\u2019s the change we choose.And so today, in the midst of events that are transforming our world, we meet united and determined to fight for the future. Our country confronts the biggest choice for a generation.  It\u2019s a choice between two parties, yes.  But more importantly a choice between two directions for our country. In the last eighteen months we have had to confront the biggest economic choices the world has faced since the 1930s.It was only a year ago that the world was looking over a precipice and Britain was in danger. I knew that unless I acted decisively and immediately, the recession could descend into a great depression with millions of people\u2019s jobs and homes and savings at risk.And times of great challenge mean choices of great consequence, so let me share with you a little about the choices we are making.The first choice was this: whether markets left to themselves could sort out the crisis; or whether governments had to act. Our choice was clear; we nationalised Northern Rock and took shares in British banks, and as a result not one British saver has lost a single penny. That was the change we chose. The change that benefits the hard working majority, not the privileged few.And we faced a second big choice \u2013 between letting the recession run its course, or stimulating the economy back to growth. And we made our choice; help for small businesses, targeted tax cuts for millions and advancing our investment in roads, rail and education. That was the change we chose - change that benefits the hard working majority and not just a privileged few.And then we had a third choice, between accepting unemployment as a price worth paying, or saving jobs.  And we in Britain made our choice, it\u2019s meant half a million jobs saved. And so Conference even in today\u2019s recession there are 29 million people in work.  2 million more men and women providing for their families than in 1997. And then we faced the mortgage choice \u2013to do nothing as repossessions rose or save the family homes people have worked so hard to buy. 200,000 homeowners given direct government support to stay in their home. That was the change we chose \u2013 change that benefits the mainstream majority and not just a few.And then we faced another choice; between going our own way, or acting with other countries. And everybody knows the choice we made \u2013 we picked internationalism over isolationism, leading the G20 to a global deal that will save 15 million jobs.Every government across Europe made the choice to act.  Every government across the G20 chose to act. Almost every major political party across the world chose to act.Only one party thought it was best to do nothing.Only one party with pretensions to government made the wrong choice; the Conservative Party of Britain.They made the wrong choice on Northern Rock.The wrong choice on jobs and spending.The wrong choice on mortgage support.The wrong choice on working with Europe.The only thing about their policy that is consistent is that they are consistently wrong.The opposition might think the test of a party is the quality of its marketing but I say the test for a government is the quality of its judgement.The Conservative Party were faced with the economic call of the century and they called it wrong.And I say a party that makes the wrong choices on the most critical decisions it would have faced in government should not be given the chance to be in government.And what of the big choices that this country has to make now - to help young people into work or to see, like the 80s, a wasted generation. And I\u2019ll tell you the choice we\u2019re making. To reject every piece of Conservative advice and instead we will ensure school leavers training, guarantee the young unemployed work experience, expand university places and to increase, not cut the apprenticeships we need. I\u2019m sorry to say that by opposing these measures conservative policy would callously and coldly return us to the lost generation and cardboard cities of the 1980s \u2013 we say never again. That\u2019s the change we choose, the change that benefits the many, not the few.Every day we are facing the business choice \u2013 to support our companies from car manufacturers to the self-employed or simply let great British businesses go to the wall. And we are making our choice. Labour believes in the businesses and enterprise of Britain. More than 200,000 agreements signed to give direct support to small businesses.That was the change we chose; change that benefits the enterprising backbone of Britain. In opening up planning in improving transport, in opting for nuclear energy it is Labour that is the party of British business and British enterprise and the Conservative Party\u2019s whose policy has been to walk away.And the Conservatives were wrong on all these choices, because they were wrong about something more fundamental still.Because what let the world down last autumn was not just bankrupt institutions but a bankrupt ideology. What failed was the Conservative idea that markets always self-correct but never self-destruct. What failed was the right wing fundamentalism that says you just leave everything to the market and says that free markets should not just be free but values free.One day last October the executive of a major bank told us that his bank needed only overnight finance but no long term support from the government.The next day I found that this bank was going under with debts that were among the biggest of any bank, anywhere, at any time in history. Bankers had lost sight of basic British values, acting responsibly and acting fairly.  The values that we, the hard working majority, live by every day.Like the small businessman who came to see me when his credit dried up at the bank. He was crying with the shame of missing some payments, but so responsible was he, that he was determined that every penny he owed would be paid. Or like the woman who wrote to me and said that when we announced our decision to rescue Icesave and her family\u2019s savings it was the first night\u2019s sleep she\u2019d had since the crisis started.When markets falter and banks fail it\u2019s the jobs and the homes and the security of the squeezed middle that are hit the hardest. It\u2019s the hard pressed, hard working majority \u2013 the person with a trade, the small business owner, the self-employed. It\u2019s the class room assistant, the worker in the shop, the builder on the site.It\u2019s the millions of people who do their best and do their bit and in return simply want their families to get on not just get by.It\u2019s the Britain that works best not by reckless risk-taking but by effort, by merit and by hard work.It\u2019s the Britain that works not just by self-interest but by self-discipline, self-improvement and self-reliance. It\u2019s the Britain where we don\u2019t just care for ourselves, we also care for each other. And these are the values of fairness and responsibility that we teach our children, celebrate in our families, observe in our faiths, and honour in our communities.Call them middle class values, call them traditional working class values, call them family values, call them all of these; these are the values of the mainstream majority; the anchor of Britain\u2019s families, the best instincts of the British people, the soul of our party and the mission of our government.And I say this too; these are my values \u2013 the values I grew up with in an ordinary family in an ordinary town.Like most families on middle and modest incomes we believed in making the most of our talents.But we knew that no matter how hard we worked free education was our only pathway to being the best we could be.  Because like most parents, my parents could not easily afford to put me and my brothers through fee paying schools.And I come from a family which, independent and self reliant as it was, could not have kept going without the compassion and caring of the NHS, because my parents could not easily have afforded to pay for operations on my eyes.So I come from a family for whom the NHS was quite simply the best insurance policy in the world.For us the NHS has not been a sixty year mistake but a sixty year liberation.And it has been those experiences, and that background, that has taught me that yes, too much government can make people powerless. But too much government indifference can leave people powerless too.Government should never try to do what it cannot do but it should never fail to do what it needs to do. And in a crisis what the British people want to know is that their government will not pass by on the other side but will be on their side.So we will not allow those on middle and modest incomes to be buffeted about in a storm not of their making.And so this is our choice \u2013 to toughen the rules on those who break the rules.Markets need what they cannot generate themselves; they need what the British people alone can bring to them, I say to you today; markets need morals.So we will pass a new law to intervene on bankers\u2019 bonuses whenever they put the economy at risk. And any director of any of our banks who is negligent will be disqualified from holding any such post.Some people believe that the public will end up subsidising the bankers\u2019 mistakes.And so I tell you this about our aims for the rescue of the banks: the British people will not pay for the banks.  No, the banks will pay back the British people.That\u2019s what we need to do to rectify the problems of the past. Now it\u2019s time to make changes that are even more fundamental for a world that is being utterly transformed.  In the uncharted waters we sail, the challenge of change demands nothing less than a new model for our economy, a new model for a more responsible society and a new model for a more accountable politics.Staying with the status quo is not an option.The issue is not whether to change, but how.And always a party of restless and relentless reformers, the new mission for new Labour is to realise our passion for fairness and responsibility in these new global times. And as we rise to the challenge of change so this coming election will not be a contest for a fourth term Labour government, but for the first Labour government of this new global age.Our new economic model for a strong economy is founded on three guiding principles.That in future finance must always be the servant of people and industry and not their masterThat our future economy must be a green economyAnd that we must realise all of Britain\u2019s talent if we are to lead and succeedThe best way finance can serve our country now is to help ensure that the inventions and innovations pioneered in Britain are developed and manufactured in Britain.  So we will create a new national investment corporation to provide finance for growing manufacturing and other businesses; our £1 billion innovation fund will the back the creativity and inventions that are essential to the economy.And I want the Post Office - to play a much bigger role, bringing banking services back to the heart of people\u2019s communities.And our economic future must be green.We are already global leaders in wind power, green cars, clean coal and carbon capture. And now we will lead again, with new designated low carbon zones around the regions of this country. And I say to you today \u2013 we will create over a quarter of a million new green British jobs.And every day we stall on a climate change deal, the people of the world are denied the chance to protect their world. And so I say \u2013  I will go to Copenhagen and I will go with our British plan to secure a climate change deal this year.And the new model for education in the 21st century \u2013the biggest step we can take into the future - is to unlock the talents of all young people.Let the new economy be one where social mobility is not held back and in this new economy there must be no cap on aspiration no ceiling on opportunity and no limit on where your talents can take you.And so I can tell you that in the next five years we cannot and will not cut support to our schools. We will not invest less, but more.And our guarantee to parents is a ruthless determination to raise standards in every school.We will aggressively turn round underperforming schools so that your child will have a good local school no matter where you live. Our guarantee to all young people is that with millions of new opportunities from apprenticeships to internships to a new class of modern technicians, we will discover, coach, develop and showcase the wealth of aspiration and talent that exists in Britain.And to add to the 100 thousand new young people\u2019s jobs we are already creating, we can today offer in partnership with the Federation of Small Businesses, ten thousand skilled internships so that, even in the midst of tough economic times, we are encouraging a whole new generation of young Britons to embrace ambition and British enterprise.And I can also announce that we will work with the Eden project and Mayday Network to create the biggest group of green work placements we have ever done- up to 10,000 green job placements so that our young people can make the most of the opportunities the low carbon economy will open up to them.And friends let me talk bluntly; to pay for our schools, hospitals, police, and the change we want to make we have to make choices about taxation and public spending. Let no one be in any doubt: as a result of Labour\u2019s economic management, Britain started the downturn with the second lowest debt of any G7 economy. And just as we have always taken the hard and tough decisions on stability in the past, we will continue to apply the same rigour to our decisions in the future.Our deficit reduction plan to cut the deficit in half over four years, will be made law in a new fiscal responsibility act. And I can say today that every change we make, every single pledge we make, comes with a price tag attached, and a clear plan for how that cost will be met.For there are only two options on tax and spending \u2013 and only one of them benefits Britain\u2019s hard-working majority.One is reducing the deficit by cutting front line public services \u2013 the conservative approach.The other is getting the deficit down while maintaining and indeed improving front line public services \u2013 the Labour approach.So we will raise tax at the very top, , cut costs, have realistic public sector pay settlements,  make savings we know we can and in 2011 raise National Insurance by half a percent and that will ensure that each and every year we protect and improve Britain\u2019s frontline services.Our opponents would take a different approach.They want to cut spending now, so that means less money now for frontline services.They want to cut inheritance tax for the 3,000 wealthiest estates, so that means even less money for frontline services.And they are against the measures we took to raise taxes and so that means even less money for frontline services.These are not cuts they would make because they have to \u2013 these are spending cuts they are making because they want to.It is not inevitable \u2013 it is the change they choose.And when people say faced with the constraints of the recession can you make progress towards a fairer and more responsible Britain let us tell them we did, we can, and we will.In 1997 we held back spending and people said there could be no progress - but we introduced the new deal, sure start the minimum wage and paved the way for tax credits and new hospitals and schoolsIn the last 12 years we\u2019ve already given teenagers educational maintenance allowances to help them stay on until 18.  And in the next five years not just some but all young people will be staying in education or training until 18.We\u2019ve already ensured that three quarters of our GP practices are open out of hours \u2013 and in the next five years we will ensure every patient has the right to see a GP in the evening or at the weekend.We\u2019ve already lifted 900 thousand pensioners out of poverty \u2013 and in the next five years will restore the earnings link for the basic state pension.And in the last twelve years we created the first legal national minimum wage.And in every year of the next five years we will increase it.The minimum wage was the dream of Neil Kinnock \u2013 and he\u2019s with us today.It was the dream of John Smith \u2013 whom we remember today.And it was one of the achievements of Tony Blair, and we thank him today.And when the minimum wage rises this month it will be 60% higher than when it started.And I can say today that not just the minimum wage, but child benefit and child tax credits for families will continue to rise every year. And for all those mums and dads who struggle to juggle work and home, I am proud to announce today that by reforming tax relief we will by the end of the next Parliament be able to give the parents of a quarter of a million two year olds free childcare for the first time.And I do think it\u2019s time to address a problem that for too long has gone unspoken, the number of children having children. For it cannot be right, for a girl of sixteen, to get pregnant, be given the keys to a council flat and be left on her own.From now on all 16 and 17 year old parents who get support from the taxpayer will be placed in a network of supervised homes. These shared homes will offer not just a roof over their heads, but a new start in life where they learn responsibility and how to raise their children properly. That\u2019s better for them, better for their babies and better for us all in the long run.We won\u2019t ever shy away from taking difficult decisions on tough social questions.Because we have to be honest \u2013 its not just bankers and politicians that have lost the people\u2019s trust. Even though there is so much that is amazing about Britain, if you ask your neighbours or your workmates how they feel right now in this fast changing world, they will probably talk about their sense of unease.The decent hard working majority feel the odds are stacked in favour of a minority, who will talk about their rights, but never accept their responsibilities. In a faster changing more mobile world of communities where family breakdown is more common, where children are at risk on the internet, where elderly people are too often isolated in their communities, the new society must be explicit about the boundaries between right and wrong- and about the new responsibilities we demand of people in return for the rights they have. And I stand with the people who are sick and tired of others playing by different rules or no rules at all.Most mums and dads do a great job \u2013 but there are those who let their kids run riot and I\u2019m not prepared to accept it as simply part of life.Because there is also a way of intervening earlier to stop anti-social behaviour, slash welfare dependency and cut crime. Family intervention projects are a tough love, no nonsense approach with help for those who want to change and proper penalties for those who don\u2019t or won\u2019t.I first saw this tough approach at work in Dundee where a young single mother who got into trouble with drugs was at risk of her kids being taken into care. But within months she was going to college to get a decent job to look after the children she loved.Family intervention projects work. They change lives, they make our communities safer and they crack down on those who\u2019re going off the rails. Starting now and right across the next Parliament every one of the 50,000 most chaotic families will be part of a family intervention project \u2013 with clear rules, and clear punishments if they don\u2019t stick to them.And we have said that every time a young person breaches an ASBO, there will be an order, not just on them but on their parents, and if that is broken they will pay the price.Because whenever and wherever there is antisocial behaviour, we will be there to fight it.We will never allow teenage tearaways or anybody else to turn our town centres into no go areas at night times. No one has yet cracked the whole problem of a youth drinking culture. We thought that extended hours would make our city centres easier to police and in many areas it has. But it\u2019s not working in some places and so we will give local authorities the power to ban 24 hour drinking throughout a community in the interests of local people. And let me say this bluntly; when someone is found guilty of a serious crime caused by drinking, the drink banning order which is available to the courts should be imposed. And where there is persistent trouble from binge drinking, we will give local people the right to make pubs and clubs pay for cleaning up their neighbourhood and making it safe. Neighbourhood policing is now a reality in every council ward in our country.Recent cases have shown it is time for a better service for the citizen. So if it\u2019s an emergency you must get action in minutes, where it\u2019s a neighbourhood priority within the hour, and where it\u2019s a general but not urgent enquiry no one will have to wait more than 48 hours for a reply or a visit. That\u2019s what I mean by public services personal to people\u2019s needs.And I can tell the British people that between now and Christmas, neighbourhood policing will focus in a more direct and intensive way on anti-social behaviour.  Action squads will crackdown in problem estates, protect the public spaces you want safe and hold monthly beat meetings to consult you directly on your priorities for action.This is a new and more mobile world and so we have to step up the protection of our borders against terrorism and illegal immigration. And it means we must take a tough approach to who gets to come to our country and who gets to stay.Tightening our points-based immigration system ensures that those who have the skills that can help Britain will be welcomed, and those who do not, will be refused.And the ID cards for foreign nationals are working. But in the last two years we have looked again at how we can give the best security to our British citizens whilst never undermining their liberties.We will reduce the information British citizens have to give for the new biometric passport to no more than that required for today\u2019s passport.And so conference, I can say to you today, in the next Parliament there will be no compulsory ID cards for British citizens.So I have been candid about the challenges we face. But we are also proud of our achievements and what makes this country we love so special.Britain \u2013 the four home nations \u2013 each is unique, each with its own great contribution and we will never allow separatists or narrow nationalists in Scotland or in Wales to sever the common bonds that bring our country together as one.And let me say to the people of Northern Ireland we will give you every support to complete the last and yet unfinished stage of the peace process which Tony Blair to his great credit started and which I want to see complete \u2013 the devolution of policing and justice to the people of Northern Ireland, which we want to see happen in the next few months.I want a Britain that is even more open to new ideas, even more creative, even more dynamic and leading the world and let me talk today about how we will do more to support the great British institutions that best define this country.The first is the one I spoke about in detail on Sunday when I talked about the mission of our brave men and women in Afghanistan.The heroism of our fighting men and women is unsurpassed and we owe them a debt we can never fully repay. And let us on behalf of the British people pay tribute to them and their courage today.The British armed forces truly are the finest in the world. And let us say to them \u2013 all British forces will always have all the equipment they need and the best support we can give.And conference let me say, Britain will work with President Obama and 40 other countries for peace and stability for the people of Afghanistan, and to make sure that terrorism doesn\u2019t come to the streets of Britain.And we will work for peace and stability for the peoples of Israel and Palestine.We will work to end nuclear proliferation and as I said last week when I talked of the contribution Britain can make; we will work as partners to end the world\u2019s nuclear arms race.And I say to Iran as they face a crucial date this week; join the international community now or face isolation.And let me say what was once an aspiration \u2013 0.7% of national income spent on international development aid, has become with Labour a promise, and will in future become a law. We will pass legislation that the British government is obliged to raise spending on aid to the poorest countries to 0.7% of our national income. Others may break their promises to the poorest, with Labour Britain never will.And there is huge debate around the world today about how countries can manage health care. Countries from every continent look to our NHS for inspiration. And this summer didn\u2019t we show them \u2013 we love our NHS. We can sometimes talk about the NHS purely in statistics \u2013 purely about the record numbers of doctors and nurses and operations and treatments under Labour. But it isn\u2019t about the figures \u2013 it\u2019s about the individuals who get help. I got a letter from Diane, a mother from Rugby who wrote to me saying her life had been saved because the NHS used its extra investment to reduce the age for breast cancer screening.Before she would have had to wait until 50 \u2013 and her surgeon told her that if she had, she\u2019d probably be dead. But thanks to the changes we made, Diane was diagnosed early, treated early, and was back at work within three weeks. When she wrote to me about us lowering the screening age she said \u201cthis may seem small in comparison to all the other issues you deal with, a small thing to do but it probably saved my life.\u201dAnd so I say to you today; Labour fought for the NHS, you fought to save and invest in the NHS, and because you did, you are saving lives every day. You should be very, very proud.Because if you\u2019ve changed one life you\u2019ve changed the world.And because we know that our investment in breast cancer screening works and early intervention saves lives, I am proud to announce that we will go much further.We will finance a new right for cancer patients to have diagnostic tests carried out, completed and with results \u2013 often same day results - within one week of seeing your GP. That is our early diagnosis guarantee, building on our current guarantee of only two weeks wait to see a specialist.And so with three major steps forward \u2013 early diagnosis, early treatment and our historic investment in research for cancer cures, we in Britain can transform cancer care; and our ambition is no less than to beat cancer in this generation.That is the change we have chosen; change that benefits not just the few who can pay but the mainstream majority.For a few days this summer Sarah and I worked  helping in a local hospice near our home and I say now that the care and compassion shown by volunteers and staff must by matched by greater support for this work of mercy.And in our times there is a new challenge that no generation has ever had to face before.  We have an ageing society and new rightful demands for dignity and for support in old age. And so we need social care for our elderly which is not subject to a post code lottery, but available to all \u2013 to the hard working majority, and not just the few who can pay.And so we will say in Labour\u2019s manifesto that social care for all is not a distant dream, that to provide security for pensioners for generations to come \u2013 we will bring together the National Health Service and local care provision into a new National Care Service. That is the change we chose.And we can start straight away.Today more and more people see their parents and grandparents suffering from conditions like Alzheimer\u2019s and dementia, and they see their dignity diminish.And for too many families the challenge of coping with the heartbreak is made worse by the costs of getting support.The people who face the greatest burden are too often those on middle incomes, who have savings which will last a year or two, but then they will see their savings slip away. And the best starting point for our National Care Service is to help the elderly get the amenities to do what they most want: to receive care and to stay in their homes as long as possible.And so for those with the highest needs we will now offer in their own homes free personal care.It\u2019s a change that makes saving worthwhile, makes every family in this country more secure and is a much needed reassurance for the elderly and their children.This is the change we choose; change that will benefit not just the few who can afford to pay, but the mainstream majority.But a fair and responsible Britain must be an accountable Britain \u2013 a nation not of powerful institutions but powerful people. And just as I have said that the market needs morals I also say that politics needs morals too.Let me say that the vast overwhelming majority of our Labour Members of Parliament are in Parliament not out of self interest but to serve the public interest. And our new generation of Parliamentary candidates want to join them not to make a personal gain but to make a difference.But there are some who let our country down. And never again should any Member of Parliament be more interested in the value of their allowances than the values of their constituents.Never again should it be said of any Member of Parliament that they are in it for what they can get; all of us should be in Parliament for what we can give.And so where there is proven financial corruption by an MP and in cases where wrong-doing has been demonstrated but Parliament fails to act we will give constituents the right to recall their Member of Parliament.And if we want a politics that is more open, more plural, more local, more democratic, then we will need to make big changes because the only way to ensure politics serves the people\u2019s values is to make all those who wield political power genuinely accountable to the people.There is now a stronger case than ever that MPs should be elected with the support of more than half their voters \u2013 as they would be under the Alternative Voting system. And so I can announce today that in Labour\u2019s next manifesto there will be a commitment for a referendum to be held early in the next Parliament it will be for the people to decide whether they want to move to the Alternative Vote.In this next year we will remove the hereditary principle in the House of Lords once and for all. And then unlike the last election we will ask for a clear mandate to make the House of Lords an accountable and democratic second chamber for the very first time.I\u2019ve been honest with you about where we\u2019ve got it right. And where we\u2019ve fallen short and have to do more. And I am determined to fight for change to benefit the mainstream majority. All that we have talked about today would simply not happen if the Conservatives were in power.The Conservative Party want people to believe that the ballot paper has an option marked change without consequence \u2013 that\u2019s it\u2019s only a change of the team at the top.They\u2019ve deliberately held their cards close to their chest. They\u2019ve done their best to conceal their policies and their instincts. But the financial crisis forced them to show their hand and they showed they had no hearts.And so I say to the British people the election to come will not be about my future \u2013 it\u2019s about your future.  Your job.  Your home.  Your children's school.  Your hospital.  Your community.  Your country.And so when our opponents talk of change, ask yourself.  Is that change that will benefit my family, or only a privileged few?Listen to what they say - but more importantly demand to know what they would do.If you\u2019re a family that\u2019s feeling the pinch \u2013 don\u2019t take it from me \u2013 just ask them the question. If you care about me, why is your first priority to give a 200 thousand pound tax giveaway to each of the 3,000 wealthiest estates?And if you\u2019re one of the millions of Britons who loves our NHS\u2013 don\u2019t take it from me \u2013 just ask them the question. If you care about us, why would you scrap the right to see a cancer specialist within two weeks? And if you\u2019re worried about crime \u2013 don\u2019t take it from me \u2013 just ask them the question. Why would you cut the Home Office budget by the equivalent of 3,500 police officers this year alone and then make it harder for them to catch the most violent criminals using DNA evidence? And if you care about a proud Britain \u2013 don\u2019t take it from me \u2013 just ask them the question.  Why would you put this country\u2019s prosperity and power at risk by placing Britain at the fringe of Europe rather than at its heart?Ask them; how can you deliver change when you so clearly haven\u2019t even changed your own party?Because there is a difference between the parties. It\u2019s the difference between Conservatives who embrace pessimism and austerity and progressives like Labour who embrace prosperity and hope. And this is a timeless difference in our approach. It\u2019s between those like them whose vision is limited to how things are and those like us who reach for the world that can be.And isn\u2019t this the story of Britain at its best and the Labour Party at its best, that we are people who strive for and achieve great changes even when others say it is impossible?They said a free National Health Service was impossible, then argued it was unworkable, then said it was unaffordable, but in the last 12 years we have rebuilt it and it is now quite simply, for the British people, irreplaceable. They told me debt relief for the poorest was impossible \u2013 but we refused to give in and now thanks to debt relief and aid 40 million more children across the world are going to school.And even when they told us last year that a great depression was inevitable and the world could not come together, we did, even when others said it was beyond our grasp.Maybe you think it\u2019s because I\u2019m the guy who doesn\u2019t take no for an answer, and you\u2019re right; I don\u2019t. But it\u2019s really because I grew up in a family, a party and a country that believes no obstacle is so great that it can stop the onwards march of fairness and of justice.And so I urge you, as the poet said, dream not small dreams because they cannot change the world. Dream big dreams and then watch our country soar.We can build a new economy which tames the old excesses.  We can meet and master the challenge of an ageing society with a National Care Service, we can in this generation be the first to beat cancer.We can transform our politics.We can do all these things and more if we think big and then fight hard.Since 1997 Labour has given this country back its future. And we are not done yet.We love this country. And we have shown over the years that if you aim high you can lift not just yourself but your country - that there is nothing in life which is inevitable \u2013 it\u2019s about the change you choose.And I say to you now \u2013Never stop believing in the good sense of the British people.Never stop believing we can move forward to a fairer, more responsible, more prosperous Britain.Never stop believing we can make a Britain equal to its best ideals.Never, never stop believing. And because the task is difficult the triumph will be even greater.Now is not the time to give in but to reach inside ourselves for the strength of our convictions.Because we are the Labour Party and our abiding duty is to stand. And fight. And win. And serve.

aVThe New GenerationConference, I stand here today ready to lead: a new generation now leading Labour. Be in no doubt. The new generation of Labour is different. Different attitudes, different ideas, different ways of doing politics.Today I want to tell you who I am, what I believe and how we are going to do the most important thing we have to do - win back the trust of the country.PersonalWe all of us share a deep conviction which brought us into this party and into this hall.But each of us has our own individual story.And I want to tell you about mine.In 1940, my grandfather, with my Dad, climbed onto one of the last boats out of Belgium.They had to make a heart-breaking decision \u2013 to leave behind my grandmother and my father's sister. They spent the war in hiding, in a village sheltered by a brave local farmer. Month after month, year upon year, they lived in fear of the knock at the door.At the same time, on the other side of Europe, my mother, aged five, had seen Hitler's army march into Poland.She spent the war on the run sheltering in a convent and then with a Catholic family that took her in. Her sister, her mother and her.My love for this country comes from this story. Two young people fled the darkness that had engulfed the Jews across Europe and in Britain they found the light of liberty.They arrived with nothing. This country gave them everything.It gave them life and the things that make life worth living: hope, friendship, opportunity and family.And they took hope and opportunity. They worked hard; they got on.My Dad learnt English, paid his way moving furniture during the day, and studying at night at technical college. He joined the Navy to fight for our country and afterwards he wanted to go to university. He did.My Mum built a life here after the war, for all of us. I know nobody more generous, nobody more kind, nobody more loving and nobody more relieved that this is contest is over, than my Mum.The gift my parents gave to me and David are the things I want for every child in this country. A secure and loving home. Encouragement and the aspiration to succeed.In those ways my family was just like every other. But in some ways it was different.I suppose not everyone has a dad who wrote a book saying he didn't believe in the Parliamentary road to socialism.But you know, it wasn't a cold house.It was warm, full of the spirit of argument and conviction, the conviction tha t leads me to stand before you today, the conviction that people of courage and principle can make a huge difference to their world.What my parents learnt in fear, they passed on to us in an environment of comfort and security.And there was one more lesson that I learnt.We do not have to accept the world as we find it. And we have a responsibility to leave our world a better place and never walk by on the other side of injustice.Freedom and opportunity are precious gifts and the purpose of our politics is to expand them, for all our people.That faith is not something I chose. It's not something I learned from books, even from my Dad's books.It was something I was born into.And that is why David and I have devoted our lives to politics.And it is why I will commit to you here and now. My beliefs will run through everything I do. My beliefs, my values are my anchor and when people try to drag me, as I know they w ill, it is to that sense of right and wrong, that sense of who I am and what I believe, to which I will always hold.Conference, I am so honoured that you chose me to lead your party and I know you share those values.And I am proud that every day, day in and day out, in every village, and every town and city in the land, you work to put those values into practice.Conference, can I thank you for the heroic work you did at the election.The reason we denied the Conservative Party a majority was because of the incredible work of Labour and trade union members the length and breadth of our country.From Birmingham Edgbaston to Westminster North and from Edinburgh South to the Vale of Clwyd, it was your dedication, your energy and your determination to fight for the communities you love that beat the Ashcroft millions.And let me thank everyone, not just Labour Party members, but thousands of ordinary members of the public who drove the BNP out of Barking and Dagenham.But let's face facts.We had a bad result.We had a very bad result.And we are out of government.And let me tell you, there is nothing good about opposition.Every day out of power, another day when this coalition can wreak damage on our communities, another day when we cannot change our country for the better.And let us resolve today that this will be a one-term government. That is the purpose of my leadership of this party.But to achieve that we must go on our own journey.And that is why the most important word in politics for us is humility.We need to learn some painful truths about where we went wrong and how we lost touch.We must not blame the electorate for ending up with a government we don't like, we should blame ourselves.We have to understand why people felt they couldn't support us.We have to show we understand the problems people face today.This will require strong leadership. It won't always be easy. You might not always like what I have to say.But you've elected me leader and lead I will.This country faces some tough choices. And so do we. And we need to change.You remember. We began as restless and radical. Remember the spirit of 1997, but by the end of our time in office we had lost our way.The most important lesson of New Labour is this: Every time we made progress we did it by challenging the conventional wisdom.Think of how we took on the idea that there was a public ownership solution to every problem our society faced.We changed Clause 4. We were right to do so.Think of how we emphasised being tough on crime was as important as being tough on the causes of crime. We were right to do so.Think of how we challenged the impression that we taxed for its own sake and that we were hostile to business. We were right to change.And think of how we challenged the idea of a male dominated Parliament with All-Women shortlists and made the cause of gender equality central to our government. We were right to do so.And the reason Tony and Gordon took on conventional wisdom in our party was so they could change the country.We forget too easily what a radical challenge their ideas were to established ways of thinking about Britain and how they reshaped the centre-ground of politics.They were reforming, restless and radical.The old way of thinking said that economic efficiency would always come at the price of social justice.With the minimum wage, tax credits, the New Deal, they showed that was wrong.I am proud that our government lifted hundreds of thousands of children out of poverty, hundreds of thousands of pensioners out of poverty, proud that we created the highest levels of employment in Britain's history.The old way of thinking said that public services would always be second-class. But we defied the conventional wisdom.I come from a generation that suffered school lessons in portacabins and crumbling hospitals. I tell you one thing, for the eighteen years they were in power the Tories did nothing to fix the roof when the sun was shining.Our legacy is a generation for whom newly built schools and modernised hospitals are an everyday fact of life.I am proud of the fact that because of what we did, yes we did save the National Health Service in this country.The old way of thinking said that you couldn't change attitudes towards gay men and lesbians.Let me tell you that last month I was privileged to be in this great city, at Pride, to see not just thousands of people marching but thousands of people lining the street in support.We should be proud that our commitment to equality means we have couples forming civil partnerships across the country and celebrating with t heir family and friends.The old thinking told us that for 300 years, the choice was either the break up of the United Kingdom or Scotland and Wales run from London.We should be proud that Labour established the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly. And we should make sure that after next May's elections we re-elect Carwyn Jones as the First Minister in Wales and we elect Iain Gray as the new First Minister in Scotland.And I am so so proud that, against all the odds, we helped deliver peace in Northern Ireland. And it will be one of Tony Blair's great legacies to this country.The old thinking told us that the challenges of the world were too big and our country too small to make a difference.But thanks to our leadership around the world, development spending is now heading towards our goal, forty million more children are going to school each day, and two hundred million are protected from malaria. And that would never have happened without the leadership of Gordon Brown as Chancellor and then Prime Minister.Tony and Gordon had the courage to take on established attitudes and institutions - and change Britain.It is that courage that made us such a successful political force.But our journey must also understand where it went wrong. I tell you, I believe that Britain is fairer and stronger than it was 13 years ago.But we have to ask, how did a party with such achievements to its name end up losing five million votes between 1997 and 2010?It didn't happen by accident.The hard truth for all of us in this hall is that a party that started out taking on old thinking became the prisoner of its own certainties.The world was changing all around us - from global finance to immigration to terrorism - New Labour, a political force founded on its ability to adapt and change lost its ability to do so.The reason was that we too often bought old, establis hed ways of thinking and over time we just looked more and more like a new establishment.Let me say to the country:You saw the worst financial crisis in a generation, and I understand your anger that Labour hadn't changed the old ways in the City which said deregulation was the answer.You wanted your concerns about the impact of immigration on communities to be heard, and I understand your frustration that we didn't seem to be on your side.And when you wanted to make it possible for your kids to get on in life, I understand why you felt that we were stuck in old thinking about higher and higher levels of personal debt, including from tuition fees.You saw jobs disappear and economic security undermined, I understand your anger at a Labour government that claimed it could end boom and bust.And I understand also that the promise of new politics of 1997 came to look hollow after the scandal of MPs' expenses. And we came to look l ike a new establishment in the company we kept, the style of our politics and our remoteness from people.I stand before you, clear in my task: to once again make Labour a force that takes on established thinking, doesn't succumb to it, speaks for the majority and shapes the centre ground of politics.And I tell you this: if we are not this party, nobody will be.This new generation that leads our party is humble about our past and idealistic about our future.It is a generation that will always stand up for the mainstream majority.It is a generation that will fight for the centre ground, not allow it to be dominated or defined by our opponents.And it is a generation which thirsts for change.This week we embark on the journey back to power.It will be a long journey involving hard thinking for our party.We do not start that journey by claiming we know all the answers now.We do so by setting a direction of change.Let me tell you what kind of country I want to see:This generation wants to change our economy so that it works better for working people and doesn't just serve the needs of the few at the top.This generation wants to change our society so that it values community and family, not just work, because we understand there is more to life than the bottom line.This generation wants to change the way government works because it understands the power of the state to change lives but also how frustrating it can be if not reformed.This generation wants to change our foreign policy so that it's always based on values, not just alliances.And this generation knows very profoundly that to change Britain we need a new politics.Above all, I lead a new generation not bound by the fear or the ghosts of the past.As we emerge from the global economic crisis, we face a choice: we can return to business as usual or we can challenge old thinking to build the new economy we need.Let me say, I believe strongly that we need to reduce the deficit.There will be cuts and there would have been if we had been in government.Some of them will be painful and would have been if we were in government.I won't oppose every cut the coalition proposes.There will be some things the coalition does that we won't like as a party but we will have to support.And come the next election there will be some things they have done that I will not be able to reverse.I say this because the fiscal credibility we earned before 1997 was hard won and we must win it back by the time of the next general election.I am serious about reducing our deficit.But I am also serious about doing it in a way that learns the basic lessons of economics, fairness and history.Economics teaches us that at times of recession governments run up deficits.We were too exposed to financial services as an economy so the impact of the crash on the public finances was deeper on us than on others.We should take responsibility for not building a more resilient economy.But what we should not do as a country is make a bad situation worse by embarking on deficit reduction at a pace and in a way that endangers our recovery.The starting point for a responsible plan is to halve the deficit over 4 years, but growth is our priority and we must remain vigilant against a downturn.You see when you cancel thousands of new school buildings at a stroke, it isn't just bad for our kids, it's bad for construction companies at a time when their order books are empty.It's not responsible, it's irresponsible.When you deprive Sheffield Forgemasters of a loan, a loan from government which would be paid back, you deprive Britain of the ability to lead the world in new technology.It's not responsible, it's irresponsible.And when you reduce your economic policy simply to deficit reduction alone you leave Britain without a plan for growth.It's not responsible, it's irresponsible and we should say so.No plan for growth means no credible plan for deficit reduction.And nor should we reduce the deficit without learning the basic lessons of fairness.We must protect those on middle and low incomes. They did nothing to cause the crisis but are suffering the consequences.I say the people who caused the crisis and can afford to do more should do more: with a higher bank levy allowing us to do more to protect the services and entitlements on which families depend.And we should learn the basic lessons of history.After 1945, we had the biggest debt we have ever had.That generation cut the deficit but they had a bigger vision: for a new economy and a good society.True patriotism is about re ducing the debt burden we pass on to our kids.But Mr Cameron, true patriotism is also about building an economy and a society fit for our kids to work and live in.You were the optimist once but now all you offer is a miserable, pessimistic view of what we can achieve. And you hide behind the deficit to justify it.But I have a different ambition, to emerge from the global economic crisis tackling the deficit, but also learning the much deeper lessons that this generation must learn.It is a huge challenge to change our economy for the future and the same old thinking will lead to the same old results: an economy too dependent on financial services, too many people stuck in low pay and dead-end jobs and growing inequality.We need a plan for change. A plan to reform the banks, invest in the industries of the future and support the small businesses and entrepreneurs who can be the lifeblood of our economy.The new generation in my party understands the fundamental New Labour lesson that we must build prosperity as well as redistributing it.And it also knows that there are huge vested interests and huge barriers to the wealth creators in this country, particularly small businesses and the self-employed.These must be tackled. I tell you this, I will make Labour the party of enterprise and also the party of small business.And I want British businesses, large and small, to be able to make the most of the advantages of globalisation.New Labour was right to be enthusiastic about the opportunities that come in a more connected world: the movement of goods and services, the chance to travel, the new markets for our companies.But this new generation recognises that we did not do enough to address concerns about some of the consequences of globalisation, including migration.All of us heard it. Like the man I met in my constituency who told me he had seen his mates' wages driven down by the consequences of migration.If we don't understand why he would feel angry\u2014and it wasn't about prejudice\u2014then we are failing to serve those who we are in politics to represent.I am the son of immigrants. I believe that Britain has benefited economically, culturally, socially from those who come to this country.I don't believe either that we can turn back the clock on free movement of labour in Europe. But we should never have pretended it would not have consequences.Consequences we should have dealt with.We have to challenge the old thinking that flexible labour markets are always the answer.Employers should not be allowed to exploit migrant labour in order to undercut wages.And if we have free movement of labour across Europe we need proper labour standards in our economy, including real protection for agency workers.And, as every democratic country recognises, it is vital that wor kers have a voice that speaks for them.I remember during this campaign I met some school dinner ladies. They had to buy their own uniforms, their shift patterns were being changed at a moment's notice, frankly conference they were being exploited.So they looked to their union to help them. They weren't interested in going on strike, they loved the kids they served and wanted to serve their schools. But they wanted someone to help them get basic standards of decency and fairness.Responsible trade unions are part of a civilised society, every democratic country recognises that.But all of us in this movement bear a heavy responsibility. We want to win an argument about the danger this coalition poses to our economy and our society.To do so we must understand the lessons of history.We need to win the public to our cause and what we must avoid at all costs is alienating them and adding to the book of historic union failures.That is why I have no truck, and you should have no truck, with overblown rhetoric about waves of irresponsible strikes.The public won't support them. I won't support them. And you shouldn't support them either.But it is not just from trade unions that I want to see responsibility.This new generation demands responsibility from business too.During this campaign, I have met some extraordinary people doing amazing service for our country.I remember a care worker I met in Durham.She worked hard and with dedication, looking after our Mums, Dads and grandparents when they couldn't look after themselves anymore.She is doing one of the most important jobs in our society, and if it was my Mum or Dad, I would want anyone who cared for them to be paid a decent wage.But she was barely paid the minimum wage \u2013 and barely a few pence extra for higher skills.She told me that she thought a fair wage would be £7 an hour because after all she would get that for stacking shelves at the local supermarket.I believe in responsibility in every part of our society.That's why I believe in not just a minimum wage but the foundation of our economy in the future must be a living wage.And we need a tax system for business that rewards responsibility:To pay a living wage;To provide high quality apprenticeships;And family-friendly employment.And we need responsibility at the top of society too. The gap between rich and poor does matter. It doesn't just harm the poor it harms us all.What does it say about the values of our society, what have we become, that a banker can earn in a day what the care worker can earn in a year?I say: responsibility in this country shouldn't just be about what you can get away with.And that applies to every chief executive of every major company in this country.And, just as businesses have responsibility to ensure fair pay, so those who can work have a responsibility to do so.This is one of the hardest issues for our party because all of us know in our communities people who are in genuine need and who worry about the impact of new medical tests, or changes to rules on them.At the same time, let's be honest, we also know there are those for whom the benefits system has become a trap.That is not in their interests or the interests of us a society and we are right when we say it must be challenged.Reforming our benefits system is not about stereotyping everybody out of work, it's about transforming their lives.Real help matched with real responsibility.That is why on welfare, I will look closely at whatever the government comes forward with: not arbitrary cuts to benefits but a genuine plan to make sure that those in need are protected and that those who can work have the help they need to ensure they do so.Work is a central part of life. But it is not all that matters.We all care about making a living but we don't just care about that.Here is our generation's paradox: the biggest ever consumers of goods and services, but a generation that yearns so much for the things that business cannot provide.Strong families.Time with your children.Green spaces.Community life.Love and compassion.New Labour embraced markets in our economy and was right to do so.But lets be honest we became naïve about them.We must never again give the impression that we know the price of everything and the value of nothing.We must be on the side of communities who want to save their local post office, not be the people trying to close it.We must be on the side of people trying to protect their high street from looking like every other high street, not the people who say that's just the forces of progress.And we must be on the side of those who are dismayed by the undermining of the local pub with cut-price alcohol from supermarkets.We must shed old thinking and stand up for those who believe there is more to life than the bottom line.We stand for these things not because we are social conservatives but because we believe in community, belonging and solidarity.And I tell you this: the good life is about the things we do in our community and the time we spend with family.I feel this so deeply since the birth of my son sixteen months ago.As we rebuild our economy, we must think how we protect families up and down this country.Families can't do the best job if they are stressed out, working 60 or 70 hours a week, can't be there when the kids get home from school, doing two or three jobs.We've got to change our culture on working time not just for the good of families, but because it is through family that we learn right from wrong, develop ambitions for ourselves and show kindness and respect for others that is the foundation of our society.When I look at some of the challenges we face as a country -from gangs to teenage pregnancy - it is only a government that stands up for families that are trying their best to bring up their kids that can offer answers.So as we rebuild our economy we must think about how we protect and nourish the things that matter to families and to family life.This new generation also wants to challenge the way we think about the state and what it can achieve.I believe profoundly that government must play its part in creating the good society.But our new generation also knows that government can itself become just such a vested interest. That unless reformed, unless accountable, unless responsive, government can impede the good society.Our new generation, hungry for change, is unwilling to see that happen.Like millions of people around the country, I went to my local comprehensive. I know the value of a good school, a good teacher.And I know there are many parents frustrated, with a school that doesn't suit your child or live up to your hopes.There are amazing secondary schools in my constituency and amazing teachers and head teachers. But one of them was consistently failing its pupils.And it pained me as an MP to see those kids being consistently let down. Now that school has been taken over, the kids life chances transformed.That is what good public service reform is all about.My generation recognises too that government can itself become a vested interest when it comes to civil liberties.I believe too in a society where individual freedom and liberty matter and should never be given away lightly.The first job of government is the protection of its citizens. As Prime Minister I would never forget that.And that means working with all the legitimate means at our disposal to disrupt and destroy terrorist networks.But we must always remember that British liberties were hard fought and hard won over hundreds of years.We should always take the greatest care in protecting them.And too often we seemed casual about them.Like the idea of locking someone away for 90 days - nearly three months in prison \u2013 without charging them with a crime.Or the broad use of anti-terrorism measures for purposes for which they were not intended.They just undermined the important things we did like CCTV and DNA testing.Protecting the public involves protecting all their freedoms.I won't let the Tories or the Liberals take ownership of the British tradition of liberty.I want our party to reclaim that tradition.So too in our foreign policy the new generation must challenge old thinking.We are the generation that came of age at the end of the Cold War.The generation that was taught that the end of history had arrived and then saw 9/11 shatter that illusion.And we are the generation that recognises that we belong to a global community: we can't insulate ourselves from the world's problems.For that reason, right now this country has troops engaged in Afghanistan.They represent the very best of our country.They and their families are making enormous sacrifices on our behalf and we should today acknowledge their service and their sacrifice.Our troops are there to stabilise the country and enable a political settlement to be reached so that Afghanistan can be stable and we can be safe.I will work in a bi-partisan way with the government to both support our mission and ensure Afghanistan is not a war without end.But just as I support the mission in Afghanistan as a necessary response to terrorism, I've g ot to be honest with you about the lessons of Iraq.Iraq was an issue that divided our party and our country. Many sincerely believed that the world faced a real threat. I criticise nobody faced with making the toughest of decisions and I honour our troops who fought and died there.But I do believe that we were wrong. Wrong to take Britain to war and we need to be honest about that.Wrong because that war was not a last resort, because we did not build sufficient alliances and because we undermined the United Nations.America has drawn a line under Iraq and so must we.Our alliance with America is incredibly important to us but we must always remember that our values must shape the alliances that we form and any military action that we take.So many of the world's problems need functioning international institutions. The days in which any country could achieve their goals on their own are over.There can be no solution to the conflicts of the Middle East without international action, providing support where it is needed, and pressure where it is right to do so.And let me say this, as Israel ends the moratorium on settlement building, I will always defend the right of Israel to exist in peace and security. But Israel must accept and recognise in its actions the Palestinian right to statehood.That is why the attack on the Gaza Flotilla was so wrong.And that is why the Gaza blockade must be lifted and we must strain every sinew to work to make that happen.The government must step up and work with our partners in Europe and around the world to help bring a just and lasting peace to the Middle East.But to achieve all these things \u2013 a different economy, a different society and reform of the state we must change our politics too.Let's be honest, politics isn't working.People have lost faith in politicians and politics.And trust is gone.Politics is broken.Its practice, its reputation and its institutions.I'm in it and even I sometimes find it depressing.This generation has a chance - and a huge responsibility - to change our politics. We must seize it and meet the challenge.So we need to reform our House of Commons and I support changing our voting system and will vote Yes in the referendum on AV.Yes we need to finally elect the House of Lords after talking about it for so long \u2013 about a hundred years.Yes we need more decisions to be made locally, with local democracy free of the constraints we have placed on it in the past and free of an attitude which has looked down its nose at local government.And I want to congratulate all our local councillors and tell you: I will be shoulder to shoulder with you at next May's local elections.And the following year, we will be proud not only of the Olympics in London, but proud too to see them presided over by the next Mayor of London. Ken Livingstone.And let me also congratulate Oona on the campaign that she fought.Let's be honest, changing our institutions won't be enough to restore trust on its own.Look in the end, it's politicians who have to change.This generation must reject the old ways of doing politics. And must speak to the issues our generation knows it must confront.The focus groups will tell you that there's no votes in green issues.Maybe not.But taking the difficult steps to protect our planet for future generations is the greatest challenge our generation faces.When I think about my son, I think what he will be asking me in twenty years time is whether I was part of the last generation not to get climate change or the first generation to get it.And climate change, just like the aging society, can't be tackled by the politics we have.They don't lend them selves to the politics of now: instant results, instant votes, instant popularity. X-factor politics.So we can't be imprisoned by the focus groups.Politics has to be about leadership or it is about nothing.I also know something else. Wisdom is not the preserve of any one party. Some of the political figures in history who I admire most are Keynes, Lloyd George, Beveridge, who were not members of the Labour Party.Frankly, the political establishment too often conducts debate in a way that insults the intelligence of the public.We must change this for the good of the country.I will be a responsible Leader of the Opposition.What does that mean?When I disagree with the government, as on the deficit, I will say so loud and clear and I will take the argument to them.But when Ken Clarke says we need to look at short sentences in prison because of high re-offending rates, I'm not going to say he's soft on crime.When Theresa May says we should review stop and search laws to prevent excessive use of state power, I'm not going to say she is soft on terrorism.I tell you this conference, this new generation must find a new way of conducting politics.And that brings me to some of the names I've been called...Wallace out of Wallace and Gromit... I can see the resemblance.Forrest Gump... Not so much.And what about Red Ed?Come off it. Let's start to have a grown up debate in this country about who we are and where we want to go and what kind of country we want to leave for our kids.ConclusionA few days ago our contest came to an end and now the real contest has begun.I relish the chance to take on David Cameron.We may be of a similar age, but in my values and ideals I am of a different and new generation.The new generation is not simply defined by age, but by atti tudes and ideals.And there is a defining difference between us and David Cameron\u2026. and that is optimism.We are the heirs to an extraordinary tradition, to great leaders who were above all the optimists of history.The optimism of 1945 which built the National Health Service and the welfare state.The optimism of Harold Wilson and the white heat of technology and the great social reforms of that government.The optimism of Tony and Gordon who took on the established thinking and reshaped our country.We are the optimists in politics today.So let's be humble about our past.Let's understand the need to change.Let's inspire people with our vision of the good society.Let the message go out, a new generation has taken charge of Labour.Optimistic about our country.Optimistic about our world.Optimistic about the power of politics.We are the optimists and together we wil l change Britain.

aVThank you Conference. It\u2019s great to be in Liverpool. Labour Liverpool. A generation ago a Labour leader came to Conference to condemn the behaviour of a Labour Council in Liverpool. Today I come to Liverpool, proud to hold our Conference in this great city. Proud of the work our Labour council is doing. Conference, it\u2019s been a busy year for me. There\u2019s one person I want to thank more than any other. For her love, her support, for her encouragement. My wife Justine. Ask me the three most rewarding things I\u2019ve done this year. Being at the birth of our second son Sam. Then getting married. It is 2011 after all. And starting to tell Daniel, my older son, the stories my Dad used to tell me. My kids, Daniel and Sam. A new generation of Miliband brothers. I know what you\u2019re thinking. But just to reassure you. We\u2019re really hoping they become doctors too. And of course one other big event happened in my life, one that the media was really interested in: My nose job. July 27th. They called it Ed Nose Day. In case you wondered listening to me, it was a great success. I had a deviated septum and it needed repositioning. Typical Labour leader. He gets elected and everything moves to the centre. A year ago I was elected your leader. And I want to thank one colleague in particular for her support over that time. For her help, her advice, for her friendship, and her commitment to equality andsocial justice. Harriet Harman, our fantastic deputy leader. Conference, let\u2019s get down to business. This is a dangerous time for Britain, and for Britain\u2019s economy. The Government\u2019s austerity plan is failing. You can sense the fear that people have as we watch the economic crisis that stalked our country in 2008 threatening to return. Stock markets round the world falling. The United States in difficulty. The Eurozone struggling. And people in Britain losing their jobs. Now is not the time for the same old answers. From us, on the issues that lost us your trust. From this Government, on the growth crisis we face. You need to know that there is an alternative. You need to know that it is credible. So people need to know where I stand. The Labour Party lost trust on the economy. And under my leadership, we will regain that trust. I am determined to prove to you that the next Labour Government will only spend what it can afford. That we will live within our means. That we will manage your money properly. As someone who believes that government can make a difference, I have a special responsibility to show you that every pound that is spent, is spent wisely. The next Labour Government will still face tough decisions. We won\u2019t be able to reverse many of the cuts this Government is making. And let me tell you, if this Government fails to deal with the deficit in this Parliament, we are determined to do so. It\u2019s why we will set new fiscal rules to bind government to a disciplined approach. And it\u2019s right, as a down payment, to tell you that we would use every penny of the sale of bank shares to pay down the debt. But I have to tell you frankly. I have a fundamental disagreement with the Government. They believe Britain can address our problems of debt without addressing our problems of growth. They are wrong. Think of how you pay off the credit card bill. You need to make savings in the household budget. But if you lose your job and the money stops coming in, you can\u2019t pay off the bill. People in Britain are losing their jobs. They aren\u2019t spending. Government is cutting back. And the recovery has stalled. Of course, the world economy is suffering. But our Government is making it worse. Because the current plan to raise taxes and cut spending more dramatically than any other country is not working. A year ago, lots of people thought the Government was taking the right course. The Governor of the Bank of England. The International Monetary Fund. But one person in particular stood outside the consensus. Labour\u2019s Shadow Chancellor, Ed Balls. He was right. But he is not interested in being proved right. And nor am I. I am interested in the Government doing the right thing by the British people. So there is a big choice facing the country. Whether to stick on the current plan or to change course? There is an alternative: For Britain and other countries to act together to get our economies moving. Like a VAT cut now to put more money in people\u2019s pockets. And action to put our young people back to work. I say to David Cameron. Put the politics aside. Look at the facts. Recognise what is staring you in the face. And understand that protecting our economy matters more than protecting your failed plan. So I\u2019m going to tell it straight. That\u2019s the lesson I have learnt about this job and myself over the last twelve months. To be true to myself. My instincts. My values. To take risks in the pursuit of that. And to stand up for what is right. The moment it came home to me most was when I heard the terrible news that Milly Dowler\u2019s phone had been hacked. Someone had hacked into the voicemails of a missing teenager. Deleted them from her phone. Given her parents false hope. As Justine said to me that morning, it was sick that someone could do that. That\u2019s why I had to speak out. I knew when I said what I did that I was breaking rule number one of British politics. Don\u2019t mess with Rupert Murdoch. I did it because it was right. That\u2019s the lesson I have learned most clearly in the last year. The lesson that you\u2019ve got to be willing to break the consensus, not succumb to it. You know, I\u2019m not Tony Blair. I\u2019m not Gordon Brown either. Great men, who in their different ways, achieved great things. I\u2019m my own man. And I\u2019m going to do things my own way. That is what it means to lead. And I know this. Nobody ever changed things on the basis of consensus. Or wanting to be liked. Or not taking risks. Or keeping your head down. It\u2019s a lesson for me and it\u2019s a lesson for my party too. Don\u2019t believe this stuff about governments losing elections, rather than oppositions winning them. It sounds to me like a consolation prize for opposition leaders that have lost. I\u2019m not interested in consolation prizes. I\u2019ll tell you what I\u2019m interested in. Winning back the trust of the British people. Winning the next general election. My message to the public is this: We know waiting for the Tories to fail won\u2019t win us back your trust. And we won\u2019t deserve your trust if that\u2019s what we do. Paying homage to past leaders won\u2019t win us back your trust. And we won\u2019t deserve it if that\u2019s what we do. Asking to carry on where we left off in government won\u2019t win us back your trust. And we won\u2019t deserve it if that\u2019s what we do. My top demand of my Shadow Cabinet, my party, my team, is this: Ambition. Ambition to change our country. It\u2019s why we were founded. It\u2019s in our souls. It\u2019s the only point in doing the jobs we do. And it\u2019s the reason I stood to be the leader of this Party. And it is urgent, at this moment, in Britain 2011. In every generation, there comes a moment when we need to change the way we do things. This is one of those moments. And I believe from our conversations over the past year that you, the British people, know it. You\u2019ve seen a series of crises hitting our country over the last few years. This summer\u2019s riots. Not the first time we\u2019ve seen decent people with the right values losing out to those with the wrong ones. The banking crisis, MPs\u2019 expenses. Journalists hacking phones. From them all a something for nothing culture. Take what you can. Fill your boots. Who cares as long as you can get away it. And these are just the noisy scandals which grab the front pages. But you know there\u2019s a quiet crisis which doesn\u2019t get the headlines. It\u2019s about the people who don\u2019t make a fuss, who don\u2019t hack phones, loot shops, fiddle their expenses, or earn telephone number salaries at the banks. It\u2019s the grafters, the hard-working majority who do the right thing. It\u2019s a crisis which is happening in your town, your street and maybe even in your home. It is a crisis of the promises made over the last thirty years. The promise that if you\u2019re in work, you will do better each year. The promise that if you work hard at school the doors of opportunity will open up to you. The promise that if you teach your kids the difference between right and wrong and bring them up properly, they will get a good job, and a decent home. These crises point to something deep in our country. The failure of a system. A way of doing things. An old set of rules. An economy and a society too often rewarding not the right people with the right values, but the wrong people with the wrong values. So the task of leadership in this generation is no ordinary task. It is to chart a new course. And strike a new bargain in our country. That\u2019s what I want to talk to you about today. Let\u2019s be clear about one thing. The problem isn\u2019t the people of Britain. I saw it when I met our troops in Afghanistan. Brave men and women. Called to serve our country. At this moment, as we meet in the comfort of this hall, hundreds, thousands of our troops are risking their lives. In harm\u2019s way, so far from home. We should think of them today and every day. Let\u2019s all thank them and acknowledge the heroism they show on behalf of our country. And as always in our history, we see the true British character in moments of crisis. We saw it during the riots. It was a terrible moment for Britain. People looting shops, burning cars. It even happened right by my old school. But for every person that looted, there were hundreds, thousands who said this will not stand and came out to help with the clean up. I saw it in Manchester, people of all generations, who came out the next morning to get the city back on its feet. Those young people with the brooms. Those young people who join us at Conference today. And let us celebrate what they did. Let us celebrate too those brave police officers who worked day and night to bring order to our streets. They put themselves in harm\u2019s way and we should thank them for it. Citizens and public servants alike. Theirs are the true values of Britain. They are the true face of Britain. And when we talk about the places where the riots happened, let\u2019s remember that the vast majority of people who live there are decent, law-abiding, community-spirited. We must punish those who do wrong. But I\u2019m not with the Prime Minister. I will never write off whole parts of our country by calling them sick. We are not a country of bad people but great people. Great people in a great country. Ready to celebrate the Olympics next year. Olympic Britain 2012, ready to light up the world. But with such great people, how have we ended up with the problems we face? It\u2019s because of the way we have chosen to run our country. Not just for a year or so but for decades. Now there are hard lessons here for my party which some won\u2019t like. Some of what happened in the 1980s was right. It was right to let people buy their council houses. It was right to cut tax rates of 60, 70, 80 percent. And it was right to change the rules on the closed shop, on strikes before ballots. These changes were right, and we were wrong to oppose it at the time. But while some of it was right, too much of what happened was based on the wrong values. That\u2019s where New Labour came in. The rebuilt schools, new hospitals, more police. The minimum wage, tax credits, the new deal. Half a million children lifted out of poverty. Britain with Labour: the only country in Europe where poverty was not going up, but was going down. My party is proud of that record. And so am I. But good times did not mean we had a good economic system. We changed the fabric of our country but we did not do enough to change the values of our economy. You believe rewards should be for hard work. But you\u2019ve been told we have to tolerate the wealthiest taking what they can. And what\u2019s happened? Your living standards have been squeezed by runaway rewards at the top. You believe we owe duties to each other. But in our economy you\u2019ve been told that duties to each other come second. And so while many companies do the right thing and train their workforce, others do not. And what\u2019s happened? You\u2019ve seen your sons and daughters not getting an apprenticeship, stuck in a job where they can\u2019t progress. And we have seen immigration policy which didn\u2019t work for the people whose jobs, living standards and communities were affected. You believe in the values of the long-term. But in our economy, you\u2019ve been told the fast buck is ok. And what\u2019s happened? We\u2019ve ended up with a financial crisis and you\u2019ve ended up footing the bill. You believe in a society where everybody is responsible for their actions. But you\u2019ve been told that if companies are big enough or powerful enough they can get away with anything. And what\u2019s happened? Big vested interests like the energy companies have gone unchallenged, while you\u2019re being ripped off. So you have been told for too long that the only way our economy can succeed is if we reward not your values, but a totally different set of values. Trickle-down economics. The triumph of finance over industry. The victory of vested interests over the public interest. And who\u2019s been rewarded in this economy? Take Fred Goodwin, who ran the Royal Bank of Scotland. He was at the heart of the banking crisis. Compare him to Sir John Rose, former Chief Executive of Rolls Royce, a great British business leader. Creating wealth and keeping jobs in this country. He is the true face of British business. The vast majority of our businesses that have the right values and do the right thing. Rooted in their communities. Committed to their workforce. And creating real, lasting value. But at the time of the financial crisis, Fred Goodwin was paid over three times more than Sir John Rose. I tell you something, Fred Goodwin shouldn\u2019t have got that salary. And I tell you something else: We shouldn\u2019t have given Sir Fred Goodwin that knighthood either. You know what your values are. You believe in looking out for each other. You believe we are stronger together. Weaker on our own. But we have allowed values which say take what you can, I\u2019m in it for myself, to create a Britain that is too unequal. The people at the top taking unjustified rewards isn\u2019t just bad for our economy. It sends a message throughout our society about what values are ok. And inequality reinforces privilege and opportunity for the few. You know what your values are. You believe whether you get on shouldn\u2019t depend on where you come from but what you have it within you to become. Those are Britain\u2019s values. Reward linked to effort. Something for something. But as the rungs of the ladder grow further and further apart, the chance of climbing up, becomes harder. Think of some of the kids at school today in my constituency, in Doncaster. Or in your town. Ask yourself, what are their chances, however bright, of getting into one of the top universities, competing against people with all the chances in life? Of having the network of connections that will set them up for their career? 21st century Britain: still a country for the insiders. What\u2019s my story? My parents fled the Nazis. And came to Britain. They embraced its values. Outsiders. Who built a life for us. So this is who I am. The heritage of the outsider. The vantage point of the insider. The guy who is determined to break the closed circles of Britain. And as young people confront the choices they have in life, they see routes to success today based on a wrong set of values. The something for nothing of celebrity culture. The take what you can of the gangs. And in parts of some of our communities, a life on benefits. You know what your values are. But they are not the values being rewarded in our benefits system. We must never excuse people who cheat the welfare system. The reason I talk about this is not because I don\u2019t believe in a welfare state but because I do. We can never protect and renew it if people believe it\u2019s just not fair. If it\u2019s too easy not to work. And there are people taking something for nothing. And if at the same time people who have paid into the system all their lives find the safety net full of holes. No wonder people are angry. It\u2019s my job, my Party\u2019s mission To say: no more. It\u2019s all got to change. We need a new bargain. Based on Britain\u2019s values. Britain\u2019s values in our economy, in our society, and in the way our country is run. Let\u2019s confront head on the big challenge we face of building a new bargain in our economy. Built on values of hard work, something for something, the long-term. We need a new era of wealth creation in this country. But it will not happen with the old set of rules. And we can\u2019t spend our way to a new economy. We are competing not just with Germany and Japan, but with China, India and Brazil. Don\u2019t believe those who would tell you that the kind of economy we have now will help us to compete in that world. We can\u2019t pay our way unless as a country we invent things, make things, and sell real services and products. Britain\u2019s future will be built not on credit default swaps but on creative industries. Not low wages and high finance, but low carbon and high tech. Not financial engineering, but real engineering. Of course, the banks and financial services are important to Britain. They employ people right across the country. They will still be important to Britain in the future. But they must change so that they are part of the solution to our economic future, not part of the problem. You\u2019ve been told all growth is the same, all ways of doing business are the same. But it\u2019s not. You\u2019ve been told that the choice in politics is whether parties are pro-business or anti-business. But all parties must be pro-business today. If it ever was, that\u2019s not the real choice any more. Let me tell you what the 21st century choice is: Are you on the side of the wealth creators or the asset strippers? The producers or the predators? Producers train, invest, invent, sell. Things Britain does brilliantly. Predators are just interested in the fast buck, taking what they can out of the business. This isn\u2019t about one industry that\u2019s good and another that isn\u2019t. Or one firm always destined to be a predator and another to be a producer. It\u2019s about different ways of doing business, ways that the rules of our economy can favour or discourage. Look at what a private equity firm did to the Southern Cross care homes. Stripping assets for a quick buck and treating tens of thousands of elderly people like commodities to be bought and sold. They may not have sold their own grandmothers for a fast buck. But they certainly sold yours. They aren\u2019t the values of British business. It must change. It must never happen again in the new economy we build. We must learn the lesson that growth is built on sand if it comes from our predators and not our producers. For years as a country we have been neutral in that battle. They\u2019ve been taxed the same. Regulated the same. Treated the same. Celebrated the same. They won\u2019t be by me. We need the most competitive tax and regulatory environment we can for British business. But when I am Prime Minister, how we tax, what government buys, how we regulate, what we celebrate will be in the service of Britain\u2019s producers. And don\u2019t let anyone tell you that this is the anti-business choice. It\u2019s the pro-business choice. Pro-business on the side of the small businesses who can\u2019t get a loan. Pro-business on the side of high value manufacturing that can\u2019t build its business because of the short-termist culture. Pro-business on the side of the British company losing out to its competitors abroad when their government steps in and our government stands aside. And that includes companies like Bombardier and BAe systems. Being sold down the river by this Government. Just like Sheffield Forgemasters before them. Having Nick Clegg as the local MP didn\u2019t help much. You know, the boundary review means his seat will be represented by a Tory after the next election. No change there then. Supporting the producers, that is what it means to be pro-business today. That is why I say all major government contracts will go to firms who commit to training the next generation with decent apprenticeships. And none will go to those who don\u2019t. And it is also why I say, the new bargain in our economy must be built on co-operation not conflict in the workplace. Raising productivity, working together, helping firms to compete. That is the most important future for the trade unions in this country. And we must challenge irresponsible, predatory practices wherever we find them. We need investment in energy here in Britain. But our energy companies have defied the laws of gravity for too long. Prices go up but they never seem to come down. I believe our environment and climate change is a crucial issue for our future. An essential part of the new bargain. Responsibility, commitment for the long term: That\u2019s what my kids will want from us on the environment when they grow up and ask whether we were the first generation to get it or the last generation not to. So over time there is going to be upward pressure on energy prices. But that makes it all the more important we get the best possible deal for customers. So let\u2019s break the dominance of the big energy companies. Let\u2019s call a rigged market what it is. And get a fairer deal for the people of Britain. But as we challenge the predators let\u2019s celebrate Britain\u2019s producers. Wherever we find them. If people make money and profit through hard work, hard graft, something for something, let\u2019s praise them. And let me tell you what the problem is with these Tories. They don\u2019t understand who the real wealth creators of this country are. Or the values our economy needs for them to succeed. They talk as if the CEOs and the executives are the only people who create wealth. Of course great business leaders make a huge difference to our country, and I applaud them. But the small businesses that are the lifeblood of our economy are also the wealth creators. The scientists and innovators are also our wealth creators. And the young apprentices are also the wealth creators. The wealth of our nation is built by the hands not just of the elite few but every man and woman who goes out and does a day\u2019s work. The Tories aren\u2019t building a new bargain that supports the right people with the right values. Young people, doing the right thing, wanting to go to higher education are going to find that their hard work and ambition will be punished with tens of thousands of pounds of debt. And yet at the same time, George Osborne plans cuts in corporation tax for the banks. It\u2019s the wrong choice. Now some of you would like no fees at all. I understand that. But it wouldn\u2019t be responsible to make promises I can\u2019t keep. That\u2019s Nick Clegg\u2019s job. Let me tell you what I would do. If we were in government now, we\u2019d be cutting the costs of going to university from a maximum of £9,000 to £6,000. To the young people who want to get on and contribute to our country my message is simple. I won\u2019t let you be priced out of your future. Labour is on your side. We can\u2019t afford to carry on with so many young people locked out of opportunity. Three thousand of our brightest young people, at state schools, get the grades to go to our most competitive universities. But they never go. That can\u2019t be right. It creates a sense that there is no something for something deal. I went to a fantastic local school. It was a tough area but it was a school that changed lives. But the truth is that the problem in some of our schools is not just investment. It\u2019s also about values. Of bright children held back when aspirations are low. Or when closed circles at the top of society shut them out. In any one year more than a quarter of our schools don\u2019t even send five kids to the most competitive universities. Is anyone seriously telling me that there aren\u2019t pupils at any of those schools who are good enough to go? It\u2019s got to change. And we will change it. Here is my challenge to those schools and universities. Raise your game. To the schools not doing enough I say: Lift your ambition, lift your sights. To the universities not opening up I say: Open your eyes, open your doors. Say to the very brightest children at every school: if you get the grades, you\u2019ll get a place. And it\u2019s not just in our schools that I want to change the values that get rewarded. It\u2019s right across society. The new bargain must demand responsibility from all. We\u2019ve got to put an end to the idea that those at the top can take whatever they can, regardless of what they give back. It\u2019s why we must end the cosy cartels of the way top pay is set in our economy. So every pay committee should have an employee on the board. And the something for something deal requires that sacrifice as well as prosperity is fairly shared. Have you noticed how uncomfortable David Cameron is when he has to talk about responsibility at the very top? He found it easy to be tough on you. VAT went up. He called it a tough decision. Tax credits were cut. He said they couldn\u2019t be afforded. Help paying for childcare was hit. He said it was the only thing he could do. When you have had to pay, it\u2019s always necessary, it\u2019s always permanent, it can never be reversed. And yet at the same time they are straining at the leash to cut the 50p tax rate for people earning over £3,000 a week. Only David Cameron could believe that you make ordinary families work harder by making them poorer and you make the rich work harder by making them richer. It\u2019s wrong. It\u2019s the wrong priority. It\u2019s based on the wrong values. How dare they say we\u2019re all in it together. So we need a new bargain at the top of society, and in our benefits system too. So it rewards the right people with the right values. But it isn\u2019t delivering that. And we\u2019ve got to fix it. If you think putting it right means just stripping away welfare then you are better off with Iain Duncan Smith and David Cameron. But at the same time we have to face the truth. Even after reforms of recent years, we still have a system where reward for work is not high enough. Where benefits are too easy to come by for those who don\u2019t deserve them and too low for those who do. So if what you want is a welfare system that works for working people then I\u2019m prepared to take the tough decisions to make that a reality. Take social housing. When we have a housing shortage, choices have to be made. Do we treat the person who contributes to their community the same as the person who doesn\u2019t? My answer is no. Our first duty should be to help the person who shows responsibility. And I say every council should recognise the contribution that people are making. David Cameron likes to talk tough on welfare, but do you know who the big losers are from his changes? Time and again it\u2019s those who work hard, who try to get on. It\u2019s the cancer patients who have worked all their lives but now lose their support. It\u2019s the couple who have put money aside and saved, but now lose their tax credits. And it is the single mum working as a dinner lady who loses help with her childcare. It\u2019s wrong. And we have got to change it. And while those who do the right thing are hit hard, the demands on those who don\u2019t work aren\u2019t tough enough. Gone is the something for something requirement that every young person out of work for six months will be required to work. This Government won\u2019t make the commitment to help our young people back to work. It\u2019s wrong and we would change it. Decency, fairness, helping those who do the right thing. I believe in a benefits system with values. And I believe in the value of work. Labour. Think about that word. The party of work. Now under my leadership, we will be the party which makes welfare work too. And it\u2019s not just in our benefits system that I want to change the way government works. It\u2019s in our public services as well. Millions of public servants deliver a fantastic service every day of every week. But we all know that sometimes powerful organisations can become unaccountable. Work not in the interests of those who need them but in their own interests. That's what vested interests are. My task, our responsibility, is to make government work better for people. The patient frustrated when they can\u2019t be seen by the person they want. The victim of crime who just wants their case properly investigated. You know what it\u2019s like. You stand in the queue. You hang on the phone. You fill in the form. And then all you get? Computer says no. We need to change that. To give power to the public. Like the power to the elderly couple to choose whether they are cared for in a care home or in their own home. Or the parents I know struggling with their council on their child\u2019s special needs who want to know who else is facing the same challenges. So I will take on the vested interests wherever they are because that is how we defend the public interest. And there is no greater public interest than our National Health Service. Cherished by all of us. Founded by Labour. Saved by Labour. Today defended by Labour once again. Why does Britain care so much for the NHS? Because, more than any other institution in our country, the values of the NHS are our values. It doesn\u2019t matter who you are. Or what you earn. The NHS offers the highest quality care when we need it. I saw it this year with the birth of our son, Sam. Like millions of other families, mine had the best of care from doctors, nurses. And nobody asked me for my credit card at the door. And when I look at everything this Tory Government is doing, it is the NHS that shocks me most. Why? Because David Cameron told us he was different. You remember. The posters. The soundbites. David Cameron knew the British people did not trust the Tories with our NHS. So he told us he wasn\u2019t the usual type of Tory. And he asked for your trust. And then he got into Downing Street. And within a year \u2013 within a year \u2013 he\u2019d gone back on every word he\u2019d said. No more top-down reorganisations? He betrayed your trust. No more hospital closures? He betrayed your trust. No more long waits? He betrayed your trust. And the biggest betrayal of all? The values of the NHS. Britain\u2019s values. The values he promised to protect. Betrayed. Hospitals to be fined millions of pounds if they break the rules of David Cameron\u2019s free-market healthcare system. The old values that have failed our economy now being imported to our most prized institution: the NHS. Let me tell David Cameron this. It\u2019s the oldest truth in politics. He knows it and now the public know it. You can\u2019t trust the Tories with the NHS. And let me tell the British people: If you want someone who will rip up the old rules so that the country works for you, don\u2019t expect it from this Prime Minister. On the 50p tax rate, on the banks, on the closed circles of Britain, on welfare, on the NHS, he\u2019s not about a new set of rules. He\u2019s the last gasp of the old rules. The wrong values for our country and the wrong values for our time. You know Britain needs to change. Every day of your life seems like a tough fight. To make ends meet. To do the best by your kids. To look after your Mum or Dad. And it will be a tough fight to change Britain. But I\u2019m up for the fight. The fight for a new bargain. A new bargain in our economy so reward is linked to effort. A new bargain based on your values so we can pay our way in the world. A new bargain to ensure responsibility from top to bottom. And a new bargain to break open the closed circles, and break up vested interests, that hold our country back. I aspire to be your Prime Minister not for more of the same. But to write a new chapter in our country\u2019s history. The promise of Britain lies in its people. The tragedy of Britain is that it is not being met. My mission. Our mission. To fulfil the promise of each so we fulfil the promise of Britain.

aVIt is great to be in Labour Manchester. And you know Manchester has special memories for me because two years ago I was elected the leader of this party. I\u2019m older. I feel a lot older actually. I hope I\u2019m a bit wiser. But I am prouder than ever to be the Leader of the Labour Party. You may have noticed that doing this job you get called some names, some of the nice, some of them not so nice. Let me tell you my favourite; it was when Mitt Romney came to Britain and called me \u2018Mr Leader.\u2019 I don\u2019t know about you but I think it has a certain ring to it myself, it\u2019s sort of half-way to North Korea. Mitt, thanks a lot for that. Let me tell you a bit of insight in to Conference. I always look forward to Conference. But the Leader\u2019s Speech, as previous leaders will attest, can be a bit of a trial. You get all kinds of advice from people. Say this, don\u2019t say that. Smile here, don\u2019t smile there. Stand there, don\u2019t stand there. Thanks Tony, Gordon and Neil for that. But sometimes you get a bit fed up with it as the Leader. And so the other day, and this is an absolutely true story, I decided that to get away from it all, the speechwriting, all of that, I\u2019d go for a walk with my three year old son, Daniel. It was an absolutely gorgeous late summer day. So we went out, I wanted to go to the park. Here\u2019s the first thing he said to me: \u201cDaddy, I can help you with your speech.\u201d I was like not you as well! He is a Miliband after all. And he said to me: \u201cDaddy, you can\u2019t do it on your own.\u201d This is absolutely true, and I said \u201cwell that\u2019s a good Labour insight, you can\u2019t do it all your own. Daniel what do you want in my speech?\u201d He said \u201cI want dinosaurs! I want dinosaurs, I want flying dinosaurs! I want dinosaurs that eat people daddy!\u201d I said, \u201cNo Daniel. We tried predators last year.\u201d OK, look only one problem, where\u2019s my speech? I want to do something different today. I want to tell you my story. I want to tell you who I am. What I believe. And why I have a deep conviction that together we can change this country. My conviction is rooted in my family\u2019s story, a story that starts 1,000 miles from here, because the Miliband\u2019s haven\u2019t sat under the same oak tree for the last five hundred years. Both of my parents\u2019 came to Britain as immigrants, Jewish refugees from the Nazis. I know I would not be standing on this stage today without the compassion and tolerance of our great country. Great Britain. And you know my parents saw Britain rebuilt after the Second World War. I was born in my local NHS hospital, the same hospital my two sons would later be born in. As you saw in the film I went to my local school. I went to my local comprehensive with people from all backgrounds. I still remember the amazing and inspiring teaching I got at that school, and one of my teachers, my English teacher, Chris Dunne, is here with us today. Thank you Chris and to all the teachers at Haverstock. It was a really tough school, but order was kept by one of the scariest headmistress you could possibly imagine, Mrs Jenkins. And you know what? I learned at my school about a lot more than how to pass exams. I learned how to get on with people from all backgrounds, whoever they were. I wouldn\u2019t be standing on this stage today without my comprehensive school education. So, Britain gave me, gave my family, a great gift that my parents never had. A safe and secure childhood. And you know my parents didn\u2019t talk much about their early lives, it was too painful, it hurt too much. The pain of those they lost. The guilt of survivors. But I believe that their experience meant they brought up both David and myself differently as a result. Because having struggled for life itself, they instilled in us a sense of duty to ease the struggles of others. And this came not just from my parents\u2019 wartime experience it came from the daily fabric of our childhood. You know there were toys and games, rows about homework. I was actually a Dallas fan, believe it or not, which didn\u2019t go down well with my dad as you can imagine. So of course there were the normal things, but every upbringing is special, and mine was special because of the place of politics within it. When I was twelve years old, I met a South African friend of my parents, her name was Ruth First. The image I remember is of somebody vivacious, full of life, full of laughter. And then I remember a few months later coming down to breakfast and seeing my mum in tears because Ruth First had been murdered by a letter bomb from the South African secret police. Murdered for being part of the anti-apartheid movement. Now I didn\u2019t understand the ins and outs of it, but I was shocked. I was angry I knew that wasn\u2019t the way the world was meant to be. I knew I had a duty to do something about it. It is this upbringing that has made me who I am. A person of faith, not a religious faith but a faith nonetheless. A faith, I believe, many religious people would recognise. So here is my faith. I believe we have a duty to leave the world a better pl ace than we found it. I believe we cannot shrug our shoulders at injustice, and just say that\u2019s the way the world is. And I believe that we can overcome any odds if we come together as people. That\u2019s how my Mum survived the war. The kindness of strangers. Nuns in a convent who took her in and sheltered her from the Nazis, took in a Jewish girl at risk to themselves. It\u2019s what my dad found when he came to these shores and joined the Royal Navy and was part of Britain winning the war. Now of course my parents didn\u2019t tell me what career to go into. My late father, as some of you know, wouldn\u2019t agree with many of the things I stand for. He would\u2019ve loved the idea of \u201cRed Ed.\u201d But he would have been a little bit disappointed that it isn\u2019t true. My mum probably doesn\u2019t agree with me either, but like most mums is too kind to say so. And look when I was younger I wasn\u2019t certain I wanted to be a politician. But I do believe the best way me for to give back to Britain, the best way to be true to my faith, is through politics. Now that is not a fashionable view today. Because millions of people have given up on politics, they think we\u2019re all the same. Well I guess you could say I am out to prove them wrong. That is who I am. That is what I believe. That is my faith. And I know who I need to serve in Britain with my faith. It\u2019s the people I\u2019ve met on my journey as Leader of the Opposition. The people who come up to me on trains, in the street, in shops who ask me about what the Labour Party is going to do for them and tell me the stories of their lives. It\u2019s for them, the people I have met on my journey as Leader of the Opposition that today\u2019s speech is for. You know I think of the young woman I met at a youth centre in London earlier this year. She was brimming with hopes and ambitions for the future. She was full of life. She was full of desire to get on and do the best for herself. And then she told me her story. She\u2019d sent off her CV to 137 employers and she\u2019d not had a reply from any of them. Many of you in this audience will know people in the same position. Just think how that crushes the hopes of a generation. I want to talk to her, to a whole generation of young people who feel that Britain under this Government is no t offering them a future. I think back to the small businessman I met in July. A proud man called Alan Henderson, a small businessman. Let me tell you Alan Henderson\u2019s story: He\u2019d spent 40 years building up his sign making business, 40 years. He told me his story, he went to see his bank manager in 1972 at his local high street bank, he got a loan and he started his business. But something terrible happened to Alan Henderson and his family a few years back. He was ripped off by the bank he had been with all that time and Alan Henderson and his family have been living through a nightmare ever since. I want to talk to him, and all the people of Britain who feel they\u2019re at the mercy of forces beyond their control. I want to talk to all of the people of this country who always thought of themselves as comfortably off, but who now find themselves struggling to make ends meet. They ask: Why is it that when oil prices go up, the petrol price goes up. But when the oil price comes down, the petrol price just stays the same? They ask: Why is it that the gas and electricity bills just go up and up and up? And they ask: Why is it that the privatised train companies can make hundreds of millions of pounds in profit at the same time as train fares are going up by 10% a year? They think the system just doesn\u2019t work for them. And you know what? They\u2019re right. It doesn\u2019t. It doesn\u2019t work for them but for the cosy cartels and powerful interests that government hasn\u2019t cut down to size. I want to talk to them and all the millions of people across our country who don\u2019t think they get a fair crack of the whip. And I want to say to them, yes our problems are deep. But they can be overcome. Deep problems about who Britain is run for and who prospers within it. One rule for those at the top, another rule for everybody else. Two nations, not one. I want to say to them today it\u2019s not the Britain you believe in. It\u2019s not the Britain I believe in. It\u2019s not the Britain this party will ever be satisfied with. So friends we\u2019re going to change it. And here\u2019s how. My faith that we can, starts with the inner strength of us as a country. You see the problem isn\u2019t the British people, just think about the Olympics and Paralympic games. It was a triumph for Britain. And why did we succeed? We succeeded because of our outstanding athletes from, Zara Phillips the grand-daughter of a parachuting Queen, to a boy born in Somalia, called Mo Farah. Mo Farah. A true Brit. And a true hero for our country. We succeeded because of the outstanding volunteers, the Games Makers who are here with us today, all 70,000 Games makers. They put a mirror up to Britain and showed us the best of ourselves. We succeeded because of our outstanding troops, our outstanding troops, many of whom were drafted in at the last minute. And let us today pay tribute to their bravery, their courage, their sacrifice in Afghanistan and all round the world. And let\u2019s say to them, and let\u2019s say to them, just as you do our duty by us in the most courageous way possible so we will always do our duty by you, both in military and in civilian life. We succeeded because of our outstanding police and let us in this city of Manchester show our appreciation for what the extraordinary police men and women of our country do for our country. And we succeeded and this is a real lesson, we succeeded because of a group of individuals, a group of individuals who saw the odds against London\u2019s bid and thought, never mind the odds, we are going to fight for the bid for London, we are going to win the bid for London, from Seb Coe to our very own Dame Tessa Jowell. And you know what friends, we succeeded, because of one reason more than any other, we succeeded because of us. We succeeded because of us, us the British people, us the British people who welcomed the athletes from abroad, who cheered them on. Who found ourselves talking to each other each morning about what had happened at the Olympics the night before, in a way that we hadn\u2019t talked to each other before. We succeeded because we came together as a country we worked together as a country. We joined together as a country. That\u2019s why we achieved more than we imagined possible. You know, I\u2019ll just tell you this. I can\u2019t remember a time like it in the whole history of my lifetime. I can\u2019t remember a time like it, that sense of a country united, that sense of a country that felt it was together. That is the spirit this Labour Party believes in. But I may not remember that spirit, but that spirit has echoed through British history. You know one hundred and forty years ago, one hundred and forty years ago to the year. Another Leader of the Opposition gave a speech. It was in the Free Trade Hall that used to stand opposite this building. It\u2019s the Radisson now by the way. His name was Benjamin Disraeli. He was a Tory. But don\u2019t let that but you off, just for a minute. His speech took over three hours to deliver, don\u2019t\u2019 worry, don\u2019t worry, and he drank two whole bottles of brandy while delivering it. That is absolutely true. Now look, I just want to say, I know a speech that long would probably kill you. And the brandy would definitely kill me. But let us remember what Disraeli was celebrated for. It was a vision of Britain. A vision of a Britain where patriotism, loyalty, dedication to the common cause courses through the veins of all and nobody feels left out. It was a vision of Britain coming together to overcome the challenges we faced. Disraeli called it \u201cOne Nation\u201d. \u201cOne Nation\u201d. We heard the phrase again as the country came together to defeat fascism. And we heard it again as Clement Attlee\u2019s Labour government rebuilt Britain after the war. Friends, I didn\u2019t become leader of the Labour Party to reinvent the world of Disraeli or Attlee. But I do believe in that spirit. That spirit of One Nation. One Nation: a country where everyone has a stake. One Nation: a country where prosperity is fairly shared. One Nation: where we have a shared destiny, a sense of shared endeavour and a common life that we lead together. That is my vision of One Nation. That is my vision of Britain. That is the Britain we must become. And here is the genius of One Nation. It doesn\u2019t just tell us the country we can be. It tells us how we must rebuild. We won the war because we were One Nation. We built the peace because Labour government\u2019s and Conservative, governments understood we needed to be One Nation. Every time Britain has faced its gravest challenge, we have only come through the storm because we were One Nation. But too often governments have forgotten that lesson. With one million young people out of work, we just can\u2019t succeed as a country. With the gap between rich and poor growing wider and wider, we just can\u2019t succeed as a country. With millions of people feeling that hard work and effort are not rewarded, we just can\u2019t succeed as a country. And with so many people having been told for so long that the only way to get on is to be on your own, in it for yourself, we just can\u2019t succeed as a country. Yes friends, to come through the storm, to overcome the challenges we face, we must rediscover that spirit. That spirit the British people never forgot. That spirit of One Nation. One Nation. A country where everyone plays their part. A country we rebuild together. So here is the big question of today. Who can make us One Nation? Who can bring Britain together? What about the Tories? What about the Tories? I didn\u2019t hear you, what about the Tories? Let me explain why, let me explain why. I want to talk very directly to those who voted for David Cameron at the last general election. I understand why you voted for him. I understand why you turned away from the last Labour government. This Government took power in difficult economic times. It was a country still coming to terms with the financial crisis. A financial crisis that has afflicted every country round the world. I understand why you were willing to give David Cameron the benefit of the doubt. But I think we\u2019ve had long enough to make a judgement. Long enough to make a judgement because they turned a recovery into the longest double dip recession since the war. Because there are more people looking for work for longer than at any time since the last time there was a Conservative government. And here is the other thing, what about borrowing? Borrowing. The thing they said was their number one priority. This year borrowing is rising not falling. Let me just say that again. Borrowing the thing they said was the most important priority, the reason they were elected. It is rising not falling. Not because there hasn\u2019t been pain and tax rises and cuts affecting every family in this country. Not because they didn\u2019t want to cut it borrowing. They did. Not because your services aren\u2019t getting worse. They are. But because if you stop an economy growing, then it leaves more people out of work claiming benefits, not paying taxes. Businesses struggle so they\u2019re not paying taxes. And as a result borrowing goes up. Borrowing not to invest in schools, in hospitals, transport and education. But borrowing to keep people idle. So the next time you hear a Conservative say to you Labour would increase borrowing, just remember it is this government that is increasing borrowing this year. So what have we seen? We\u2019ve seen recession, higher unemployment, higher borrowing. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what people were promised. Now look there will be some people who say, and this is an important argument, they\u2019ll be some people who say: \u2018Well there is short-term pain but it is worth it for the long-term gain.\u2019 But I\u2019m afraid the opposite is true. You see that the longer you have low growth in our country the bigger the debt hole becomes for the future and the bigger our problems will be in the future. The longer a young person is out of work that is not just bad for their prospects now; it is bad for their prospects for the whole of the rest of their lives. And if a small business goes under during the recession, it can\u2019t just get back up and running again during the recovery. So when David Cameron says to you: \u2018Well let\u2019s just carry on as we are and wait for something to turn up.\u2019 Don\u2019t believe him. Don\u2019t believe him. If the medicine\u2019s not working you change the medicine. And friends, I\u2019ll tell you what else you change. You change the doctor too. And that is what this country needs to do. Now look around you, you know the problem is the British people are paying the price of this government\u2019s failure. You\u2019re going to the petrol station and not filling up your tank because you can\u2019t afford it. Your tax credits are being cut because the Government says it can\u2019t afford it. Your frail mum and dad are not getting the care they need because the Government says it can\u2019t afford it. But there are some things this Government can afford. The wrong things. What do they think at this most difficult economic time is going to get us out of our difficulties? What do they choose as their priority? A tax cut for millionaires. A tax cut for millionaires. Next April, David Cameron will be writing a cheque for £40,000 to each and every millionaire in Britain. Not just for one year. But each and every year. That is more than the average person earns in a whole year. At the same time as they\u2019re imposing a tax on pensioners next April. Friends, we, the Labour Party, the country knows it is wrong. It is wrong what they\u2019re doing. It shows their priorities. And here\u2019s the worse part. David Cameron isn\u2019t just writing the cheques. He is receiving one. He\u2019s going to be getting the millionaire\u2019s tax cut. So next week maybe Mr Cameron can tell us how much is he awarding himself in a tax cut? How much is that tax cut he is awarding himself? For a job I guess he thinks is a job well done. How many of his other Cabinet colleagues have cheques in the post from the millionaire\u2019s tax cut? And how can he justify this unfairness in Britain 2012. And of course let\u2019s not forget this tax cut wouldn\u2019t be happening without Nick Clegg and the Liberal Democrats. Isn\u2019t it shameful that the party that supported, that implemented the People\u2019s Budget of 1909, Lloyd George\u2019s budget, is supporting the millionaire\u2019s budget of 2012. So that\u2019s the reality in Britain today. It is a rebate for the top. It\u2019s rip-off for everybody else. It\u2019s a recovery for the top. It\u2019s a recession for everybody else. This Prime Minister said: \u2018We are all in it together.\u2019 Don\u2019t let him ever tell us again we are all in this together. And friends I say this. You can\u2019t be a One Nation Prime Minister if you raise taxes on ordinary families and cut taxes for millionaires. You can\u2019t be a One Nation Prime Minister if all you do is seek to divide the country. Divide the country between north and south. Public and private. Those who can work and those who can\u2019t work. And you can\u2019t be a One Nation Prime Minister if your Chief Whip insults the great police officers of our country by calling them plebs. But there is one thing that this Government might have claimed to be good at, and that is competence. Because after all, they think they\u2019re born to rule. So maybe they\u2019d be good at it. Have you ever seen a more incompetent, hopeless, out of touch, u-turning, pledge-breaking, make it up as you go along, back of the envelope, miserable shower than this Prime Minister and this Government? There\u2019s more there\u2019s more, not quite Disraeli but there is more. What have we had. We\u2019ve had the caravan tax, we\u2019ve had the churches tax, we\u2019ve had the pasty tax, we\u2019ve had the granny tax, we\u2019ve had panic at the pumps, we\u2019ve had dinners for donors, we\u2019ve had country supers with Rebekah Brooks. He even rode the horse. He sent the texts, he sent the texts. Remember LOL. And now what do we have. We have the Minister for Murdoch becoming the Minister for the National Health Service. We have an International Development Secretary; she says she doesn\u2019t believe in international development. And get this, we\u2019ve got a Party Chairman who writes books about how to beat the recession, under a false name. Really, I\u2019m not making this up; I\u2019m really not making this up. I mean I have to say if I was Chairman of the Conservative Party, I\u2019d have a false name too. But here is my favourite one of all. There\u2019s one more, here\u2019s my favourite one of all. There is even a bloke, and I think they call him Lord Hill who went to see the Prime Minister. He made an appointment during the last reshuffle in order to resign. But David Cameron was too incompetent to notice that he wanted to resign. So Lord Hill is still in the Government. This lot are so useless they can\u2019t even resign properly. So they\u2019re not going to build One Nation, so it is up to us. And let me say to you, One Nation is not a way of avoiding the difficult decisions, it is a way of making the difficult decisions. And I\u2019ve just got to be very clear about this and about what we face as the next Labour government. You see I think it is incredibly important that to be One Nation we must show compassion and support for all those who cannot work. Particularly the disabled men and women of our country. But in order to do so, those who can work have a responsibility to do so. We can\u2019t leave people languishing out of work, for one year, two years, three years. We\u2019ve got a responsibility to help them and they\u2019ve got a responsibility to take the work that is on offer. To be One Nation, we have got to give much greater dignity to our elderly population because you know, we\u2019re going to have to tackle the care crisis that faces so many families up and down this country. And look, living longer should be one of the great virtues of the 21st century. But friends, in order to be able to afford to do that, we are going to have to work longer; have a later retirement age than we do now. To be One Nation, we have got to live within our means. And because borrowing is getting worse not better, it means there will be many cuts that this Government made that we won\u2019t be able to reverse even though we would like to. And that\u2019s why we\u2019ve said in this Parliament that we\u2019d put jobs before pay in the public sector. And in the next Parliament we will have tough settlements for the public services and that will make life harder for those who use them and harder for those who work in them. But here is the big difference between a One Nation government led by me, and this Government. Those with the broadest shoulders will always bear the greatest burden. I would never cut taxes for millionaires and raise them on ordinary families. That is wrong, that is not being One Nation. And here is the other thing, I will never accept an economy where the gap between rich and poor just grows wider and wider. In One Nation, in my faith, inequality matters. It matters to our country. Now what does it mean to the Labour Party to be One Nation? It means we can\u2019t go back to Old Labour. We must be the party of the private sector just as much as the party of the public sector. As much the party of the small business struggling against the odds, as the home help struggling against the cuts. We must be the party of south just as much as the party of the north. And we must be the party as much of the squeezed middle as those in poverty. There is no future for this party as the party of one sectional interest of our country. But so too it is right to move on from New Labour because New Labour, despite its great achievements, was too silent about the responsibilities of those at the top, and too timid about the accountability of those with power. In One Nation responsibility goes all the way to the top of society. The richest in society have the biggest responsibility to show responsibility to the rest of our country. And I\u2019ve got news for the powerful interests in our country, in One Nation no interest, from Rupert Murdoch to the banks, is too powerful to be held to account. So we must be a One Nation party to become a One Nation government, to build a One Nation Britain. And here\u2019s how we are going to take these steps to do that. We need a One Nation economy and the first big mission of the next Labour government is to sort out our banks. Sort them out once and for all. Not just to prevent another crisis but to do what hasn\u2019t been done in decades. Necessary to enable us to pay our way in the world. We need banks that serve the country not a country that serves its banks. Think about Alan Henderson, the small businessman I talked about earlier on. He wanted to be able to go into his bank, look his high street manager in the eye and know that he was working for him. Instead he found a bank more interested in playing the international money markets. That\u2019s why he was ripped off. Of course, this government promised change, but things aren\u2019t really changing. So I have got a message for the banks, we can do this the easy way or the hard way. Either you fix it yourselves between now and the election or the next Labour government will once and for all ensure that the high street bank is no longer the arm of a casino operation and we will break you up by law. Now look friends, there will be some people who say this is all too radical, let\u2019s just carry in as we are. I say we can\u2019t carry on as we are. We can\u2019t carry on as we are, two nations not one. The banks and the rest of Britain. We must have a One Nation banking system as part of a One Nation economy. Next, we need an education system that works for all young people. You see, to be a One Nation economy you have got to use all the talents of all of our young people. It\u2019s not just that it\u2019s socially right, it is absolutely essential for our economy for the future. I remember when Chris and I were at Haverstock. I remember at Haverstock school, my comprehensive, the kids who were good at passing exams, who were academic, they could go to university and the world would just open up for them like it did for me. But think about all those kids who had talent and ability, great talent and ability. School just didn\u2019t offer them enough. It was true twenty five years ago, and it is even more true today. Just think in your minds eye about the 14 year old today. Today is a school day. Think about that 14 year old, not academic, already bored at school, maybe already starting that process of truanting, of not going to school. Now of course they need to get back to school and their parents need to get them back to school. They can\u2019t afford to drift through life with no qualifications and Britain can\u2019t afford for them to do it either. But we can\u2019t just say to that 14 year old just put in the work, because we have been failing them too. You see for a long time our party has been focused on getting 50% of young people into university. I believe that was right. But now it\u2019s time to put our focus on the forgotten 50% who do not go to university. Here\u2019s the choice that I want to offer to that 14 year old who is not academic. English and maths to 18 because rigour in the curriculum matters. But courses that engage them and are relevant to them. Work experience with employers. And then culminating at the age of 18 with a new gold standard qualification so they know when they are taking that exam they have a gold standard vocational qualification, a new Technical Baccalaureate. A qualification to be proud of. You know, we\u2019ve got to change the culture of this country friends. We can\u2019t be a country where vocational qualifications are seen as second class. They are a real route to apprenticeships and jobs. They can be as valuable to our young people as a university degree. We need to make it so. So we\u2019ve got to change the culture in this country and there needs to be that real route to apprenticeships but let me tell you though, there is another problem. Only one in three large employers in Britain actually offers apprenticeships. And if anything, in the public sector the situation is far far worse. That is about a culture of a country. That\u2019s about a culture of a country which hasn\u2019t been dealt with for decades. It is the task of the next Labour government to do that. So the public sector is going to have to step up to the plate and understand we can\u2019t be two nations. We can\u2019t be two nations. And when the public sector offers contracts to the private sector the next Labour government will ensure that every private sector contract will only be awarded to a large company that trains the next generation with apprenticeships. Because when the public sector is having a contract with a private sector company, it is not just buying goods and services, it must be about building One Nation together. Public and private sectors joining together to do it. And we need a new deal with British business. You get the money, you get control of the money for training, as you have long asked for, you set the standards, as you have long asked for. But you have a responsibility to make sure the training happens. In One Nation there is no place for free riding. Free riding where firms that don\u2019t train poach workers from firms that do. Now think about this vision of education. Education to the age of 18 with proper vocational qualifications, and then think about the vision on offer from the Conservatives. Michael Gove. Michael Gove, who wanted to bring back two-tier academic exams. I remember what that was like. O-levels and CSEs one whole group of young people written off. We are not going back to those days. Michael Gove who has contempt for vocational qualifications and has abolished some of the best vocational qualifications our country has. And Michael Gove who has nothing to say about education to 18. So in education there really is a choice of two futures. Education for a narrower and narrower elite, with the Conservatives. Or a One Nation skills system as part of a One Nation economy with the next Labour government. To be a One Nation economy we have to make life just that bit easier for the producers, and that bit harder for the predators. \u201cPredators and producers\u201d, I think one year on people know what I was talking about. You see businesses tell me that the pressure for the fast buck from City investors means they just can\u2019t take the long view. They want to plan one year, two years, ten years ahead but they have to publish their accounts in Britain every 3 months. In line with the wishes of the best of British business, we will end that rule so companies in Britain can take the long term productive view for our country. Companies in Britain are far more easily bought and sold than in many other countries. Do you know that when a takeover is launched the hedge funds and the speculators can swoop in for a quick profit. They are not acting in the interests of firms or the nation. They are just in it for the fast buck. It is wrong and we will change it. And here is the thing, ladies and gentlemen, I invite British businesses \u2013 work with us in advance of the next Labour government. Let\u2019s refound the rules of the game so we have a One Nation business model as part of a One Nation economy for our country. So friends, in banks, in education in the rules of the game for companies \u2013One Nation gives us an urgent call of change. But One Nation is not just about the things we need to change, it is about the things we need to conserve as well. Saying that doesn\u2019t make me a Conservative. Our common way of life matters. My vision of One Nation is an outward looking country. A country which engages with Europe and the rest of the world. I am incredibly proud to be the son of immigrant parents. I am incredibly proud of the multi-ethnic diverse Britain which won us the Olympic bid. The Olympics saw that kind of country here in Britain. But to make that Britain work. To make that vision work for our country, immigration must work for all and not just some. And friends, too often in the past we have overlooked those concerns, dismissed them too easily. Here is how my approach is going to be different both from the last Labour government and this Conservative government. You see we need secure management of out borders, we need competent management of the system. But here is the big change, it is about the way our economy works. You see, immigration has really significant economic benefits but not when it is used to undercut workers already here and exploit people coming here. The last Labour government didn\u2019t do enough to address these concerns and the Tories never will. So the next Labour government will crack down on employers who don\u2019t pay the minimum wage. We will stop recruitment agencies just saying they are only going to hire people from overseas. And we will end the shady practices, in the construction industry and elsewhere, of gang-masters. So we need a system of immigration that works for the whole country and not just for some. You know there is no more important area of our common life than the United Kingdom itself. Now one of the four countries, Scotland, will be deciding in the next two years whether to stay or to go. I want to be quite clear about this, Scotland could leave the United Kingdom. But I believe we would be far worse off as a result. Not just in pounds and pence but in the soul of our nation. You see I don\u2019t believe that solidarity stops at the border. I care as much about a young person unemployed in Motherwell as I do about a young person unemployed here in Manchester. We have common bonds, we have deep bonds with each other. The people of Scotland and the people of the rest of the United Kingdom. And by the way, if you think about the people of Scotland and the Olympic games, they weren\u2019t cheering on just the Scottish athletes of Team GB, they were cheering on all the athletes of Team GB. That\u2019s what the SNP don\u2019t understand. And why would a party that claims to be left o f centre turn its back on the redistribution, the solidarity, the common bonds of the United Kingdom? Friends it is up to us. It is up to us, we the Labour Party must be the people who fight, defend and win the battle for the United Kingdom. And after the United Kingdom itself there is no more important area of our common life than the NHS. The magic of the NHS for me is that you don\u2019t leave your credit card at the door. The NHS, it\u2019s based on a whole different set of values, a whole different set of values that the people of Britain love. Not values of markets, money and exchange but values of compassion, care and co-operation. That is the magic of the NHS; that is why the British people love the NHS and I\u2019m afraid the Tories have shown in government it\u2019s something they just don\u2019t understand. Remember before the last election, remember those airbrushed posters? \u2018I\u2019ll protect the NHS\u2019 with that picture of David Cameron. Remember those speeches? The three most important letters to me, he said, were N-H-S. It was a solemn contract with the British people. And then what did he do? He came along after the election and proposed a top-down reorganisation that nobody voted for, that nobody knew about and nobody wanted. And here\u2019s the worst part. When it became unpopular he paused. Remember the pause? He said he wanted to listen, and what happened? The GPs said no. The nurses said no. The paediatricians said no. The radiologists said no. The patients said no. And the British people said no. And what did he do? He ploughed on regardless. He broke his solemn contract with the British people, a contract that can never be repaired. Let me tell what I hate about this reorganisation; let me tell you what I hate. I hate the waste, I hate the waste of billions of pounds at a time the NHS has its worst settlement, its most difficult settlement for a generation. I hate the fact that there are 5,500 fewer nurses than when David Cameron came to power. Think of what he could have done if he hadn\u2019t spent billions of pounds on that top-down reorganisation and had used the money to employ nurses, rather than sacking them. But here\u2019s what I hate most of all. It\u2019s that the whole way they designed this NHS reorganisation was based on the model of competition that there was in the privatised utility industry, gas, energy and water. What does that tell you about these Tories? What does that tell you about the way they don\u2019t understand the values of the NHS? The NHS isn\u2019t like the gas, electricity and water industries. The NHS is the pride of Britain. The NHS is based on a whole different set of values for our country. Friends, it just shows that the old adage is truer now than it ever was: You just can\u2019t trust the Tories on the NHS. So let me be clear, let me be clear, the next Labour government will end the free market experiment, it will put the right principles back at the heart of the NHS and it will repeal the NHS Bill. So friends, this is where I stand. This is who I am. This is what I believe. This is my faith. You know, I was talking to my mum this morning, as you do before a big speech, and she reminded me her mother was born in a small Polish village in 1909. I went back to that village with my mum about a decade ago. About 2,000 people live there and it\u2019s quite an event having people from England coming over. It feels a long way from that village, and what my parents experienced, to this stage today. You see Britain has given my family everything. Britain has given my family everything. Britain and the spirit, the determination, the courage of the people who rebuilt Britain after the Second World War. And now the question is asked again: who in this generation will rebuild Britain for the future? Who can come up to the task of rebuilding Britain? Friends, it falls to us, it falls to us, the Labour Party. As it has fallen to previous generations of Labour Party pioneers to leave our country a better place than we found it. Never to shrug our shoulders at injustice and say that is the way the world is. To come together, to join together, to work together as a country. It\u2019s not some impossible dream. We\u2019ve heard it, we\u2019ve seen it, we\u2019ve felt it. That is my faith. One nation: a country for all, with everyone playing their part. A Britain we rebuild together.

aVIt's great to be in Brighton. And I want to start by thanking somebody from the bottom of my heart for the kindest of words. Not Justine \u2026oh, I would like to thank her, a round of applause for Justine please, ladies and gentlemen. Not my mum \u2026 but a woman called Ella Philips. It was local election day, Ella rode past me on her bike, she fell off \u2026it\u2019s not funny! I helped her up and afterwards she called me something I had never been called before: she said I was an \u201caction hero\u201d. Why are you laughing? She said I was an action hero \u201cwho mysteriously appeared out of nowhere\u201d. And she said, \u201cWhat added to all the confusion was that Ed was actually attractive and not geeky at all\u201d. I promise you, she did say that. She said, \u201cEven the way he appeared was suave\u201d. I don\u2019t know why you find this so funny, friends. \u201cHe was dressed casually, but he had style\u201d. Sounds quite me, doesn\u2019t it? Now I was pretty pleased with this, as you can tell, until something dawned on me: Ella was concussed. She was badly concussed. In fact, she herself said, \u201cI was seeing things because I was still in quite a daze\u201d. Well, Ella, you are not kidding. But let me say, Ella, if you are watching today, thank you, you have made my year. I want to start today with the simplest of thoughts. An idea that has inspired change for generations. The belief that helped drive us out of the Second World War and into that great reforming government of 1945. An ambition that is more important now than it has been for decades. An emotion that is felt across our country at kitchen tables every night. A feeling that is so threatening to those who want to keep things as they are. Words that are so basic and yet so powerful, so modest and yet so hard to believe. Six simple words that say: Britain can do better than this. Britain can do better than this; we are Britain, we are better than this. Are you satisfied with a country where people are working for longer for less, year after year? Are you satisfied with a country divided losing touch with the things we value the most? Are you satisfied with a country that shuts out the voices of millions of ordinary people and listens only to the powerful? Are you satisfied with a country standing apart as two nations? Well I am not satisfied. We are Britain, we are better than this. And we have to rebuild anew One Nation. An economy built on your success, a society based on your values, a politics that hears your voice \u2013 rich and poor alike \u2013 accepting their responsibilities top each other. One Nation, we are going to make it happen, and today I am going to tell you how. I want to start with leadership. Leadership is about risks and difficult decisions. It is about those lonely moments when you have to peer deep into your soul. I ran for the leadership of this party, it was really hard for my family, but I believed that Labour needed to turn the page and I was the best person to do it. I when I became leader I faced a decision about whether we should stand up to Rupert Murdoch. It wasn\u2019t the way things had been done in the past, but it was the right thing to do so I did it. And together we faced them down. And then the other week I faced an even bigger decision about whether the country should go to war. The biggest decision any leader faces, the biggest decision any Parliament faces, the biggest decision any party faces. All of us were horrified by the appalling chemical weapons attacks in Syria, but when I stood on the stage three years ago, when I became your leader, I said we would learn the lessons of Iraq. It would have been a rush to war, it wasn\u2019t the right thing for our country. So I said no. It was the right thing to do. You see, the real test of leadership is not whether you stand up to the weak, that\u2019s easy; it\u2019s whether you stand up to the strong and know who to fight for. And you know I am reminded of a story back when I was starting out, standing to be an MP in Doncaster, with a woman called Molly Roberts. Molly was in her seventies, and there I was candidly trying to get her vote, sitting in her front from sipping a mug of tea. And she said to me, \u201cHow can you, who weren\u2019t brought up in this area, possibly understand the lives of people here, their hopes and their struggles?\u201d It was the right question, and here is the answer. For me it lies in the values I was brought up with. You see in my house it was my mum that taught me these values. About the importance of reaching out a listening to people, of understanding their hopes and their struggles. She is the most patient, generous person I have met in my whole life. And she taught me never to be contemptuous of others, never to be dismissive of their struggle. Now she was teaching me a lesson of life. And some people will say, ah yeah but you have to leave decency behind when it comes to politics. Well I say they are wrong, because only if you reach out and listen can you do the most important thing a leader can do, the most important qualification in my view for being Prime Minister. Only then will you have the ability to walk in the shoes of others and know who to fight for, whoever your opponent, however powerful they are, guided by the only thing that matters: your sense of what is right. This is what I believe, this is where I stand, this is the leadership Britain needs. And when I think about who we need to fight for I think about all the people I have met over the last year. I think of the people Britain and their enormous and extraordinary spirit. I think of our troops, serving so bravely all around the world. Let us pay tribute to them today. You know I have seen in Afghanistan those young men and women, young men and women who are young enough to be my son or daughter serving our country, and it is a truly humbling experience. And the events of the last few days in Kenya remind us of the importance of being ever-vigilant against terrorism at home and around the world. I think of the brave men and women of our police force, who serve with so little credit each and every day for our country. Let us thank them for what they do. And then I think of all the people I have met over the last year. During the local election campaign I did something unusual. I went to town centres, market squares and high streets and I stood on a pallet \u2013 not a soapbox, but a pallet. And I talked to people about their lives. I remember this town meeting I had in Cleverly. It was just coming to the end of the meeting and this bloke wandered up. He was incredibly angry. It\u2019s a family show so I won\u2019t exactly repeat what he said. He was so angry he wouldn\u2019t give me his name, but he did tell me his story about how he spent the last ten years looking after his disabled wife, and then another four years looking for a job and not finding one. He was angry about immigration and some people in the crowd booed him. But actually he wasn\u2019t prejudiced, he just felt the economy didn\u2019t work for him. And then I think about the two market traders I met in Chesterfield, standing by their stalls, out in all weathers, working all hours, and they said look this country just doesn\u2019t seem to be rewarding our hard work and effort. There seem to be some people getting something for nothing. This society is losing touch with our values. And then I think about this beautiful sunny spring day I spent in Lincoln. And the face in the crowd, this young woman who said she was an ambulance controller. So proud to be working for our National Health Service. And so proud too of her young son. Because she was a single parent, nineteen years old, and what she said to me was, \u201cWhy does everybody portray me as a burden on the system? I am not a burden on the system, I am going out, I am doing the right thing for the country, why doesn\u2019t anyone listen to my voice?\u201d And then I think about this scaffolder I met just around the corner from where I live. I was just coming back from a local café I\u2019d been at. He stopped in me the street, he said to me, \u201cWhere\u2019s your bodyguard?\u201d I said I don\u2019t have one, but that\u2019s another story. He told me his story. And what he said to me was \u201clook, I go out, I do the work, I go all around the country, again out in all weathers, I earn a decent wage, but I still can\u2019t make ends meet\u201d. And he said to me, \u201cIs anyone ever going to do anything about those gas and electric bills that just go up and up, faster than I can earn a living?\u201d He wanted someone to fight for him. Now if you listen to these stories \u2013 four of millions of the stories of our country \u2013 and you have your own, and your friends and family, what do you learn? All of these people love Britain, they embody its great spirit, but they all believe that Britain can do better than this. Today I say to them and millions of others you\u2019re right, Britain can do better than this, Britain must do better than this, Britain will do better than this with a government that fights for you. But for Britain to do better than this we\u2019ve got to understand why we got here, why things are so tough at the moment even while they tell you there is a recovery and why unless we put things right it will only be a recovery for the few. Now what I\u2019m about to tell you is the most important thing I\u2019m going to say today about what needs to change about our country. For generations in Britain when the economy grew the majority got better off. And then somewhere along the way that vital link between the growing wealth of the country and your family finances was broken. This is, this goes beyond one party or one government. It is more important to you than which party is in power, even more important than that. You see, when I was growing up in the 1980s, I saw the benefits of growing prosperity, people able to buy a house, a car, even a second car, go on a foreign holiday their grandparents would never have dreamed of. Not spend all their hours at work, able to spend time with kids, not working all the hours that god sends, have a secure pension in retirement and also believe that their kids would have a better life than them. That feels a long way away from where Britain is today doesn\u2019t it and that is because it is. You see, somewhere along the way that link got broken. They used to say a rising tide lifts all boats, now the rising tide just seems to lift the yachts. Now I say this to the people of Britain. If I were you I wouldn\u2019t even take a second look at a political party unless they make this their central defining purpose because your future depends on it. Your children\u2019s future depends on it. Britain\u2019s future depends on it. I say we are Britain we can do better than this. Now I have got a question for you ladies and gentlemen, do the Tories get it? [Audience: No] Oh come on, I didn\u2019t hear you, do the Tories get it? [Audience: No] Ok that is better. They don\u2019t get it do they. I want to say this. I understand why three and a half years ago some people might have thought that David Cameron did get it and that is why people voted for him at the last general election. But they voted for change and I don\u2019t believe they got the change that they were voting for. Let me just explain it this way: next week we are going to see David Cameron resuming his lap of honour for how brilliantly he\u2019s done as Prime Minister. Claiming credit for his enormous achievements, how he has saved the economy as they put it. No doubt he\u2019ll even be taking off his shirt and flinging it into the crowd expecting adoration from the British people like he did recently on holiday and maybe I should make this promise while I\u2019m about it, if I become Prime Minister I won\u2019t take my shirt off in public, I mean it is just not necessary is it. I\u2019ll try and keep the promise. Anyway, back to David Cameron, so he is going on this lap of honour, everything is brilliant, he\u2019s saved the economy, George Osborne, he deserves the garlands as well, you know, aren\u2019t they brilliant. Come on. The slowest recovery in one hundred years. One million young people looking for work. More people on record working part-time who want full time work. More people than for a generation out of work for longer. The longest fall in living standards since 1870. That is not worthy of a lap of honour. That is worthy of a lap of shame and that is the record of this government. He does have one record though but I don\u2019t think it credits a lap of honour. He has been Prime Minister for 39 months and in 38 of those months wages have risen more slowly than prices. That means your living standards falling year, after year, after year. So in 2015 you\u2019ll be asking am I better off now than I was five years ago? And we already know the answer for millions of families will be no. You\u2019ve made the sacrifices, but you haven\u2019t got the rewards. You were the first into the recession but you are the last one out. Now of course it would have taken time to recover from the global financial crisis whoever was in power. But when these Tories tell you that the pain will be worth the gain, don\u2019t believe them. They can\u2019t solve the cost of living crisis and here is why. The cost of living crisis isn\u2019t an accident of David Cameron\u2019s economic policy it is in his economic policy. Let me explain why. You see he believes in this thing called the global race, but what he doesn\u2019t tell you is that he thinks for Britain to win the global race you have to lose, lower wages, worse terms and conditions, fewer rights at work. But Britain can\u2019t win a race for the lowest wages against countries where wages rates are pennies an hour and the more we try the worse things will get for you. Britain can\u2019t win a race for the fewest rights at work against the sweat shops of the world and the more we try the worse things will get for you. And Britain can\u2019t win a race for the lowest skilled jobs against countries where kids leave school at the age of 11. And the more we try the worse things will get for you. It is a race to the bottom. Britain cannot and should not win that race. You see it is not the low achievements of these Tories that really gets me. That is bad enough. It is their low aspirations; it is their low aspirations for you. It is their low aspirations for Britain but their high hopes for those at the top. The City bonuses are back. Up 82% in April alone thanks to the millionaire\u2019s tax cut. So when they tell you the economy is healing, that everything is fixed, just remember, they are not talking about your life, they are talking about their friends at the top. That is who they are talking about; it is high hopes for them. And every so often you know the mask slips doesn\u2019t it. The other day a man they call Lord Howell, he was I think their advisor on fracking at one point\u2026 There is nothing funny about that. He said it was wrong to frack in some areas but it was ok in others, it was ok in the North East of England because he said, and I quote \u2018it was full of desolate and uninhabited areas.\u2019 In one casual aside dismissing one whole region of the country. Let\u2019s tell these Tories about the North East of England and every other part of Britain. People go out to work. They love their kids. They bring up their families. They care for their neighbours. They look out for each other. They are proud of their communities. They are proud of their communities. They hope for the future. The Tories call them inhabitants of desolate areas. We call them our friends, our neighbours, the heroes of our country. They are fed up of a government that doesn\u2019t understand their lives and a Prime Minister who cannot walk in their shoes. We are Britain, we are better than this. Now, to make Britain better we have got to win a race to the top, not a race to the bottom. A race to the top which means that other countries will buy our goods the companies will come and invest here and that will create the wealth and jobs we need for the future but we are not going to be able to do it easily. It is going to be tough and let me just say this friends. You think opposition is tough, you should try government. It is going to be tough; it is not going to be easy. And I\u2019m not going to stand here today and pretend to you it is. We are going to have to stick to strict spending limits to get the deficit down. We are not going to be able to spend money we don\u2019t have and frankly if I told you we were going to you wouldn\u2019t believe me, the country wouldn\u2019t believe me and they would be right not to believe me. But we can make a difference. We can win the race to the top and let me tell you how. It is about the jobs we create, it is about the businesses we support, it is about the talents we nurture, it is about the wages we earn and it is about the vested interests that we take on. Let me start with the jobs of the future. The environment is a passion of mine because when I think about my two kids who are 2 and 4 at the moment and not talking that much about the environment, more interested in The Octonauts. There\u2019s a plug. In 20 years\u2019 time they\u2019ll say to me \u2018were you the last generation not to get climate change or the first generation to get it?\u2019 That is the question they\u2019ll be asking. But it is not just about environmental care. It is also about the jobs we create in the future. You see some people say, including George Osborne, that we can\u2019t afford to have environmental at a time like this. He is dead wrong. We can\u2019t afford not to have an environmental commitment at a time like this. That is why Labour will have a world leading commitment in government to take all of the carbon out of our energy by 2030. A route map to one million new green jobs in our country. That is how we win the race to the top. And to win that race to the top we have also got to do something else, we\u2019ve got to support the businesses of the future. Now many of the new jobs in the future will come from a large number of small businesses not a small number of large businesses. And this is really important. If you think 15 years ahead, the rate of change and dynamism is so great that most of the new jobs that will be being done will be by companies that don\u2019t yet exist. Now that changes the priorities for government. When this government came to office, since they came to office they cut taxes for large business by £6 bn but raised taxes on small businesses. Now I don\u2019t think that is the right priority. Yes we need a competitive tax regime for large businesses but frankly they\u2019ve short-changed small business and I\u2019m going to put it right. If Labour wins power in 2015 we will use the money that this government would use to cut taxes for 80,000 large businesses to cut business rates for 1.5 million businesses across our country. That is the way we win the race to the top. One Nation Labour. The party of small business. Cutting small business rates when we come to office in 2015 and freezing them the next year benefitting businesses by at least £450 a year. That is how we win the race for the top friends, and to win that race to the top we\u2019ve also got to nurture the talents of the next generation. The skills of people. There are so many brilliant businesses in our country who provide amazing training for the workforce, but look, we have got to face facts, leading businesses say this to me too which is there aren\u2019t enough of them and we have got to work to change that so we will say if you want a major government contract you must provide apprenticeships for the next generation. And we\u2019ll also say to companies doing the right thing, training their workforce that they will have the power to call time on free-riding by competitors who refuse to do the same. That\u2019s how we win the race to the top friends. It\u2019s not just business that has to accept responsibility though, it\u2019s young people. We have a tragedy in this country. Hundreds of thousands of young people who leave school and end up on the dole. We\u2019ve got this word for it haven\u2019t we? NEET: Not in education employment or training. Behind that short word is a tragedy of hundreds of thousands of wasted lives. If the school system fails our young people they shouldn\u2019t be ending up on benefits. They should be ending up in education or training so they can get back on the road to a proper career. That requires them to accept responsibility but it requires government too to accept our responsibilities for the next generation in Britain, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ll do. But to win the race to the top we\u2019ve also got to take advantage of the talents of Britain\u2019s 12 million parents. Justine and I had one of the great privileges in any parent\u2019s life this year, which was taking our son Daniel to his first day at school. He was nervous at first, but actually pretty soon he started having fun; it\u2019s a bit like being leader of the Labour Party really. Well it\u2019s not exactly like being leader of the Labour Party. But look, for so many parents in this country the demands of the daily school run, combined with their job are like their very own daily assault course and we\u2019ve got to understand that. Because we can\u2019t win the race to the top with stressed out parents and family life under strain \u2013 we\u2019ve got to change that. In the last century, schools stayed open till mid-afternoon and that was okay back then because one parent usually stayed at home. But it\u2019s not okay now: that\u2019s why we want every primary school in Britain to have the breakfast clubs and after school care that parents need and that\u2019s what the next Labour government will do. To win the race to the top we\u2019ve also got to deal with the issue of low pay. The National Minimum Wage, one of the last Labour government\u2019s proudest achievements, friends. But we have to face facts: there are millions of people in this country going out to work, coming home at night, unable to afford to bring up their families. I just think that\u2019s wrong in one of the richest countries in the world. The next Labour government must write the next chapter in dealing with the scourge of low pay in this country. And to do that though, we\u2019ve got to learn lessons from the way the minimum wage came in, because it was about business and working people, business and unions working together in the right way so we set the minimum wage at the right level and we\u2019ve got to do the same again. The minimum wage has been falling in value and we\u2019ve got to do something about it. There are some sectors, and I don\u2019t often say anything nice about the banks but I will today, there are some sectors which actually can afford to pay higher wages, and some of them are \u2013 a living wage in some of the banks. So we\u2019ve got to look at whether there are some sectors where we can afford a higher minimum but we\u2019ve got to do it on the right basis \u2013 business and working people working together. That\u2019s what we will do: the next Labour government will strengthen the minimum wage to make work pay for millions in our country. That\u2019s how we win the race to the top. And to win that race to the top we\u2019ve got to call a halt to the race to the bottom, between workers already here and workers coming here. I\u2019m the son of two immigrant parents. I\u2019m proud of the welcome Britain gave me and my family, and we\u2019ve always welcomed people who work, contribute and are part of our community. Let me say this, if people want a party that will cut itself off from the rest of the world, then let me say squarely: Labour is not your party. But if people want a party that will set the right rules for working people then Labour is your party, the only party that will do it. Employers not paying the minimum wage and government turning a blind eye \u2013 it\u2019s a race to the bottom; not under my government. Recruitment agencies hiring only from overseas \u2013 it\u2019s a race to the bottom; not under my government. Shady gang masters exploiting people in industries from constructing to food processing \u2013 it\u2019s a race to the bottom; not under my government. Rogue landlords, putting 15 people in tied housing \u2013 it\u2019s a race to the bottom; not under my government. And our country, sending out a message to the world that if you need to engage in shady employment practices, then Britain is open for businesses? It\u2019s a race to the bottom; not under my government. And in case anyone asks whether this is pandering to prejudice, let\u2019s tell them, it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s where Labour has always stood \u2013 countering exploitation, whoever it affects, wherever they come from. We\u2019ve never believed in a race to the bottom, we\u2019ve always believed in a race to the top, that is our party. And to win the race to the top we\u2019ve also got to take on the vested interests that hold our economy back. In the 1990s we committed to a dynamic market economy. Think of those words: \u2018dynamic, \u2018market\u2019, \u2018economy\u2019. And then think about this, what happens when competition fails? What happens when it just fails again and again and again? Then government has to act. Train companies that put the daily commute out of reach. Payday lenders who force people into unpayable debt. Gas and electric companies that put prices up and up and up. It\u2019s not good for an economy. It\u2019s not a dynamic market economy when one section of society does so well at the expense of others. It\u2019s bad for families, it\u2019s bad for business and it\u2019s bad for Britain too. Now some people will just blame the companies but actually I don\u2019t think that\u2019s where the blame lies. I think it lies with government. I think it lies with government for not having had the strength to take this on. Not having stood up to the powerful interests. Not having the strength to stand up to the strong. Take the gas and electricity companies. We need successful energy companies, in Britain. We need them to invest for the future. But you need to get a fair deal and frankly, there will never be public consent for that investment unless you do get a fair deal. And the system is broken and we are going to fix it. If we win the election 2015 the next Labour government will freeze gas and electricity prices until the start of 2017. Your bills will not rise. It will benefit millions of families and millions of businesses. That\u2019s what I mean by a government that fights for you. That\u2019s what I mean when I say Britain can do better than this. Now the companies aren\u2019t going to like this because it will cost them more but they have been overcharging people for too long because of a market that doesn\u2019t work. It\u2019s time to reset the market. So we will pass legislation in our first year in office to do that, and have a regulator that will genuinely be on the customers\u2019 side but also enable the investment we need. That\u2019s how Britain will do better than this. So, making Britain better than this starts with our economy \u2013 your economic success as a foundation for Britain\u2019s economic success. But it doesn\u2019t just stop there it goes to our society as well. I told you earlier on about those market traders in Chesterfield and how they felt that society had lost touch with their values. I think what they were really saying was this: that they put in huge hard work and effort, they bring up their kids in the right way and they just feel that their kids are going to have a worse life than them. And nowhere is that more true than when it comes to renting or buying a home. There are 9 million people in this country renting a home, many of whom who would want to buy. 9 million people \u2013 we don\u2019t just have a cost of living crisis, we have a housing crisis too. In 2010 when we left office there was a problem. There were one million too few homes in Britain. If we carry on as we are, by 2020 there will be two million too few homes in Britain. That is the equivalent of two cities the size of Birmingham. Wave got to do something about it and the next Labour government will. So we\u2019ll say to private developers, you can\u2019t just sit on land and refuse to build. We will give them a very clear message \u2013 either use the land or lose the land, that is what the next Labour government will do. We\u2019ll say to local authorities that they have a right to grow, and neighbouring authorities can\u2019t just stop them. We\u2019ll identify new towns and garden cities and we\u2019ll have a clear aim that by the end of the parliament Britain will be building 200,000 homes a year, more than at any time in a generation. That\u2019s how we make Britain better than this. And nowhere do we need to put the values of the British people back at the heart of our country more than in our National Health Service, the greatest institution of our country. You know I had a letter a couple of months back from a 17 year old girl. She was suffering from depression and anxiety and she told me a heart-breaking story about how she had ended up in hospital for 10 weeks. Mental health is a truly one nation problem. It covers rich and poor, North and South, young and old alike and let\u2019s be frank friends, in the privacy of this room; we\u2019ve swept it under the carpet for too long. It\u2019s a bit of a British thing isn\u2019t it; we don\u2019t like to talk about it. If you\u2019ve got a bad back or if you\u2019re suffering from cancer you can talk abbot it but if you\u2019ve got depression or anxiety you don\u2019t want to talk about it because somehow it doesn\u2019t seem right \u2013 we\u2019ve got to change that. It\u2019s an afterthought in our National Health Service. And here\u2019s a really interesting thing \u2013 so you might say, it\u2019s going to be really tough times Ed, you told us that before. You said there would be really difficult decisions in government, and that\u2019s true, so how are you going to make it work? Well here\u2019s the thing, the 17-year-old said in that letter, look if someone had actually identified the problem when it started three years earlier I wouldn\u2019t have ended up in hospital. I wouldn\u2019t have ended up costing the state thousands of pounds and the anguish that I had. So it\u2019s about that early identification and talking about this issue. And if it\u2019s true of mental health, it\u2019s true in an even bigger way about care for the elderly. There\u2019s so much more our country could be doing for our grandmas and granddads, mum and dads, nuclease and aunts. And it\u2019s the same story. Just putting a £50 grab rail in the home stops somebody falling over, prevents them ending up in hospital with the needless agony, and all of the money that it costs. The 1945 Labour government, in really tough times, raised its sights and created the National Health Service. I want the next Labour government to do the same, even in tough times, to raise our sights about what the health service can achieve, bringing together physical health, mental health, and the care needs of the elderly: a true integrated National Health Service. That\u2019s the business of the future. But we don\u2019t just need to improve the health service, friends; we\u2019ve got to rescue it from these Tories.And the Liberals too. Now look, before the election, I remember the speeches by David Cameron. I remember one where he said the three most important letters to him were NHS. Well he has got a funny way of showing it, hasn\u2019t he? And when they came to office, they were still saying how brilliant was in the health service, how the health service was doing great things and the doctors and nurses and so on. Now have you noticed they have changed their tune recently? Suddenly they are saying how bad everything is in the NHS. Now the vast majority of doctors and nurses do a fantastic job. Sometimes things go wrong. And when they do, we should be the first people to say so. But hear me on this. The reason David Cameron is running down the NHS is not because the doctors and nurses aren\u2019t doing as good a job as they were before. It is because they have come to a realisation that the health service is getting worse on their watch and they are desperately thrashing around trying to find someone else to blame. Blame the doctors, blame the nurses, blame the last Labour government. That is what they are doing. Well let me tell you about the record of the last Labour government. When we came to office there were waiting time targets of 18 months that were not being met, when we left office there were waiting time targets of 18 weeks that were being met. When we came to office there was an annual winter A&E crisis, when we left office the people had A&E services they could rely on. When we came to office there were fewer doctors and nurses, we when left office more doctors and nurses than ever before. And when we came to office people said well the health service, it was a good idea in previous generations but I don\u2019t really believe it will be there in the next, and we left office with the highest public satisfaction in the history of the health services. Yes friends, we did rescue the National Health Service. So when you hear David Cameron casting around for someone to blame for what is happening in the NHS just remember it is not complicated, it\u2019s simple, it\u2019s as simple as ABC: when it comes to blame, it is Anyone But Cameron. We know who is responsible, the top-down reorganisation that nobody voted for and nobody wanted, the abolition of NHS Direct, the cuts to social care, the fragmentation of services. We know who is responsible for thousands of fewer nurses, we know who is responsible not just for an annual A&E crisis, but an A&E crisis for all seasons. It is this Prime Minister who is responsible. So friends it is the same old story, we rescue the NHS, they wreck the NHS and we have to rescue it all over again. And that is what the next Labour government will do. Right, I have explained to you how we can make Britain better by changing our economy and changing our society, and now I want to talk about how we change our politics. And here is the bit you have all been looking forward to: party reform. Now look let me say to you, change is difficult, change is uncomfortable. And I understand why people are uncomfortable about some of the changes, but I just want to explain to you why I think it is so important. With all of the forces ranged against us, we can\u2019t just be a party of 200,000 people. We have got to be a party of 500,000, 600,000, or many more. And I am optimistic enough \u2013 some might say idealistic enough \u2013 to believe that is possible. And the reason it is possible in our party is the unique link we have with the trade unions. The unique link. I don\u2019t want to end that link, I want to mend that link. And I want to hear the voices of individual working people in our party, louder than before. Because you see, think about our history. It is many of you who have been telling us that actually we haven\u2019t been rooted enough in the workplaces of our country. And that is what I want to change. And that is the point of my reforms. See my reforms are about hearing the voices of people from call centre workers to construction workers, from people with small businesses to people working in supermarkets at the heart of our party. Because you see it is about my view of politics. Leaders matter, of course they do, leadership matters, but in the end political change happens because people make it happen. And you can\u2019t be a party that properly fights for working people unless you have working people at the core of your party, up and down this country. That is the point of my reforms. And I want to work with you to make them happen so that we can make ourselves a mass-membership party. Friends, let\u2019s make ourselves truly the people\u2019s party once again. But to change our politics we have got to a lot more than that. We have got to hear the voices of people that haven\u2019t been heard for a long time. I think about our young people, their talent, their energy, their voices. The voices of young people demanding a job, the voices of young people who demand that we shoulder and don\u2019t shirk our responsibilities to the environment. The voices of gay and lesbian young people who led the fight and won the battle for equal marriage in Britain. And the voices of young people, particularly young women, who say in 2013 the battle for equality is not won. You see they are not satisfied that 33% of Labour MPs are women, they want it to be 50% and they are right. They are not satisfied that 40 years after the Equal Pay Act, we still do not have equal pay for work of equal value in this country. They are not satisfied and they are right. And they are not satisfied that in Britain in 2013, women are still subject to violence, harassment, and everyday sexism. They are not satisfied and they are right. Friends, let\u2019s give a voice to these young people in our party. And let\u2019s give a voice to these young people in our democracy, let\u2019s give the vote to 16 and 17 year olds and make them part of our democracy. But you know we have got to win the battle for perhaps the most important institution of all, our United Kingdom. Friends, devolution works. Carwyn Jones, our brilliant First Minister of Wales, he is showing devolution works. And let\u2019s praise the leadership of our Scottish Joanne Lamont for the brilliant job she is doing against Alex Salmond. Now that referendum on September the 18th 2014, it is going to be conducted on the basis of fact and figures and arguments and counterarguments, but I have a story I want to tell you which I think says even more. It\u2019s the story of Cathy Murphy. Cathy Murphy lives in Glasgow, she worked in the local supermarket. In 2010, Cathy was diagnosed with a serious heart problem, but she came to Labour conference nonetheless in 2011 as a delegate. She fell seriously ill. Her family were called down from Glasgow. The doctors said to her that to save her life they\u2019d have to give her a very long and very risky operation. She had that operation a few weeks later at the world-leading Liverpool Broadgreen hospital. Cathy pulled through. She went back to Glasgow some weeks later. She comes back down to Liverpool every six months for her check-up. Now she said to me the nurses and doctors don\u2019t ask whether she is English or Scottish, the hospital doesn\u2019t care where she lives. They care about her because she is Scottish and British, a citizen of our United Kingdom. Friends, Cathy is with us today, back as a delegate. Where is she? Cathy\u2019s here. Friends, I don\u2019t want Cathy to become a foreigner. Let\u2019s win the battle for the United Kingdom. So I have talked to you today about policy and what a Labour government would do, how it would make Britain better and win a race to the top in our economy, put our society back in touch with people\u2019s values and change our politics so it lets new voices in. But the next election isn\u2019t just going to be about policy. It is going to be about how we lead and the character we show. I have got a message for the Tories today: if they want to have a debate about leadership and character, be my guest. And if you want to know the difference between me and David Cameron, here\u2019s an easy way to remember it. When it was Murdoch versus the McCanns, he took the side of Murdoch. When it was the tobacco lobby versus the cancer charities, he took the side of the tobacco lobby. When it was the millionaires who wanted a tax cut versus people paying the bedroom tax, he took the side of the millionaires. Come to think of it, here is an even easier way to remember it: David Cameron was the Prime Minister who introduced the bedroom tax, I\u2019ll be the Prime Minister who repeals the bedroom tax. You see here is the thing about David Cameron. He may be strong at standing up to the weak, but he is always weak when it comes to standing up against the strong. That is the difference between me and David Cameron, so let\u2019s have that debate about leadership and character, and I relish that debate. And we know what we are going to see from these Tories between now and the general election, it is the lowest form of politics, it is divide and rule. People on benefits versus those in work. People in unions against those outside union. People in the private sector versus those in the public sector. People in the north against those in the south. It is the worst form of politics. Like sending vans into areas of Britain where people\u2019s mums and granddads have lived for years, generations, and telling people to go home. I say we are Britain, we are better than this. Telling anyone who\u2019s looking for a job that they are a scrounger. However hard they are looking, even if the work is not available. I say we are Britain we are better than this. So come on. So David Cameron I have got a message for you. You can tell your Lynton Crosby, it might work elsewhere, it won\u2019t work here. We\u2019re Britain, we\u2019re better than this. Friends, the easy path for politics is to divide, that\u2019s the easy part. You need to know this about me, I believe in seeing the best in people, not the worst. That\u2019s what I am about. That\u2019s how we create One Nation. That\u2019s how we make Britain better than this. That\u2019s how we have a government that fights for you. Now, it is going to be a big fight between now and the general election. Prepare yourself for that fight. But when you think about that fight, don\u2019t think about our party, think about our country. I don\u2019t want to win this fight for Labour; I want to win it for Britain. And just remember this, throughout our history, when the voices of hope have been ranged against the voices of fear, the voices of hope have won through. Those who said at the dawn of the industrial revolution that working people needed the vote and they wouldn\u2019t wait \u2013 they knew Britain could be better than this, and we were. Those that said, at the birth of a new century, those who said at the birth of a new century that working people needed a party to fight for them and the old order wouldn\u2019t do \u2013 they knew Britain could be better than this, and we were. Those who said at our darkest hour in the Second World War that Britain needed to rebuild after the war and said \u2018never again\u2019, they knew Britain could be better than this, and we did. Those who said, as the 20th Century grew old, that the battle for equality was still young; they knew Britain could do better than this, and we did. And so now it falls to us, to build One Nation, a country for all, a Britain we rebuild together. Britain\u2019s best days lie ahead. Britain can do better than this. We\u2019re Britain, we\u2019re better than this. I\u2019ll lead a government that fights for you.

aVIt\u2019s great to be at Labour Party Conference in Manchester. A fantastic city. A city with a great Labour council leading the way. It\u2019s here four years ago here that I won the leadership of this great party. We meet at Conference in serious times. Let\u2019s face it: our country nearly broke up in last week\u2019s Scottish referendum. And a country that nearly splits apart is not a country in good health. I\u2019ll let you in on a story from that campaign - there were six days to go before the big vote and I was on my way to a public meeting. I was late, but I ran into a woman just outside the building and asked her about how she was voting; she told me she hadn\u2019t decided. Her name was Josephine and it turned out she was a cleaner in the building. I asked what the company was like - she said the company was decent but the wages were rubbish. She hadn\u2019t made up her mind because life was incredibly tough. She didn\u2019t want to leave but she thought it might be the best thing to do. I don\u2019t know how she voted in the end, but I do know the question she was asking: \u201cIs anything going to make life better for me and my family?\u201d I hear Josephine\u2019s question everywhere, not just in Scotland. \u201cCan anyone build a better future for the working people of Britain?\u201d It wasn\u2019t just the referendum question - it\u2019s the general election question. I am not talking about a better future for the powerful and the privileged. Those who do well whatever the weather. I\u2019m talking about families like yours treading water, working harder and harder just to stay afloat. For Labour, this election is about you. You have made the sacrifices. You have taken home lower wages year after year. You have paid higher taxes. You have seen your energy bills rise. You have seen your NHS decline. You know this country doesn\u2019t work for you. My answer is that we can build that better future for you and your family. Wherever you live in the United Kingdom, these are Labour\u2019s plan for Britain\u2019s future. Across every part of the United Kingdom there is a silent majority who want Britain to endure, but are also telling us it must change. They come from every walk of life. For example, there\u2019s a young woman who works in a pub near where I live, called Xiomara. She lives at the other end of the country from Josephine and she\u2019s separated from her by at least a generation. But she shares a common experience -- she couldn\u2019t afford to go to college, so she got a job washing dishes in the pub kitchen and has worked her way up to being one of the chefs. But like Josephine, life is incredibly tough for her too and she thinks nobody can sort it out -- she thinks all politics is rubbish. And it isn\u2019t simply that people like Josephine and Xiomara are struggling today. So many people have lost faith in the future. I met two students from a top university in London recently. One of them said something to me that really stuck with me. She said: \u201cMy generation is falling into a black hole.\u201d Then she said about her parents\u2019 generation: \u201cThey had it so good and now there\u2019s nothing left for us.\u201d She wasn\u2019t just speaking for herself but for millions of people across Britain, including people who earning a good wage. Gareth is pretty high up at a software company, but still can\u2019t afford to buy a home for his family. Because he\u2019s simply being priced out by the richest. He thinks that unless you\u2019re one of a very few, then the likelihood is that your kids will have a harder life than you. So the task is to restore people\u2019s faith in the future. The way to do it is not to break up our country, but to break with the old way of doing things. I\u2019m not talking about changing a policy or simply a different programme, but something that is bigger: transforming the idea and ethic of how our country is run. Strip away all of the sound and fury and what people across Scotland, England and Wales, across every nation of the United Kingdom are saying is that this country doesn\u2019t care about me. Politics doesn\u2019t listen. The economy doesn\u2019t work. And they\u2019re right. But this Labour Party has a plan to put it right. To do that we have to go back to the very foundations of who we are and how we run things. We just can\u2019t carry on with the belief that a country can succeed with a small minority doing well. Prosperity in one part of Britain, amongst a small elite, a circle that is closed to most, blind to what is going on for everyone but a few. They\u2019re sending the message to everyone but a few: You\u2019re on your own. In our economy, working people are left to bear the burden of insecurity, of precariousness, of anxiety. They\u2019ve been told: you\u2019re on your own. So many young people who don\u2019t have privilege feel life is going to be harder for them than it was for their parents. They\u2019ve been told: you\u2019re on your own. Small businesses find themselves up against forces more powerful than them. They\u2019ve been told: you\u2019re on your own. The most vulnerable have been cast aside, thrown on the scrapheap, not listened to even when they have a case. They\u2019ve been told: you\u2019re on your own. And to cap it all, because it is only a few who have the access, everyone else feels locked out of our politics. They\u2019ve been told: you\u2019re on your own. That\u2019s why so many have lost faith in the future. That\u2019s why so many voted to break our country apart. Is it any wonder? The deck is stacked. The game is rigged for those who have all the power. In just eight months, we\u2019re going to call time on this way of running the country. \u201cYou\u2019re on your own\u201d doesn\u2019t serve you, it doesn\u2019t serve your family, and it doesn\u2019t serve Britain. Can we build a better future for our whole country? With a different idea we can. An idea that in the end won this referendum but has meaning far beyond that. An idea I love because it says so much about who we are and who we can become. An idea rooted in our party\u2019s character and our country\u2019s history. An idea that got us through our darkest moments and built our greatest institutions. An idea that is just one simple word: Together. Together we can restore faith in the future. Together we can build a future for everyday working people. Together we can rebuild Britain. Together we can. Together says it is not just the rich and powerful whose voice should be heard. It is everyone. Together says that it is not just a few that create the wealth. It is every working person. Together says that we won\u2019t succeed just with the talents of a few. But we need to use and reward the talents of all. Together says that we can\u2019t have some living under different rules. But we need everybody to play their part. And together says we have a duty to look after each other when times are hard. Together: a different idea for Britain and the way we will restore faith in the future. Of course it\u2019s hard to believe that we can run the country differently. But look around us and the inspiration is everywhere to see. There are so many shining examples of a different way of doing things. I told you about Gareth earlier - I didn\u2019t just meet him, I met a lot of his colleagues. And do you know what shines through for me about his company? It is full of brilliant, savvy, young people with great enthusiasm. But what stood out the most is that they all say the most important thing about this company is that it is based on using the talents of every single person. Not just the software designers, but the customer service. Not just the developers, but the people who manage the accounts. And go to so many other firms that succeed. This is the ethic of the 21st century in so many of our businesses. You need the great entrepreneurs. Britain needs its great entrepreneurs. But the greatest entrepreneurs recognise that they\u2019re only as a strong as their team. And this is just as true of great public services too. Earlier this year, I spent a couple of days at an NHS hospital in Watford, getting to know how it looks from the frontline. At 9pm I stood in A & E, as the night shift started and I was incredibly moved as I watched people from different backgrounds, different walks of life, all working together. I was inspired by their teamwork and I was deeply proud of our NHS. Go to any good hospital, go to any great school, it is the team that makes it strong. And think about our brilliant, heroic armed forces, doing the most dangerous job, serving our country. They, more than anyone else, will all tell you, it is about the team. If the ethic of the 20th century was hierarchy, order, planning and control, rewarding the talents of just a few, then the ethic of the 21st century is co-operation, everybody playing their part, sharing the rewards and using the talents of all. Together. It\u2019s time we ran the country like we know it can be run. But if the question is how to build a future together, the Tories can never be the answer. If you want the best example of the \u201cyou\u2019re on your own\u201d, insecure, rig the system for the powerful few, trickle down, throwback dogma, then just look at this government. \u201cYou\u2019re on your own\u201d If you\u2019re a low paid worker struggling to make ends meet. You\u2019re working harder for longer for less and you\u2019re on your own. If you\u2019re a family in the squeezed middle. You just feel like you\u2019re treading water. And you\u2019re on your own. If you\u2019re on a zero-hours contract, having to ring up at 5 o\u2019clock every morning asking whether you are going to get work. They\u2019ll tell you that is how an economy succeeds. You\u2019re on your own. If you are worried about the railway company, the payday lender ripping you off. Tough luck. You\u2019re on your own. And if you\u2019re one of the nine million people renting your home, they won\u2019t act to support you. Because they say that would be like Venezuela. And you\u2019re on your own. You\u2019re on your own they say, because they don\u2019t believe in government intervention. Really? Of course they do. If you are a millionaire they\u2019ve intervened to give you a tax cut. You will never be on your own. If you are a banker, who wants your bonus, they are going to intervene to protect it. You will never be on your own. If you are an energy company whose profits are soaring, they\u2019ll intervene to support you. You will never be on your own. And by the way, if you are a Conservative supporting, gold mining, luxury hotel owning, Putin award winning, Tory ball attending, Russian oligarch, and you have got a £160,000 to bid in an auction? You won\u2019t be on your own either; you will be on tennis court playing doubles with David Cameron. David Cameron is going to spend a lot of time in the next eight months trying to fight this election about the past. He tells you that any problems are not his fault, he\u2019s done a tremendous job and everything is about to get better for you and your family. In the end you\u2019re going to have to be the judge of this. But his record isn\u2019t just mediocre. For your family it is the worst ever. The longest fall in living standards since records began. Wages rising slower than prices for 50 out of 51 months. Nearly five years of David Cameron. For your family that\u2019s five years of sacrifice, and zero years of success for him. Now you could believe that\u2019s nothing to do with David Cameron. But isn\u2019t there a more plausible explanation? That a Tory economy is always going to be an economy for the few, because that\u2019s who the Tories care about. We\u2019ve had five years of their experiment with your life and so we have a pretty clear view of what the Tory future looks like. Your family worse off. Your family can\u2019t afford to take that risk. Your family can\u2019t afford another five years of David Cameron. I\u2019ve got a better idea - come this May, let\u2019s give him all the time he needs for surfing and angry birds and tennis with the Russian oligarchs Let\u2019s send him into opposition. Here\u2019s the hard truth: the Tories have no plan for the future for you and your family. That\u2019s why we need Labour\u2019s plan for Britain\u2019s future. And in the four years since we lost the last election, we have learnt hard, important lessons. They start with government having to live within its means. If people feel cynical now - and they do - think how much worse it would be if we made false promises. There won\u2019t be money to spend after the next election. Britain will be spending £75 billion on the interest on our debt alone. That\u2019s more than the entire budget for our schools. So as Ed Balls announced yesterday, Labour\u2019s plan is based on a tough new approach. Eliminating the deficit as soon as possible in the next parliament. Getting the national debt falling. And no proposals for additional borrowing. We will get the deficit down. The next Labour government will deal with our nation\u2019s debts. And it is because government won\u2019t have the money to spend, it is more important than ever that everyone does their bit so we change Britain together. One Nation Labour has changed from New Labour - businesses have a responsibility to pay their taxes, respect their customers and treat their workers fairly. Because together we can and on our own we can\u2019t. Those who can work have a responsibility to do so. Because together we can and on our own we can\u2019t. Immigration benefits our country but those who come here have a responsibility to learn English and earn their way. And employers have a responsibility not to exploit migrant workers and undercut wages. Because together we can and on our own we can\u2019t. Government, business, working people acting together. Living up to their responsibilities. A new ethic. A national effort. Labour\u2019s plan for Britain\u2019s future. Six national goals I want to set out six national goals. Not just for one year or one term of office. But a plan for the next ten years. Britain 2025. Goal 1 The starting point of Labour\u2019s plan is that we become a country that rewards hard work once again. One in five of the men and women go out to work in Britain, do the hours, make their contribution, but find themselves on low pay. With Britain\u2019s traditions, with Labour\u2019s traditions, that should shame us all. So our first national goal is that we will halve the number of people in low pay in our country. Changing the lives of two million people in Britain, and we will start straight away. Building a country together means not just using but rewarding the talents of all. The minimum wage must become a route to bringing up your family with dignity. So we will raise the minimum wage by £1.50 an hour by 2020, to £8 an hour. Someone working full-time on the minimum wage would be paid nearly £60 a week more than they are now. That\u2019s almost £3000 a year. The Tories are the party of wealth and privilege. Labour is once again the party of hard work fairly paid, and every working person should have their hard work rewarded. Goal 2 So our second national goal is that all working families share fairly in the growing wealth of the country. That means, when the economy grows, the wages of everyday working people should grow at the same rate. I will tell you what is extraordinary: that this has become controversial. We used to take it for granted. Now, that is what the cost of living crisis is all about. It is hard to turn round. But you need a government with a clear focus on it. There is only one way to achieve this: to transform our economy so that it starts to create good jobs at decent wages. This needs a national effort,from government to let no vested interest, no stale orthodoxies, no old mindset, stand in the way of restoring the basic bargain of Britain. It means bigger reform of our banks, including breaking up the big banks so they help create those good jobs. It means getting power out of Whitehall. Businesses, towns and cities, controlling the resources to create the jobs and prosperity their area needs. It means businesses and trade unions engaged not in confrontation but in cooperation. And it means this great party using our historic values to fight for the people in the frontline of the modern workforce. To the growing army of our self-employed, five million working people so often the most entrepreneurial, go-getting people in our country -- they don\u2019t want special treatment, but they do deserve a fair shot. Two thirds have no pension. Because of the jobs they do, one in five is stopped from getting a mortgage. It is time to end this modern, 21st century discrimination. The next Labour government will ensure there are equal rights for the self-employed. Goal 3 I said the only way to transform our economy is to make sure we create good jobs. The jobs of the future. So our third national goal is for Britain to be truly a world leader in Green technology by 2025, creating one million new jobs as we do. Under this government, Britain is behind Germany, Japan, the United States and even India and China for low-carbon, green technologies and services. So many of our brilliant businesses are desperate to play their part in creating their jobs of the future but they just can\u2019t do it unless government does its bit. With our plan, we will. Making a clear commitment to take the carbon out of our electricity by 2030. A Green Investment Bank with real powers to borrow and attract investment. And as Caroline Flint announced yesterday, devolving power to our communities so that we can insulate 5 million homes. The environment may not be fashionable as a political issue any more. But I believe it is incredibly important to our economy today. And it is the most important thing I can do in politics for the future of my kids and their generation. A plan for our country, a plan for our families, must have at its heart a future for all our young people. Goal 4 Yesterday, I met some apprentices from Manchester College. Most of them had no encouragement from their schools. They had been told they were a waste of time. But I did a young woman, Elizabeth, who had been encouraged by her school. She was doing a fantastic apprenticeship in Auto electrics. She is one of the lucky few. So our fourth national goal is that as many young people leaving school should be able to do apprenticeships as currently go to university. Under this government, the number of apprenticeships for young people has actually fallen. So here again we need the biggest national effort that we have seen for generations. Young people showing the ambition to get on. Schools and colleges leading a dramatic change in education, with gold standard technical qualifications. And business and government leading a revolution in apprenticeships. We will end the failure of the public sector to provide apprenticeships. Companies that bring workers in from outside the EU will have to offer apprenticeships to the next generation. And we will give employers the money for apprenticeships for the first time and we will say to every big company that wants a government contract: you must provide apprenticeships to our young people. Goal 5 And a plan for your family doesn\u2019t just depend on wages, jobs and education. What is it that provides us with security in life and faith in the future? The love of the people we care most about. Decent work properly rewarded. And the confidence and security that comes from having our own home. So many people in Britain today don\u2019t have that. That most British of dreams, the dream of home ownership, has faded for so many. Under this government, Britain has the lowest level of house-building since the 1920s. So our fifth national goal is that for the first time in fifty years we will make sure this country is building as many houses as we need. By 2025, doubling the number of first time buyers who get on the housing ladder each year. Again, we will need a national effort to achieve. We will stop the large developers sitting on land and we will back the thousands of small developers and construction companies with access to new loans. There will be new towns, garden cities and suburbs with a half a million new homes. And housing will be a top priority in our capital investment programme. Because we need to start Britain building again. Goal 6 You also need to know that public services - policing, schools, transport - will be there when you need them. But it is especially true when it comes to health. I mentioned earlier the two days I spent at an NHS hospital in Watford. I met a patient, Colin, in his 80s, who sadly passed away a few weeks later. We had an amazing conversation - he remembered the foundation of the NHS, and life before and he said: \u201cwhere would we be without it?\u201d We know where we would be. We would be on our own. I know my duty to Colin and the British people. We need to make sure there is an NHS there when we need it. So our sixth national goal is to create a world-class 21st century health and care service. Because a hospital is only as good as the services in the community - that\u2019s the biggest lesson I learnt in Watford. If people can\u2019t get to see their GP, if they can\u2019t get the care they need at home, they end up in hospital when that could have been avoided. That\u2019s bad for them, and it costs billions of pounds. One in four people have to wait a week or more for a GP appointment. We\u2019ve seen the scandal of care visits restricted to just 15 minutes for the elderly. And we know huge future pressures facing the NHS. We are going to have to transform the way the NHS works in the years ahead. It is time to care about our NHS. We need doctors, nurses, care workers, midwives able to spend proper time with us, not to be rushed off their feet. So the next Labour government will set aside funding so we can have 3000 more midwives, 5000 more homecare workers, 8000 more GPs & 20000 more nurses in our NHS We\u2019ll create an NHS with time to care. And because there has never been a more important time for our National Health Service, there will be £2.5 billion in an NHS Time to Care Fund to start transforming services for the future. Tomorrow, Andy Burnham will present our plan for a truly integrated service, for physical health, mental health and care for the elderly. And we won\u2019t borrow a penny to do it, nor will we be raising taxes on everyday working people. We will raise a billion pounds from tax avoidance, including by closing the tax loop-holes for the hedge funds. We will use the proceeds from a tax on houses worth over two million pounds. And we will raise revenue from the tobacco companies, who make soaring profits on the back of ill health. Doing it together, means everyone playing their part to help fund our NHS. The stakes are incredibly high in this election, but nowhere more than on the NHS. The NHS is sliding backwards under this government - they are privatising and fragmenting it. Just think what it would look like after five more years of this government. It is not safe in their hands. We built the NHS. We saved the NHS. We will repeal their Health and Social Care Bill and we will transform the NHS for the future. And we will do it together. So here we have six national goals. Labour\u2019s plan for Britain\u2019s future. A future fit for the everyday working people of Britain. This plan is about how we can build a better future for you and your family. But to make this plan really work, we need to change who has the power so that all those people who feel locked out are let back in. Westminster politics is so often out of touch, irrelevant and disconnected from people\u2019s lives. It is time we brought power much closer to people. It is time the voice of young people was heard which is why we will give the vote to 16 and 17 year olds. It is time we complete the unfinished work of reform of the House of Lords, aiming to make it truly a Senate of the regions and nations. And yes it is time to devolve power to England too. I am proud of our devolution proposals. Reversing a century of centralisation in this country. We need to go further. We have to be led by the people not politicians. If the problem is Westminster we can\u2019t have a quick fix, a stitch up in Westminster. We\u2019ve got to mobilise and harness the energy of people all across the country. That\u2019s why only a constitutional convention will do. And giving voice to everyone in Britain is also about who we are. We are more than ever, four nations -- and one. England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and Britain too. Each nation making its contribution. Not just better together, but greater together. Not something to fear but something to be proud of. In the Scottish referendum people showed us they can be proud to be Scottish and proud to be British. And let\u2019s play tribute to the First Minister of Wales, Carwyn Jones. Proud to be Welsh and proud to be British. And let\u2019s be proud of our Englishness too. No political party owns our English national identity. So is time we fought, this party fought, for the traditions of England and did not cede them to others. Englishness: a history of solidarity. From the Battle of Cable Street to the spirit of the Blitz. Englishness: traditions of fairness. From the Dagenham workers who fought for equal pay to today\u2019s campaigners for a living wage. Englishness: a spirit of internationalism. From those who fought in the Spanish Civil War to our generosity to those overseas. There will be some people who tell you that being English, Scottish or Welsh means cutting ourselves off or seeking to divide. That\u2019s never been our tradition. And that\u2019s not our future. Because the same injustices face working people across our whole country and the only way we can tackle them is together. Social justice, not unfairness. Solidarity, not division. Together, not on your own. And the principle of together is why our future lies in reaching out to the rest of the world, not turning our backs on it. Because we\u2019re stronger with allies than we are on our own. Let me say it plainly: Britain\u2019s future lies inside not outside the European Union. And the way we reform the EU is by building alliances, not burning them. And it\u2019s why all those who want to leave, including in the Conservative Party, are now a huge threat to the prosperity of our country. And so too the government I lead will be engaged in the world. Over four years, I\u2019ve shown this party has learnt the lessons of the Iraq war. We have all been horrified by the murderous actions of ISIL in the last few months. And our thoughts are with Alan Henning and his family at this terrible time. Our traditions of Internationalism mean that we can never turn away when we see that threat. But we will seek to build alliances across the world, and in the region, in a legitimate and effective way to counter it. And fighting for our values overseas also means promoting human rights, including for gay and lesbian people. That is why I make this commitment to you today. When I am Prime Minister the question of human rights for gay and lesbian people will never be ignored. And I will appoint Michael Cashman to lead the government\u2019s work in promoting gay rights across the globe, so that together we can build a fairer, more equal, more just world for everyone. Making our plan happen, at home and abroad, also needs the right leadership. And I know that the next eight months represent my interview with the British people for one of the most important jobs in the country. Let me tell what I care about: I care about big ideas that can change our country \u2014 the principle of together. I care about reaching out to people right across our country, and hearing them not shutting them out. And I care about being a Prime Minister who will stand up for you when you need it against powerful forces. As Rosie, a doctor from Devon said to me the other day: \u201cwhat we need is someone who will stand up for working people, everyday people, because you will have the power and we won\u2019t.\u201d That\u2019s why I stood up against Rupert Murdoch over phone hacking. Stood up against the banks over bonuses. Stood up against the payday lenders over their disgraceful exploitation. Stood up against the energy companies over their soaring profits and prices. And, yes, I stood up against the Daily Mail when they said that my Dad hated Britain. Because I know my Dad loved Britain. Friends, as Prime Minister I will show the same resolve. My opponent stands for something different. He stands for the \u201cyou\u2019re on your own\u201d idea. And he seems to believe that a good photo opportunity will fool you into thinking he doesn\u2019t just stand up for the rich and powerful, he stands up for you. But, he\u2019s been found out. He\u2019s been found out because he hugged a huskie before the election, and then said \u201clet\u2019s cut the Green crap\u201d after the election. He\u2019s been found out because he stood outside a hospital with a sign saying \u201cno hospital closures\u201d before the election, and then closed that very A&E department after the election. He\u2019s been found out because he changed his logo to a tree before the election, and tried to sell off the forests after the election. He\u2019s been found out because he said he\u2019s a compassionate conservative before the election, and then imposed the cruel, the unfair, the vindictive bedroom tax after the election. And you know what gets me even more? He has heard all the stories of misery, hardship, injustice but he thinks a clever bit of rebranding will get him off the hook. So he calls it the \u201cspare room subsidy\u201d as if somehow that will make the problem will go away. Britain won\u2019t fall for it any more. David Cameron, you\u2019ve been found out. There will be a choice of leadership at this general election. A stark, real, choice of leadership. Leadership that will always stand for the privileged few, or leadership that fights for you. But as I have said, this task isn\u2019t only about leadership and government. Labour\u2019s plan for Britain\u2019s future requires us to mobilise every part of our country to work together. So to every young person in this country, I say: we need your hope, your energy, your vitality. To every older person, I say: we respect your service and need your wisdom. To every business, I say: you can be part of this and we can\u2019t do it without you. To every entrepreneur, I say: we need your ideas, your creativity. To every charity, I say: we admire your spirit and want to hear your voice. To every nurse, teacher and all the public service workers, I say: we salute your dedication and we know why you do what you do. To every person in Britain who believes, like I do, that tomorrow can be better than today, I say: we need you. Together. Together we bring up our families.Together we look out for our neighbours.Together we nurture our communities.Together we build great businesses, the best in the world.Together we teach the young.Together we heal the sick.Together we care for the old.Together we invent cures for the most terrible of diseases.So, of course, together we can rebuild our country.Together we can reward hard work.Together we can ensure the next generation does better than the last. Together we can make our NHS greater than it has ever been.Together we can make Britain prouder, stronger in the world.Together we can restore faith in the future.On our own, we can\u2019t. But together we can. In just eight months\u2019 time you will face one of the most important choices in generations: a choice between carrying on as we are, on your own, for the privileged few, or a better future, for you and your family. We are ready. Labour\u2019s plan for Britain\u2019s future. Let\u2019s make it happen. Together.

aVFriends, thank you so much for that incredible welcome and Rohi, thank you so much for that incredible welcome. Rohi, thank you so much for the way you introduced me and the way our family and you have contributed so much to our community. That was absolutely brilliant. Thank you very much. I am truly delighted to be invited to make this speech today, because for the past two weeks, as you\u2019ve probably known I\u2019ve had a very easy, relaxing time. Hardly anything of any importance at all has happened to me. You might have noticed in some of our newspapers they\u2019ve taken a bit of an interest in me lately. Some of the things I\u2019ve read are this. According to one headline \u201cJeremy Corbyn welcomed the prospect of an asteroid \u2018wiping out\u2019 humanity.\u201d Now, asteroids are pretty controversial. It\u2019s not the kind of policy I\u2019d want this party to adopt without a full debate in conference. So can we have the debate later in the week! Another newspaper went even further and printed a \u2018mini-novel\u2019 that predicted how life would look if I were Prime Minister. It\u2019s pretty scary I have to tell you. It tells us football\u2019s Premier League would collapse, which makes sense, because it\u2019s quite difficult to see how all our brilliant top 20 teams in the Premiership would cope with playing after an asteroid had wiped out humanity. So that\u2019s a no-no for sure! And then the Daily Express informed readers that \u2013 I\u2019m not quite sure how many greats there are here, but I think there are three or four - great-great-great grandfather, who I\u2019d never heard of before was a very unpleasant sort of chap who apparently was involved in running a workhouse. I want to take this opportunity to apologise for not doing the decent thing and going back in time to have a chat with him about his appalling behaviour. But then there\u2019s another journalist who had obviously been hanging around my street a great deal, who quotes: \u201cNeighbours often see him riding a Chairman Mao style bicycle.\u201d Less thorough journalists might just have referred to it as just a \u2018bicycle\u2019, but no. So we have to conclude that whenever we see someone on a bicycle from now on, there goes another supporter of Chairman Mao. Thus, the Daily Express has changed history. But seriously Conference it\u2019s a huge honour and a privilege for me to speak to you today as Leader of the Labour Party. To welcome all our new members. More than 160,000 have joined the Labour party. And more than 50,000 have joined since the declaration of the leadership and deputy leadership election results. I\u2019m very proud to say that in my own constituency, our membership as of last night had just gone over 3,000 individual members and 2,000 registered supporters. 5,000 people in my constituency. I want to say first of all thank you to all of the people of my constituency of Islington North and Islington North Labour party for their friendship, support and all the activities we\u2019ve done and all the help and support they\u2019ve given me in the past few weeks. I\u2019m truly grateful to you. Thank you very much indeed to everyone in Islington. Above I want to welcome all our new members to this party, everyone who\u2019s joined this party in this great endeavour. To change our party, change our country, change our politics and change the way we do things. Above all I want to speak to everyone in Britain about the tasks Labour has now turned to. Opposing and fighting the Tory government and the huge damage it is doing. Developing Labour\u2019s alternative. Renewing our policies so we can reach out across the country and win. Starting next year. In Wales. In Scotland. In London. In Bristol. In local government elections across Britain. I want to repeat the thanks I gave after my election to all the people who have served the Labour Party so well in recent months and years. To Ed Miliband for the leadership he gave our party, and for the courage and dignity he showed in the face of tawdry media attacks. And also for the contribution I know he will be making in the future. Especially on the vital issues of the environment and climate change. Thank you Ed. Thank you so much for all you\u2019ve done. And to Harriet Harman not just for her leadership and service, but for her commitment and passion for equality and the rights of women. The way she has changed attitudes and law through her courage and determination. The Equality Act is one of many testaments to her huge achievements. Thank you, Harriet, for everything you\u2019ve done and everything you continue to do. I also want to say a big thank you to Iain McNicol, our General Secretary, and all our Party staff in London and Newcastle and all over the country for their dedication and hard work during the General Election and leadership election campaigns. And also to all the staff and volunteers who are doing such a great job here this week in Brighton at this incredible conference we\u2019re holding. Thank you to all of them. They\u2019re part of our movement and part of our conference. Also I want to say a special thank you to the fellow candidates who contested the leadership election for this party. It was an amazing three month experience for all of us. I want to say thank you to Liz Kendall, for her passion, her independence, determination and her great personal friendship to me throughout the campaign. Liz, thank you so much for that and all you contribute to the party. I want to say thank you to Yvette Cooper for the remarkable way in which she\u2019s helped to change public attitudes towards the refugee crisis. And now for leading a taskforce on how Britain and Europe can do more to respond to this crisis. Yvette, thank you for that. And to Andy Burnham, our new Shadow Home Secretary, for everything he did as Health Secretary to defend our NHS \u2013 health service free at the point if use as a human right for all. I want to say thank you to all three for the spirit and friendship with which they contested the election. Thank you Liz. Thank you Yvette. Thank you Andy. I want to thank all those who took part in that election, at hustings and rallies all across the country. Our Party at its best, democratic, inclusive and growing. I\u2019ve got new people to thank as well. The talented colleagues working with me in the Shadow Cabinet and on Labour\u2019s front bench. An inclusive team from all political wings of our Party. From every part of our country. It gives us the right foundation for the open debate our Party must now have about the future. I am not leader who wants to impose leadership lines all the time. I don\u2019t believe anyone of us has a monopoly on wisdom and ideas - we all have ideas and a vision of how things can be better. I want open debate in our party and our movement. I will listen to everyone. I firmly believe leadership is about listening. We will reach out to our new members and supporters. Involve people in our debates on policy and then our Party as a whole will decide. I\u2019ve been given a huge mandate, by 59 per cent of the electorate who supported my campaign. I believe it is a mandate for change. I want to explain how. First and foremost it\u2019s a vote for change in the way we do politics. In the Labour Party and in the country. Politics that\u2019s kinder, more inclusive. Bottom up, not top down. In every community and workplace, not just in Westminster. Real debate, not necessarily message discipline all the time. But above all, straight talking. Honest. That\u2019s the politics we\u2019re going to have in the future in this party and in this movement. And it was a vote for political change in our party as well. Let me be clear under my leadership, and we discussed this yesterday in conference, Labour will be challenging austerity. It will be unapologetic about reforming our economy to challenge inequality and protect workers better. And internationally Labour will be a voice for engagement in partnership with those who share our values. Supporting the authority of international law and international institutions, not acting against them. The global environment is in peril. We need to be part of an international movement to cut emissions and pollution. To combat the environmental danger to our planet. These are crucial issues. But I also want to add this. I\u2019ve been standing up for human rights, challenging oppressive regimes for 30 years as a backbench MP. And before that as an individual activist, just like everyone else in this hall. Just because I\u2019ve become the leader of this party, I\u2019m not going to stop standing up on those issues or being that activist. So for my first message to David Cameron, I say to him now a little message from our conference, I hope he\u2019s listening \u2013 you never know: Intervene now personally with the Saudi Arabian regime to stop the beheading and crucifixion of Ali Mohammed al-Nimr, who is threatened with the death penalty, for taking part in a demonstration at the age of 17. And while you\u2019re about it, terminate that bid made by our Ministry of Justice\u2019s to provide services for Saudi Arabia - which would be required to carry out the sentence that would be put down on Mohammed Ali al-Nimr. We have to be very clear about what we stand for in human rights. A refusal to stand up is the kind of thing that really damages Britain\u2019s standing in the world. I have huge admiration for human rights defenders all over the world. I\u2019ve met hundreds of these very brave people during my lifetime working on international issues. I want to say a special mention to one group who\u2019ve campaigned for the release of British resident Shaker Aamer from Guantanamo Bay. This was a campaign of ordinary people like you and me, standing on cold draughty streets, for many hours over many years. Together we secured this particular piece of justice. That\u2019s how our human rights were won by ordinary people coming together. Ordinary people doing extraordinary things \u2013 that is how our rights and our human rights have been won. The Tories want to repeal the Human Rights Act and some want leave the European convention on Human Rights. Just to show what they\u2019re made of, their new Trade Union Bill which we\u2019re opposing very strongly in the House and the country, is also a fundamental attack on human rights and is in breach of both the ILO and the European Convention on Human Rights. Now I\u2019ve been listening to a lot of advice about how to do this job. There\u2019s plenty of advice around, believe me. Actually I quite like that.  I welcome that. I like to listen to advice, particularly the advice which is unwelcome. That is often the best advice you get. The people that tell you, \u201cyes, you\u2019re doing great, you\u2019re brilliant, you\u2019re wonderful\u201d. Fine. Thank you, but what have I got wrong? \u201cOh, I haven\u2019t got time for that.\u201d I want to listen to people. But I do like to do things differently as well. I\u2019ve been told never to repeat your opponents\u2019 lines in a political debate. But I want to tackle one thing head on. The Tories talk about economic and family security being at risk from us the Labour party, or perhaps even more particularly, from me. I say this to them. How dare these people talk about security for families and people in Britain? Where\u2019s the security for families shuttled around the private rented sector on six month tenancies - with children endlessly having to change schools? Where\u2019s the security for those tenants afraid to ask a landlord to fix a dangerous structure in their own homes because they might be evicted because they\u2019ve gone to the local authority to seek the justice they\u2019re entitled to? Where\u2019s the security for the carers struggling to support older family members as Tory local government cuts destroy social care and take away the help they need? Where\u2019s the security for young people starting out on careers knowing they are locked out of any prospect of ever buying their own home by soaring house prices? Where\u2019s the security for families driven away from their children\u2019s schools, their community and family ties by these welfare cuts? Where\u2019s the security for the hundreds of thousands taking on self-employment with uncertain income, no sick pay, no Maternity Pay, no paid leave, no pension now facing the loss of the tax credits that keep them and their families afloat? And there\u2019s no security for the 2.8 million households in Britain forced into debt by stagnating wages and the Tory record of the longest fall in living standards since records began. And that\u2019s the nub of it. Tory economic failure. An economy that works for the few, not for the many. Manufacturing still in decline. Look at the Tory failure to intervene to support our steel industry as the Italian government has done. So, as we did yesterday in conference, we stand with the people on Teesside fighting for their jobs, their industry and their community. The company has said that it will mothball the plant and lay the workers off, therefore it is not too late now, again, to call on the Prime Minister even at this late stage, this 12th hour, to step in and defend those people, like the Italian government has done. Why can\u2019t the British government? What is wrong with them? There\u2019s an investment crisis. Britain at the bottom of the international league on investment. Just below Madagascar and just above El Salvador.  So we\u2019re doing quite well! Britain\u2019s balance of payment deficit £100 billion last year. Loading our economy and every one of us with unsustainable debt for the future. And the shocks in world markets this summer have shown what a dangerous and fragile state the world economy is in. And how ill prepared the Tories have left us to face another crisis. It hasn\u2019t been growing exports and a stronger manufacturing sector that have underpinned the feeble economic recovery. It\u2019s house price inflation, asset inflation, more private debt. Unbalanced. Unsustainable. Dangerous. The real risk to economic and family security. To people who have had to stretch to take on mortgages. To people who have only kept their families afloat through relying on their credit cards, and payday loans. Fearful of how they will cope with a rise in interest rates. It\u2019s not acceptable. The Tories\u2019 austerity is the out-dated and failed approach of the past. So it\u2019s for us, for Labour to develop our forward-looking alternative. That\u2019s what John McDonnell started to do in his excellent speech to conference. At the heart of it is investing for the future. Every mainstream economist will tell you that with interest rates so low now is the time for public investment in our infrastructure. Investment in council housing, and for affordable homes to rent and to buy. John Healey\u2019s plan for 100,000 new council and housing association homes a year. To tackle the housing crisis, drive down the spiralling housing benefit bill and so to make the taxpayer a profit. A profit for the taxpayer because the benefit bill falls when the cost of housing falls. It\u2019s quite simple actually and quite a good idea. Investment in fast broadband to support new high technology jobs. A National Investment Bank to support investment in infrastructure. To provide finance to small and medium sized firms that our banks continue to starve of the money they need to grow. A Green New Deal investing in renewable energy and energy conservation to tackle the threat of climate change. The Tories of course are selling off the Green Investment Bank. They are simply not interested in this. This is the only way to a strong economic future for Britain. That\u2019s sustainable. That turns round the terrible trade deficit. That supports high growth firms and businesses. That provides real economic security for our people. The economy of the future depends on the investment we make today in infrastructure, skills, and schools. I\u2019m delighted that Lucy Powell is our new shadow Education Secretary.She has already set out how the education of every child and the quality of every school counts. Every school accountable to local government, not bringing back selection.We have aspirations for all children, not just a few. Now my first public engagement as Labour leader came within an hour of being elected. I was proud to speak at the \u2018Refugees Welcome\u2019 rally in London. I wanted to send out a message of the kinder politics we are pursuing and a caring society we want to achieve. I have been inspired by people across our country. Making collections for the refugees in Calais. Donating to charities. The work of Citizens UK to involve whole communities in this effort. These refugees are the victims of war - many the victims of the brutal conflict in Syria. It is a huge crisis, the worst humanitarian crisis in Europe since the Second World War. And globally it\u2019s the biggest refugee crisis there has ever been. But the scale of the response from the government, Europe and the international community isn\u2019t enough. And whilst the government is providing welcome aid to the region, especially in the Lebanon, we all know much more needs to be done. Because it\u2019s a crisis of human beings just like you and just like me looking for security and looking for safety. Let\u2019s reach out the hand of humanity and friendship to them. Now let me say something about national security. The best way to protect the British people against the threats we face to our safety at home and abroad is to work to resolve conflict. That isn\u2019t easy, but it is unavoidable if we want real security. Our British values are internationalist and universal. They are not limited by borders. Britain does need strong, modern military and security forces to keep us safe. And to take a lead in humanitarian and peace keeping missions - working with and strengthening the United Nations. On my first day in Parliament as Labour Leader it was a privilege to meet the soldiers and medics who did such remarkable work in tackling the Ebola crisis in Sierra Leone. There is no contradiction between working for peace across the world and doing what is necessary to keep us safe. Today we face very different threats from the time of the Cold War which ended thirty years ago. That\u2019s why I have asked our Shadow Defence Secretary, Maria Eagle, to lead a debate and review about how we deliver that strong, modern effective protection for the people of Britain. I\u2019ve made my own position on one issue clear. And I believe I have a mandate from my election on it. I don\u2019t believe £100 billion on a new generation of nuclear weapons taking up a quarter of our defence budget is the right way forward. I believe Britain should honour our obligations under the Non Proliferation Treaty and lead in making progress on international nuclear disarmament. But in developing our policy through the review we must make sure we all the jobs and skills of everyone in every aspect of the defence industry are fully protected and fully utilised so that we gain from this, we don\u2019t lose from this. To me, that is very important. And on foreign policy we need to learn the lessons of the recent past. It didn\u2019t help our national security that, at the same time I was protesting outside the Iraqi Embassy about Saddam Hussein\u2019s brutality, Tory ministers were secretly conniving with illegal arms sales to his regime. It didn\u2019t help our national security when we went to war with Iraq in defiance of the United Nations and on a false prospectus. It didn\u2019t help our national security to endure the loss of hundreds of brave British soldiers in that war while making no proper preparation for what to do after the fall of the regime. Nor does it help our national security to give such fawning and uncritical support to regimes like Saudi Arabia and Bahrain - who abuse their own citizens and repress democratic rights. These are issues we have to stand up on and also recognise in some cases they are using British weapons in their assault on Yemen. We have got to be clear on where our objectives are. But there is a recent object lesson in how real leadership can resolve conflicts, prevent war and build real security. It\u2019s the leadership, the clever and difficult diplomacy that has been shown by Barack Obama and others in reaching the historic deal with Iran. A deal that opens the way for new diplomatic efforts to resolve the conflict in Syria. The scale of the destruction and suffering in Syria is truly dreadful. More than a quarter of a million people killed. More than ten million driven from their homes. I yield to no-one in my opposition to the foul and despicable crimes committed by Isil and by the Assad government including barrel bombs being dropped on civilian targets. We all want the atrocities to stop and the Syrian people free to determine their own destiny. But the answer to this complex and tragic conflict can\u2019t simply be found in a few more bombs. I agree with Paddy Ashdown when he says that military strikes against Isil aren\u2019t succeeding, not because we do not have enough high explosives, but because we do not have a diplomatic strategy on Syria. That\u2019s the challenge for leadership now, for us, for David Cameron. The clever, patient, difficult diplomacy Britain needs to play a leading role in. That\u2019s why Hilary Benn and I together are calling for a new United Nations Security Council resolution that can underpin a political solution to the crisis. I believe the UN can yet bring about a process that leads to an end to the violence in Syria. Yesterday\u2019s meetings in New York were very important. Social democracy itself was exhausted. Dead on its feet. Yet something new and invigorating, popular and authentic has exploded. To understand this all of us have to share our ideas and our contributions. Our common project must be to embrace the emergence of a modern left movement and harness it to build a society for the majority. Now some media commentators who\u2019ve spent years complaining about how few people have engaged with political parties have sneered at our huge increase in membership. If they were sports reporters writing about a football team they\u2019d be saying: \u201cThey\u2019ve had a terrible summer. They\u2019ve got 160,000 new fans. Season tickets are sold out. The new supporters are young and optimistic. I don\u2019t know how this club can survive a crisis like this.\u201d We celebrate the enthusiasm of so many people, old and young, from all communities. In every part of the country. Joining Labour as members and supporters. And we need to change in response to this movement. Our new members want to be active and involved. Want to have a say in our Labour Party\u2019s policies. Want to lead local and national campaigns against injustice and the dreadful impact of Tory austerity. Want to work in their local communities to make people\u2019s lives better. They don\u2019t want to do things the old way. Young people and older people are fizzing with ideas. Let\u2019s give them the space for that fizz to explode into the joy we want of a better society. They want a new politics of engagement and involvement. Many of them are already active in their communities, in voluntary organisations, in local campaigns. And we\u2019ve convinced them now to take a further step and join our Labour Party. What a tremendous opportunity for our Labour Party to be the hub of every community. The place where people come together to campaign. To debate, to build friendships, to set up new community projects. To explain and talk to their neighbours about politics, about changing Britain for the better. That\u2019s going to mean a lot of change for the way we\u2019ve done our politics in the past. Our new Deputy Leader Tom Watson is well up for that challenge. He\u2019s leading the charge and leading the change of the much greater use of digital media as a key resource. That is the way of communication, it is not just through broadsheet newspapers or tabloids, it\u2019s social media that really is the point of communication of the future. We have got to get that. One firm commitment I make to people who join our Labour Party is that you have a real say, the final say in deciding on the policies of our party. No-one - not me as Leader, not the Shadow Cabinet, not the Parliamentary Labour Party - is going to impose policy or have a veto. The media commentariat don\u2019t get it. They\u2019ve been keen to report disagreements as splits: agreement and compromise as concessions and capitulation No. This is grown up politics. Where people put forward different views. We debate issues. We take a decision and we go forward together. We look to persuade each other. On occasions we might agree to disagree. But whatever the outcome we stand together, united as Labour, to put forward a better way to the misery on offer from the Conservatives. There\u2019s another important thing about how we are going to do this. It\u2019s a vital part of our new politics. I want to repeat what I said at the start of the leadership election. I do not believe in personal abuse of any sort. Treat people with respect. Treat people as you wish to be treated yourself. Listen to their views, agree or disagree but have that debate. There is going to be no rudeness from me. Maya Angelou said: \u201cYou may not control all the events that happen to you, but you can decide not to be reduced by them.\u201d I want a kinder politics, a more caring society. Don\u2019t let them reduce you to believing in anything less. So I say to all activists, whether Labour or not, cut out the personal attacks. The cyberbullying. And especially the misogynistic abuse online. And let\u2019s get on with bringing values back into politics. So what are our first big campaigns? I want to start with a fundamental issue about democratic rights for Britain. Just before Parliament rose for the summer the Tories sneaked out a plan to strike millions of people off the electoral register this December. A year earlier than the advice of the independent Electoral Commission. It means two million or more people could lose their right to vote. That\u2019s 400,000 people in London. It\u2019s 70,000 people in Glasgow. Thousands in every town and city, village and hamlet all across the country That\u2019s overwhelmingly students, people in insecure accommodation, and short stay private lets. We know why the Tories are doing it. They want to gerrymander next year\u2019s Mayoral election in London by denying hundreds of thousands of Londoners their right to vote. They want to do the same for the Assembly elections in Wales. And they want to gerrymander electoral boundaries across the country. By ensuring new constituencies are decided on the basis of the missing registers when the Boundary Commission starts its work in April 2016. Conference we are going to do our best to stop them. We will highlight this issue in Parliament and outside. We will work with Labour councils across the country to get people back on the registers. And from today our Labour Party starts a nationwide campaign for all our members to work in every town and city, in every university as students start the new term, to stop the Tory gerrymander. To get people on the electoral register. It\u2019s hard work - as I know from 10 years as the election agent for a marginal London constituency. But now we have new resources. The power of social media. The power of our huge new membership. Conference, let\u2019s get to it. Get those people on the register to give us those victories but also to get fairness within our society. And, friends, we need to renew our party in Scotland. I want to pay tribute today to our leader in Scotland, Kezia Dugdale and her team of MSPs in the Scottish Parliament. I know that people in Scotland have been disappointed by the Labour Party. I know you feel we lost our way. I agree with you. Kezia has asked people to take another look at the Labour Party. And that\u2019s what I want people across Scotland to do. Under Kezia and my leadership we will change. We will learn the lessons of the past. And we will again make Labour the great fighting force you expect us to be. We need to be investing in skills, investing in our young people \u2013 not cutting student numbers. Giving young people real hope and real opportunity. Conference, it is Labour that is the progressive voice for Scotland. There\u2019s another big campaign we need to lead. David Cameron\u2019s attack on the living standards of low paid workers and their families through the assault on tax credits. First, remind people over and over again David Cameron pledged during the election not to cut child tax credits. On the Question Time Leader\u2019s debate he said he had rejected child tax credit cuts. It\u2019s a shocking broken promise - and the Tories voted it through in Parliament just two weeks ago. How can it be right for a single mother working as a part time nurse earning just £18,000 to lose £2,000 to this broken promise? Some working families losing nearly £3,500 a year to this same broken promise. And how can it be right or fair to break this promise while handing out an inheritance tax cut to 60,000 of the wealthiest families in the country?  See the contrast So we\u2019ll fight this every inch of the way. And we\u2019ll campaign at the workplace, in every community against this Tory broken promise. And to expose the absurd lie that the Tories are on the side of working people, that they are giving Britain a pay rise. It was one of the proudest days of my life when cycling home from Parliament at 5 o\u2019clock in the morning having voted for the national minimum wage legislation to go through. So of course it\u2019s good to see a minimum wage. But the phoney rebranding of it as a living wage doesn\u2019t do anyone any good. And the Institute of Fiscal Studies has shown Cameron\u2019s broken promise mean millions of workers are still left far worse off. They can and must be changed. As I travelled the country during the leadership campaign it was wonderful to see the diversity of all the people in our country. And that is now being reflected in our membership with more black, Asian and ethnic minority members joining our party. Even more inspiring is the unity and unanimity of their values. A belief in coming together to achieve more than we can on our own. Fair play for all. Solidarity and not walking by on the other side of the street when people are in trouble. Respect for other people\u2019s point of view. It is this sense of fair play, these shared majority British values that are the fundamental reason why I love this country and its people. These values are what I was elected on: a kinder politics and a more caring society. They are Labour values and our country\u2019s values. We\u2019re going to put these values back into politics. I want to rid Britain of injustice, to make it fairer, more decent, more equal. And I want all our citizens to benefit from prosperity and success. There is nothing good about cutting support to the children of supermarket workers and cleaners. There is nothing good about leaving hundreds of thousands unable to feed themselves, driving them to foodbanks that have almost become an institution. And there is nothing good about a Prime Minister wandering around Europe trying to bargain away the rights that protect our workers. As our Conference decided yesterday we will oppose that and stand up for the vision of a social Europe, a Europe of unity and solidarity, to defend those rights. I am proud of our history. It is a history of courageous people who defied overwhelming odds to fight for the rights and freedoms we enjoy today. The rights of women to vote. The rights and dignity of working people; Our welfare state. The NHS - rightly at the centre of Danny Boyle\u2019s great Olympic opening ceremony. The BBC. Both great institutions. Both under attack by the Tories. Both threatened by the idea that profit comes first, not the needs and interests of our people. That\u2019s the difference between us and the Tories. So let me make this commitment. Our Labour Party will always put people\u2019s interests before profit. Now I want to say a bit more about policy \u2013 and the review that Angela Eagle has announced this week. Let\u2019s start by recognising the huge amount of agreement we start from, thanks to the work that Angela led in the National Policy Forum. Then we need to be imaginative and recognise the ways our country is changing. In my leadership campaign I set out some ideas for how we should support small businesses and the self-employed.That\u2019s because one in seven of the labour force now work for themselves. Some of them have been driven into it as their only response to keep an income coming in, insecure though it is. But many people like the independence and flexibility self-employment brings to their lives, the sense of being your own boss. And that\u2019s a good thing. But with that independence comes insecurity and risk especially for those on the lowest and most volatile incomes. There\u2019s no Statutory Sick Pay if they have an accident at work. There\u2019s no Statutory Maternity Pay for women when they become pregnant They have to spend time chasing bigger firms to pay their invoices on time, so they don\u2019t slip further into debt. They earn less than other workers. On average just £11,000 a year. And their incomes have been hit hardest by five years of Tory economic failure. So what are the Tories doing to help the self-employed, the entrepreneurs they claim to represent? They\u2019re clobbering them with the tax credit cuts. And they are going to clobber them again harder as they bring in Universal Credit. So I want our policy review to tackle this in a really serious way. And be reflective of what modern Britain is actually like. Labour created the welfare state as an expression of a caring society \u2013 but all too often that safety net has holes in it, people fall through it, and it is not there for the self-employed.  It must be. That is the function of a universal welfare state. Consider opening up Statutory Maternity and Paternity Pay to the self-employed so all new born children can get the same level of care from their parents. I\u2019ve asked Angela Eagle, our Shadow Business Secretary, and Owen Smith, our Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary, to look at all the ways we can we support self-employed people and help them to grow their businesses. And I want to thank Lillian Greenwood, our Shadow Transport Secretary for the speed and skill with which she has moved policy on the future of our railways forward. It was wonderful to see Conference this morning agree our new plan to bring private franchises into public ownership as they expire. Labour\u2019s policy now is to deliver the fully integrated, publicly owned railway the British people want and need. That\u2019s the Labour policy, that\u2019s the one we\u2019ll deliver on. Housing policy too is a top priority. Perhaps nowhere else has Tory failure been so complete and so damaging to our people. In the last parliament at least half a million fewer homes built than needed. Private rents out of control. A third of private rented homes not meeting basic standards of health and safety. The chance of owning a home a distant dream for the vast majority of young people. There\u2019s no answer to this crisis that doesn\u2019t start with a new council house-building programme. With new homes that are affordable to rent and to buy. As John Healey, our Shadow Housing Minister, has shown it can pay for itself and make the taxpayer a profit by cutting the housing benefit bill by having reasonable rents, not exorbitant rents And we need new ideas to tackle land hoarding and land speculation. These are issues that are so vital to how things go forward in this country. I want a kinder, more caring politics that does not tolerate more homelessness, more upheaval for families in temporary accommodation. A secure home is currently out of reach for millions. And John Healey has already made a great start on a fundamental review of our housing policies to achieve that. And we are going to make mental health a real priority. It\u2019s an issue for all of us. Every one of us can have a mental health problem. So let\u2019s end the stigma. End the discrimination. And with Luciana Berger, our Shadow Minister for Mental Health, I\u2019m going to challenge the Tories to make parity of esteem for mental health a reality not a slogan. With increased funding \u2013 especially for services for children and young people. As three quarters of chronic mental health problems start before the age of 18. Yet only a quarter of those young people get the help they need. All our work on policy will be underpinned by Labour\u2019s values. End the stigma, end the discrimination, treat people with mental health conditions as you would wish to be treated yourself. That\u2019s our pledge. Let\u2019s put them back into politics. Let\u2019s build that kinder, more caring world. Since the dawn of history in virtually every human society there are some people who are given a great deal and many more people who are given little or nothing. Some people have property and power, class and capital, status and clout which are denied to the many. And time and time again, the people who receive a great deal tell the many to be grateful to be given anything at all. They say that the world cannot be changed and the many must accept the terms on which they are allowed to live in it. These days this attitude is justified by economic theory. The many with little or nothing are told they live in a global economy whose terms cannot be changed. They must accept the place assigned to them by competitive markets. By the way, isn\u2019t it curious that globalisation always means low wages for poor people, but is used to justify massive payments to top chief executives. Our Labour Party came into being to fight that attitude. That is still what our Labour Party is all about. Labour is the voice that says to the many, at home and abroad: \u201cyou don\u2019t have to take what you\u2019re given.\u201d Labour says: \u201cYou may be born poor but you don\u2019t have to stay poor. You don\u2019t have to live without power and without hope. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to set limits on your talent and your ambition - or those of your children. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to accept prejudice and discrimination, or sickness or poverty, or destruction and war. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be grateful to survive in a world made by others. No, you set the terms for the people in power over you, and you dismiss them when they fail you.\u201d That\u2019s what democracy is about. That has always been our Labour Party\u2019s message. You don\u2019t have to take what you\u2019re given. It was the great Nigerian writer Ben Okri who perhaps put it best: \u201cThe most authentic thing about us is our capacity to create, to overcome, to endure, to transform, to love\u201d. But they\u2019re at it again. The people who want you to take what you\u2019re given. This Tory government. This government which was made by the few - and paid for by the few. Since becoming leader David Cameron has received £55 million in donations from hedge funds. From people who have a lot and want to keep it all. That is why this pre-paid government came into being. To protect the few and tell all the rest of us to accept what we\u2019re given. To deliver the £145 million tax break they have given the hedge funds in return. They want us to believe there is no alternative to cutting jobs. Slashing public services. Vandalising the NHS. Cutting junior doctor\u2019s pay. Reducing care for the elderly. Destroying the hopes of young people for a college education or putting university graduates into massive debt. Putting half a million more children in poverty. They want the people of Britain to accept all of these things. They expect millions of people to work harder and longer for a lower quality of life on lower wages. Well, they\u2019re not having it. Our Labour Party says no.The British people never have to take what they are given. And certainly not when it comes from Cameron and Osborne. So Conference, I come almost to the end of my first conference speech, and I think you for listening OK, alright, don\u2019t worry. Listen, I\u2019ve spoken at 37 meetings since Saturday afternoon, is that not enough? Well talk later. So I end conference with a quote. The last bearded man to lead the Labour Party was a wonderful great Scotsman, Keir Hardie who died about a century ago this weekend and we commemorated him with a book we launched on Sunday evening. Kier grew up in dreadful poverty and made so much of his life and founded our party. Stood up to be counted on votes for women, stood up for social justice, stood up to develop our political party. We own him and so many more so much. And he was asked once summaries what you are about, summarise what you really mean in your life. And he thought for a moment and he said this: \u201cMy work has consisted of trying to stir up a divine discontent with wrong\u201d. Don\u2019t accept injustice, stand up against prejudice. Let us build a kinder politics, a more caring society together. Let us put our values, the people\u2019s values, back into politics. Thank you.
