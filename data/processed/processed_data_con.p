VMy Lord Derby, my lords, ladies and gentlemen, I thank you very heartily for the reception you have given to me, and I congratulate you most sincerely upon the great meeting which you have had in London and which I am told exceeds in the numbers and influential character of its constituents anything that since the foundation of this association has been experienced (cheers); and it is not unfitting that at this time you should assemble in your numbers to give expression to your feelings and views upon political affairs and to combine in your strength to guide the nation in the right way (cheers); for though strictly technical politics seem to be sufficiently quiet, owing to the temporary paralysis which appears to have fallen on our opponents (laughter), yet the situation is not destitute of elements of disturbance, and even of apprehension, either in this country or abroad.  I do not wish to refer to the great industrial conflict which is dividing us at this moment.  It is well that such an event, lamentable though it is, should be kept as much as possible out of political discussion.  (Cheers.)  All we can say is that, in view of the vast commercial and industrial interests which depend upon the union of classes in this country, we hope that this division may before long cease.  (Hear, hear.)Indian PolicyBut abroad our attention is drawn more than anything else to the splendid example of patriotism and devotion which is being set before our eyes in India.  (Cheers.)  There have been greater issues tried on that soil, there have been greater dangers confronted; but I doubt whether at any period in the history of the connexion of this island with India such splendid devotion to their Sovereign and their flag has been exhibited, not only by those who belong to this country, but also by the loyal and splendid races who inhabit our dependencies.  (Cheers.)  It is a great subject of congratulation that, when so many influences combine to tempt men to an easy and inglorious life, when there are so few of those exciting causes which draw forth the heroic qualities from men, at such a crisis as this we should be able to show a display of the highest virtues of a nation of which at any time Great Britain or India would have been proud.  (Cheers.)  I feel bound, specially in the circumstances of the time, to pay a tribute of respect and admiration to the statesman by whom these great operations are being conducted in India.  (Cheers.)  As you know, Lord Elgin is not a partisan of ours.  We speak of him with all impartiality so far as political preference might tend to bias us, but we feel that in a moment of great difficulty and of sudden danger he has shown great courage and resolution and has acted worthily of the great crisis in which he was placed and the splendid position which he occupies.  (Cheers.)  I am glad to be able to say this because I think there are some critics of his in this country who hardly reflect upon the bearing of their words when they attack him.  (Hear, hear.)  There are men, apparently, upon whom the influence of the existing struggle presses so much more than the recollection of past comradeship that they accuse Lord Elgin of having broken the faith which he himself, with his own hand, deliberately passed, and, by that act, of having brought the present war upon this country.  That is an accusation which men do not make in these calmer days against even their political opponents, and it seems somewhat strange that it should be made against a political friend.  (Cheers.)  I will not attempt to go into the minute, hypercritical details of verbal criticism by which this charge is attempted to be substantiated, but I will only invite your consideration of this - that Lord Northbrook, a former Viceroy, thoroughly acquainted with all the circumstances of India and all the features of this case, and not concurring with us in the expediency of the policy which we have adopted, has yet pronounced in the most formal manner that there is no pretence or foundation for this charge of a breach of faith.  (Cheers.)  Now, a charge of breach of faith, when it is made against your own country, when it is made in the face of 200 millions of men, many of them of the same race and religion as those with whom the breach of faith is alleged to have been committed - such a charge as that should be made gravely and with circumspection and with a due consideration of all the responsibility which it involves.  (Cheers.)  The responsibility is enormous, and it is hard to measure the condemnation which is due to those who in the mere hurry-scurry of party welfare are not ashamed to cast this slight upon their country, upon the Queen\u2019s officer, or to set up this subject of difference between the races whom it is our highest privilege and desire to keep together.  (Cheers.)  Perhaps I may note, as I am passing, other incidents in the controversy of the moment as applied to foreign affairs which show the same vehemence of imagination betraying the judgement of our opponents.TunisI see only this morning that Mr Bryce has been criticising the conduct of the government, and one of his causes of censure is that we have concluded a treaty with France which is injurious to the cotton industry of this country.  Mr Bryce might have read the treaty to which he refers.  The essence of the treaty is that for 15 years it fixes 5 per cent instead of 8 per cent as the duty to be charged upon cotton goods imported into Tunis.  (Hear, hear.)  But the treaty is important to us for another reason, and I hold it on that account, so far as such matters can be dealt with as important, to be of considerable moment.  As you are no doubt aware, under international law a treaty only lasts as long as the Powers who make it last, and we have a treaty with Tunis which is, no doubt valuable in its provisions.  But the regency of Tunis is a very remarkable political structure.  It is entirely at the disposal of France, and a decree could at any moment bring its national existence to a close.  I am not saying that France ought to make such a decree, nor am I for a moment suggesting that she will under her present enlightened Government.  The only important point is this \u2013 that if there was a system of life insurance for States, as there is for individuals, Tunis would be an uncommonly bad life (laughter), and no decent office would undertake its insurance.  (Renewed laughter.)  Under these circumstances, I hold it to be a matter of considerable importance that we have now a treaty with France which will last as long as France does, instead of a treaty with Tunis which would only last as long as Tunis does, and, at all events for the next 15 years, the cotton trade of this country will be very much the better for that operation.  (Hear, hear.)Siam and MadagascarThen I see Mr. Asquith accusing me of having made surrenders of territory to France in Siam and Madagascar.  Really, the boldness of his imagination positively alarms me.  (Laughter.)  It is quite true that Siam has been despoiled or deprived of a considerable portion of her territory \u2013 all the territory on the other side of the Mekong, 20 miles of the territory on this side, and the temporary \u2013 so-called temporary \u2013 occupation of most important and valuable provinces besides.  Now all that has been done, no doubt.  The French Government have been allowed by the English Government \u2013 I do not say the English Government ought to have prevented it, but with the acquiescence of the English Government it has been done; but it was all done under Mr Gladstone (laughter and cheers), and it is too hard that I should be accused of making a surrender of Siam to the French, when all the time Mr Gladstone was doing this.  I, out of a respect for what I believe is the duty of statesmen in Opposition, carefully abstained from raising any public question on the subject.  There was, it is quite true, one matter left behind when I succeeded to office.  There was a territory far in the hills, small in extent, almost entirely destitute of population, and so unhealthy that during six months of the year the inhabitants themselves could not venture to mark out its limits.  This territory was claimed by France and by England.  The Sovereign of the territory was a judicious man, and in order to avoid disagreeable complications he sent assurances to Burma of his allegiance on one side, and assurances to Siam and Anam of his allegiance on the other; and as England claims through Burma, and France through Siam, it is obvious that on evidence which might have been thought somewhat similar France claimed this bit of territory and England claimed it too.  What was to be done?  First we thought of arbitration; but then we found that it was so desperately unhealthy that no arbiter would go there (laughter), and that if we sent for the people who knew anything about it and examined them in London or Paris we should have eaten up\u000a\u000aseveral times the fee simple value of the territory before we had got half through the case.  Under these circumstances, the French Ambassador and I, we resorted to a very vulgar plan very commonly known in commerce \u2013 we split the difference.  (Cheers and laughter.)  A great river happens to pass through this territory, dividing it into approximately equal shares.  England took the western share, France took the eastern share (hear, hear), and without any further expense the controversy was solved.  (Cheers.)  If you call that surrendering to France \u2013 surrendering to another country \u2013 I can only say I wish all the controversies we have with the various nations of the world could be settled so simply and so satisfactorily.  (Cheers.)  But Mr. Asquith did not stop there.  He accused me of surrendering to France in the matter of Madagascar.  That is the cruellest thing of all, because Madagascar was invaded, conquered, a protectorate was declared, its most valuable maritime portion annexed to France.  All this was announced to the English Government, and no protest was made.  That is all perfectly true, but it was all done by Mr. Gladstone (laughter and cheers); and so again, another expedition was sent two years ago which has resulted in the more complete absorption of Madagascar by France; but that expedition was announced and started while Lord Rosebery was Prime Minister.  (Hear, hear.)  Do not understand me to blame these statesmen for what they did in these matters of Siam and Madagascar.  But the question is a very difficult one and would require more argument from me than I can give it now.  I do not blame them for what they did, but I do blame them for saying I did it.  (Cheers.)  Well, these are the substance of the attacks you see made on our foreign policy.  They have gone on repeating the words Siam and Madagascar until they really believe they have a grievance against the existing Government.  (Laughter.)  I would entreat you not to exercise levity towards us, not to spare condemnation if we are wrong, but if you condemn us, do not accept the facts from the mouths of our adversaries, but ascertain the facts for yourselves.Greece and TurkeyWell, there has been as you know, another very interesting matter of foreign affairs upon which condemnation has been levelled very freely at her Majesty\u2019s Government.  The only satisfactory thing is that that condemnation has been levelled almost equally from two opposite sides of the question.  I am speaking of the condition of South-Eastern Europe.  I will not go into that, but I ask you to notice that we profess to be a British Government, that we profess that British interests and rights are the main objects of our policy.  (Cheers.)  We do not censure people who have a vehement passion for the Turks.  We do not censure people who have a vehement passion for the Greeks.  I know, without attempting to hold the balance between these two influences, I know very excellent persons on both sides of the question, but those persons must not act as members of her Majesty\u2019s Government.  (Hear, hear.)  We are in the position, as we have said before, but it is so little accepted that I venture to say it again.  We are in the position of trustees.  Our business is to dispose of the power and the resources which are in our hands for the object for which the trust exists \u2013 namely, the interests of Great Britain and Ireland.  (Cheers.)  Though we may have the highest respect for those who have enthusiasms upon the Greek or the Turkish side we cannot admit that those motives can be allowed to weigh upon us in the slightest degree.  We should be exactly in the position of trustees full of philanthropic zeal who paid all the money of those who entrusted it to them to a hospital instead of spending it on the persons to whom the trust belonged.  (Cheers.)  It is not enough that your motive is noble, generous, beautiful; it must also be just (cheers); and that and that axiom is, I think, not sufficiently taken into consideration when the policy of England in the South-East of Europe is judged.  Our object was to maintain the peace.  (Cheers.)  If peace had not been maintained great calamities would have fallen on the world.  The result of the efforts of the Powers of Europe was that in respect of the Slavonic principalities and territories peace was maintained.  Everybody imagined that Macedonia and Bulgaria and Serbia and Montenegro would rise and add to the general confusion, and produce the shock of far greater and more important Powers.  But that did not take place.  Peace was maintained.  It was broken, unfortunately, in one instance by the Greeks against our most earnest representations.  They, and they only, have suffered by what they did; and I do not wish to press upon them the results of their unwise and unthinking conduct.  (Hear, hear.)  We did our best to restrain them.  I maintain that you have no right, or at least it is a very doubtful proceeding, to try and prevent a man from killing himself by killing him yourself (laughter); and with that limitation we behaved ourselves to Greece.  All that exhortation or representation, and even something like an apparent threat, could do we did; but we shrank before the possible danger that might come if we were found in a war between Greece and Turkey fighting on the Turkish side.  (Hear, hear)  Therefore, the concert of Europe failed to prevent this Greek war.  I hold that the responsibility is entirely with Greece (cheers), but in every other respect the concert of Europe has up to this time succeeded.  It has dealt with vast and important problems of the Turkish Empire without breaking that peace which in the present state of the world we all feel to be so valuable, without incurring the dangers of international war between other and powerful countries which might have brought about countless calamities to mankind.  (Cheers.)London Municipal GovernmentNow, gentlemen, you are here, no doubt, not entirely or mainly to deal with foreign affairs, and I owe you some apology for having dealt with them so much.  (Cries of \u2018No\u2019 and \u2018Go on.\u2019)  But there are other things which interest us besides foreign affairs, and they are things which concern our own daily and hourly well-being.  We live in the largest city in the world.  We necessarily make great claims upon the government of that city.  But we ask ourselves whether it is in all respects governed as effectively, as wisely, and as cheaply as it might be.  (Cheers and laughter.)  And that is a question which the inhabitants of London will be forced to answer.  My own belief, which is known to you \u2013 for I have expressed it before \u2013 is that in this matter the inhabitants of London, or perhaps I should rather say the statesmen of this country, have fallen victims to a common intellectual complaint of the present day, which I may name, as I see that Mr. Gladstone has consecrated the word, megalomania (laughter) \u2013 the passion for big things simply because they are big.  And in so doing they have departed from the traditions and the precedents of all other large municipalities, for London has a constitution wholly different from theirs.  We are very proud of our municipal genius in this country and the splendid results which the municipalities all over the country have produced, and we are not the less proud when we compare them with what happens in some other countries.  (Laughter and cheers.)  But in London you have not got a municipality; you have a little Parliament; and a little Parliament is not what you want.  (Loud cheers and laughter.)  We have a big Parliament to which we all pay the deepest reverence.  But we think that one big Parliament is enough for this island, and to double it by another little Parliament, which has less important matters to deal with, but which is hampered by all the difficulties which hinder the progress of business in its larger archetype \u2013 I think that is a proceeding destitute of wisdom and judgement.  (Cheers.)  Your so-called municipality is, I believe, something like ten or twelve times larger than any other municipality in the country, and the result is that you have ten or twelve times the amount of business to do.  But the day remains limited to 24 hours, and the human being remains limited to the amount of force with which Nature has endowed his brain and body.  (Laughter and cheers.)  And the consequence is that \u2013 though I desire to speak with the utmost respect of the members of the London County Council, and I reverence them very much for the amount of time and labour which they bestow fruitlessly upon the public good (loud laughter and cheers) \u2013 yet I feel that if our Legislature had condescended to look upon the precedents which we have all over the country we should have seen that we might have obtained a much more efficient machine, or some much more efficient machines, if we had been content to look upon London as what it is \u2013 not as one great municipality, but as an aggregate of municipalities.  (Cheers.)  Now, that is a problem which you will have to consider.  I hold that the limitation of the size of your municipality is one of the essential conditions of its efficacy and excellence, and for this reason \u2013 that you get working upon your municipalities the best men of the town or district which they inhabit, the men  who are well-known to their fellow citizens, who have themselves conducted their own businesses with great success and still continue to do so, but who can find some time in their day to give to the conduct of the municipality to which they belong, and who would be the best administrators.  (Hear, hear)  You cannot possibly find men not only of greater integrity, but men who, by their very education and by their daily experience, are taught to solve problems which come up for solution in their official capacity.  (Hear, hear.)  But if you overload them you will not get these men.  They cannot give you the whole of their time; some must be given to their own affairs, and, though I do not for a moment deny that you have excellent men on the London County Council, they are men of another type.  They are men who give themselves wholly up to this matter.  That is not so good, or anything like so good, as a Government consisting of men who are still conducting their own affairs of the same sort.  (Hear, hear)  What I am going to say I say with apology, for I should be exceedingly sorry if I were thought, for a moment, to cast a slur, which it would be most impertinent for me to cast, on the members of the County Council, but they are running a danger of becoming professional politicians.  (Cheers.)  And so you see that in their daily capacity there is almost as much waste of time as there is in the House of Commons.  (Laughter.)  In the House of Commons it is a necessary evil; it is one of the conditions on which we receive the inestimable benefit of representative institutions.  But we do not require to duplicate that phenomenon, and you will see if you watch the proceedings of the London County Council that they are overborne by the labour which they have to go through; that the committees they have to attend are endless; and the result is that their debates are adjourned from time to time, and are to an unfortunate, and, I fear, an increasing, extent devoted rather to abstract questions which concern advancing politicians than to those more prosaic and simple matters on which the happiness and welfare of five millions of people depend.  (Cheers.)Two Instances of MegalomaniaAnd I would entreat you, if you have still temptations to megalomania, to look at two great instances of it in the world.  Do you wish to be governed as Paris is governed?  (Cries of \u2018No.\u2019)  Do you wish to be governed as New York is governed?  (Cries of \u2018No.\u2019)  And yet the result at New York, which was waited for with so much interest, and which so many people deplore, was adopted after an effort to amend the admitted defects of the municipality by enormously increasing its area and bringing a much vaster population within its range.  (Hear, hear.)  It failed \u2013 it failed lamentably.  It failed because it could not obtain the assistance and support and co-operation of the only class of men by whom municipal institutions can thoroughly, satisfactorily be conducted.  This matter will be commended to you.  I earnestly hope that it will be entertained by the County Council \u2013 though perhaps it may seem a suicidal course to recommend to it \u2013 in a wise, a patriotic and enlightened spirit; and I earnestly hope that our friends will do their best, even at some inconvenience, to furnish for this or the next election a sufficient number of candidates to enable this matter to be impartially considered. The Problem of London GovernmentI do not think, if you elected the best county council in the world, that you would have solved the problem of London municipal government.  You will not solve it until you seek to give a large portion of the duties which are now performed by the County Council to other smaller municipalities (loud cheers), elected in narrower areas, and having a full and real knowledge of the condition of the people for whom they are legislating.  You cannot tell me \u2013 unless we have a political omniscience which I cannot discern \u2013 you cannot tell me that Hackney knows much of what goes on in Putney, or that Hampstead knows much of what goes on in Greenwich.  But this matter, I have no doubt, will be pressed to the front.  I have very little doubt that some legislation on the subject will be introduced by the Government in the ensuing Session.  (Cheers.)  But, of course, that is not a matter for Government or for party majorities.  We must have the thorough sympathy and co-operation of the best and most enlightened; or the policy with which we are dealing, the enterprise on which we have embarked, will fail.Recent Bye-ElectionsAnd now, gentlemen, the only matter which, perhaps, I ought to refer to is a question which interests us all; and that is the movement of the pendulum.  (Laughter.)  Though we have made an exceedingly good fight there is no doubt that our numbers have in several constituencies declined.  I should be very sorry if that reflection caused the slightest discouragement to any person present.  It is an essential result of your system of Parliamentary representation.  When a general election comes, the electors have before them all the sins of the Government of the day, which are more numerous with one Government and less numerous with another (laughter), but I am afraid are present with all.  And they have that excitement which will induce them to abandon their ease and put aside their enjoyments for the moment in order to fulfil one of the most vital duties that rest upon them as citizens.  But when you come to a bye-election, matters are very different.  There is no general inquest on the proceedings of the Government, but there are a number of things the Government have probably done which affect the feelings of a limited number of persons, and it is a curious maxim of human nature that people of eccentric opinions are very intense in their feelings and convictions, and people of reasonable convictions are very much inclined to stay at home.  (Hear, hear)  I do not know, of course, the various cross currents that may have decided certain votes in some of these recent contests.  I only venture to go on information which I have received.  On the morning when the result of the contest at Middleton was declared I received a telegram from a body calling itself the National Canine Association.  (Loud laughter.)  They did not sign their names or tell me from where the information came, so this is the first opportunity I have had of acknowledging their courtesy.  (Cheers and laughter.)  They were very fully convinced that all the votes that told against us at Middleton were bestowed by people whose dogs had been muzzled, to their own great discontent.  (Laughter.)  I do not suppose that that is a solitary instance.  Of course, the dogs are very much to the fore, and you know all about them; but I am not sure there may not be a party of cats (laughter), and I have no doubt there are many small parties of that kind, and you may always be sure of the result that, in proportion to the smallness of the party is the intensity of the convictions that actuate them.  (Hear, hear.)  For these reasons you must not be surprised at the movement of the pendulum.  It moved during our last Government; when it concluded we were still in a majority in Great Britain and a very large majority in England.  But there was a body of opinion in which no pendulum moves which gave a majority the other way.  But it is not merely this motion which I may call the automatic result of the conditions of political movement in this country; but there is another special cause which produces indifference on our side, and might tend to cause electoral defeat, and that cause is the utter disorganisation into which our adversaries have fallen.  (Hear, hear.)  They profess, and I have no doubt sincerely, to deeply regret the retirement of Mr. Gladstone; but they have not so much cause to regret it as we have.  As long as Mr. Gladstone was on the front bench nobody on our side thought of muzzled dogs.  (Laughter.)  No petty considerations were allowed to thrust aside solicitude for the great interests which, in our belief, were threatened by Mr. Gladstone\u2019s gigantic changes.  (Cheers.)  No follower to Mr. Gladstone has shown himself.  I do not know precisely who the leader on the other side is.  (Laughter and cheers.)  I wish to tender him my heartiest respects and to express a wish that he would withdraw the mask from his face and let me see what lineaments he has.  (Laughter.)  But the result is that the terror, that salutary terror which keeps eccentric spirits from wandering from the fold, has gone away.  People say, \u2018Oh!  The Government has a large majority, and the idea that the country will entrust its destinies to Sir William Harcourt \u2013 well, it is not worth considering.\u2019  (Laughter.)  Therefore, they give themselves freely to the pleasure of poking fun at their friends and revenging any little cause of irritation which they may have felt. Home Rule and the Need for VigilanceThese are human passions \u2013 I may call them human failings.  They are natural in a party, and still more natural in a large party; but standing in the presence of the strongest organisation which the Conservative party has seen, and I think the strongest organisation any party in this country has seen (cheers), I would urge upon them that the correction and remedy of errors of this kind is precisely the service which a strong organisation should perform.  (Hear, hear.)  When we are in the flood-tide of success and everybody is thinking of politics, no doubt such a body as this is very useful; but it does little to influence a movement determined by higher and more potent causes.  But in a time of slack water such as we are in now, when a few eccentrics, by whom a contest may be decided, have their full opportunity and know it is their hour of licence, then is the time when an organisation such as the National Union should make itself a power and its utility felt.  (Cheers.)  Do not imagine that the cause for your exertion has passed away.  No doubt the history of recent times as it will be written is a very strange history.  No doubt the dismemberment of the Empire was undertaken under auspices that might well make us fear.  The whole organisation \u2013 and a terrible organisation it is \u2013 which the Nationalists are able to bring to bear, joined to the whole organisation of the Liberal party, the great prestige and long services of Mr Gladstone and the influence of his seductive eloquence \u2013 all these things, and many more, were joined together in order to assure success to the recent Home Rule movement.  They succeeded after many years of effort in procuring the assent of the House of Commons.  They delighted to indulge in menaces of the fate that would befall the House of Lords if they dared to stand in their way.  Their confidence was unlimited; they never believed for a moment that it was upon that stone that their undertaking would trip.  But the matter turned out differently from their expectation.  The House of Lords rejected the Bill by a contemptuous majority (cheers), and then they were told that their cup was to be filled and final condemnation was to be pronounced.  (Laughter.)  But, instead of that, the country has sent back a larger majority than has ever been returned in our time to support it.  (Cheers.)  No doubt it was a great victory, and no doubt the effect has been for the moment to silence the cry for Home Rule, so that you only hear it now and again in a stray election speech.  But do not imagine that the danger has passed by.  The elements are all there \u2013 all the elements of discontent; all the elements of the organisation by which the integrity of the country was threatened; and, I might add, all the elements by which the integrity of the Church of England was threatened.  (Hear, hear.)  All these things remain where they were.  What they want is a prophet to give life to the dry bones, a general to handle the troops which are ready to his hands.  The general has not shown himself.  (Laughter.)  But do not count upon his absence.  In this period of repose it is for you to perfect your organisation and to make your security undoubted.  (Cheers.)  Do not count that there will be always absent from the benches opposite you a man who can use the elements of discontent and subversion which have been handed down for his employment.  It is for you to prepare against that danger.  If you now use the period of repose; if you now foresee that this lull will not be permanent, but that the tempest will be on you again; you may again have the proud privilege which you had before; and it will again be said that it is due to your efforts and to that party which you organised that the Empire which we all cherish and value has been preserved.  (Loud cheers.)

aVMy Lords and gentlemen, I thank you very heartily for the kind manner in which you have received this toast, and I desire to express my gratitude to you and to my noble friend who on this occasion has kindly brought us together.  (Hear, hear.)  The National Union owes much to him for his constant and unsparing support, and every triumph which we can register and is achieved by it, falls to his glory in no small degree.  I am very grateful for the kind expression you have given of your feelings on this occasion, but it impresses strongly the conviction on my mind that, as for what we have done, it is mainly the workers of such societies as this that have achieved the great victory over which we are able to rejoice. The Change of Political FeelingIt has been indeed a very remarkable victory.  (Cheers.)  There is no other case in the life of the Queen, or I think since the time of the great Reform Bill, where a Ministry has twice referred its conduct to the judgement of the constituencies and has twice been returned with the strongest evidence of their approval and support.  We cannot be vain enough to attribute the main operation in this great change to any action on our part.  We rather point to it as a proof of the marvellous change which has come over the political feeling of the country and of London (cheers), where the instincts of the country are first to be discerned.  I am old enough to remember a very different state of things.  (Cheers.)  I can remember when London was the highest expression of Liberal enthusiasm, when the strongest trust of the party leaders of the Whig or Liberal party was in every part of London; and I remember, when I lived there, it was most of all in the borough of Marylebone that the fire of Liberalism seemed to burn bright and perpetual.  The sort of people who stood then for London boroughs were not the aristocratic Whigs (laughter); they were not any modified expression of Liberal orthodoxy; they were the extremest Radicals which the populace could get together.  I remember well a great election when the two members were Sir Benjamin Hall \u2013 all that could be desired of the fine flower of Radicalism \u2013 and Mr. Harper Twelvetrees, whose name sufficiently expresses the kind of orthodoxy he represented.  We had no chance in those days, and any one who should prophesy that in half a century these London boroughs would be the safest refuge for Conservative statesmen would have been regarded as simply insane.  It has been a very great change.  The City of London has become so Conservative that it is not only safe from those attacks of Radicalism, but it is the principal object of every Radical hatred.  Much the same has been the case in most of the London boroughs, and you know very well what the balance of our losses and gains in the last few elections has been.  But what strikes me as most extraordinary is that the great strength of Conservative feeling lies among the vast number of owners of villas of every kind who surround London.  In my time they were a certain \u2018find\u2019 for every Radical candidate, but a notable change has taken place there.  The question naturally occurs to us whether this state of things will last and how are we to make it last.  My answer is that you will make it last by trying to do your duty.  (Cheers.)Housing of the Working ClassesIf you observe that the villas outside London are the principal seed-plots of Conservatism I am afraid that if you look carefully you will find that such Radicalism as still remains attaches to those districts of London, unfortunately still too large, where what is called the great question of the housing of the poor is living and burning.  I would recommend this, that there is no surer guide to the Conservative party in trying to maintain and to improve their hold over public opinion in London than that they should devote all the power they possess to getting rid of that which is really a scandal to our civilisation \u2013 the sufferings which many of the working classes have to undergo, in the most moderate, I might say the most pitiable, accommodation.  These things will strike any one who looks at the question, but there has been so much controversy on the matter that in touching it I earnestly desire to protest that I am not trying to blame anybody or any set of men.  I am deeply aware of all the difficulties which attach to this question.  They have been created quite as much by economic laws as by any conscious human agency.  But though I would not dream of hinting at blame upon any persons to the right or to the left, yet, looking at the state of things we find, I would not the less earnestly press upon all over whom my opinion may have any weight that the subject which should occupy their attention more than any other social subject is that of providing adequate and healthy accommodation for the working classes.  (Cheers.)  I beg to say that these are no new opinions on my part.  Some 16 or 17 years ago, when first I took my present office, the question was then under agitation.  There was a vast area of ground, the site of Millbank Prison, which was about to be put on the market.  I introduced a Bill and urged it strongly on the acceptance of Parliament, that this land should be sold, not at its market price, but at its cost price for the purpose of promoting the erection of proper houses for the poor.  (Cheers.)  The measure passed the House of Lords, but in the House of Commons \u2013 it was a time of great political confusion \u2013 the difficulties of passing it were too great and it fell through.  I merely allude to this to show that, in urging it upon you now as an object of social endeavour more calling for your zeal and exertion than any other, I am supporting no new opinions but opinions which I have cherished for years.  (Cheers.)  I feel that I could not go further into social questions on the present occasion when my opportunities are naturally restricted, and therefore I will not deal further with them.  I would only ask you to bear in mind that you must not allow yourselves to be frightened away from the remedies for social evils by the fact that they are made a cover or pretence for attacks upon property and other institutions.  (Hear, hear.)  You must repel these attacks, but at the same time you must not allow your attention to be diverted from the stern necessities which the vast social changes of our time are imposing upon all who cherish the prosperity of this country.  (Hear, hear.) The Object of the Hour I am aware that these matters, deeply important as they are, are not the matters which at this moment occupy our attention in the first rank.  We have grave duties to perform and those duties must be fulfilled.  (Cheers.)  They may require strenuous effort, they may require self-denial, but if you wish to uphold the reputation which has been handed down to us from our fathers, if you mean to sustain the Empire which they did so much to build up and which we have sacrificed so many things to maintain, if we mean that the glory of England shall suffer no tarnish at our hands, we must not allow our efforts to slacken until the great enterprise in which we have engaged has been carried through.  (Cheers.)  We are speaking now at a time of some anxiety.  We do not know exactly what is taking place and we earnestly hope that the issue may be better than the beginning; but we have to push it through.  (Cheers.)  It may be that there are matters which have not been explained and which ought to be explained.  It may be that we have to scrutinise every step by which the present result has been reached; but whatever our attitude may be with regard to the efforts that have been made, to the failures or the successes of the past, we must remember that the one thing we have to keep before us is that on the issue of this great enterprise the glory and perpetuity of\u000a\u000aour Empire rest and that we must spare no effort and no sacrifice by which ultimate success may be achieved.  (Loud cheers.)

aVMy Lord Derby, my lords, ladies, and gentlemen: I am not a stranger to this audience - (hear, hear) - nor do I re­quire any introduction, I hope, of an elaborate kind, either to my friends in Manchester or to the larger national gathering which is collected within these walls, and which represents every Conservative Asso­ciation in England. (Cheers.) It was to have been my happy fortune last year to have addressed in another great industrial centre a meeting which, if not as great and as enthusiastic as this - for I imagine that would be hard to find out of Lancashire and out of Manchester - (hear, hear) - at all events a gathering collected upon similar lines, and to deal with great national questions, but I was prevented by illness. Happily for myself, at all events, no such accident has intervened today - (hear, hear) - to prevent me speak­ing to you upon a subject which, if not as exciting as the war, which would have been my topic had I spoken this time 12 months - (hear, hear) - is, I firmly and conscientiously believe, not less intimately bound up with our greatness as a nation and our Imperial position in the world than even was that mighty struggle which we have now brought happily to a successful conclusion. (Cheers)Calumnies against the BillHad I spoken to this audience last year - at all events if I had had to deal with the calumnies and misrepresentations to which the war gave birth \u2013 I should have had 9-tenths of the nation, 99-hundredths of the nation, 999-thousandths of the nation on my side. And why? Because the subject was under­stood. Because the voice of the calumniator, though not silent, was crushed, was crushed by the knowledge which the whole country had of the true issues at stake. I have perhaps therefore tonight a more difficult and a more responsible task before me, because I have to recognise that, up to the present time at all events, the voice of the calumniator has been too long uncontradicted, and that it is full time that this country should show that it is capable of distinguishing truth from falsehood, and that it is not to be hoodwinked even by the most elaborate and ingenious travesties of the truth. It is a melancholy reflection that the misstatements which have been sown broadcast for so long should have been readily accepted even by those of whom we might have expected and hoped better things. I received a letter not many days ago from a correspondent whose bona fides was obvious. He said to me, \u2018Absurd as it may seem to you, I do implore you when you speak at Manchester to contradict these two falsehoods which are believed here, even by many of the best of the artisan and working classes.\u2019 And what do you think those misstatements were which I was gravely asked to contradict? One of them was that the Education Bill which is now before Parliament, and which is absorbing at the present time the whole political attention of the country, did away with Board schools; and the second misstatement was that in the rate-supported schools of the future denominational teaching would be required by law. Now, if these two things can be believed about the Education Bill, anything can be believed about it. They are not only untrue, they are not only falsehoods of the blackest character, but they are falsehoods the falsity of which could be seen in five minutes by anybody who had taken the trouble to read through the Bill. And yet such is the courage - if I am to use the most com­plimentary term at my disposal - such is the courage of our opponents, so confidently do they count either upon the ignorance or upon the indifference of our countrymen, that this kind of lie can find persons shameless enough to propagate it, and others credulous enough to believe it.The reasons for introducing the BillNow there is one preliminary question which I often find asked by those who have but slightly followed this controversy. They say to me: Why did the Unionist Government ever start this unhappy dispute? Why have you, by bringing forward an Education Bill, filled the land with these insensate clamours from north to south, and from east to west? Why have you disturbed the social peace which might have lasted, had you not taken the course you thought fit, for an indefinite period? It is a perfectly fair question. I will give it a direct and, I hope, an intelligible answer. The answer is this, that the existing educational system of this country is chaotic, is ineffectual, is utterly behind the age, makes us the laughing-stock of every advanced nation in Europe and America, puts us behind not only our American cousins but the German and the Frenchman and the Italian, and that it was not consistent with the duty of an English Government, of a British Government, to allow that state of things longer to continue without an adequate remedy.The evils of the present systemWhat were, what are the evils under which, educationally speaking, this great country at the present groans? I have got so much to say to you on the subject of education that I am only going to touch on the heads, the main points which I wish you to bear in mind. In the first place, then, from a local government point of view, we have the absurdity of two rating authorities dealing with education, both with power to draw upon the local resources. But the local government point of view I quite admit is not the worst point of view. From the educational point of view, to begin at the top - or to begin, at all events, if not at the top, at the point immediately underneath our University system - you have the great county councils and borough councils of this country, corporations like the great Corporation of Man­chester, building technical schools like that which I hope to have the honour of opening tomorrow, but without the smallest power so to arrange the education in their district that those who are expected to profit by these great technical schools shall come to them with adequate preparation. The Corporation of Manchester at an enormous cost has built this great institution, the glory not only of Manchester but of the whole of Lancashire. And yet the Corporation of Manchester at this moment is incapable of dealing with secondary education, with higher elementary education, and with elementary education which, if they be not all treated as one organic whole, make all this expenditure vain, empty, and useless, a cost to the ratepayers, but no benefit to the industrial community.Many authorities: no unity or connectionTo go a step lower, there is at this moment in England no public authority which is capable of supplying secondary education in its true sense, and when you come to that higher primary education which has been illegally carried on by the School Boards, though I heartily sympathise with the objects they had in view, when you come to deal with that you have under the existing system, between the Corporation on one side and the School Board on the other, inevitable overlapping, unless you come, as the public spirit and common sense of Manchester has been able to come, to some kind of arrange­ment between those bodies whom the State has thrown down to fight it out as best they can in their midst. And when, leaving higher elementary education, I come to that elementary education which is the necessity of every class in the community, and to which we justly require every man in the land from the highest to the lowest to subject his children, what do we find? Under the existing system we find Board schools which are in no relation either to the voluntary schools on the one side or to the secondary schools and higher technical schools on the other, and we find the voluntary schools, educating, remember, more than half of the children of this country, we find them in many cases starved for want of funds and incap­able of carrying out - properly, at all events - the great duties entrusted to them by the community.The duty of the GovernmentNow, I say that that is a system which this Government, if it was to be worthy of its name, could not tolerate. I say that is a system we are bound to reform, and therefore, when I am asked why the Government have disturbed the serenity of the social calm which existed before this Bill was introduced, I say we did it in obedience to the greatest mandate which a Government can have, in obedience to the duty which devolves upon the whole adult community, that the nation should see that the children of the nation are brought up to carry on and, if possible, improve the traditions of their forefathers. I am told that by the course the Govern­ment have adopted we have given a tonic to the Radical party. I do not grudge it them. They want it. But even if they did not want it, I should think we were utterly unworthy of the confidence which the nation has reposed in us, if for mere party and transitory reasons we had refused to deal with this great problem which pressed for solution.The central principle of the BillAnd what is our solution? I am not going into it in detail, but in substance it is this - that we should put all the branches of education of which I have spoken under the control and supervision of those great public assemblies, the borough councils and the county councils of the country. That is the central principle of the Bill. On that everything else hangs, and I shall have to ask you to remember that fact when I come in a few moments to deal with one of the greatest controversies which this Bill has aroused. We want those great municipal and county authorities to co-ordinate the higher with the lower education, to provide secondary education and higher elementary education without overlapping. We want them - and this is one of the most important things that needs to be done - we require them to train teachers. At present, under our existing system, we find no machinery, no adequate machinery, no tolerable machinery, no machinery that any other country in the world but our own would stand for a moment. We want this municipal and county authority to provide the machinery for training teachers, and we want it to control all the schools with­out exception, so far as secular education is concerned, in which the children of our people are educated, and to see that, so far as secular education is concerned, they are properly equipped and adequately staffed. Remember, then, that the Bill is an organic whole, which deals with a great and admitted evil. It deals with it on a fixed and intelligible plan, and no amendment ought to be admitted into the Bill which destroys it as an organic whole. Very well. So far I do not say I have a unani­mous opinion behind me. Can anybody say that on any subject unanimity is to be expected in this country, and least of all upon the subject of education? But so far I do believe that, if we could eliminate all other points of controversy, the educa­tionalist of this country would come into line with the Govern­ment.The religious difficultyWhere, then, is the difficulty? The difficulty, as you know, lies in religion. Our countrymen, by a vast majority, are of opinion - and personally I agree with them - irrespective, I believe, of political party or Church membership, that religion should be taught to the children of this country. Unfortunately, while we are on the whole agreed on that point, we are not, and probably shall never be, agreed as to what religion should be taught to the children of this country.An ideal system Now, the ideal system - the system which we would set on foot had we the power to reconstruct society - would be that every parent sh\u000a\u000aould find provided for his child a school in which religion should be taught after the manner desired by that parent. That is the ideal system which carries out the principle of ideal justice, but evidently it is not a practicable system. The divisions of religious opinion among us are unhappily so great, and are unhappily of such a character that it is quite impossible that if you are to have compulsory education in the public schools of the country you can so arrange it that every parent should, as a matter of course, find at his doors a school in which religious education is given according to his own particular beliefs.The next best systemVery well, what is theoretically the next best system? In my judgment the next best system theoretically is probably what I may roughly call the Scottish system, and I do not say so only because I am a Scotsman. In the Scottish system there is absolute freedom given to each locality to give the religious teaching which a majority of that locality think desirable for the various classes of parents in the locality. That, in my belief, is a very good system. It works well in Scotland. It works well in some parts of Scotland where the divisions of religion are of the acutest kind. But I do not think it is practicable in this country for reasons which at this moment it would take too long to enter into, but one of which I will just mention in passing. It is this - that that system cannot be adopted unless you abolish the Cowper-Temple Clause and that, as you all know, is by the great body of Nonconformists in this country valued as a portion of the system of education with which they will never willingly part.The only possible alternativeWell, if the Scottish system is impracticable, then I venture to say that the only possible alternative in which there is even a semblance of justice is one which, while it permits so-called undenominational teaching in schools entirely supported out of public funds, permits denominational teaching in schools which are not so wholly supported out of public funds. And therefore, in my judgment, any plan is absolutely inadmissible, and ought not to be contemplated by any Government, or passed by any Parliament, or supported by any constituency which destroys as part of that system the voluntary schools of the country. In other words, so long as you choose to maintain the Cowper-Temple Clause in the schools wholly supported out of public funds, so long must you as a matter of simple and elementary justice allow voluntary schools, outside the wholly rate-supported schools, in which denomina­tional teaching can take place. And when I find - I was going to say our Nonconformist friends, but that is an unfair way of putting it - when I find certain extreme Nonconformist agitators looking forward to what they call a national system of education, and when I discover that that national system of education is one that exactly suits the Nonconformists, but does not suit other people, then I say that that system o\u000a\u000a" type="text/javascript"> f education may have many merits, but does not deserve the merit of being called national. You will observe, then, that I am brought as regards secular education to the single authority - that authority being the county council or the borough council - and that as regards religious education in this country we must as part of our system, so long as we maintain the Cowper-Temple Clause, maintain the right to have the children of that party of the nation which desires it taught in voluntary schools. I believe that the conclusion to which I have thus brought you - I hope at not too great length - is one that commends itself to the moderate men of all parties, whether Churchmen, whether Nonconformists, whether Roman Catholics, or whether belonging to any of the other sects, or to no sects into which the community is divided.Two schools of thoughtWhere then, you will ask me, is the difficulty? The difficulty largely arises because those who hold the general theory of education which I have ventured to propound are divided, and must naturally be divided, into two schools of thought - those, on the one hand, who, agreeing that we must retain our voluntary and denominational schools, are more preoccupied in seeing that there should be adequate popular control for those schools; and those, on the other hand, who agree that there should be adequate popular control, but who are more preoccupied on their side that the denominational character of those schools should not be interfered with. And a good deal of the difficulty has arisen - among those who agree with the general principles advocated by the Government - between those two opposite poles of thought or schemes of thought.The powers of the managersNow let me say that I think some of the difficulty has arisen owing to a misunderstanding of one of the terms used in the Government Bill - the term \u2018managers.\u2019 I think it very natural that anybody who saw the term \u2018managers\u2019 in the Bill would say: \u2018These are the people who have got control of the schools.\u2019 It is a mistake, but it is a natural mistake. I do not think it is a mistake for which either the Government draftsman or the Government are responsible, because we have borrowed the term \u2018manager\u2019 from the preceding Act of 1870, and in the Act of 1870 \u2018management\u2019 and \u2018manager\u2019 are terms which do not carry with them the idea of control. It is only necessary to remind you of the case, for example, of the London School Board. The London School Board controls all the rate-supported schools in London, and the rate-supported schools in London contain the majority of the children in London, and, as you know, the metropolitan area is the largest area probably which ever has been, which ever could be, placed under the control of one local education authority. But the London School Board has the control of its schools. In each of the schools there are managers. In every Board school under the London School Board there are managers, but they have not got the control; and the theory of our Bill is that the control should be not with the managers, but with the borough council or with the county council, as the case may be; and I would venture to urge upon the friends of the Bill - for in this part of my speech I am dealing with the friends of the Bill, I shall have a word to say about its enemies directly - that if they desire, as the Government most heartily desire, that public control should be made a reality - and that it should be adequate to the amount of support given out of public funds - I would earnestly ask them to turn their attention not to the balance of power among the managers, but to increasing the authority of the borough council or county council as the case may be.Increased power to the local education authorityThe reason I make this appeal to them is twofold. If they succeed in modifying the Bill in the direction of making the managers the real controlling power over the schools they would violate that great principle of the Bill which I have endeavoured to explai\u000a\u000an to you, the principle that education should be in the hands of the unifying authority of the borough or county council; so that to increase the managerial power at the expense of the county council or the borough council is really violating the general principle of the Bill, and is running counter, I cannot help thinking, to the soundest view of the direction in which education reform should proceed. That is one reason why I would ask them to turn their attention rather to increasing the power of what is called in the Bill \u2018the Local Education Authority\u2019 than to increasing or modifying the balance of power or want of power among the managers. But there is another reason.Taxation and representationI have constantly heard it urged, I have constantly read it in the controversial pamphlets, that this Bill errs by dividing taxation and representation. In my judgment nothing would tend more to divide taxation and representation than handing over the real control of the elementary schools in this country to any authority, call them managers or call them what you will, other than the county council or the borough council. Who raise the rate? Who pay the rate? The county council and the borough council raise the rate. The constituency of the county council and the con­stituency of the borough council pay the rate. Let them control the schools, let them have the real control over secular education. If, for example, in a country parish you were to make the real controllers of the school the local managers, if you allowed them to draw upon the funds of the county council, then, indeed, you would violate that constitutional principle, then, indeed, you would divorce repre­sentation from taxation, then, indeed, you would be open to some of the criticisms which, in my judgment, are most unfairly passed upon this Bill. Therefore, let me say that I hope the House of Commons - if it be anxious, as it ought to be anxious, to see that there is adequate popular control over secular education - will devote their attention to increasing the really true and effective authority of the borough council or the county council, as the case may be, rather than to merely manipulating the constitution of those who, so far as secular education is concerned, are merely servants and ministers of the borough or county council. I have dealt with one school of thought among those who are friendly to the Bill, those who are anxious - legitimately anxious - to increase popular control.What the Voluntary Schools give upMay I add this one observation? Anybody reading the literature of this subject - if you can call it literature, let us rather say the flood of pamphleteering that has been poured forth upon the country - would suppose that the voluntary schools have everything to gain and nothing to lose by this Bill, nothing to lose, I mean, in the way of the authority of the existing managers over those schools. That is a profound delusion. This Bill, in its aim of unifying and co-ordinating national education, asks sacrifices from many and not least from those who manage our voluntary schools at the present time. No doubt there are schools to whom this Bill will be very little but pure gain from the managers\u2019 point of view; but there are many others who will come into it with grave misgivings and much reluctance, and if anybody doubts that I would ask them to consider this imaginary case. Let us suppose that the Bill became law in the shape in which it was introduced so far as what is known as the option clause is concerned - in the shape, that is to say, in which each local authority had the power to decide whether it would adopt the Bill or not. Let us further suppose in regard to the new grant of a million (or I should say it is a little less, let us call it a round million) which is promised by the Exchequer to the elementary schools of this country - let us suppose that that proportion which would belong to every county which adopted the Bill was given to a county if it did not adopt it, but divided, not as the county would have divided it, had it adopted the Bill, but equally among all the schools, Board and Voluntary alike; who, then, I ask you, in a county which under my suppo­sition had not adopted this Bill, would clamour that the Bill should be adopted? Would it be the managers of the voluntary schools? Or would it be the Nonconformist agitators? My belief is that if that experiment were tried it would be found that no county council or borough council would consent to see themselves excluded from the management of education in their district; while the voluntary schools, of course, their resources aided by the new grant, would go on happily and merrily, not, indeed, forming part of what we want to see created - namely, a great uniform national system of education - but still quite happily for themselves and free from all inconvenience arising from elected managers or from meddlesome county councillors. I think if anybody will meditate upon that hypothesis they will see that my proposition is not without its justification - the proposition, I mean, that after all the voluntary schools in this country are giving up that which in many cases their managers greatly value when they are obliged to fall in with this new scheme of national education.Threatened refusal to pay ratesWell, I turn now from arguing over the details of the Bill with its friends to making a few comments upon its foes. It is a very curious thing that this Bill when it was introduced was most favourably received by the House of Commons, that it was favourably received by the County Councils\u2019 Association. and it was favourably received by the Municipal Corporations\u2019 Association, and that it was not until Parliament separated and the extreme agitator was turned loose to spend his holidays uncontradicted in inflaming the country that we heard of all these extraordinary defects which the measure is now supposed to contain - defects, mark you, so grave that, if we are to believe what we see in the public prints and what I learn from my own personal correspondence, there are a large number of conscientious Nonconformists who seriously think, not only that they will be justified, but that it will be their duty to refuse the payment of rates when this Bill comes into force.Unworthy of the citizens of a free countryWith regard to that attitude, as I believe, a genuine and conscientious attitude, I do not desire to speak with disrespect; but may I say, if that is consistent with respect, as I hope it is, that I think this attitude quite unworthy of the citizens of a free country. The Constitution of this country gives to the electorate and to Parliament, the organ of the electorate, the power to deal with legislative matters. It is always in the power of the electorate, and always in the power of Parliament, to reverse a decision previously come to, and in a free country it is not admissible that any individual, simply because he dislikes, or, it may be, disapproves, or even, it may be, vehemently disapproves, of the action either of the majority of his countrymen or of a Parliament of his countrymen - it is not legitimate for him to disobey the laws of his country. They say their objection is conscientious. Of course it is conscientious; I hope all objections are conscientious; but if I conscientiously object to anything that Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman does, am I, therefore, justified in refusing my rates or my taxes?Capable of indefinite applicationIs not this principle that, whenever you disapprove of the action of the Ministers or Parliament or the electorate, you may immediately refuse your rates, capable of indefinite application? I do not like Home Rule; suppose, per impossibile, the Radicals passed Home Rule, am I going to protest by refusing rates and taxes? Is civilised government possible on terms like that? Does not the whole idea of a free, self-governing country contradict it? Well, it may be said that is a very sound maxim for the ordinary affairs of life and the common legislation of Parliament; but here is a question in which morality is fundamentally involved.A challengeWell, I make a challenge. I make a challenge of a very simple kind. Will anyone tell me what this fundamental principle of morality is? I will engage to show either that it is, on the face of it, not a fundamental principle of morality, or that, if it is, it has been consistently violated in England and Scotland by Nonconformists for the last 30 years. I think it probable, I think it certain, I can prove one or other of those propositions to you, and I think I can almost promise that I will prove both. Well, that is a fair challenge which I think every Nonconformist who conscientiously believes that he is bound to put his house­hold furniture up to auction as a protest against this Education Bill is bound to answer before he goes further.The conscientious NonconformistsBut as I am talking to the conscientious Nonconformists, may I say with what extreme pain I have found myself in con­flict with them over this Bill. To a mere political fight I need hardly say I have no objections. I have been inured to it from my youth up. But when I find people with whom, perhaps, on broad questions of policy I agree, and whom when I do not agree I am anxious to treat with every respect, when I find them really hurt and apparently suffering under a sense of wrong over this Bill, I quite honestly admit that it gives me great pain, and I would very gladly do anything I could to meet their objections. Though I am told every day of my life that I am trampling upon their rights, that they are being deprived of their privileges as citizens, that their consciences are being out­raged, I can most truly say that, having given the subject every consideration, I think in a spirit of great impartiality, while I understand that there can be differences of opinion about the Bill, I cannot understand how it is that they can find that this particular class of objection can weigh upon their minds.They gain much and lose nothingI ask myself, do they object to the Bill as it is, or to the Bill as it is represented to be? Is it the measure that we have been discussing at such length, and on the whole, though with prolixity, without violence in Parliament, is it the Bill they object to? or is it the extraordinary travesty, parody, and caricature of that measure - no, I will not call it caricature, because a caricature involves resemblance of some sort - which has been presented to them by the political agitators who have been deafening us for the last six weeks? I have never, in a now rather prolonged political experience, known the art of misrepresentation carried to such cynical lengths. I have never known any body of agitators draw with such apparent security and confidence upon the credulity of their fellow countrymen. They have improved, so far as I have observed, upon all previous methods. We are quite familiar with mere misrepresentation. We know the orator who misdescribes the subject he is dealing with; but those gentlemen have gone much further than that. What they have done is to take everything in the present system, in the present chaotic educational system under which we groan, and take everything in that system to which the Nonconformists object, and to say of it, this is what the Bill imposes upon you, even in a case where the Bill remedies it. I will give you an illustration. It is stated over and over again that the working man is to be deprived of his school, that the \u2018people\u2019s schools\u2019 by this Bill are to be taken away from the people. Now observe. The people\u2019s school! I presume by the people\u2019s school is meant the Board school. But under the Bill the Board school is left to a body popularly elected, and by a far better electoral machinery than is the School Board now. But in addition to that, the volun­tary schools, which now are not under popular control at all, are by this Bill placed absolutely under the control of a popularly-elected body; so that instead of taking away from the people the people\u2019s school we are giving to the people all the schools they did not possess and in which their children are now educated.Position of the ClergyOne other example I may perhaps give you, indeed I must give you, because it has figured so largely in this controversy. I see it in pamphlets. I see it in speeches. I see it in letters to the papers. I see it in an endless private correspondence, that this Bill increases the power of the clergyman, and that it is intended and devised for the purpose of increasing clerical control, that its object is for ever to put the public schools of this country under the heel of the clergy. Everybody who has followed this controversy will admit I have not exaggerated what has been said. Now let me say that I think a great injustice has been done to the clergy of this country. You would have supposed, to hear these people talk, that the common thing in England was for the children of reluctant Dissenters to be hounded into some elementary school and there taught by force doctrines to which their parents violently objected. So far as I know, you may go from parish to parish in rural England, and you will never find the religious controversy or the religious difficulty existing. You will never find it has occurred to the mind either of the parson or the parent. You will find that different sections and different creeds live in harmony, and that the rare occasion on which the contrary is the case is but the exception which proves the rule. You will also find this - that if the clergy have been left, as I think they have been left, too large a share in the elementary education of this country, it is not because they were greedy of power, but because in parish after parish, and in district after district, the only man ready to take the trouble and make sacrifices of time and energy for the education of the children of the parish was this much-abused clergyman. Well, that is a parenthesis. The argument I was dealing with, the allegation, the shameless and the most impudent allegation, is that this Bill puts education under the heel of the clergy. Precisely the reverse is the fact.Powers of clergy reduced, not increasedAt present (and permanently, if you refuse to adopt this Bill) at present it is true that, for the reasons I have stated - reasons not discreditable to the clergy of this country - in a vast number of parishes there is what is called a one-man control of schools, that one-man control being the control of the clergyman of the parish. But that is the system which exists now. That is the system which will remain if this Bill be rejected. That is the system which will remain if, in the phrase which was used, we either withdraw the Bill or dissolve. But what is the system which this Bill introduces? That is the point. I say that the typical case - I do not say it is universally so - will be that whereas the clergyman of the parish is at present sole manager of the education of his parish, now under the Bill he will be one of six managers. In most cases there will be added to him five laymen, two of them very likely, in many cases certainly, not belonging to the same denomination as himself. What do these agitating controversialists mean by saying that a scheme like that puts the education of the country under the heel of the clergy - the clergy being in a minority of one to six among the managers, the lay managers being five in number - and the managers not having the control of secular education in the schools? The control of that secular education lies with the county council or borough council, and in the case of the borough council, at all events, the clergyman is by law prevented from having a seat upon it.Powers of Nonconformists increasedOne more audacious misstatement I must mention. It is that this Bill, in the words of some pamphleteer or other, rivets the denominational system upon this country. May I remind you that under the existing law, passed by a Liberal Administration, the denominational system is absolutely riveted on those places where the denominationalists have provided adequate school accommodation for the children in the district? The borough council or the county council, or any other popularly elected body you please, is powerless. They cannot build a school to suit the Nonconformists. The Nonconformists are obliged to go, whether they like it or not, and in whatever number they may be, to the Church of England or the Wesleyan or the Roman Catholic school, as the case may be. I consider that that is a monstrous system. I believe it is depriving them of a liberty they should possess; and that liberty will be given them by this Bill. It will give to them the power which has never been theirs before - should the circumstances of their district require it, to build out of the rates, out of the public funds, a school which would suit those whom the voluntary and denominational schools and the district do not suit. And yet we are told that this Bill \u2018rivets denominationalism on the country.\u2019History repeating itselfThese charges are as cynical in substance as they are violent in language; but I take comfort to myself. At first I admit I was rather disheartened that such misunderstanding should occur among an intelligent population, but I have looked back upon the history of the Act of 1870, and I take comfort. That Act is now quoted by the militant Nonconformists as the great palladium of their liberties, as the great gift of a Liberal Government to them; but I find that when the Act of 1870 was passed the self-same epithets of which I have been the special recipient were put at the disposal of Mr. Forster, and that he, then the colleague of Mr. Gladstone responsible for that Bill, was abused by the same people and in the same terms. He was opposed by the same methods, the same demonstrations, the same banners, the same threats not to pay rates, and by the same abuse that is now showered upon us in such profusion at the present moment. I saw the other day a piece of doggerel which, I believe, was sung to a hymn tune at the recent great gathering near Leeds. Its author, I believe, was the secretary of the Northern Counties Education League. I do not know whether it is more remarkable as poetry or as history, but as history I observe that it associates together as the givers of free education to the people men who were violently opposed to the Act of 1870, which it praises. Let me parenthetically remark that it was the Conservatives who gave free education. That is not what I want to dwell upon. What I desire to point out is that this historian-poet now seems to think that the Act of 1870 was the joint and harmonious work of a body of statesmen who, as a matter of fact, differed violently upon it. This gives me great hopes for the future; and I believe that when 20 years hence - let us say in 1922 - some future poet, of a similar calibre, shall hymn the Nonconformist view of education, I shall be found associated with perhaps Mr. Lloyd-George as one of the authors of that great and Nonconformist educational reform known as the Education Bill of 1902.The aims of the agitatorsWhat are these men aiming at? I am not talking now of the friends, perhaps the critical friends, but still the friends of the Bill. I am not talking now of the conscientious Nonconformist of whom I spoke just now. I am talking of the political agitators. What is it that they want? If they really and genuinely wanted the Nonconformist grievances remedied, would not they hail with acclamation a Bill which deals with so many of the real difficulties under which they labour? Would they not hail a Bill, for example, which gives, what is not now given, a real opportunity for Nonconformist teachers to be trained? Would they not hail a Bill which, according to the promises which I have made on behalf of my colleagues in the House of Commons will give to pupil teachers, Nonconformist pupil teachers, opportunities which at present in the rural districts they do not possess, and which in the existing state of the law they cannot acquire? Would they not hail a Bill which deals - which, as I have indicated, the Government desire it should deal - with what are called \u2018single-school areas\u2019 in the country where there is but one school and that a Church school, to which the children of all denomi­nations are obliged to go? Would they not hail with acclamation a Bill which enables them for the first time in our history to build out of public funds a school according to their own views, and, if you will, their own prejudices even in those places where at the present time all necessary accommo­dation is provided by schools belonging to one or other of the denominations? So much for the Nonconformist grievance. Again, if they sincerely desire to do away with that clerical influence about which they talk so much, about which they raise so many spectres, would they not be the first to hail with acclamation a measure which, whatever else can be said of it, certainly ought to earn this tribute of praise, that it is a great measure for giving the laity their full share in the education of the country? If they really believed that their children were being perverted - I know not into what paths, what religious paths or by-paths - would they not hail a measure which prevents any clerical eccentricity, and which puts it in the power of laymen, if need be, to regulate those matters connected with the education of the children of which complaint has been occasionally made? And, above all, if education be their object, ought they not to hail with pleasure a Bill which gives all the benefits which I described earlier in my speech in respect of the proper organisa­tion and unification of national education? Ought they not to hail a measure which from the highest to the lowest step in the educational ladder will co-ordinate and will arrange and will provide that no working man shall send his child to an ill-equipped school, which will provide that no working man with a child of really superior attainments shall be debarred from making his way through one grade to another of higher education until he has fulfilled his natural destiny? Would they not hail with pleasure a scheme which will give to the people of this country an absolute unlimited complete control over secular education in all public elementary schools?Their objects - political, not educationalI do not believe those questions can be answered. The real truth is that these agitators are not animated either by a desire to diminish Nonconformist grievances, or by a desire to minimise clerical influence, or by a desire to improve education. Their objects are political. What they wish is first to turn out the present Government, a relatively unimpor­tant matter; but they wish in the second place - and they avow it - to avoid any such reform of our educational system as shall save the voluntary schools from slow and gradual extinction. What does that mean? Let us suppose they defeat this Bill, and with the Bill the Government, and then some kind of hybrid party comes in to take our places. Are they going to try a reform of education? Not they! If this Bill be rejected I see no hope, during my lifetime at all events, of a great educational reform. I do not believe these agitators desire it. They wish to see the difficulty of raising subscriptions grow and grow, and, with the growth of the difficulty, the voluntary schools one by one extinguished like lamps at the end of a feast, in order that when that happy consummation is reached they may have what they call a national system of education. That means that for 20 years or more you are going to have the voluntary schools - more than half the schools in the kingdom - starved, that for 20 years and more the children of the working men in this country are in a large number of cases to have an inferior education. A gentleman in the audience says that there will be Board schools for them to go to. But how, under the existing law, are you going to get Board schools in those places until the voluntary schools are extinguished, and how are you going to extinguish the voluntary schools?The education of the children at stakeThe slow and gradual extinction of the voluntary schools means the degradation of education during the whole time it lasts, and when it is accomplished - if it ever is to be accom­plished - then it means an enormous and quite unnecessary burden thrown upon the rates, and, what is far worse, a perennial religious controversy, dividing all men, sundering all parties, embittering all the relations of life, until those who sincerely believe that the purely undenominational educa­tion of Board schools is not what they want for their children can induce a Government to give them what they legitimately desire. Is that an idea which we should tolerate? For my own part, I think we have reached a point in the educational history of this country which is of capital and paramount importance. I am not going to dwell upon the consequences to our party or to the Govern­ment of any defeat of this measure. I am not going to ask you to consider the painful silence of friends, the ill-concealed contempt of enemies which would follow upon the abandonment of any plan so long thought out, so earnestly supported as this one. It is on no party or political ground that I appeal to this vast assembly. I tell you there are at stake issues more important than the fortunes of any political party, be it what it may. There is at stake the education of your children for a generation. And if for that time we - I mean the members of the House of Commons, the majority of the members in the House of Commons - it we hesitate either through a desire to avoid a little extra trouble, or through the fear of a few loud-mouthed speeches or men­dacious pamphleteers, to do our duty and carry through this great reform, then I say we shall receive the contempt of the parents of the children living and to be born, for the next generation, and that contempt which we shall receive we shall most justly and richly have earned. [1] The Cowper-Temple Clause (Section 14 of the Act of 1870) provides that in schools built out of the rates no religious catechism or religious formulary distinctive of any particular denomination shall be used. There is no restriction of this kind upon the Board Schools in Scotland.

aVMy Lord Derby, ladies and gentlemen, I mean to talk to you tonight upon one subject, and one subject alone, not because there are not many other topics of deep interest to this nation on which I should like to address you, but because I am well aware that you first want to hear what I have to say upon the subject of tariff reform.  (Hear, hear.)  And if that subject is to be dealt with at all, it had better not be limited by the introduction of other alien themes.  Now, ladies and gentlemen, this is not a new subject; it is not a new subject in this hall, it is not a new subject discussed by the Conservative Association.  On the contrary, all who will look back over the records of this great association, drawn from every part of England, whom I now have the honour to address \u2013 all, I say, who will study these records may convince themselves that the subject of tariff reform has never been absent, or but rarely absent, from your deliberations.  At all events, within the limits of my political recollection there have been varieties of opinion held upon this subject within the limits of one united Party.The Rise of Tariff ReformWhat is it, ladies and gentlemen, which has suddenly brought this topic \u2013 I am sorry my voice is not all I could wish \u2013 (cheers) \u2013 what has suddenly brought this subject, often before you previously, into the exceptional prominence which it now holds.  There are those who would attribute this new importance which it has acquired to a great speech delivered by a great man \u2013 (cheers) \u2013 in the month, I think it was, of May last.  But, after all, it was not in May last that Mr. Chamberlain \u2013 (loud cheers) \u2013 not in May last \u2013 Mr. Chamberlain first uttered sentiments which he there expressed with such burning eloquence, and something more is required to account for a phenomenon unparalleled in the political experience of any man whom I am now addressing.  What, then, is the reason why tariff reform has suddenly come so much to the front.  I attribute it to more than one cause.  In the first place, remember that the late war has brought us into closer and more conscious touch with that great Colonial Empire, of which this country is the centre.  Remember, also, that the Prime Ministers and representatives of those Colonies brought before this country and the Empire, in the most categorical and explicit terms, the question of tariff reform in connection with our Colonial Empire.  And, remember, also, that there has been for some time past \u2013 long, indeed, before the recent developments of this tariff controversy \u2013 there has been a growing uneasiness as to the condition of British trade in its relation to the trade of the world.  (Cheers.)Growing UneasinessIf you want to have evidence of that fact, don\u2019t look at the speeches that have been delivered since tariff reform came to the front.  Look at the speeches delivered before that epoch, then you will have some impartial test, some undoubted guide as to the opinions held on this subject; and if you look at the speeches, the papers, the pamphlets, and the articles written on the subject of technical education, written on the necessity of meeting foreign competition by increased efforts in this country \u2013 a movement which I heartily sympathise with \u2013 (hear, hear) \u2013 and which I have in my way to the best of my ability, done my best to promote \u2013 (cheers) \u2013 if, I say, you look at those speeches, delivered by men of all shades of opinion, you will see that I am not exaggerating when I say that there has been or some years past a feeling of growing uneasiness as to the industrial place of Great Britain among the industrial nations of the world.  (Hear, hear, and cheers.)  Therefore, when Mr. Chamberlain made his speech, the speech no doubt to which we date back \u2013 and naturally date back \u2013 this particular movement; the speech itself would have had no effect comparable to that which was actually produced had it not fallen on ground prepared for it by circumstances \u2013 (cheers); had it not dealt with a problem that every man conscientiously or unconscientiously began to put to himself.  Now, that feeling was greatly intensified by what occurred in relation to Canada\u2019s Imperial effort to give preferential treatment to this country.  (Cheers.)  You all have the particulars of that incident in your mind, how Canada gave preferential treatment to our manufactures, and how thereupon Canada was threatened by at least one foreign Power with some species of retaliation for the effort she had made.  That brought home, I am convinced, to many minds the consciousness of our helplessness under our existing tariff system to deal with a situation of that kind.Tariff to Meet TariffYou can\u2019t go to war over tariff questions.  Tariff attacks can only be met by tariff replies.  (Loud cheers.)  And I think every Englishman felt, when he heard that there was some danger lest that great Colony should be penalised for her efforts after closer Imperial union; every Englishman, I say, felt that we were helpless indeed, under our existing tariff system, to meet with a situation so unexpected and so dangerous \u2013 (cheers); and that feeling of helplessness has not been diminished by a survey of the commercial history of the world during the last two generations. Sixty years have passed, or nearly 60 years, since the greatest, or at all events, the most notorious step was taken in the direction of tariff reform in this country, in the great epoch between 1841 and 1846.  Those sixty years have been filled with refutations of the prophecies made by the great tariff reformers.  (Hear, hear.)  I am not going to say a word against those tariff reforms.  I believe them to have been appropriate, and indeed necessary, at the time they were made.  (Hear, hear.)  But the time they were made is very different from the time in which we live \u2013 (cheers) \u2013 and every year which has passed, at all events in the latter half of that sixty years, during the generation of which we in this room have some personal recollection, is a contradiction of all the hopes, all the aspirations, and all the prophecies which then filled the mouths and the minds of men.  (Hear, hear.)Cobden\u2019s PropheciesI am never one of those who attack Mr. Cobden because he has made a great many prophecies which have been falsified.  Any of us who are rash enough to make prophecies, and are famous enough to have those prophecies recorded, are pretty sure sixty years hence to find ourselves very much in Mr. Cobden\u2019s position.  At all events, if he was unfortunate, he was only a little more unfortunate than the rest of his fellow creatures.  (Laughter.)  The observations I have to make upon these prophecies is not by way of criticism of Mr. Cobden, but, if criticism at all, of Mr. Cobden\u2019s followers; because he laid down, or he is supposed to be responsible for laying down, a certain doctrine of fiscal policy adapted to the world in which he lived - adapted to the world which he thought he had the right to foresee; but not adapted to the world in every respect, at all events, in which we at this time live.  (Cheers.)  What was Mr. Cobden\u2019s ideal?  No one will deny that he was a patriot, but I think few who have studied his life and writings will pretend that the sentiment of nationality had any large place in his philosophy of politics.  He looked forward to a world in which national divisions might indeed remain, but their emphasis would be largely diminished, if not wholly effaced, in which the divisions between nations would in no sense correspond with fiscal or commercial divisions, in which Free Trade would have swept asunder altogether all rivalry between men of different race, of different creed, and of different political institutions, in which the world would commercially be one without artificial barriers, and in which production would follow its natural line, and in which international manufactures would take, not a competitive, but a co-operative shape.  That was his ideal, and he drew from it the conclusion that upon a world thus industrially organised, that in such a world war would be a practical impossibility; that nation would be so linked to nation by commercial and financial ties, it would be impossible for either national ambition, or for national vanity, to break the great peace which was to brood over the face of the world.  Who shall deny that that ideal had in it elements of great nobility?  Not I, for one.  But that ideal world is not the world in which we live.Face the Actual FactsIt is not merely \u2013 and let th\u000a\u000ais be noted, for it is important \u2013 it is not merely that Protection has survived this relic, this barbarous relic, as Mr. Cobden would have thought of a past time; it is not merely that nation is still divided from nation by political and racial peculiarities.  The actual facts are far stronger and more significant than that.  What has happened is that the sentiment of nationality has received an accretion of strength since that time of which no man then living can have dreamed for a moment, and that contemporaneously with this growing sentiment of nationality we have found Protection in foreign countries, not holding on as the creed of an obscurantist minority, but growing in strength day by day, and day by day more and more separating the nations commercially from one another.  I regret it.  I regret it.  I think it is a matter of profound regret, but, after all, we have to take account of the facts of the world in which we are living, and neither an individual nor a nation can venture, with any prospect of felicity or success, to act as though he lived in an ideal world, and not in the world which actually, and, as a matter of fact, surrounds him.  (Hear, hear, and cheers.)  Well, I am afraid that in these years we have too much been in the position of dreamers, confident in the beauty and the virtue of our own ideal, refusing to see that it was not conformed to by our neighbours or the world with which we had to deal; and the result is that we have watched for 50 years, without saying a word, or making a sign; we have watched the wall of hostile tariffs growing up, dividing nation from nation, and dividing us from the Protective nations of the world.  (Hear, hear.)  And we have seen our own Colonies, our own flesh and blood, the very sinews of the Empire that is to be \u2013 (cheers) \u2013 building up one vested interest after another, with a system of Protection which, when it reaches its logical and its natural conclusion, will have made it as hard for us, their Mother Country \u2013 pledged to defend them, bound to them by every tie of affection and regard \u2013 it will make it as hard for us to export the results of our industry, enterprise, and capital, as we now find it to export those results to America, or to other Protective countries.  I don\u2019t know whether there is anybody who has faced these facts in their integrity, who can look at them with indifference.  But the fact remains that for the whole period of the lifetime of any man I am now addressing, we have done nothing whatever, either in regard to foreign markets or in regard to our own Colonies, to hinder a state of things so absolutely inconsistent with Free Trade as Mr. Cobden understood it.  (Cheers.)Cobden\u2019s French TreatyI ought, however, to make one exception.  I have said that no effort has been made.  That I believe to be, in strictness, incorrect.  One effort, one great effort, and in its measure one successful effort, was made, and it was made by Mr. Cobden himself.  I allude to the famous commercial Treaty with France negotiated in 1859, and brought to a successful issue in 1860; and when I consider the history of that treaty I ask myself whether Mr. Cobden was indeed a Cobdenite.  (Hear, hear, and laughter.)  What was the essence of the treaty of 1860?  We were then in process of completing that great series of reforms \u2013 for which I may incidentally remark it was Tory and Conservative statesmen chiefly, who obtained the credit for that great system of reform which did so much for English commerce, and set so good an example to the world.  In 1859 there were certain taxes still in existence which the then Chancellor of the Exchequer and the financial authorities of the day thought might well be repealed, but for the repeal of which they desired to obtain from the French \u2013 at the time perhaps the most Protectionist nation with whom we had large dealings \u2013 they wished to obtain from the French Government some concessions in the direction of free exchange of goods.  Now I want to put to you this question; the duties which were promised to the French Government as a consideration for some diminution in their Protective tariffs were, as I have told you, duties to which no value was attached, but the contrary, by the British Exchequer.Retaliatory Taxes JustifiedWhen Mr. Cobden negotiated that treaty, he and those who sent him, must either have been resolved to keep on those duties if the treaty failed, or they must have been resolved to give them up in any case.  If the latter \u2013 if they were determined to give up those duties which on their merits they desired to repeal, then they were asking from the French Government consideration without value received.  And the most complimentary epithet that I can imagine for a diplomatic transaction of that kind is that it was extremely dexterous.  (Laughter.)  The epithets that I should be inclined to apply are of a less complimentary description.  (Renewed laughter.)  But I do not think that those less complimentary epithets are deserved.  I believe that Mr. Cobden, who was the emissary, and Mr. Gladstone, who was the Chancellor of the Exchequer, when they were dealing with the French Government of the day, did not mean to indulge in these over-dexterous tactics, but they did say to them, and meant to say to them, \u2018If you will give us increased facilities for our exports, we will remit these taxes; if you will not give us increased facilities we will retain these taxes.\u2019  I think that is the only interpretation I can put, consistently with the honour of the persons concerned, upon that great commercial transaction.  But if so, then in the opinion of Mr. Gladstone and Mr. Cobden in 1859 and 1860, it was legitimate to keep on taxes which would have been from a purely Treasury and Revenue point of view, illegitimate, in order to put pressure upon a foreign Government to relax theirs.Self-Complacent IndifferenceThere is no economical distinction.  There may be a distinction from the point of view of practical difficulty, but there is absolutely no economical distinction whatever between keeping on a tax for diplomatic purpose which you would otherwise repeal, and putting on a tax which you would otherwise not have put on for carrying out the same objects.  (Cheers.)  I do not know, ladies and gentlemen, whether this point has ever been dealt with by the Cobden Club.  (Laughter.)  If not, I respectfully commend it to their attention.  Well that, so far as I know is one exception in all these years, the one effective exception of our attitude to a somewhat self-complacent indifference to the tariff proceedings of our great commercial friends and rivals, and the tariff proceedings of our own Colonies.  I don\u2019t think it is to our credit.  (Hear, hear.)  And I confess that when I hear criticisms \u2013 criticisms in which I sympathise, taken by themselves \u2013 when I hear criticisms upon the American and the German policy, which has caused those great industrial nations to accompany their marvellous commercial expansion with Protective duties, which must have thrown a most heavy burden upon the consumer, I feel that they have a retort to which I, at least, have no reply.  They may well say to us that, although they have been thus Protectionist, at all events within the limits of their own country they have established permanent Free Trade.  And at this moment, within the circuit of the German Empire, and within the vast ambit of the American Commonwealth, all duty, all restriction upon Free Trade, everything which can hamper production, everything which can limit the increase of wealth, has been abolished by their patriotism and their foresight, and they may well ask whether we in the British Empire can point to a similar picture, and whether at this moment that Free Trade of which we talk so much, and of which we boast so justly, is a Free Trade extending beyond the limits of the four seas, and whether it even includes those great self-governing Colonies which we proudly boast are to be the great buttresses of our Empire in the future.  (Cheers.)Sufferings under Free TradeI take it, ladies and gentlemen, that it is quite impossible for any man to say, I know it is quite impossible for any Free Trader to say that we have not suffered deeply and profoundly by foreign tariffs in this country.  (Hear, hear.)  Free Trade is indeed an empty name, and a vain farce, if, in fact, foreign nations are setting themselves to work to divert our industries into channels into which they never would have naturally flowed, to exclude our manufactures from their markets, to limit as far as they can the international play of supply and demand \u2013 I say Free Trade is indeed a farce if those things do not produce an evil effect, not merely upon the country which imposes Protective duties, but on the Free Trade country \u2013 and there is but one \u2013 (cheers) \u2013 which has to endeavour to the best of its ability to pierce them.  And I do not believe that the evil of foreign Protective tariffs is limited to their mere exclusion of our products from their markets.  There has been a development of which Mr. Cobden and Mr. Cobden\u2019s contemporaries never dreamed, a development of the trust system under the protection of those tariffs which inflicts an injury upon the capital, and still more upon the workmen \u2013 (hear, hear) \u2013 of these islands.  The phenomenon is so new that I dare scarce venture to prophesy what developments it is likely to take, whether it is going to expand into a great national danger, or whether it is going to be limited to the evils which I fear it has already inflicted; but of this you may be absolutely sure, that in the combination, that in the alliance of trusts and tariffs, there is a danger to the capital, to the enterprise of this country, which reacts, not mainly, not principally, upon the capitalist, for he is always at liberty to go to those happier regions where his industry will be looked after, but will fall with the heaviest weight upon the artisan and labouring classes of this country \u2013 (cheers) \u2013 who have no methods, or no methods known to me, by which they are capable of protecting their interests against such a calamity.  (Hear, hear.)    No Cure, But Only a PalliativeNow, if I have rightly described the dangers, and the evils from which we suffer, you have a right to ask me whether I know of a cure.  (Cheers.)  My answer, I am afraid, will be a disappointing one.  I know of no cure; but I do know of a palliation.  (Cheers.)  I am not going to stand up here on an occasion when it is my duty to advise the great Party of which, for the moment, I am the chief \u2013 (cheers) \u2013 it is not, I say, my duty to draw an imaginary picture of the blessings to follow from the remedy, or from any remedy which I have to propose.  I know of no cure; the ill has gone too far.  You will not get the great commercial nations of the world to abandon Protection.  You will not get, I fear, our great self-governing Colonies to retrace all the steps which we have, without remonstrance, permitted them to take.  I therefore say there is no complete cure of the evils that I have described.  But I think there is a palliation, and it is that palliation which I am here to recommend to you today.  (Cheers.)  Remember what the situation is which I have endeavoured to describe to you.  Mr. Cobden supposed that the world was going to be a Free Trade world, in which trade would follow its natural courses, unhampered by the devices of statesmen and politicians, untouched by the influence of international treaties.  That is what he hoped.  That is what he believed.  What, in fact, we have got to deal with is a world in which these international commercial relations are regulated entirely by treaty, and are governed entirely by the arrangements come to between the different nations concerned.An Impossible PositionIt is common sense that in a world which is commercially governed by treaty we, the greatest commercial nation of all, should come forward and say, \u2018We will endeavour to arrange treaties with you.  We have nothing to give you \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 we have nothing to withhold from you.  We throw ourselves upon your mercy, and upon your consideration.  (Renewed laughter.)  Remember, please remember, how good we are to your commerce, how we throw no impediments in its way, how we do all we can for you, and please don\u2019t forget us when you are making your next treaty.\u2019  (Laughter.)  Well, well, I am incapable of believing that a nation which deprives itself of its power of bargaining is a nation which is likely to make very good bargains.  I have been asked by friends of mine whether there really is any ground for believing that we should make better bargains if we had the freedom of negotiation which I ask you to give us.  (Loud cheers.)  I confess that the very question seems to me to show that the questioner lives in a world of economic phantasmagoria, with no relation whatever to the realities in which, fortunately or unfortunately, our lot is cast.  Are commercial bargains different from every other bargain?  Are negotiations between nations, which have to deal with duties upon manufactured goods \u2013 are they different in essence and in character from other negotiations carried on for other purposes?  (Voices: No.)  And did any man ever hear of a country going into negotiations for these other purposes, which ever came out of those negotiations with a trace of success, unless they had in the course of those negotiations something which they could offer, and something which in case of necessity they might withhold?  (Cheers.)Freedom of Negotiation: Mr. Balfour\u2019s DemandsMy request, therefore, to you tonight is the fundamental and essential request to which everything I have to say in the remainder of my speech is subsidiary and accidental \u2013 my fundamental request is that the people of this country should give to the Government of this country from whatever Party that Government may be drawn, that freedom of negotiation of which we have been deprived, not by the force of circumstances, not by the action of overmastering forces, not by the pressure of foreign Powers, but by something which I can only describe as our own pedantry and our own self-conceit.  (Cheers.  Voice: \u2018How can we give you that power?\u2019)  I have stated the fundamental proposition, which I wish to affirm, but I agree with my friend opposite that it is necessary for me, though it may not be interesting to you, that I should answer some questions which will inevitably be asked as to the manner in which that freedom for which I ask is going to be used.  (Hear, hear.)  I would, however, observe that that question is often put in a manner which I regard as highly unreasonable.  I suppose there is not a man in this room who denies that we ought to have a fleet, a navy, but am I, or any other Minister standing in this place, am I to tell you how that navy is to be used in 1904, 1905, 1906, or 1907?  (Cheers.)  That is a kind of prophecy which neither I nor any other man can make.  (Hear, hear.)  All you can say is this: That it is absolutely necessary for this country to have at its command, in case of need, a great navy.  (Cheers.)  And it is necessary, though I admit less necessary, but it is necessary in my judgement, that this country should also have at its command those instruments of negotiation for which in general terms I have already pleaded.  (Cheers.)  But though I think the question is thus put very often in a most unreasonable fashion, I am perfectly ready to answer it, so far as in my judgement it can be answered, by hypothesis and prophecy.  Well, let it be noted that I have brought before your attention two separate aspects of one great problem.  I have pointed out to you that we have allowed, so to speak, the world to slide into this system of high Protective duties against this country without effort and without remonstrance, but that world which has thus acted partly consists of our own Colonies, our self-governing Dependencies, who have fiscal, and must always retain fiscal autonomy, and partly it consists of foreign nations properly so-called.A Colonial and a Foreign ProblemThe problem connected with the two is evidently a distinct problem, though it arises from the same difficulty, and springs from the same root.  And as regards the first of those, our relations with our Colonies, let me say I think we have in this country been strangely blind, and strangely dull \u2013 (hear, hear) \u2013 to the abnormal and anomalous situation in which the British Empire is placed in these fiscal matters.  You will find many cases in which fiscal union has been the prelude to that closer, and more intimate union, which is the basis of national strength.  (Hear, hear.)  I may mention as a Scotsman \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 the case of England and Scotland.  If any of you will consult your histories you will see that what reconciled the smaller kingdom to union with the greater kingdom was no love of being under a British Parliament, but the sense that it was absolutely necessary for national existence, or, at all events, for national prosperity \u2013 (hear, hear) \u2013 that England and Scotland should be fiscally one.  (Cheers.)  And that union, which began merely, so to speak, on a fiscal basis, has grown, as we all know, in a manner which has welded the two people together in an inseparable unity, which it will not be given to any hostile force ever to divorce.  (Cheers.)  If I wished to load my speech with historical illustrations, I might, of course, point to the case of Germany \u2013 different in many respects, but resembling the case of Scotland in this respect, that the fiscal union began before that political union, which has been the greatest incident in modern European history.  (Hear, hear.)  Well, we have been content apparently, so far as our Empire is concerned, to see divisions, fiscal divisions, growing with our growth, and strengthening with our strength, and at the very moment that the population and the wealth of our Colonies are increasing, and in other respects the sentiment of a common interest of a common blood, and of common institutions is gaining strength, at the very moment I say we see these fiscal divisions growing up, of which no man can prophesy the ultimate result, but which I venture to say no man of sober judgement or any knowledge of history can contemplate without disquiet.  (Cheers.)  Well, that is the first branch of the problem.  I am disposed to say that in many respects it is the most important branch, and I have sorrowfully to admit that it is also the most difficult branch.  And for this reason.  The evil has been allowed to grow, both by us and by our Colonies, to a point in which it is probably incapable of any complete solution, and in which even an attempted solution, so far as I am able to see, would involve taxation of food in this country.Impossibility of Taxing FoodNow, I do not think the public opinion is ripe in this country for the taxation of food.  (Hear, hear.)  I have given the matter my most earnest consideration, and this is the conclusion at which I have arrived.  Of course, all must admit - I don\u2019t care what their opinions are - all must admit that the taxation of food - indeed, every kind of taxation, is in itself an evil. (Hear, hear.)  But I think that the evil of the taxation of food, so long as that taxation is kept within very narrow limits \u2013 I want to tell the whole truth to this great audience \u2013 the evil of taxation on food, kept within these narrow limits has been exaggerated beyond what reason and logic justify.  But I think, nevertheless, that for historic reasons that feeling, though it does go beyond what logic and reason seem to justify is one of those ingrained \u2013 perhaps ingrained means necessarily permanent \u2013 but is one of those sentiments born of the history of a people, of which it is absolutely necessary that every practical statesman should take account, and of which I do take account, and which I believe you cannot traverse with impunity.  And the reason is not far to seek.  Compare the case of France and of England.  In France at this moment it would be impossible for any legislator to attempt to make a breach in that theoretical equality which for historic reasons, burned into them by the great struggle of the French Revolution, every Frenchman believes in, or most Frenchmen believe in, as an immutable creed.  An Englishman cares little for speculative equality, what he wants is liberty.  (Hear, hear.)  Very well.  The Frenchman, however, is tolerant to a degree incredible among us to any taxation of food, all his food.  You remember it is a country governed under as democratic a government as our own, and taxation on food is part of their normal system, and they are not content with having taxation on food for what we should call national and Imperial purposes, but they pay what we pay out of our rates very largely by taxation on food.  (Hear, hear.)  Very well.  Now take the case of England.  In England we had no French Revolution.  There is not burnt into us by our historic experience any of the feelings which animate the French on the subject of equality; but the memory of the misery endured by our working classes, and especially by the agricultural labourer, in the days when wheat was at 70s., 80s., or 100s. per quarter, has become associated, though I admit with very little historic propriety, but is has become associated with the question of the abolition of the corn tax.  It burnt into the historic imagination of the people; it cannot be eliminated by the best logic, the most conclusive reasoning, or the most eloquent speeches.  (Hear, hear.)  I am therefore distinctly of opinion \u2013 I am speaking here as one who is bound to give advice to a great Party on the policy which they should regard as their official policy \u2013 (hear, hear) \u2013 I am bound to give you, as the best results of my reflection, to ask you to adopt the conclusion that a tax on food is not \u2013 with the public opinion in the state in which it is \u2013 within the limits of practical politics.  (Cheers.)  So much for the Colonial branch of the question.A Tariff War Not IntendedNow you will ask me how I mean to carry out, or how I contemplate should be carried out, that liberty of negotiation for which I ask in respect of foreign countries.  Well, there are a great many people who seem to think that if we ask for liberty of negotiation in respect of tariffs with foreign countries, we mean to enter into a general tariff war with the whole world.  No such idea, no such expectation, is entertained at all events by myself.  (Hear, hear.)  I don\u2019t know whether most of you have sufficiently followed the practice of foreign countries in their tariff negotiations.  What they commonly do, or what they often do, is to have what they call a combative tariff, a very high tariff placed upon all foreign goods, which they then proceed to reduce for the benefit of other nations, who give them something in return.  So that they start with an immense general import duty on all foreign goods, which they reduce for consideration received.  (Laughter.)I contemplate no such procedure with regard to this country.  I think it would involve far too great a disturbance of our habits, of our practice and of our trade.  But I do think that we might with advantage proceed from the other end, and, if it suited us, and if we thought we could do it without disadvantage to ourselves, which, after all, is the guiding policy in these matters \u2013 (hear, hear) \u2013 we might inform any foreign country who we thought were treating us with outrageous unfairness that unless they modified their policy to our advantage, we should feel ourselves compelled to take this or that step in regard to their exports to our country.  (Cheers.)  Now, I do not for a moment suggest that foreign countries are animated by a desire to destroy our trade simpliciter; what they want to do is to improve their trade at our expense, which is perhaps rather a different thing.  (Cheers, and laughter.)  But, in any case, are you not trying them too high by your present system?  Is it fair, supposing they want to do us justice \u2013 let us assume that \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 is it fair to go to their negotiators and say, \u2018Well, we have nothing to give you; we cannot hurt you.  Our principles are such that you may kick us round the room, and we will only say it is according to principle, but please treat us as well as you can.\u2019  (Great laughter.)  Now, I do not think that is fair on the foreign negotiator, and I think he will be greatly helped to do us justice if he knows that behind our requests for justice  there is a method of exacting it.  (Loud cheers.)  Now, ladies and gentlemen, I have spoken at an outrageous length \u2013 (\u2018Go on\u2019) \u2013 but I have been most anxious to be perfectly clear and perfectly explicit as to the advice I want to give you, and, if I may say so, through you the country at this moment. You will admit I have not clouded my statement by any verbal rhetoric or attempt at eloquent declamation.  I have tried to give you the bare outlines of rather a hard and difficult argument.Mr. Balfour\u2019s Self-CatechismBut, in order that I may be absolutely beyond reproach, and that no man will be able to say tomorrow or hereafter, that I have been obscure, in order that every misunderstanding shall be apparently and obviously a wilful misunderstanding, I will for one moment \u2013 and it shall only be a moment \u2013 conceive myself asked certain questions by this audience.  It is not in accordance with procedure on this occasion, as it is during a General Election, that there should be self-appointed questioners upon the burning topics of the day.  May I erect myself for the moment, on your behalf, into a questioner, and may I put questions to myself?  (Hear, hear, and laughter.)  Very well.  The first question I put to myself is this.  I can imagine the gentleman who interrupted me \u2013 (a laugh) \u2013 most courteously, most courteously, about twenty minutes ago \u2013 I can imagine him putting this question.  He may say: \u2018Do you mean to come forward and ask the country to reverse the verdict arrived at in the great lawsuit between Free Trade and Protection in 1845 and 1846?\u2019  My answer is simple and plain.  I regard the controversy of 1846 as of no interest whatever to us now \u2013 (cheers) \u2013 except simply from a historical point of view.  I care no more for the quarrel between Mr. Cobden and his opponents than I do about the Bagarian controversy, which I expect nobody in my audience has ever heard of.  All that was appropriate to 1845 and 1846, but it is utterly inappropriate to 1903 and 1904.  (Cheers.)  Our grandfathers fought out their battles as men, and with a view to the actual situation of the world in which they lived.  Let us in that respect imitate their example, and let us not be misled by musty debates, living enough to those who took part in them, but which are as dead to us as ours will be to our grandsons 60 years hence.  (Hear, hear.)  That is the first question I put.  The second question I have imagined being put to me is this, \u2018Do you desire to reverse \u2013 to alter fundamentally \u2013 the fiscal tradition which has prevailed during the last two generations?\u2019  Yes, I do.  (Loud cheers.)  And how, I may imagine my questioner going on, do you propose to alter that tradition.  I propose to alter it by asking the people of this country to reverse, to annul, to delete altogether from their maxims of public conduct the doctrine that you must never put on taxation except for revenue purposes.  (Hear, hear.)  I say distinctly that in my judgement the country ought never to have stood self-deprived of that liberty; that it ought publicly to resume in the face of Europe and the world that liberty of which it has deprived itself.  And though, of course, the liberty so resumed may be abused \u2013 I don\u2019t doubt it \u2013 it may get into incompetent hands \u2013 it should be resumed, and this country should again have what every other country in the world possesses, and that of which no other country in the world would think of depriving itself \u2013 the liberty of negotiating with something to negotiate with.  The next question I can imagine being asked of me is \u2018Why do you want to resume this liberty of negotiation seeing how well the country has prospered for all these years without it?\u2019  To that my reply is, I hope, explicit and distinct.  My object is to mitigate, so far as circumstances allow, the injury done to us by hostile tariffs.  (Hear, hear.)  Those hostile tariffs have inflicted upon us injury of a double kind.  (Hear, hear.)  They have divided one fragment of the Empire fiscally from the other.  They have diverted our industries into channels in which they would never naturally have flowed; they have restricted and hampered our export trade, and by restricting and hampering our export trade their effects have acted and reacted over the whole community \u2013 the community of consumers, and the community of producers for home consumption.  These are the evils.  In addition, the third of the evils is the insecurity which I fear some great branches of our industry suffer, and must suffer so long as we permit protective duties in combination with trusts to pour into this country at unnatural prices goods which, under a true system of Free Trade \u2013 under a system, I mean, in which every country produced according to its natural capacities \u2013 would never be able to compete and never be able to oust the industries of home origin.  (Cheers.)  Two other questions, and only two other questions, have to be asked.  \u2018Will the remedy you propose be complete?\u2019  To that I answer: It will not be complete, even if it could be tried in its integrity, and it cannot be tried in its integrity because I believe that the country will not tolerate the tax upon food.  And if the last question be asked me: \u2018Then do you think it is of any value?\u2019 - to that I reply with equal clearness, emphasis, and decision, undoubtedly it will be useful.  There have been plenty of occasions in the past, and believe me there will be plenty of occasions in the future, when a British Minister having to conduct a great commercial negotiation, will feel his hands strengthened, will feel that he is indeed able to represent the interests of the great country whose foreign affairs he has to manage.  If he can say to some other \u2013 if he can say to the Ministers of the country with whom he is negotiating, \u2018We don\u2019t ask you to reverse your commercial policy; we don\u2019t ask from you anything which is impossible, but common justice and common fair treatment we do ask, and if we don\u2019t get it, we will take our own measures.\u2019  (Cheers.)\u2018I Mean to Lead\u2019Now, my lords and gentlemen, I hope, at the risk of some length and some tedium \u2013 (\u2018No, no\u2019) \u2013 I have at all events avoided any kind of obscurity.  I have been asked to give a lead.  I think the request was a reasonable one.  A man who, however unworthy, is called upon to lead a Party must lead it \u2013 (cheers) \u2013 and so long as I am in that position I mean to lead it.  (Loud and prolonged cheers, and \u2018What about Joe?\u2019)  I have given this great topic my best thoughts, my most earnest consideration, and I am firmly convinced that the policy which I now recommend to the Party and to the country is not only in absolute harmony with all our best traditions \u2013 (hear, hear) \u2013 not only finds its precedents in the statements of all our greatest leaders, is not only in perfect conformity with the spirit of the great body which we here represent, but that also and beyond all that, it is the best which this country, depending as it does, and depending as it does solely, upon its commercial and manufacturing position in the world, it is the best which this country can adopt.  In that faith, in that belief, and with all earnestness of purpose, I recommend to your favourable consideration.  (Loud and prolonged cheering, during which Mr. Balfour resumed his seat, having spoken just an hour and 20 minutes.)
p186
aVLord Winchester, my Lords, ladies and gentle­men, I think your Chairman has tonight struck the right note in the few words which he has just addressed to you. It is by no will of mine that this great assembly coincides with a moment of national difficulty (hear, hear). Long ago was it arranged that the representatives of the Con­servative opinion throughout the country should meet here; long ago was it determined that Southampton should be the spot on which, for this year, the topic which interest us as citizens and as members of a great party (hear, hear) should be thrashed out and discussed. Ladies and gentlemen, since all the arrangements which have brought together within these walls the great gathering I am now addressing there have been events which have stirred to their depths the feelings of every section and every class of the community (hear, hear), every inhabitant of the United Kingdom, and every subject of his Majesty beyond the seas (cheers), all the great English speaking peoples of the world (cheers), and I think I may add the general sentiment of civilised Europe (cheers). Ladies and gentlemen, under such circumstances as these I should certainly be doing violence to any own sentiments of what is appropriate, and I think I should be doing violence to your senti­ments of what is appropriate, if I dragged into the larger issue thus suddenly opened up any question, however important it might be, which dealt with any subject on which Britons of all political creeds, however varying their opinions on other subjects, are not in hearty agreement. The Leader of the Opposition, speaking I think two nights ago, uttered sentiments worthy on this subject, worthy of that high place which he holds, and which the Leader of an Opposition must always hold in the political life of a free people (hear, hear). It is true that he felt him­self bound to go into a large number of highly controversial subjects, and I do not blame him for that. I do not see he had any alternative before him, but he would be the first, I think, to agree that this is not the time at which I can most conveniently or appropriately deal with his allegations, tempting as that field of political dialectics may be, I refrain from entering on, and, indeed, the only observations which I shall make in the few words that I am going to say to you tonight which can be regarded as having the smallest party reference whatever are these. My utterances on a certain great question have been received with as many commentaries as if I was a classic, and they have been subjected or wrested into as many different meanings as if they were inspired. I suggest, and it is only a suggestion I make, that no man in or out of this hall should judge of my writings or my speeches upon economic questions by seeing what other people say of them (hear, hear), but they should read them for themselves (applause), and if they do that I am confident they will find that they are neither obscure, nor difficult, nor inconsistent (hear, hear), but that they represent a well thought out body of ideas which may be right or may be wrong, but which at all events stand there for public criticism, and must be judged by themselves, and not by their self-appointed commentors. Gentlemen, I must apologise for having even for a moment lapsed from the programme I have laid out for myself with regard to what I have to say to you this evening. And let me begin what I have to say by telling you that I hope and believe that it is wholly of a favourable complexion (cheers). Had it so fallen out that this meeting had been fixed for last night instead of tonight I cer­tainly could not have dared to preface my re­marks with any observation of that character. I think I may now say without raising unduly hopes which are likely to be dashed that so far as I am able to forecast the future, the lament­able and deplorable tragedy which took place on the night of last Friday will not end in one of those great international struggles (cheers) which, though they may be now and again in the history of the world necessary incidents in the collision of great interest, always leave a deplorable mark behind them, and always have had the effect of retarding the great progress of humanity and civilisation. In order that I may explain exactly the situation in which we now stand perhaps you will allow me to begin with something in the nature of a truism, but a truism which we are constantly apt to forget. The truism is this - That bad as war is to the principals, to the nations engaged in it it never has been, it never can be, it never will be waged between two great Powers without causing suffering and risks far beyond the circle of the subjects of those Powers and neutrals for whose Powers and neutrals themselves never do, and never can escape from some of the collateral evils which the condition of hostilities inevitably brings in its train. In all the great wars in which we were engaged, in which we were the protagonists of the nineteenth century, the period when some of the most glorious naval and mili­tary memories go back, in the days of what is called the great war, think not for a moment that we were able to pr\u000a\u000aevent some of the suffer­ing to those who occupied the position of neutrals. But while that is the inevitable incident of war, and while it is the duty of the neutrals to understand that this cannot be wholly avoided, nonetheless is it one of the most urgent duties upon the belligerents themselves, a duty which they should never be inclined to forget, and never be permitted to forget. But it is their business to make the positi\u000a\u000aon of neutrals as onerous as is consistent with the due fact of warlike operations. We have striven, I mean the Government have striven, supported by the House of Commons, and supported, I believe, in this matter by the country (hear, hear). We have striven to do our duty as neutrals with strict impartiality (hear, hear). I do not deny that we have had our difficulties. I do not deny that such incidents as those referred to by your Chairman in his opening remarks, such incidents as the sinking of the Knight Commander, such incidents as the strange vagaries of the two ships of the volunteer fleet (laughter), such difficulties as have arisen from the definition of contraband of war. I do not say that they have not strained, and greatly strained, and greatly increased the difficulties we have found in maintaining, as we have consistently maintained, the position of neutrals during the period of this great struggle (hear, hear). Well, everybody has recognised that among the difficulties incident to a neutral position were the possibilities of interference with commerce by the belligerents. Who, until last Monday morning, ever contemplated that among the dangers which neutrals ran was that of being fired upon during the progress of their peaceful avocations? (Hear, hear) Who ever contemplated that among the risks neutrals ran was the risk of being sunk, and having damage done, and even of danger to life (hear, hear), such an incident as that which took place in midnight last Friday? Who contemplated, who thought it possible, and who that did contemplate it, thought such incidents were possible? (Hear, hear) I think myself that these feelings of universal horror, indignation, and surprise, which filled the hearts of the whole civilised world. I think the character of those emotions was largely increased by the fact that it came as a complete surprise. No human being ever thought such incidents possible but everybody thought that if they were possible that these things were too horrible to be repeated. Now when we first heard of this story on Monday morning there was but one account for us, and the world of what had taken place. The horrified and startled fishermen who crowded into Hull on Sunday afternoon were the bearers - the only bearers - of the message of the tragedy in the North Sea. The Russian Fleet had gone on silently (shame), had made no sign, and on that day at all events we had only one version of this lamentable incident, and that was the version supplied to us by the trawlers on the Dogger Bank. The day before yesterday - yesterday morning - the situation changed because for the first time we had a counter story, an alternative version supplied to the Russian Government by the Russian Admiral. In the story of our fishermen there was much tragedy; there was no romance (hear, hear, and laughter). In the story of the Russian Admiral I don\u2019t know that there was any tragedy; but I am driven to believe that there was much tragedy (hear, hear). Now, ladies and gentlemen, for a reason that you will ap­preciate presently, I should under ordinary circum­stances have avoided expressing an opinion upon this part of the subject, because it is to be made the subject of an impartial and International in­quiry (loud and prolonged applause); and strongly as I feel, and strongly as I think every inhabitant of these islands must feel instinctively and without argument that the two stories, absolutely con­tradictory as they are in every particular which of these two stories it is impossible to doubt which is the one substantially true (hear, hear) - there would be no expression of my opinion on the subject until it has been investigated, as it will be by the Coroner\u2019s inquest by a Board of Trade inquiry, which we shall conduct under special circumstances with the assistance, I hope, of repre­sentatives of the Russian Government, but with a court which we shall constitute with special care, consisting of men who are authorities, and investigated as it will be in the third place and above and beyond all by that International tribunal to which I have just referred. I should not have attempted to prejudge it but for this fact, that if the story of the Russian Admiral be accurate it really is an attack upon our National honour (hear, hear). It carries with it the inevitable implication that we have not been doing our duty as a neutral power (loud applause). Now we are, it is true, the allies of Japan (cheers), and bound to assist Japan in certain well-defined circumstances (hear, hear), but just as we should make it a point of honour, if the case contem­plated by that treaty should ever arise, to use our whole national power to fulfil our ob­ligations (hear, hear), so until that case arises it is a point of honour with this Government, as it would be a point of honour with any British Government, that our duty as neutrals should be scrupulously performed. Looked at from this point of view, what is the story which has been communicated by the Russian Admiral at Vigo to his chiefs at St. Petersburg (\u2018A lie\u2019). He tells us - he tells the world - that on Friday night he was suddenly attacked (laughter) by two torpedo boats (laughter), that he fired upon them, that he sank one of them (laughter), that the other was injured - I don\u2019t know what has happened to it since (laughter). He tells us, further, that the reason he did not remain to assist the fishermen whose boats had been sunk was that the fishermen showed themselves hostile (laughter), were accessories to the attack, and that the fishermen were guilty of complicity, and en­deavoured to pass through his lines (laughter). Several questions inevitably suggest themselves in this connection, with this account of the affair which I should not put to a British audience in ordinary circumstances because they are obvious, but which I think ought to be stated for the reason I have just given, on the present occasion. In the first place I should like to ask how fishing boats, how trawlers, with their nets down, which, as I need hardly tell the inhabitants of Southampton, are probably the least moveable of floating craft; how they could attempt to pass any lines or engage in any hostile operations is incredible on the face of it. In the second place I should like to ask something about these tor­pedo boats that made the sudden attack. The Russian fleet was 30 miles out of its course (hear, hear), when it went to the Dogger Bank. Thirty miles, I think, is the actual distance. It had every reason to know - because every seaman does know - that at the Dogger Bank you would in all probability find a large fleet of vessels engaged in the peaceful pursuit of trawling. I may be permitted - every seaman knows it, but to empha­sise that general statement, let me read one or two sentences which I have translated from the Russian official sailing directions. On page 13 of these sailing directions you will find these words: \u2018The inexhaustible quantity of fish, especially cod, on the Dogger Bank attracts hundreds of fishing boats, which renders navigation difficult, especially at night\u2019 (hear, hear), and you will find on page 142 a sentence which runs as fol­lows, the material part of it runs as follows: \u2018The Dogger Bank, which is always crowded with fishing boats\u2019 (applause). The Russian Admiral went 30 miles out of his course, and the place was crowded with fishing boats, and there he found lying in wait among these fishing boats two torpedo boats (laughter). Why did the commanders of those torpedo craft choose that particular station for preparing their attack upon the Russian fleet? Why did they, gentlemen, choose it, knowing the nature of the case involved publicity? The very fact that Dogger Bank is crowded with fishermen, and crowded with fishermen of all nationalities, would make such an operation absurd on the face of it; and if these mysterious craft wanted, as I presume they did, to conceal their very existence from the public eye, would they h\u000a\u000aave gone over the whole North Sea and chosen as the only spot open to them that where publicity was inevitable and certain. And, in the second place, if they had wanted to lie in wait for the Russian fleet, by what extraordinary powers of prevision did they foresee that the Russian fleet would go 30 miles out of its course? (laughter and cheers). I think myself justified in publicly expressing - in­deed, more than justified - required to express publicly my disbelief in the existence of these phantom Japanese ships, not merely because, in the opinion of an expert whom I have had the opportunity of consulting, the nearest Japanese ship of war is 14,000 miles away, but because, as I have said, if two Japanese torpedo craft are really hunting the North Sea, or were hunting the North Sea, till one of them was sunk, they must have a base (hear, hear), and unless the sugges­tion is that the base is France, or Holland, or other countries bordering on the North Sea, I presume it is believed by the Admiral - not, I am convinced, believed for a moment by the Russian Government - but it is evidently believed by the Admiral that we have been giving them, contrary to our duty, our plain duty as neutrals, been providing them with a base. It is pure fancy. A base in an island like Britain, where everyone that comes to our shores is scanned, her character interpreted, her nationality known, in a country where all this is public property, and where with all our merits we are not good at keeping a secret is it conceivable by the most hostile witness\u000a\u000a\u000athat we should, for I don\u2019t know how many days, weeks, or months, been harbouring Japanese sailors and Japanese ships of war without knowing it ourselves, without the Russians knowing it, or without its being dreamed of in any part of the civilised world. I enter my most emphatic protest, as a member of his Majesty\u2019s Government, which is responsible in these matters against the allegation which affects, as I think, our honour as neutrals (hear, hear). More on this point I do not say, because if the truth be, as I think it is, and as I know every man whom I am addressing thinks it is (hear, hear), that truth will, I hope, be made manifest and clear as noonday, when that inquiry which, as I think, in the most, statesmanlike manner the Czar welcomes (hear, hear), when that inquiry takes place. I have mentioned the Czar and the Russian Government. Let me say in this connection that I think it is but bare justice to them to say that they have not at any time underrated the gravity of the crisis or failed to do what they could to diminish it. Remember that the wheels of diplomacy move slowly, and I shall not be thought offensive if I say that perhaps the wheels of Russian diplomacy move specially slowly (laughter). At all events, there have been occasions when that opinion has been borne in upon us. But in this case re­member that the North Sea tragedy was known to nobody until Monday morning, and that with­out delay the Russian Government expressed their deep regret at the occurrence and promised ample compensation to those who had suffered (interrup­tion). Well, that is only part of the subject. I am quite aware of that, but I am coming to the other part. They also, even at the beginning, indicated that any wrongdoer in this matter ought to receive punishment (hear, hear); and in ordinary times I do not think that any special difficulty would have arisen. Whence did come the special difficulties of this case? The special difficulty in this case came from the fact that the fleet which had committed what we, at all events, in this country, must be permitted to call an outrage, was on its way illimitable. If it was done the wrongdoers were fleeing from Europe, and if they had witnesses to produce for their version of what has taken place, those wit­nesses were being carried with them far from the control of any court, national or international. That is the difficulty. That was one difficulty. Well I am glad to say that I think that difficulty has been got over (hear, hear). There was another difficulty. The other difficulty was this. The Parisian Admiral, if the accounts of his views which have appeared in many sources of information be at all correct, and perhaps they are not correct, has a theory of the rights and duties of a belligerent fleet as against neutrals which really make the high seas a place of public danger (hear, hear). He defends naturally enough the action which be took on Friday last in the North Sea. In his name views have been put forward which would seem to justify, in his view, a Russian fleet, or any belligerent fleet, firing at large on any ship, upon any errand, which came too near them (laughter) by night, or I suppose by day. Now we, as your Chairman has remarked, are the guardians of the maritime, are among other great nations guardians of the maritime which ought to bind civilised countries. We must be the first to admit that there are circumstances in the theatre of war in which it is inevitable that neutrals should be put to inconvenience, or if they be rash even to danger. I do not see that in the China seas for instance it is possible for a Japanese or Russian fleet to treat the ordinary commerce of the world as if war was not going on, but there should be the proviso that such powers must be used with the utmost discretion, and reckless or indifference to cruelty ought to be avoided by every man who has the interest of civilisation or of his own country at heart. But while we have to admit that there may be circumstances in certain theatres of war-like operations where the neutral must be conscious in his movements, are we to allow - can the civilised world allow for a moment that all channels of commerce from St. Petersburg to Vladivostok; that all oceans, the Pacific and the Atlantic, that all the narrow ways of commerce, like the English Channel or the Red Sea, that those situated thou­sands of miles from the theatre of military opera­tions; is the Admiral to pass unscathed, unchal­lenged, unpunished (\u2018No, no\u2019), if he uses his supposed rights - his supposed rights as a belligerent to the danger of the peaceful neutral carrying on his ordinary avocation? The Russian fleet, I am told, one portion of the Russian fleet, I think, are going down the West Coast of Africa, and the other through the Mediterranean to the Red Sea. I do not know whether - I am only supposing - the principles which seem to underlie the judgment of the Russian Admiral are carried into effect they may meet on some dark night in the solitude of the ocean some homecoming transport, or liner approaches within the magic distance, and the ship which once carried the lives of privileged neutrals is fired upon. The ship is sunk, like the torpedo boat, in the North Sea, and the fleet pur­sues its way, happy in the consciousness that it has destroyed another of its enemies. There is an entry at Lloyd\u2019s that such and such a ship has not returned, and has left no record; the waves close over the tragedy, nothing more is heard, or, indeed, in the circumstances which I have supposed - can be heard, and countless families are in mourning, or a British Regiment is wiped out of existence, or the sailor, who carries out an avocation dangerous enough itself, has found a new danger and an unexpected fate in the course of his perilous undertaking. Is that a position which it is possible for neutrals to tolerate? (\u2018No, no; never\u2019). A fleet animated by the policy; a fleet of commanders to whom that policy commends itself as the one which duty forces upon him is a fleet which would have to be hunted out of existence (loud applause). If civilised commerce is to pursue its way unimpeded - and I am glad to say that in those views the Russian Govern­ment agreed with us (hear, hear), that they take the view, as I understand, which I am sure com­mends itself to other civilised nations, and they are giving orders, or have given orders, which shall prevent a recurrence (loud applause) of the tragedy which has filled our hearts with sorrow, and, I think, the hearts of most, of all, of those who have heard of it at all with something ap­proaching indignation. Now, I have nearly done (\u2018Go on\u2019), because I have surveyed the case from the beginning to the end, and I have shown you what it is that the Government think we ought to obtain, and I have indicated to you that what they think they ought to obtain we believe that we have attained (loud applause). The Russian Ambassador authorises a statement to the following effect: \u2018The Russian Government, on hearing of the North Sea incident, at once expressed its profound regret, and the Russian Emperor tele­graphed to the King in the same sense. The Russian Government also promised the most liberal compensation. The Russian Government have now ordered the detention at Vigo of that part of the fleet which was concerned in the inci­dent (loud applause), and those officers responsible and those officers who are material witnesses will not proceed on this voyage to the Far East (loud applause). An inquiry is to be instituted into the facts, and we and the Russian Government are agreed that an International Commission on Crimes, as provided for by the Hague Convention - I ought to any that is nothing to do with arbitration - shall find out the facts, and any person found guilty by this tribunal will be tried and punished ade­quately (cheers). The Russian Government say that precautions will be taken to prevent a recur­rence of such acts, and that special instructions with this object will be issued (cheers). Now, ladies and gentlemen, I think we must admit that the Russian Government has shown an en­lightened desire that truth and justice in this matter should prevail (hear, hear). Only a few hours ago I had myself taken a very gloomy view of the possibilities of the circumstances, and therefore of a peaceful solution of the question. I think the Czar has shown himself an enlightened judge of what is right in this matter as between nation and nation. We have asked nothing of others that I believe we should not gladly have granted had we been in their places. We have shown no desire - and I don\u2019t think such a desire was in the heart of any man - to take advantage of what perhaps might be called Russia\u2019s difficul­ties to enforce our demands. We have appealed simply to justice, to equity, to the principles which ought to govern the good relations between nation and nation (hear, hear), and we have not appealed in vain (applause). It might have been far otherwise. We might have seen the delays of diplomacy intervene, we might have seen one excuse urged after another, until either the Rus­sian fleet had vanished into the Far East or until other things had happened (hear, hear, and laughter). That we have not seen this is due, I hope, in part to the justice and moderation of our requests, is also due to the far-sighted wisdom of the Emperor. The world has now got its eye concentrated on one great warlike tragedy moving through its appointed course in the Far East. It would have been appalling if that great tragedy had been doubled by another, the greatest calamity that could perhaps befall mankind, a struggle between two First Class Powers. Speak­ing for the Government, I am sure we have done all we can consistently with national honour (loud applause) to avert that calamity. And speaking for my colleagues, I gladly grant that we have been met in the right spirit by the Government with which we had dealings. To say that the incident is closed and over would be too much, but surely, after the account which I have given you tonight of what has occurred, after the glimpse you have had of the national diplomacy of the last four or five days, you will not think me sanguine in hoping that the spirit of reason and justice which has brought us through the most difficult parts of this controversy without the supreme calamity of war, will still preside over the councils of nations, and that the greatest of all calamities, the calamity of a war between two European nations will be avoided. If it is I can promise it will be avoided without dishonour to this country. I think I may also venture to say that it will do nothing but credit to the ruler of that great Empire whom we have been so nearly coming into collision, but with whom it my earnest hope and sincere belief that our good relations shall remain undisturbed (cheers). I hope tonight I have brought you good news (cheers, and hear, hear). I have, indeed, touched upon no question which divides our countrymen. I hope I have said nothing which can in the smallest degree embitter international relations (hear, hear), and though I have spoken, as you may well see, under a heavy sense of responsi­bility, and under considerable difficulty, I do think that the events of the last few days, though they can never wipe out the tragic occurrence of Friday, will not bring in their train any of those widespread calamities which at one time I almost feared they might do. Ladies and gentlemen, I have done. I do not suppose that at any meeting of the Conservative Associations has a Minister had to speak under the circumstances in which I have had to address myself this evening. Certainly, never has a Minister had a more sympathetic audience (hear, hear), and you will allow me, while congratulating the country and Russia and Europe and the world on what I believe will be the result of the last few days\u2019 negotiations, you will allow me to add those larger wishes, my own thanks to you for the manner in which you have received me upon this historic occasion (prolonged cheering).
p187
aVMy Lord Duke, Lord Armstrong, ladies and gentlemen, I have been introduced to your favourable notice by one of the kindest speeches ever made by a chairman in introducing the speaker of the evening.  (Hear, hear.)  But the Duke of Northumberland and I are old political allies.  We sat for years together in the House of Commons, and praise from him is to me valuable, not merely from the great authority which he rightly possesses in this great industrial centre, but because it comes from the mouth of an old and valued friend.  (Hear, hear.)  He has reminded you that it was eleven years ago since I last addressed in this place a great Newcastle audience.  He has also told you \u2013 he has also reminded you \u2013 that now after eleven years events have passed memorable in the history of our country \u2013 war, foreign difficulties, domestic reform \u2013 each and all have come before the attention of our fellow countrymen; and we have to look back upon a longer period of continuous office than has for many years fallen to any single party in the State.  (Cheers.)  Indeed, unless I am greatly mistaken, I have myself led the House of Commons for a longer continuous period than any predecessor of mine since William Pitt.  (Cheers, and a Voice:  \u2018Long may it continue.\u2019)    I do not come here tonight to talk about the past, although that is a subject well worthy of the attention of the country and of Unionist audiences.  I believe that the ten years referred to by the Duke of Northumberland may vie with any other ten years in our history for reforming at home, dignity in our foreign policy, and war, when war had to take place, successfully carried out to a conclusion.  I do not mean to deal tonight with those ten years.  I do not mean to discuss the controverted questions which they have inevitably raised.  I may be allowed to pass them by on the present occasion, because I take it that the address which has just been so kindly presented to me by Lord Armstrong is an indication that this audience, at all events, and our party in this part of the country, look back upon the period of office which their Government have filled as one which need cause shame to no man who belongs to it \u2013 (cheers) \u2013 and that we have shown ourselves not unworthy of the generous support which they have so continuously conferred through years of varying difficulty and stress.The Question before the CountryBut I dismiss the past for the moment, and I ask you to look at the present and at the future.  It is of course evident to every man that by our statutory enactments, if for no other reason, the time may not be far distant, and may be very close, at which the country will have to pronounce whether it prefers to entrust its destiny to the party to which we belong or whether it prefers to transfer it to that federation of pathos \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 which, if I may judge by the signs of the times, is extremely eager to take up the responsibility.  Let us therefore for a moment consider the position occupied by ourselves, and by what I have described as a federation of pathos opposed to us.  And that I may follow every due rule of courtesy let me devote my first attention to our opponents.  (Laughter.)  I understand from their public utterances that they regard themselves as personally aggrieved that they were not ensconced on the Treasury bench two or three years ago.  They make it a matter of almost personal grievance that His Majesty\u2019s Ministers are still drawing from the Unionist party, and that those who have with more or less success carried out the national will and dealt with national policy, having been asked to transfer their energies to the Opposition bench and applied to the aggregate, and I am bound to say, relatively easy task of criticism, powers which to the best of their ability they have devoted to constructive legislation and public administration.  From a personal point of view, I confess I see no obstacle myself to the proposed change.  (Laughter.)  It is always easier to criticise than to construct, and unless my powers of anticipation are strangely at fault, criticism for the next Opposition, whenever the next Opposition is brought into being, will be a singularly easy and a singularly agreeable task.  (Laughter.)  But, in the meanwhile, what I would like to ask you, and through you, the country at large, is what these gentlemen, who for two or three years have regarded themselves as the natural and legitimate owners of a property from which they have been scandalously ejected by us \u2013 what they propose to do when they come into their heritage?The Liberal PolicyThey had thirty months or so to think the matter over.  They have told us until we are weary of it that they really possess the confidence of the country \u2013 that it is their policy which the country really desires to see carried into effect, and we are forced by this claim to ask ourselves what is that policy which it is alleged the country so passionately desires to see turned to practical account.  Well, I do not say I have read all the Opposition speeches, and I have not yet had the advantage of seeing the latest utterances of the leader of the Opposition, for I think so far as I am aware, that Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman has not yet had the opportunity of laying his view \u2013 after all the most important view \u2013 before the country.  But we have had long speeches and many speeches from persons only second to Sir Henry Campbell-Bannermen in the position they held in the Radical party, and I want to know what it is we can collect from them.  What has been the result of these thirty months\u2019 careful consideration?  What is the policy \u2013 I should say the mature policy \u2013 that these gentlemen mean to bring before us?  (A Voice:  \u2018Home Rule for Ireland.\u2019)  Well, I am coming to their views on Home Rule for Ireland.  (Hear, hear.)  But my friends, perhaps, will allow me to begin with what they think much more important than Home Rule for Ireland - (hear, hear) - which is the dinner hour of the House of Commons.  (Laughter and applause.)  It really is a most amazing thing when you come to think of it, that Mr. Asquith, the ablest speaker on the Radical side of the House, and a man whose capacity friends as well as political foes were agreed to admire \u2013 it really is an extraordinary thing that he should make a series of speeches to his constituents, that he should have the most subtle views apparently of the House of Commons procedure, as to the holidays which the House of Commons have, the hours when the House should dine, the time at which their weekly holiday should be taken; all these things should be given to his Fifeshire constituents, but that upon matters which I presume he and his colleagues are agreed, such things as the Education Bill, and the land legislation for Ireland, and matters of that kind, we should have only the vaguest hints, the least explicit utterances, the obscurest sketches of what this great party who has had an unwelcome holiday in which to consider its proposals \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 the only thing they were able to produce.  Surely that is a most undignified position for a party which has always been talking of the mandate given to parties at an election, and of the Constitutional  procedure of those who think that the House of Commons was not necessarily bound in its activity by the speeches or the election addresses of Ministers.  Well, why don\u2019t they tell us more?  Why don\u2019t they tell us, for instance, what their land legislation is to be about which they utter these dramatic hints?  That they intend to despoil somebody is, I suppose, obvious enough.  (Applause and laughter.)  But who they mean to despoil, how they mean to despoil them, and for whose benefit the process of spoilation is to take place \u2013 on that they maintain possibly an unwilling, certainly a somewhat sinister silence.  Look again at education.  They must know what they mean to do about education.  At all events, if they don\u2019t know it now, I can\u2019t see how they are ever to know it, for they kept us month after month in the House of Commons talking about the Education Bill of 1902.  They have talked very little of anything else ever since, and yet at this moment I don\u2019t believe there is a man either on their own side or upon our side, who really knows what is the system which they mean to substitute for that which was created by the Act of 1902.  I gather that they are with a light heart going to despoil \u2013 rob \u2013 the Church and other denominations of their voluntary schools, and that they are going to lay down as a principle that if elementary schoolmasters \u2013 or through elementary schoolmasters \u2013 are to be permitted, even enjoined, to teach religion, it shall be an offence to ask these schoolmasters before they undertake that duty whether they are competent to perform it or not.  I do not know whether that will be satisfactory or not to the supporters of voluntary schools.  I know that I mean so far as I personally am concerned to resist such proposals to the end.  (Cheers.)Mr. Balfour\u2019s ComplaintWhat I complain of is that we have no details of these matters.  We do not know what it is they are going to do, nor do we know how they are going to do it.  And why do we not know?  We do not know because directly they drew in the rudest way a plan they propose to adopt, from that moment they know they would excite an amount of opposition in every locality in the country, which would gravely militate against their electoral prospects.The Liberals and the Licensing QuestionBut there is, oh, yes, there is the other subject \u2013 I forgot that \u2013 which I gather has engaged their attention, and that is the licensing question.  Now I am not going\u000a\u000ainto the merits or demerits of the licensing measure we passed last year, although, in my judgement, it has been the only practical effort ever carried out by any Government at the same time to do justice to legitimate traders and to foster all the interests of temperance.  (Hear, hear and cheers.)  And they do not like that bill.  They have specifically announced that they mean by increasing the cost of licences, and in other ways to extract from the licence holders an even larger amount of contribution to public purposes than they pay already.  They have fallen, not for the first time, into the old error of supposing that he does a service to temperance who does a personal injury to the licensed holder or to the brewer.  Believe me, no moral reform can be based upon foundations like these.  (Cheers.)  The growth of temperance among our people, one of the greatest and most beneficent changes that have happened in my experience, is not due to preaching based upon doctrines such as that, and I firmly believe that those who try thus to associate in an indissoluble union the injury to a class with the danger to public morals may succeed indeed, in injuring the class, but will leave public morals where they were so far as temperance is concerned, and lower than they were in so far as public morals have to do with the treatment by the state of separate interests.  (Cheers.)The Opposition and Home RuleOne of my friends a few minutes ago asked me a question about Home Rule, and the view of Home Rule taken by our friends who are, to their own regret, at present on the other side of the House.  I do not think a more singular spectacle has ever been presented by a statesman of great ability than has been presented by Mr. Asquith, Lord Rosebery, and Mr. Morley within the last few weeks upon the subject of Home Rule.  I told you that Mr. Asquith was eloquent and detailed in the information he gives you about rules of the House of Commons, hours of the House of Commons, and the dinners of the House of Commons.  On that he speaks spontaneously and with satisfaction.  His views on Home Rule have to be extracted from him by a question.  He never volunteered them.  What are they?  His views of Home Rule are that it is not a question that the next Radical Government can deal with \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 but at the same time they adhere, that is, he, his colleagues, and his party \u2013 adhere to the letter and the spirit of Mr. Gladstone\u2019s statement upon Home Rule.  Rather hard on Mr. Gladstone, is it not?  (Laughter.)  We know what Mr. Gladstone\u2019s views on Home Rule were, and how he interpreted the spirit of those views, and how he carried out, or attempted to carry them out to the letter.  And we also know what the views of the Radical Party are, because they were good enough to vote with all the apparatus and party terrors on the resolution which condemned root and branch Irish Government and everything that has to do with it.  So that we have the most important speaker who has declared himself on this subject, announcing to the country that he thinks nothing can be worse than the existing system of the government of Ireland, though he agrees with Mr. Gladstone in the spirit that the way to deal with these evils is to institute a separate Parliament in Dublin, and though he agrees with Mr. Gladstone in the letter, he does not mean, so far as he is concerned, and his party does not mean so far as he can speak for them, to deal with that question at all.  Well, that was a great satisfaction, or would be a great satisfaction to me, if I saw in it anything in the nature of a conversion.  If Mr. Asquith were to get up and say, \u2018Mr. Gladstone, a very eminent and very great leader of the Liberal Party, took a view with regard to an Irish Parliament, which experience has shown to be impracticable, and which although I once agreed with it, now I am prepared to abandon.\u2019  I would say that was the speech of a perfectly direct, perfectly intelligible, and, of course, perfectly honest man.  But they do not say that.  They say they agree with Mr. Gladstone, but do not mean to do what Mr. Gladstone did.  I want to know how that kind of logic is going to stand against the stress of Parliamentary elections and Parliamentary contests.  (Hear, hear.)  That Mr. Asquith and those who think with him have not a logical leg to stand upon in regard to Home Rule is perfectly obvious.  And when to that bad logic was added bad conditions, then not only i\u000a\u000as the position an intrinsically insensible position; and when a large number of those on whom he is looking to for support take that view, do you think it is going to last?  Do you think there is the smallest security for us, who believe in the Union, that Mr. Asquith thinks the Union wrong, and yet does not mean to carry it out so far as he is concerned.  The position is absolutely futile, and yet we have a colleague of Mr. Asquith exposing mercilessly its futility, for Mr. John Morley has said that so far as he is concerned he \u2013 who also believes in the letter and in the spirit of Mr. Gladstone\u2019s views \u2013 he views, as surely everybody must think who holds those views, that the dealing with the Irish question is one which the Radical Party in power cannot ignore; and  we have Lord Rosebery saying also, in my opinion, with perfect truth, that they cannot ignore it, for the logic of facts, and the logic of opinions and the logic of  votes \u2013 (laughter and cheers) \u2013 inevitably drive them in the direction of Home Rule, and they will be forced to say so in the course of the examination to which they will be subjected before the General Election comes to its conclusion.  (Cheers.)   Now, is it not evident from the sketch which I have endeavoured to give you of the line taken by the only persons of authority who have yet spoken in the course of the present autumn on the other side \u2013 is it not evident that they are ashamed of their own programme - that they have nothing which they wish to recommend to the country in which the country sincerely believes, that their bill of fare, which may suit the diners in the House of Commons, is not one which the country will find appetising, and if they prefer to crawl into office, if office they were going to have, saying as little as they possibly can with regard to what they mean to do if and when office is within their reach, I consider that a most dangerous situation.  (Cheers.)  If they told us what they wanted to do, and told the country what they were going to do, and they put clearly and in the foreground of their programme the measures on which they were really bent in language which the country could understand, at all events some kind of preliminary verdict could be passed upon those measures.  (Cheers.)  But they pass it over as much in silence as they can, and what we have got to look forward to, if by any mischance they should become the depositories of political power, is not the carrying out of a programme which few of us here understand, and on which the interest of the country has never yet been concentrated.  We have got to consider what the Radical party, the British Radical party, driven by the Welsh Radical party and the Irish Home Rule party, could be driven by stress of Parliamentary controversy to lay before the House of Commons and the country.  (Cheers.)The Remedy for the ElectorsI think the prospect alarming; and I know but one remedy for it, and that remedy is that the electors of the country \u2013 who, after all held their own destiny in their hands \u2013 (cheers) \u2013 should entrust to those not untried depositories of power a yet further term of office, in which, as I believe, as I venture to hope, the interests of the country at home and abroad, the interests of our foreign policy, and the interests of sober domestic legislation, would be safe and secure.  (Cheers.)  But, ladies and gentlemen, if that consummation is to be arrived at, it must be fought for.  (Cheers.)  It is not by sitting and listening to speeches that that goal of our ambitions can be attained.  Are we equipped for fighting this great contest which may be imminent, and which, whether imminent or not, can in no case be long deferred?  I cannot honestly answer that question with full and satisfactory affirmation.  I don\u2019t think that as things now are the Unionist party is arraying itself for this great conflict\u000a\u000a, and forming itself in the order in a manner which best promises for success in a stricken field.An Episode in the House and an ExplanationI don\u2019t think that I can more clearly put before you what I have been compelled to regard as the great dangers of our situation, than if I for a moment touch upon an episode that took place in the House of Commons last year, which caused a great deal of comment at the time, and has caused much comment since.  It will be in your recollection that when the fiscal question came on - (cheers) \u2013 at a certain point in last year, I publicly advised the party to take no part either in the debates upon it or in the divisions to which it might give rise.  That advice was given entirely on my own responsibility.  (Hear, hear.)  It was most reluctantly acquiesced in by some of those of my colleagues \u2013 in whose judgement I have the greatest confidence.  It has been subject to adverse criticism by some of the most eminent members of the party in and out of the House, but I have not the slightest doubt that the advice I gave then was the right advice, and that any other course would have been dogged by disaster.  (Cheers.)  Well, how is that, and why is that?  I understand that the Opposition hold the idea that we were afraid of them, and that because we were afraid of them we ran away.  I think that is the legend which they have assiduously propagated to the credit of their own eloquence, and to the discredit of our courage.  But they make a great mistake.  (Cheers.)  Remember the fiscal debate in the House of Commons, although they had no reference to any word before the House of Commons, although they did not touch the policy of the Government while the present Parliament lasts \u2013 remember these discussions had been neither few nor far between and, according to a calculation that a friend of mine made for me, before this episode on which I am touching took place, it was calculated that no less than 1,100 columns of Hansard had been devoted to the speeches \u2013 I have no doubt very able and very excellent speeches \u2013 of members of the House of Commons on the fiscal question.  But when the Opposition tell us that they have frightened us from the field, I regretfully have to tell them that the course pursued had no connection with them at all.  (Laughter.)  The mixture of rather doubtful political economy and rather crude personalities which passed with them for a kind of speech appropriate to the fiscal question - they may possibly produce tedium, but hardly horror in the minds of the hearer - (laughter) - and we have heard too many of them to regard them with any other emotion than that of good-natured weariness.  (Laughter and cheers.)  No, ladies and gentlemen, I was not afraid of the Opposition.  I was afraid of my friends \u2013 and this is why I am dealing with the subject \u2013 I was afraid of my friends, because I have had borne in upon me by a painful experience of two years or two years and a half, that upon this fiscal question the Unionist party is more interested in criticising its own members than in turning their united front to the Opposition.  I am here to say exactly what I think about the present situation, and I mean to say it.  Nobody who has had the direct experience which I have had in the matter will say that I exaggerate in the least when I tell you that a party, united upon all other questions, supporting a Government in its foreign policy and its domestic legislation, when a resolution, dextrously enough drawn by the Opposition, was thrown down on the table of the House for debate, that every section of the party were much more alive to each other\u2019s shortcomings than they were to the dangers which menaced us from the common enemy.  (Hear, hear.)  That was the reason why I, for my own part, determined that after eleven hundred columns of Hansard had been spouted forth, that the floor of the House of Commons was not, if I could prevent it, to be the arena in which different sections of opinion in the one party, supporting the same Government were going to find their battlefield.  For I saw right that if they had not been prevented from going on we should as a Government have been rendered impotent for the great work in hand.  Great legislation was before the House of Commons.  The Japanese treaty was on the anvil - (cheers) - and it seemed to me folly then, and it seems folly now, to imperil great constructive acts on account of discussions which had no more reference to the actual work of the House of Commons than the discussion at a debating society at Oxford or Cambridge.  It had nothing to do with the present but with the future, not with this Parliament but with the next Parliament, and it did not touch the present and insistent needs of the nation whose interests we were bound to serve.  (Cheers.)  I have not mentioned this to defend myself.  I have come for far more important work than that.  I mention it because it is illustrative of the position which now exists in far too many constituencies.  And it is a position which if allowed to continue must destroy the real fighting efficiency of what ought to be and what might be a great united fighting force.  (Cheers.)  And there is no reason for it.  What is a party \u2013 what is a political party?  A political party does not consist of men who are bound to agree with each other in everything in heaven and in earth for all time and in all circumstances.  A political party no doubt is primarily bound together by a common mode of approaching political questions \u2013 a sentiment very often of ancient historic lineage on which they feel themselves able to work in harmony for the common good.  But if you come to specific details, to the actual enunciation of a definite policy, how can you expect, in a country  where all of us boast the right to individual opinion, and the freedom of the individual to form his own opinion; how can you expect that you will be able to do more than come to a common agreement with regard to the policy immediately before you, not always occupying your mind with possible controversies which, in a possible future, you may have with your political friends?  On no other plan whatever can that common action which we call party action be possible in a free country, and as I believe that the whole future of representative institutions depends upon the possibility of having a common organised action among the members of a party, so my very faith in the party system compels me to protest with all my strength and with all my force against stretching the doctrine of party unanimity to a point where it must break, and for asking for an agreement \u2013 which you can never get from free and independent human beings \u2013 which shall expand not merely into the immediate foreseen and practical future, but which shall cover in its abstract and theological meshes the whole potentialities of political thought.A Practical Fixed PolicyWell, you will ask me if you agree \u2013 and I hope you will agree \u2013 with the account I have given you of what a party ought to be and what alone it can be, and if you agree with me, the only question you have to ask is this:  Is there on the fiscal question a policy \u2013 a practical policy \u2013 upon which the Unionist Government can be formed \u2013 is there such a policy before you?  If there is, it should be enough, and the fact that there may be other economic aspects of social life on which the party is not agreed should be swept aside as not merely irrelevant but absolutely pernicious to the effective working of the party system.  Well, I say there is such a party before you.  (Cheers.)  I say that the agreement is easy of attainment if only you will consent to take it when it lies before you.  I don\u2019t, of course, mean either that on every economic subject the whole Tory party is agreed \u2013 it never has been agreed \u2013 it has not been agreed for sixty years.  (Hear, hear.)  But the Tory party has been a model of unity all that time, and I don\u2019t see why it should not continue to give an example of unity for another sixty years.  (Cheers.)  Neither do I mean that even as regards the policy which I venture to recommend to the party will everybody look at it with the same eyes, with the same enthusiasm, or weigh the relative values of the proposition I lay before you in precisely the same balance or measure it by the same standard.  Of course not.  You cannot expect it, and you will not get it.  But what you may expect, and what, if you will, you can get, is a policy of fiscal reform in which as I think all Unionists may for practical purposes agree.  (Cheers.)  It is that common policy and not the differences outside of that policy, which I would venture to implore the party to concentrate their attention upon.  (Cheers.)  I don\u2019t ask every man who listens to me, or who may do me the honour tomorrow to read what I have said \u2013 I don\u2019t, I say, ask every man to take the same grave view that I take of the restrictions of our foreign markets, upon the industry of a country which if it is to grow \u2013 nay if it is to exist as we know it - (cheers) - must have an immense and expanding foreign trade.  (Cheers.)  But though I don\u2019t ask every member of the party to which I belong to share my anxieties upon this subject, is there a man who regards it as wholly unimportant, is there a man who does not see that here, at all events, there may be a peril, even if I overestimate it \u2013 as I do not think I do \u2013 (cheers) \u2013 and if I am right, if every member of the party sees that there are dangers in the future of the kind I have indicated, surely, at all events, they may well join with us and refrain from paralysing the efforts of the party, and may co-operate enthusiastically with the party in carrying out what has, I think, rather unfortunately been called retaliation.  That is the first point.  Can there be, need there be, ought there to be on that point any disagreement with the party?  (\u2018No.\u2019)  Is it for that we are going to hand over foreign and domestic legislation to these \u2013 (\u2018No retaliation at all, sir.\u2019) \u2013 various, this strange collection of parties, who at all events are ready to unite to turn us out, whatever might happen afterwards?  I go on.  There may be members of the party who do not share to the full my views with regard to certain modern industrial developments, who may not feel as I feel that the whole course of industrial evolution is to require larger masses of capital, to be concentrated on great staples of industry, working with every modern appliance and with a very narrow margin of profit.  That is the form in which I think anybody who studies what is now going on in the great industrial countries of the world \u2013 that is the direction in which industry is moving.  Now, you won\u2019t get these great industrial aggregations working, as I have said, upon narrow margins of profit if they are to be destroyed from time to time by foreign rivals, supported in their own country by protective tariffs.  (Hear, hear.)  It is not a fair competition nor a possible competition.  (Cheers.)  I am speaking, mark you, not in the interests of the manufacturer and not in the interests of the wage earner as such.  I am speaking at this moment in the interests of the consumer, and it is undoubtedly in the interests of the consumer, as it is certainly in the interests of the other two classes I have mentioned, that there should be no interference in this country with the productive evolution of those great industrial methods by foreign rivals not depending either upon their own enterprise or their own courage or their own foresight, but depending upon the artificial aid given to them by the fiscal legislation of their country.  (Cheers.)  Well, I say again, I may overrate these dangers \u2013 (cries of \u2018No, no.\u2019) \u2013 but does anybody doubt that they are real - (cries of \u2018No, no.\u2019) - and does anybody doubt that a Government returned by the Unionist party should be returned with hands free, yes, with hands free, to deal with those dangers if so be that they be even possible and profitable.  (Cheers.)  There, again, I think there is no ground for this disastrous division of opinion, which is paralysing our efforts in so many directions.  (Hear, hear.)  I ask another question.  Some of my friends may think that when I have advised them, and advised the party to put in the forefront of our constructive policy, the calling of a free conference - (hear, hear) - and the attempts to deal in a permanent and satisfactory fashion with a closer commercial union of the various members of the empire.  (Cheers.)  There may be friends of mine who think either that I am too sanguine in supposing such an arrangement to be possible, or that I overrate the advantages which will accrue to the empire from carrying such an arrangement into effect.  Yet, ladies and gentlemen, there may be differences among us on that point.  Is there any man whose blood courses so slowly through his veins who does not feel that, if we could bring into some more organic union the disjointed members of the empire, we should in the eyes of our children and our grandchildren have done the greatest and most patriotic work ever attempted \u2013 (loud cheers) \u2013 and he would indeed lack courage and lack patriotism who would hastily reject \u2013 the attempt is impossible \u2013 who would discourage the sentiment which has grown up in our colonies, and which I believe to be strong among the citizens of the mother country.  Here, again, is there any reason, why we should dispute among ourselves?  (Cries of \u2018No.\u2019)Not on the Protectionist SideI acknowledge, of course \u2013 and the statement is no surprise, though it may be painful, it may be disagreeable to many who listen to me \u2013 I acknowledge, of course, that the party has always been disunited upon the subject of what is strictly and technically known as protection.  I have never been and am not on the protectionist side.  (Hear, hear.)  I recognise, and I have throughout my political life recognised, that the doctrine which used to be  associated with free trade \u2013 of non-interference of what the French term laissez-faire, of leaving commercial matters as between nation and nation entirely to the free play of the forces that are in existence, never touching it one way or another.  I believe that throughout my political life I have always thought to be an antiquated and illusory doctrine.  (Hear, hear.)  It was a very convenient doctrine not to legislate for the difficulties.  I agree that in any department, social or commercial, the difficulty of dealing with these problems is very great, but for my own part it is a difficulty which must be faced by all legislation.  As I have said, I will not say, for I never belonged to the extreme school of laissez-faire \u2013 you will remember it was a characteristic Radical doctrine, although they had long abandoned it \u2013 although I have never belonged to that department of politics, I am more than ever convinced that that in the commercial policy it is antiquated, and that the Governments in the future will have their hands free to do all they can to help the industries of the country \u2013 (cheers) \u2013 and by helping the industries to help not merely the manufacturer, not merely the wage-earner, but citizens regarded as neither capitalist nor wage-earner, but citizens regarded as consumers.  (Cheers.)  Well, I know, and it is the very essence of that part of the speech I am making, I know the views I have given to this assembly are not precisely the views which, had one the power \u2013 were he at liberty to direct himself \u2013 the whole commercial policy of the country would be acceptable.  (A voice:  \u2018It would be to nine-tenths.\u2019)  But I am not asking for nine-tenths; I am asking for ten-tenths.  The one-tenth to which my friend referred, if it existed, would be sufficient to neutralise for all practical purposes the most enthusiastic, the most united efforts of the remaining nine-tenths.  Ten-tenths or nothing.  (Cheers.)  How many constituencies are there in the country in which the leaders \u2013 the local leaders and their followers \u2013 insist upon discussing not the constructive policy which I venture to recommend, but possible differences that may arise among them if and when that policy is carried out.  Let that state of things come to an end.  (Cheers.)  I speak here as the leader for the time being \u2013 (a Voice:  \u2018For all time.\u2019) \u2013 of the great party which for more than 30 years I have been associated in politics; to which I have given the best I have to give, both in time and labour.Appeal for UnityThere is no use in a leader, believe me, unless you mean to follow him, and I am so confident that the advice which I am today giving you, and which I shall like to spread into every constituency in the kingdom, and into every corner of England, Scotland, and Ireland.  The advice which I shall give you is to is to forget the differences which are outside the practical politics of the hour, to associate yourselves in the common support of a policy which in my opinion all can accept, confident that if you reject my advice disaster will certainly overtake our cause as it overtakes every cause whose supporters are not at one with each other; while if you will follow the councils of him who at all events for the moment you have selected to be your guide, I think I can promise you not success at this or that bye-election, but I think I can promise you that the country will in moments of stress and difficulty turn to you, when it will see in you a party which has shown itself competent to protect its interests abroad, to promote its prosperity at home \u2013 a party which of all others has done most to further the interests of social legislation, that has never forgotten, under the stress of any difficulty, to preserve at the same time both the dignity, the honour, and position of our country, and to maintain those great interests of peace which in common with the whole civilised world are after all the greatest interests of an industrial population.  (Cheers.)  My Lord Duke, I have spoken longer than I designed, but I hope I have not unduly engaged your attention if I have brought it home to every man and woman connected with this grand organisation of the National Union, if I have persuaded them that in mutual co-operation and in mutual co-operation alone, enthusiastic, ungrudging, in that alone is to be found safety and power for the party, and through the party the highest interests of the Empire, which the party exists alone to serve.  (Loud cheers.)  (Mr. Balfour resumed his seat, having spoken an hour and ten minutes.) Mr. Balfour subsequently rose and said: I hope you will allow me to say I am called for to another place to deal with the overflow meeting, and that I shall not have an opportunity, I am afraid, of taking any further part in the magnificent ceremonies of this evening\u2019s meeting.  I am afraid, therefore, that it is my painful duty now to have to say goodnight and good luck to you \u2013 (cheers) \u2013 and may the unanimity and the enthusiasm of this great gathering be sympathetic and prophetic of a similar enthusiasm and a similar unanimity in our ranks throughout the whole country.  (Cheers.)
p188
aVThe chairman has recalled to our memory the last time that I had the pleasure and the honour of speaking to the National Union of Conservative Associations, and he has reminded us, if we required to be reminded, that since that day many things have happened (laughter), including the defeat of the Unionist party. The country has, of course, in consequence of that event, had the privilege of living for six or seven months under the rule of our opponents, and it is almost time that we should begin to take stock of their performances. (Hear, hear.) The election of last January provided us with a new Government. (A voice \u2013 \u2018What do you call it?\u2019) (Laughter and cheers.) No collective name in our political vocabulary enables me to answer the question just put to me (laughter and cheers); however we describe the new Government, we have certainly got one. But what I am going to discuss tonight is not the fact that we have a new Government­ - a Government belonging to a different party, composed of different individuals - but that we have got a new kind of Government, not differing merely in members, but differ­ing fundamentally in method. (Cheers.) We have got government by mandate. (Cheers.) Now, what is a mandate? What is its origin and genesis, its character? I have listened to the various speeches of the Ministers and their supporters, trying to collect an adequate answer to the question. I think I have found an answer. The origin of a mandate is usually to be found in some catch­word or phrase which is only a success on an election platform to a stormy audience, but which neither speaker nor audience thoroughly understands. (Cheers.) A mandate is a phrase which does duty for argument, which does duty for sense, which saves the necessity of eloquence, which is incapable of being translated into practice except at the loss of administrative justice, of admini­strative ability \u2013 which is, above all, an instrument which cuts short and saves thorough discussion. (Loud cheers.) Indeed, ladies and gentlemen, you may go further, and you may say that Government by mandate is an im­possibility unless you combine it with Parliamentary closure. I will give you, if I may, two examples of what is called a mandate. The first is a phrase echoed and re-­echoed from every Radical platform in the country, or from many Radical platforms in the country, and which takes the form of saying \u2018No tests for teachers.\u2019 No human being knows what that phrase precisely means, and directly you attempt to give a precise definition of it you find yourself either admitting that no tests for teachers were ever imposed or that tests for teachers cannot be avoided. If you mean by \u2018no tests for teachers\u2019 that the teachers in our schools, whether provided or voluntary schools, are not to be asked to sign elaborate theological formulae, I quite agree. Who has ever asked them to sign elaborate theological formulae? There is a clause, a pretentious and absurd clause, in this Bill which specifically forbids any teacher to sign such a formula. I should never think of dividing against such a clause. You may as well put in an Act of Parliament, \u2018It is hereby enacted that two and two make four.\u2019 So they do (laughter); and if you like to forbid that which never was done, you spend so much Parliamentary ink and Parliamentary paper, and you do no harm. (Laughter.) This is one horn of the dilemma. The other horn of the dilemma is that the tests for teachers did not mean requiring for the teacher that he should sign some elaborate religious formula; on the contrary, it means only that you should make no inquiries at all about the readiness or the capacity of a teacher to give religious education to the children of the school. (Hear, hear.) And I say that in that form the so-called mandate which forbids tests for teachers is absolute nonsense (hear, hear), and must be known by every man who gives five minutes\u2019 thought to the subject that it is nonsense. (Cheers.) What did the House of Commons declare the other day by an overwhelming majority, a majority drawn from every party in the House? It declared its desire that the compulsory education of the children of this country should not be secular education (cheers), and it admitted, as everybody admits, that if you are going effectually to give religious education that work must in the main be carried out by the ordinary teachers in the school. (Hear, hear.) Well, if you hold those two propositions - and 90 per cent of the House of Commons holds both (hear, hear) - then, I ask you, is it not mischievous nonsense to say that the children are to receive religions education, that the teachers are to give religious education, when the body appointing the teachers is not to ask whether they are competent to perform that duty? (Hear, hear.) But this irrational and unconsidered mandate was, in the opinion of the Government at all events, given at the general election, and these unfortunate Ministers who are endeavouring to govern us by mandate, and not by reason or by argu­ment (hear, hear), have been struggling in the meshes, having been endeavouring to disengage themselves from the network in which that so-called decision of the electorate has involved them. Ladies and gentlemen, it was no decision of the electorate. (Cheers.) Had anybody at these meetings, of which we heard so much, come forward and said to these crowds which no doubt vociferously cheered the Radical victor when he talked about tests for teachers - had put to these people this plain proposition: \u2018You want your children taught religion, and you want that religion taught by the teachers. Are you going to ask no questions, make no inquiries, take no steps for satisfying yourselves that the most important of all the functions which a teacher can ask to give (cheers) is one which he is capable of giving\u2019? That is the illustration of what is meant by a mandate.South AfricaWell, there was another mandate of which we have heard much, but of which we heard more, I may incident­ally say, five months ago than we hear now. (Laughter.) I mean the mandate in relation to Chinese labour. (Laughter and cheers.) Again, the Government found themselves entangled in the empty rhetoric of their followers. They struggled gallantly at first to carry out the mandate, but they found, as all men of common sense would have found in their place, that the mandate - the so-called mandate - was issued by the electorate in ignorance of the facts of the situation, and that no responsible government in this country - I do not care from what party it was drawn - would venture or could venture, without the immediate destruction of our South African position, to carry out in its integrity, in its entirety and immediacy, the so-called mandate of the people. Here again the easy phrases, the clap-trap utterances (cheers), the rash promises, the facile rhetoric of these gentlemen who received a mandate, has been an embarrassment from the moment they came into office until now; and, as I shall show you before I sit down, the evils which have been begun by this rash and intemperate dealing with the delicate and difficult problem of South Africa has produced, is producing, and, I fear, is likely to produce in the future, the most serious perils to the Empire. (Cheers.) Now, I told you just now that if you attempt to govern by mandate you must also govern by closure, and you must govern by closure because a policy founded upon mandate, a policy founded upon the kind of mandates that I have been describing to you, is one that will not stand argument. (Hear, hear.) Argument must be stopped at all hazards (hear, hear); if you cannot answer, you must gag; if you cannot meet reason by reason, you must meet reason either by clamour or by closure. (Hear, hear.) I do not discuss the question of clamour. (Laughter.) Closure we have had and had in abundance. Now I am not going to make the mistake, as I think it is, tonight of arguing before a great popular audience the details of House of Commons procedure. The House of Commons, according to my experience, is a body which is never understood, and never can be thoroughly understood but by those who form part of it, and even those who form part of it have an extraordinary gift of forgetting what they learned when they were members in that Assembly. We must manage our affairs as best we can and rule our procedure as best we may, and I am not coming here to appeal to this audience to support us in our opposition to the Government method by closure. What I do want to speak to you about is that which directly or immediately concerns yourselves, which is the fact that this closure gives the Government a free hand where a free hand ought not to be given them, and enables them to pass almost sub silentio proposals which, if adequately discussed in and out of the House of Commons, would, I am convinced, never receive the assent of the people of this country. (Cheers.)The Army ProposalsTake the case of the Army. (Hear, hear.) The Minister for War (a laugh) made a very able and elaborate speech early in the year, in which he asked for time, and in which he promised a full discussion of any pro­posals which he might make in July. July has come, the proposals have come - what is the amount of discussion we have been allowed? (\u2018None.\u2019) Do not let us exaggerate. I heard some gentleman say \u2018None.\u2019 We\u000a\u000ahad two hours (laughter); that is to say, two hours of independent criticism, as against four hours of Ministerial statement. Do you think that the country would be content with those proposals had we had time thoroughly to sift them? (\u2018No, no.\u2019) I am well per­suaded that they would not, and I will tell you why in a few sentences. I do not maintain, and never did while I was in office - and I apply no rules to my successors that I am not ready to apply to myself - I do not maintain that the existing principle of Regular battalions in the British Army is fixed and immutable, determined by infinite wisdom, neither to be diminished nor increased in obedience to the promptings of the economical spirit or in obedience to a reasonable calculation of the chances of war. I lay down no hard and fast proposition of that kind. I say that all the investigations of the experts, and of those civilians who have had access to expert knowledge and have been able to criticise experts, show that there are possible duties before the British Army which the present Army can but imperfectly carry out unless there be some means of ex­pansion found to meet a great national emergency. (Cheers.) I do not believe that proposition is seriously challenged by any military critic. I will lay down another proposition which I believe to be unchallenged by any military critic. It is this - that when the time for expansion comes, when that great national necessity meets us face to face, in the immediate future, our main difficulty will be to provide those expert members of an efficient army which cannot be created directly or immediately to fill a gap which no mere patriotic spirit can fill, to provide men who require a training which it is very difficult to give in an auxiliary force alone. (Cheers.) No one rates higher the importance of the auxiliary army than I do; but what an auxiliary force can hardly do is to provide elaborately trained officers, gunners, and professional staff, adequate not merely to the Regular Army as we now have it, but as we ought to have it in the supposed case of national emergency. (Cheers.) If that be the problem we have to meet, we must all admit it is a difficult one. We might not all agree as to what the solution is; some doubt whether a solution can be arrived at without a fundamental altera­tion of the relations between the State and the citizen in his military capacity. But, whatever our differences of opinion on this point may be, there is one thing on which we shall all agree, and it is this - that until you have found your machinery for expanding the Regular Army in time of war, it is nothing short of lunacy to deprive yourself of regiments in which trained men are to be found to supply the wants of the Army, which can give you officers and reserve and much that you will need even in the first months of a great war, carried on, let us say, for the defence of the North-West Frontier of India. (Loud cheers.) Now what has this Government by mandate done? (\u2018Nothing.\u2019) Well, they have done something - that is just my complaint - or they are going to do something. What have they done or what do they propose to do? Without framing their plan for this Army expansion, without having a scheme or telling us what their scheme is, they have begun to destroy before they have begun to build - before, indeed, they know how they are going to build. That is government by mandate. (Laughter.) Do you suppose the present Cabinet, unhampered by all the irrational talk about extravagance - do you suppose they would have set to work in the clumsy and disastrous fashion in which they have set to work had they not felt themselves bound by what they call this mandate? And when we, in the House of Commons, urge these unanswer­able arguments, we are not met by anything in the nature of a rational reply; we are met by the blunt statement­ \u2018This was the mandate of the country. Be it good or be it bad, be it reasonable or unreasonable, be it consistent or inconsistent with the safety of the Empire, thus has the country commanded us at the general election. We are its humble servants, and, despite reason and common sense, we must obey.\u2019 (Laughter.) That is a gross misrepresentation of the country. I do not in the least doubt that everybody would have liked to see a diminu­tion of naval and military expenditure; I am sure I should. Nobody loves paying taxes; I am sure I do not. (Laughter.) But to tell me the country want to cut down these Estimates by no rational or considered plan, but simply and in order to satisfy rhetorical state­ments made in the heat of a general election, is an insult to the country itself; and as to paying reverence to the democracy, it involves the profoundest insult to the democracy itself. (Cheers.)Self-Government in the New ColoniesThere is one other illustration perhaps even more important than the one to which I have just adverted - one more illustration of this government by mandate to which I must refer - it relates to South Africa. I am most reluctant to touch at a party meeting on that thorny subject, lest I should for a moment be thought to be using our colonial Empire as a pawn in the political game. I do not believe there is a single man or woman whom I are addressing who, if he or she had to choose between the exclusion of the party to which we belong during the term of our generation - to choose between that and the greatness and safety of our Empire beyond the seas would hesitate to choose the latter. (Cheers.) Ill should we deserve the name of the Imperial party if we could hesitate in our choice. (Hear, hear.) But I do not think that what I am going to say can do other than good. I do not think the exposure of what I consider the methods of the Government in this matter can affect in any adverse sense the fortunes of our follow country­men in South Africa. The Government - I will not say the country (hear, hear) - but the Government are on the eve of one of the most momentous decisions which have ever fallen to the lot of a British Government to make.Consider the conditions under which they intend to make it. You know that the plan of the late Government was to follow an unbroken, or practically unbroken precedent - I believe an absolutely unbroken precedent - not to give self-government without a fair trial, a fair preliminary tria\u000a\u000al, of an intermediate stage between govern­ment entirely from home and full autonomy. That plan has been abandoned, and they now propose to give absolute autonomy to our Colonies, to the Transvaal and the Orange Free State, with as little delay as possible. I think you will find that even those in South Africa who look with most dismay and most misgivings upon the experiment are nevertheless in favour of its being tried, since the only alternative appears to be government of the Transvaal from Downing Street (laughter and \u2018Hear, hear\u2019); and whatever be the ills which may await them in the future from the new Con­stitution, anything, in their opinion, is preferable to this intolerable meddling in their economic concerns of which the present Government have been guilty. (Cheers.) Very well. Let it for the sake of argument be agreed that fall autonomy is to be given; that a Constitution is to be framed which makes the Transvaal - and I presume the Orange Free State also - as independent as Australia, as New Zealand, as Canada, how is that Constitution to be formed? It is a matter of vital moment. The present Government, through the mouth of the Prime Minister, announced that they intended to give complete autonomy, and either in the same speech, or in some other speech delivered later, when asked why he was sending out a Commission of inquiry to South Africa, the, Premier told the House that they were in a condition at deplorable ignorance (\u2018Oh, oh\u2019) - I think those were his exact words (laughter) - as to the conditions there prevailing which ought to govern the framing of a new Constitution. I should have thought myself, if I had not seen that an opposite procedure was followed both in the Education Bill and in Army reform \u2013 I should have thought myself it would have been better to inform yourself of the conditions before arriving at your con­clusion. (Cheers.) That, however, is not the view of the Prime Minister, and everybody has his own methods of working out these questions. (Laughter.) It is not for me to criticise. My criticism comes in not in con­nexion with his own methods of determining his own policy, but when he sets to work to deal with the Opposition in the House of Commons, the House of Commons at large, and the country. He sends out a Commission because he is in a state of \u2018deplorable ignorance.\u2019 (Laughter.) Before next Tuesday he and his colleagues will have to make up their minds what the Constitution is to be. For next Tuesday he is going to tell us what it is, and he is going to allow us some four hours to discuss it. (Cries of \u2018Shame.\u2019) Do you not think, as impartial men, that he might have given us a copy of the information on which he is going to act? (\u2018Yes.\u2019) Our ignorance may be less deplorable than his own (laughter and cheers); but I take it that we should all obtain enlightenment from the opportunity of perusing the report of this Commission, for which, as taxpayers, we have all paid, and which has been sent out to supply the Government with information. We are going to have four hours to discuss it on Tuesday. (A voice \u2013 \u2018A scandal.\u2019) Yes, it is a scandal. (Cheers.) It has never been discussed in the colony at all, so that we now have, for the first time in British history, a step taken which is going to add two new members to the great constellation of self-governing colonies, without either the colony or the mother country having any adequate opportunity of considering either the decision of the Government or the grounds on which that decision was framed. (Cheers.)Conditions in the TransvaalFor my own part, I should have thought that a monstrous method of procedure even in the case of an ordinary colony; but consider what it is you are doing in the case of the Transvaal. You are dealing with a country where the population is almost equally divided between Boer and Briton, you are dealing with a colony where the memories of the war are not distant memories of the past, but almost present memories of what happened yesterday. You are dealing with a situation in which no country in the world has ever attempted, or, I believe, ever would attempt, to give full self-governing powers to a colony. The United States of America, after the great Civil War, did not immediately or for a long period put the South in possession of the full rights which they had possessed before the war. And yet, so far as the United States themselves are concerned, that might have been done with perfect consistency; it is a policy which might have been carried out without really endangering the Union, and for this reason - that the representatives of the South were only a minority of Congress, only a portion of one homogeneous whole, and would not have had that independent power which we gave, and gladly gave and safely gave, to great and friendly populations like Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. (Cheers.) The population of the Transvaal, I hope, will some day - I believe at no distant day - resemble those great self-governing colonies, but can we expect, human nature being what it is, that, if you give full self-government to the Trans­vaal, if you put into the hands of a body which is half or nearly half the whole population of the country the full powers, practically the whole powers, which the Dominion of Canada or the Commonwealth of Australia now enjoy, they will not use them to carry out by means even more dangerous, because they are not necessarily warlike, the objects which they failed to obtain by the arbitrament of arms. (Cheers.) The responsibility of the Government is tremendous. Have we the smallest ground for thinking that the reck­less policy of confounding the power of uttering plati­tudes and the power of governing States - have we any ground for thinking that confusion of ideas which prevails perhaps naturally enough at a general election is not dominating their councils now? Have they a real grip of the actualities of the position? (\u2018No.\u2019) I fear not. But how can we judge if we are not given information? (Hear, hear.) How can we judge unless we have a Parlia­mentary opportunity of commentary and criticism, of eliciting answers by questions insistently put, which is the great privilege of a great debating assembly like the House of Commons, but which this Government of mandate is determined to suppress. (\u2018Shame.\u2019) I can promise on behalf of my friends - I promise on your behalf (cheers), with absolute assurance that we shall not endeavour to turn to party or political account any con­troversy which may arise upon this subject. (Hear, hear.) But remember that there is at stake at this moment all that you fought for during the war. (Hear, hear.) Remember, and let the Government remember, if they take a false step we may lose all that was gained for the cause of civilisation by the vast expenditure of national treasure, by the even more to be regretted expenditure of the blood of those whom we most loved. (Hear, hear.) We have established claims against the British Empire in South Africa which we should be dishonoured if we forgot, for which we are bound to expend our last shilling, to fight to the last ditch; and if this Govern­ment, pursuing their policy of mandate and their love of platitude, establish some Constitution which hands over to those who recently were our enemies and who are not yet in any full measure our friends (hear, hear) - although I doubt not they are in process of becoming our friends were a wise policy pursued - remember if the Govern­ment hand over the power to those, our late respected enemies, they are endangering all that we fought for and that we bled for, all that we suffered for, the course of civilisation in those regions is destined to be indefinitely set back, your most sacred obligations will be broken, you will yourselves be involved in difficulties of which no man can see the end, and you will have shaken to its very foundation the basis of British greatness in African continents; and not in the African continent alone, but wherever the British colonist thinks he can rely on the greatness, the courage, the statesmanship, and the honour of England, and who, after any disaster con­sequent on our short-sightedness or policy, will say that henceforth the Empire of which he was proud offers no safeguards to him, and that he must look elsewhere if he is to pursue in security and safety the development of his civilisation. (Cheers.) My lords, ladies, and gentle­men, may the Government in this great decision be animated, not merely by excellent motives - for that I am quite ready to give them credit - but may they be animated by that far-sighted and courageous statesman­ship which is absolutely required if we are to steer the Empire through these difficulties which I have dimly indicated, and which every one who hears me knows to be as real as they are great. If they carry out what I hope - I hardly dare say I expect - but what I hope, if their plan is indeed sober, far-seeing, and just, then they may count, irrespective of party, on the support of their fellow countrymen. If otherwise, they will have dealt the most serious blow to the Empire of which they are but the temporary guardians (loud cheers), which for 150 years it has sustained. (Loud cheers.)

aVLord Plymouth, my lords, ladies, and gentlemen. It is twenty years since I had the pleasure and the honour of addressing a Birmingham meeting. I am sorry the interval since I last spoke in this great city has been so long, and I regret still more that when, in the ordinary course, this great gather­ing, representing as it does the Conservative branch of the great Unionist party throughout England, meets here we should not feel that we have with us and behind us, the active energy of that great statesman - (hear, hear) - whose work for Birmingham, whose work for Great Britain - (hear, hear) - whose work, shall I say in this audience above all, for our Colonial Empire - (loud cheers) - has given him an immortal place in the great series of statesmen who have guided the imperial destinies of this country. (Applause.) We have the consolation of knowing that Mr. Chamberlain - (load cheers) - although for the moment he cannot take any part in the firing line - (\u2018Pity\u2019) - yet gives us his keenest and heartiest sympathy - (hear, hear) - that he watches each step, each movement in the gradual evolution of public thought upon some of the greatest imperial questions of the day, with unabated interest - (hear, hear) - and that we here - we repre­senting the Conservative portion of the great Unionist party, have in all the work we are doing, and have been doing, his keenest and heartiest sympathy. (Cheers.) My lords and gentlemen, I have not had an opportunity of addressing the great body of the Conservative Unionists of England since the great reorganisation has been worked through and brought to a happy conclusion. This is my first opportunity of speaking to you, and I cannot preface what I have come here to say upon the great question of the day more appropriately than by congratulating you upon that reorganisation, which has carried out what has always been the view of the party to which I belong - namely, that the Conservative party should be in its organisation essentially democratic - (loud cheers) - that as we recognise and have recognised that our strength comes from the people - (hear, hear) - is born of the people - (hear, hear) - can have efficiency and perpetuity only by means of the people - (hear, hear) - our organisation should reflect our ideals, and that the system on which we carry out party Govern­ment should be one in which the leaders of the party may feel that they represent, not merely the officers of the party, but the rank and file and every member who belongs to it.An Appeal for TolerationThis reorganisation has been carried out. I believe it has been carried out successfully, and the result of it is that upon the various representative asso­ciations in each constituency it thrown the responsibility, the full responsibility, the representa­tive responsibility, of selecting their candidate, and of maintaining that unity without which no enthusiasm is of the smallest value, without which it is impossible that the causes which lie nearest to our hearts can ever reach their full and satisfactory fruition, which is the very condition of success in a free country governed under the party system. (Hear, hear.) Now I am not going to attempt to suggest how that practical unity in either case is to be carried out. I have no love either of processes of court-martial or processes of excommunication. (Hear, hear.) The first may be necessary under a great military system; the second has been rightly or wrongly thought to be necessary in many great ecclesiastical organisa­tions. But such things are not in my line. (Laughter and \u2018Hear, hear.\u2019) This, and this only would I say: You cannot lay down rules in black and white as to what constitutes party loyalty, or what does or does not amount to a difference of opinion with the great body of a party which should cut any member of that party from the general communion. (Hear, hear.) No precision of doctrine is possible in such circumstances, but the test of our competence as prac­tical men to deal with great practical problems will be measured by our power of working together, of forgetting small individual differences - (hear, hear) - of sinking petty jealousies - (hear, hear) - of silencing contemptible criticism - (hear, hear) - which we are able to show in the face of a great national and Imperial destiny - that you, gentlemen, representing as you do\u000a\u000aevery constitu­ency in England, every great body in England, will see both the need which lies before you, and each in your own measure be able to carry out the steps which are required to satisfy that need. I come here before you as your leader. (Cheers.) I believe I have your confidence. (Cheers, and a Voice: \u2018You have!\u2019). That I know. (Cheers.) I know I have done all in my power to earn it. (Hear, hear.) And while I am the last man in this room either to claim or to desire immunity from criticism, I think may appeal to every man who listens to me, and to that larger public throughout the country which may honour me by reading what I say tonight, I may appeal, to them, not in my interests or in yours - (hear, hear) - not on any personal. grounds, for, as every human being knows, I have no personal interest in the matter whatever - (hear, hear) - in the interests of the great cause to which we all owe service, and to which all of us are bound to sacrifice leisure and convenience - in the interests of that great cause I would ask them, each in their own sphere, not to exercise any tyrannical jurisdiction over those who may feel difficulties about this or that item in the party programme; but, at all events, to see that the degree of party unity is preserved throughout the whole of England, for which alone you can speak, which is the first condition to party success, and without which talents, energy, zeal, are all thrown away, and are all so much waste; but which, if you only can secure it, is bound to lead you at no distant date to that posi­tion of responsibility in the councils of the country which you have wielded with conspicuous success for so many years within the last generation - (hear, hear) - and which I am confident you will within a relatively short space - (hear, hear) - be called upon to wield again - (cheers) - for the benefit of every class of the country. (Cheers.)Enthusiasm for Fiscal ReformNow, my lords and gentlemen, you have reorganised yourselves, but an organisation is nothing as a mere machine, a mere soulless instrument, unless it be animated by convictions, by the consciousness of a mission - (hear, hear) - by a belief in principles - (hear, hear) - by a desire to reach a goal which alone will make it worthwhile for the citizens of a free country to engage in all the labours involved in carrying on free institutions. Have we those great aims? Where do we stand in respect of the principles that we desire to see adopted by the country at large? Do we feel that at this moment our affairs are being mismanaged by the present Government? (Hear, hear.) I should suppose that on that point there would be little doubt in any assembly. (Cheers.) However orthodox might be the complexion of their Radicalism that would hardly be doubted. But have we something more than a mere negative conviction, or, rather, a conviction of the negative deficiencies of our political opponents? Have we that positive consciousness that, were we called upon in our turn to govern the destinies of the Empire, we should rise to that great occasion which would then be offered us? (Cheers.) I think so. (Cheers.) If you carried your memories back, let me say, to the beginning of last session, the beginning of the year 1906, or, if you prefer, to the end of the year 1905, when the late Government resigned office, what you would find would be that, so far as we were concerned, so far as our p\u000a\u000aarty was concerned, the solitary subject, so far as I know, which excited the enthusiasm of the Unionist party, was the programme, was the desire to see some change in our fiscal system. (Loud cheers.) I am not going back on the history of the ten years of office, which I believe was one of the greatest periods of administrative success of this country - (hear, hear) - but which has passed into the domain of the historian, and is outside now, at all events for the moment, the sphere of discussion in current party controversy. Our business, ladies and gentlemen, is to make history, not to discuss it. (Hear, hear.) I have told you with general assent what the frame of mind was of our party two years ago. What was the frame of mind of our opponents? (A Voice: \u2018Nothing.\u2019) Some friend of mine in the gallery said \u2018Nothing!\u2019 I believe that to be a very accurate description - (laughter) - of all that we can learn, at all events from the authoritative utterances of their authoritative leaders. I do not know whether I misrepresent - I think I do not - some statements of the Prime Minister\u2019s, whose restoration to health we are so rejoiced to hear. (Hear, hear.) I don\u2019t know whether I misrepresent his statements before the election when I say, as far as I can remember, they were con­fined to a general expression of a desire to increase the happiness of everybody all round - in entirely proper and estimable sentiment - and a fixed intention to have an enquiry into the canal traffic of the United Kingdom - (laughter) - a proposal which, at all events, was innocuous. (Hear, hear.) But since then we have seen these gentlemen at work. We know exactly, I won\u2019t say what the Government as a unity can do, but what each Minister, in his individual and irresponsible capacity can do - (laughter) - and I rather think many of us, many of the community who are not, as we are, engaged in active political propaganda, have come to the conclusion at which we have long ago arrived, that these gentlemen are not the people to whom the safety of the country can properly be entrusted. Their conduct has raised, in addition to the great fiscal question, other issues which no Unionist can afford to forget - (hear, hear) - which no Unionist is likely to forget, and to which, before I finish, I may make a few references. (Hear, hear.) But before I come to that, let me ask you what has been the fate of the great fiscal controversy which excited among our own friends so much enthu­siasm at the time when we finally abandoned office, and when we handed over the destinies of the country to our successors. Has it lost force? (Cries of \u2018No!\u2019) Has it gained force? (Cries of \u2018Yes!\u2019) Does it represent a movement which, slowly here, rapidly there, but continuously everywhere - (hear, hear) - has gained strength? (Cries of \u2018Yes!\u2019) You have given me your answer. I agree with that answer. (Loud cheers.)Mr. Chamberlain and Tariff ReformThere are those who say that the origin, the sole origin of this great movement was a speech delivered by Mr. Chamberlain in this city in 1903. (Hear, hear.) My lords and gentlemen, even Mr. Chamberlain\u2019s great genius and great authority, even his magnificent advocacy of any cause which he has taken in hand, would have been insufficient to give permanent vitality to any great cry for reform unless the desire for reform were deeply rooted in the public needs of the com­munity. (Cheers.) And if anybody will take the trouble to do now what some day the historian will have to do, wh\u000a\u000aich is to trace the genesis of the great movement to its beginnings, they will say that it is the offspring of two quite separate, quite independent movements, both of which con­spired to make the citizens of this country utterly discontented with the fiscal system under which we have now for two genera­tions carried out our national work. What were these two streams of tendency? The first was one which convinced observers that foreign countries were becoming rivals of this country in their productive manufactures in a manner which had never been conceived, or could be conceived by the statesmen and economists of sixty years ago - (hear, hear) - and that foreign Governments were using their power, not merely in the way of seeing that their citizens possessed the opportunities of fair trade, of fair competition, with their rivals in other countries, but that their whole fiscal organisation was directed to the end of injuring the trade of their rivals and assisting the trade of those whom, rightly enough, they regarded as their clients. (Applause.) You know well enough what forms that Governmental action took. You know well enough the weak­nesses which our traditional system imposed upon the Foreign Office for the time being in carrying out negotiations with regard to treaties. We found ourselves one of many productive countries, all rivals in the same markets, all fully equipped for the great industrial warfare, a\u000a\u000and we found that while other countries were making with each other treaties for their own benefit, we were helpless in all negotiations, and had no safeguard for our interests at all, except the feeble and elusive safeguard given us by the most-favoured­-nation clause. We found also that behind the wall of tariffs which it had pleased our com­mercial rivals to erect round their respective countries, they were organising, intentionally or unintentionally, a machinery by which, in times of indifferent trade, in times of sinking trade, in times of bad trade, they could dump down upon our shores goods manufactured at a cost at least as great as those which we had to undergo, but which they were able to put down in rivalry with our manufactures at a less cost than that which we had to undergo. (\u2018Shame.\u2019) I am not quarrelling with them. My quarrel is not with foreign countries. (Hear, hear.) My quarrel is with those who, after we have had experience of the result of offering up our national industries unarmed to this kind of attack, refuse to put on the armour which they have at their disposal. (Applause.) That represents one current of opinion. I told you there were two. The other current of opinion is that which arises from the fact that in the last two generations our colonies have in the first place become great self-governing communities; and, in the second place, while that process of growth was going on, the consciousness that they belonged to a great Empire has been growing also. (Applause.) And they felt that, as members of that Empire, it was becoming to them as citizens to see that the great productive forces of this community - this Imperial community, of which we are all citizens - those productive forces should not be used with that inter­national impartiality which was the idol of the economists sixty or seventy years ago, but which, I think, in the face of modern developments, is absolutely antiquated at the present time. (Cheers.)Free Trade within the Empire\u000a\u000at;Now, so far as I am concerned, I have always thought that this idea of promotion of Free Trade within the Empire - (hear, hear) - is not only the most important of all to our commercial interests, but appeals most directly and immediately to the heart of every man who believes that he is mot merely an Englishman, a Scotchman, or an Irish­man - not merely a citizen of the United Kingdom, but that he is a member of a worldwide Empire. (Cheers.) Well, I personally have always felt that. I quite admit that until the recent conference I entertained serious doubts as to whether this great policy could be carried through in the face of the great difficulties which must surround any course of action which requires the co-operation of a large number of independent units. (Hear, hear.) And I think that those fears, though I believe them to be unfounded, were not irrational. (Hear, hear.) What I think is irrational is that these fears should still be entertained after we have experience of what occurred at the last conference. (Cheers.) I observe that members of the Government allude with a compla­cency that I am utterly unable to understand to the figure which they cut - (\u2018Hear, hear,\u2019 and laughter) - at the debate which occurred between them and the Prime Ministers of our great self-governing colonies. (Laughter.) I thought they cut a very poor figure. (Hear, hear.) At all events, of this I am sure - that every impartial spectator must have come to two conclusions. The first was that at the beginning of this year the temper of our self-governing colonies was such that it would have been easy for the British Government to make an arrangement with them, by which this Imperial inter-communication of commerce could have been enormously promoted. (Hear, hear.) Even if they could not do much they might have expressed sympathy. (Hear, hear.) Even if they could not do all that Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa desired, they might have said, \u2018We recognise the great­ness of your aims, we sympathise with your ideals, and insofar as we can do it consistently with the revenue needs of our country, we will endeavour to meet you.\u2019 (Cheers.)A Missed OpportunityThey held out not the smallest hope. (\u2018Shame!\u2019) They told those gentlemen that, insofar as they could speak for one of the great parties in the State, they rejected absolutely any offers they could make. (\u2018Shame!\u2019) And I suppose it would be rash now to say that there will ever again be an opportunity as great as that which was wantonly and recklessly thrown away by the present Government, (\u2018Hear, hear,\u2019 and applause.) Suppose our colonies now choose to say, \u2018The mother country has rejected our offers; they have, in language sometimes polite, sometimes not so polite, explained that they will have nothing to do with our commercial schemes; we will proceed, therefore, to do what we are invited to do, which is to pursue a commercial policy in which the interests of the mother country have no place at all, in which we treat Great Britain, are invited to treat Great Britain, no better than we treat those who are great com­mercial rivals of Great Britain\u2019s.\u2019 Should we in such circumstances have any right to complain? (\u2018No.\u2019) I trow not. And as I cannot foresee what course colonial policy will take, until such time as the country may recall us to power - (\u2018Hear, hear\u2019 and applause) - I can make no sure fore­cast of what the future is. But this I know - that were we, by the wave of some magician\u2019s wand, installed in office tomorrow, clearly our first duty would be to summon again that conference - (loud and prolonged cheers) - which was so hastily dis­solved. (A Voice: \u2018We won\u2019t slam the door.\u2019) We would open that door which was so rashly slammed, and see if we could not again do some­thing towards that great ideal of Imperial unity - (hear, hear) - in which every statesman, every re­sponsible statesman, of the colonies has borne a share, in which the late Government were warm sympathisers, and towards which no man has done so much as my right hon. friend the late Colonial Secretary. (Loud applause.) Time is passing­ - (\u2018No, no!\u2019) - and I have still a great deal to say to you. (Applause.) But I will condense as much as I can. (\u2018No, no!\u2019) On this question of fiscal reform - (cheers) - I do not think there is a better text to be taken than that which is given me by the resolution moved by my friend Mr. Chaplin - (cheers) - and passed, not merely unanimously, but with enthusiastic acclamation - (applause) - by the whole body of representatives. (Hear, hear.) That resolution divides the question into four heads - broadening the basis of taxation - (hear, hear) - safeguarding our great productive industries from unfair competition - (hear, hear) - strengthening our position for the purpose of negotiation in foreign markets - (hear, hear) - and establishing preferential commercial arrangements with the colonies, and securing for British producers and workmen a further advantage over foreign com­petitors in the colonial markets.Four Incontrovertible PropositionsNow to that programme of fiscal reform, taken, I believe, from a speech which I delivered to the Council of this Union - (hear, hear) - to that pro­gramme of fiscal reform, taken from that speech of mine, among others - (laughter) - I need not say I heartily subscribe. (Applause.) But the in­teresting point is not that, because that, I hope, is obvious enough - but the interesting point I think about it is this: At first sight you might sup­pose that those four propositions, however excel­lent in themselves, were separate and isolated, with no logical connection, and not to be advanced by any single fiscal policy. Now, I don\u2019t agree with that. I think you may approach these four propositions - broadening the basis of taxation, safeguarding productive industries, strengthening our position in foreign markets, and colonial preference - you might, I say, approach the whole policy from any one of those four propositions, and I believe you would arrive at the same prac­tical result. (Hear, hear.) The policy which is good for one is good for the other. Through the policy by which one can be promoted the other can be advanced, and we can confidently say that any fiscal changes we carry out would not merely be independent efforts to deal first with that proposition and then with the other, but that a comprehensive scheme by which all four of those great causes might be equally ad­vanced. (Applause.) Well, if it be a matter of indifference - and I think it is - from which of those propositions you approach the whole policy, let us, for the sake first of all of brevity, approach it from the revenue side, from the point of view which is represented by the resolution which deals with the basis of taxation. I might approach it from the others, but I will approach it from that. You will see in a moment or two why I choose that avenue of approach rather than any of the three others equally open to me. I will for the moment assume what I am subsequently going to prove - that a broadening of the basis of taxation is absolutely necessary in my judgment for revenue purposes \u2013 (hear, hear) - and that if we had no Colonies, and if there were no such thing in existence as a commercial treaty, and if no industrial phenomenon such as dumping had ever been seen or heard of, it would still be necessary for us, for the purposes of revenue and the purposes of revenue alone, to broaden the basis of taxation. There are four principles which may be laid down as practically incon­trovertible, or, at all events, which I am prepared to support by argument if necessary. The first is that your duties should be widespread, the second is that they should be small, the third is that they should not touch raw material. (Hear, hear.) The fourth is that they should not alter the proportion in which the working classes are asked to contribute to the cost of govern­ment. (Applause.) They should be small, because it is small duties which do not interfere with the natural course either of production or of consumption. They should be numerous, because if you require revenue, and if your duties are small, you must have many articles of consump­tion subject to those duties. Need I argue the other two questions - the question as to whether they should be applied to raw material or whether they should be used to alter the balance of Imperial burdens upon the working classes. Those require no argument. They have always been both the commonplaces of the Unionist party in this controversy and the subject of the grossest mis­representation by gentlemen who differ from us in opinion. (Applause.) And in my judgment, while those are four conditions which should govern any reform in our fiscal system, it would be folly for us to go beyond them, and to exclude from any redistribution or any alteration which, subject to those conditions, it might be necessary to make in our fiscal system, any articles of import whatever. Let our general import system be subject to revision and consideration. I, for my part, never have consented, and never will consent, either to bind myself or to suggest to any friend of mine that he should bind himself to exclude from this redistribution, this alteration of taxation, any article of import whatever \u2013 provided - (\u2018Ah! That\u2019s it!\u2019 and laughter) - firstly, that it is not raw material - (hear, hear) - and, secondly, that the tax put upon it is not a tax which would augment the proportion paid by the working man to the general taxation of the country. (Cheers.) Now, observe, that in this general scheme - I may say, incidentally, that I am not going to be bullied by our opponents - (cheers) - into doing what they never think of doing, which is to give an account of the precise details of their procedure some years ahead - I have laid down these general propositions. Their character is unmistakable, they are perfectly plain, they are perfectly precise, and while I reserve to myself the right to ask the gentlemen questions - the Chancellor of the Exchequer and others - (laughter) - to ask them some questions before the autumn campaign is over - (laughter and \u2018Hear, hear\u2019) - I consider that they are paid £5,000 a year to answer questions - (laughter and cheers) - the most they can ask of me is to lay down the principles on which I should propose to act were I again called to the councils of my Sovereign. (Cheers.)Not Backward, But ForwardBefore I pass to some of the things I am bound to talk to you about tonight, I must deal with one commentary which I hear perpetually echoed and re-echoed from more or less responsible quarters. I am told that in this policy I am recommending a return to some antiquated and discredited fiscal system. I am doing nothing of the kind. (Cheers.) I do not ask you to go back; I ask you to go forward. (Cheers.) I do not ask you to take to yourselves bows and arrows and Brown Bess and all the antiquated machinery of a system which may have suited its own day, but does not suit ours. (Hear, hear.) What I am asking you to do is to abandon a system which itself is antiquated - (hear, hear) - which was started when the industrial world was framed on wholly different lines from that which we see determining its character at the present moment. When the fiscal system under which we now suffer - (cheers) - was originally started there was no question in the minds of any public man or any economist about markets. The difficulty of finding markets for British goods was not one that suggested itself, or could suggest itself to anybody. (Hear, hear.) Would anybody say that that is the state of things at the present time? (\u2018No!\u2019) Would anybody say that the whole forces of industrial development in the world at the present moment are not tending towards making it more and more difficult for us to find the outlet for our manufactured goods which is essential to our national existence? (Cheers.) The second observation I have to make is that the diplomatic difficulty of commercial treaties was never thought of two generations ago. There were not these commercial treaties. The Foreign Office was not called upon to deal day by day with commercial rivals without having anything in its hand either to give or to withhold. That is a new fact. It is a fact that ought never to be forgotten. (Hear, hear.) Well, the colonies? When our vaunted system of taxation was established the British colonies were not merely in their infancy \u2013 they were in their cradle. (Hear, hear.) It never occurred to anybody that they were the great nations of the future, that it was to our interest as well as our duty to make commercial arrangements, and the whole colonial aspect is absolutely of novel growth within the memory of almost every man and woman I am addressing, born, indeed, within the last fifteen years, and in no sense present to the minds of the economists and legislators of the time of Sir Robert Peel. Take corn, again. The old theory of British economics on corn was based on the fact of what economists called the law of diminishing returns, which meant that as a community increased in numbers the pressure on the means of subsistence would increase also, and various consequences, of which I will not speak now, would ensue. But that is no longer the law governing wheat. Wheat is now subject, not to the law of increasing cost, it is subject to the law of diminishing cost, and the enormous strides which the growth of wheat in Canada, Argentina, and elsewhere, the enormous improvements in transport - however unfortunate to the farming class to which I belong - (laughter and applause) - absolutely destroy the whole basis of the economic argument familiar to our forefathers. The last point is the point of revenue. When our present basis of taxation was started, it was easy to get all the revenue you required from the sources which we now strain almost to the breaking point. (Hear, hear.) Is it easy now? (\u2018No.\u2019) Will the Chancellor of the Exchequer say it is easy now? (\u2018No.\u2019) Here are four points, and they are the pivots of the whole argu­ment I have addressed to you tonight, and of every argument I have ever addressed to any public meet­ing. I say that no one single point of those four, the governing consideration of the whole argument, were present to the great men - their greatness I do not minimise or desire to minimise - or could be present to the great men who were the founders of our present fiscal system. (Hear, hear.) I leave it to the Radical Party to bow down in this abject submission to a dead authority. (Cheers.) I leave it to them to base their whole policy upon conditions which once existed but which exist no longer - (hear, hear) - and to show their love of progress - (laughter) - their consciousness of the changing needs of an ever-developing society by binding themselves, now and for all time, to the dead formulae of the great men who would have been the first to scorn the action they are taking. (Cheers.) Well, ladies and gentlemen, I know of only one possible answer to the argument that I have laid before you, and it is this: It may be said the present system of taxation, at all events, is adequate for our needs; what the country wants it can get from the present sources open to the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Is that true? (\u2018No!\u2019) Is there the smallest prospect of it? (\u2018No!\u2019) Observe that this was a point on which it was very difficult - almost impossible, I think - to pronounce a conclusive opinion before a popular audience until the present Chancellor of the Exchequer had had the opportunity of pre­senting two Budgets to the nation. He has pre­sented two Budgets, and nothing could be more certain that while we are all desirous, and for the best of reasons, to promote national economy, it is quite impossible that we should carry out the ordinary duties of national and Imperial defence and the other duties incumbent upon a Government, and also pursue a policy of social reform - (hear, hear) - unless we have some possi­bility of increasing the sources from which our public expenditure must ultimately come.Socialism versus Social ReformI observe that the Chancellor of the Ex­chequer devoted a speech the other day, or the large part of a speech, to the discussion of social reform and Socialism. Everybody will admit - everybody in this room, I think will admit - that while social reform has always been a cardinal element in the Unionist programme, the growth of Socialism is a disquieting phenomenon at the present time. Well, the Chancellor of the Ex­chequer is very naturally fidgety and nervous about being confused with those Socialists who are alienating some of his best supporters - (laughter) - and he very properly desires to clear his character before the world. I read a speech in which he cleared his character. Perhaps you will allow me to read the central extract from his speech. It is quite worth it. (Laughter.) This is what Mr. Asquith said: \u2018If they asked him at what point it was that Liberalism and what was called Socialism in the true strict sense of the term parted company, be would answer when liberty in its positive and not merely in its negative sense was threatened.\u2019 (Laughter.) I am told, ladies and gentlemen, that there are people uncritical enough to accuse me of an over-subtlety of statement. (Laughter.) But mere plain men - (laughter) - as the Prime Minister described them last night - mere plain men, when they set themselves to the task, have an extraordinary gift of ambiguity. (Hear, hear.) \u2018When liberty in its positive and not merely in its negative sense is threatened.\u2019 (Laughter.) That is the point at which Liberalism ceases to be Liberalism and becomes Socialism - (laughter and cheers) - and Socialism becomes no longer Liberalism. Now it is my happy destiny to sit opposite the crowded benches of the Government side, filling not merely the right hand part of the House of Commons, but extending to the Independent Labour Party, who sit below the gangway on our own side. When I return next session I shall look with the greatest curiosity to see where this fissure occurs. (Laughter.)What Socialism IsI shall pass my eye from the amiable and comfort­able capitalists and landowners - (Laughter) - who sit behind the Treasury Bench, down across the gangway, and then up on the left-hand side to the Speaker, and I shall ask myself where the precise division occurs between the gentlemen who interfere with liberty on its negative side - (laughter) - who threaten liberty on its negative side, and those who threaten liberty on its positive side. (\u2018Hear, hear,\u2019 and applause.) It would be a very interesting subject of investigation. (Laughter.) And as we are asking questions of each other from platform to platform, I should like to have the Chancellor of the Exchequer\u2019s views on the precise point where this unhappy division between Liberalism and Socialism occurs. (Laughter.) But, in truth, ladies and gentlemen, it seems to me that there is no difficulty or ambiguity about the subject at all. Socialism has one meaning, and one meaning only. (Hear, hear.) Socialism means, and can mean, nothing else than that the community or the State is to take all the means of production into its own hands, that private enterprise and private pro­perty are to come to an end, and all that private enterprise and private property carry with them. That is Socialism, and nothing else is Socialism. (Applause.) Social reform is when the State, based upon private enterprise, based upon private property, recognising that the best productive results can only be attained by respect­ing private property and encouraging private enterprise - (applause) - asks them to contribute towards great national, social, and public ob­jects. That is Social reform. (Hear, hear.) There is, there can be, or ought to be, no ambiguity between the two, and we need not discuss either liberty in its positive or liberty in its negative sense when we are dealing with this plain pro­position. Now I have one observation to make upon the social aspect, upon the effect on the State of these two plans. Socialism I believe to be absolutely ruinous - (hear, hear) - not to the possessors of property principally or chiefly, but to the whole community, which depends not upon dividing the wealth of those who are above the average, but upon increasing the production of the whole community. (Hear, hear) It is upon the productive activity, the inventiveness, the enterprise, the knowledge, the readiness to run risks and to bear the result of risks when they go wrong - (hear, hear) - it is on these that a great community depends, and on these alone, for the wealth it can use. As regards social reform, I admit the difficulty. I admit that there is nothing in the world which more tries the statesmanship of those entrusted with office than really to carry out something which is not merely to figure as social reform on a platform, but which is to make the lot of the unfortunate and the toiler and the aged better, happier, healthier. The only con­dition which is to be kept in mind in that connec­tion is that if you ask from the community at large too great a contribution, even for the best of objects, you defeat your own end - (hear, hear) - by destroying the productive efficiency of the com­munity on which alone all your philanthropic efforts must ultimately be based. Very well, I ask now how is Mr. Asquith going to find the money for his social reform on the present basis of taxation? He is fond of asking questions of those who have no responsibility for the present conduct of affairs. I ask him, who has responsibility, how he means to do it? (Hear, hear.) I cannot con­ceive it. (Hear, hear.) Ladies and gentlemen, social reform has long been the work of the Unionist Party - (applause) - as distinguished from the Radical or Socialist Party. I was amused in reading in this very speech of Mr. Asquith a statement that we are all in favour of social reform, which some call erroneously Socialism, and that nobody would care to go back upon such great changes in our system as that involved in free education, the labour laws, the Factory Acts, the Housing Acts, and other great feats of social reform of the past. Nobody will go back on them. But who did them? (\u2018Hear hear,\u2019 and applause.) Was it Mr. Asquith\u2019s friends or predecessors - (\u2018No!\u2019) - or was it the party of which we all here are members?  (\u2018Yes.\u2019)The Real Social ReformersGo back sixty years, trace the course of ameliora­tive legislation through all that period, and you will find the stamp of the Unionist party upon every serious effort. You will find that the men who are, in the Chancellor of the Exchequer\u2019s view, entangled in the desire to support this or that privilege, this or that class - that these men, these class politicians, are the only ones who have found time, while they were in office, really to carry out the work of social reform, of which the Radical party can present us nothing except perorations. (Laughter.) We passed the Acts; they give us a sort of general survey of British history from which you suppose that everything had been done by them. As a matter of fact, nothing has been done by them - nothing or next to nothing. (Applause.) And why? For a reason given you by the Prime Minister last night, which is only an echo of similar reasons, given by a long line of his distinguished predecessors. The Prime Minister cannot give social reform because he has got to destroy the House of Lords. (Laughter and applause.) I am not travestying his argument. I believe I have quoted him literally. That is exactly what they have always said. The Radical, when he is face to face with a social problem, says, \u2018An excellent object, an object to which we may all devote the whole efforts of our great and historic party - (laughter) - but before we do so we must destroy this or that institution. (Hear, hear.) We must carry out this or that political reform, and the welfare of the worker, the happiness of the crowded centres of our great towns, the conditions of industry - they must wait until we have reformed the Constitution and provided the machinery by which we can effectively carry into practice all the great professions with which for fifty years we have tickled the ears of the public.\u2019 (Laughter and \u2018Hear, hear.\u2019) My lords and gentlemen, we are a more modest party. We think the machinery provided for us by our ancestors is not inadequate to the task of carrying out social reform. (Hear, hear.) We think that in addition to all that has been done for the housing of the working classes in the great towns, there may yet be remedies found, and that we may be privileged to find them. (Hear, hear.) We think that in addition to all we have done to increase small ownership - (hear, hear) - agricultural and urban, and in addition to all that has been done - and it has all been done by our party - (hear, hear) - in addition to all that, yet more can be done. (Hear, hear.) This idea, that you are going to improve the agricultural position of Great Britain by handing over the management of smallholdings, either to county councils or a bureaucracy in Edinburgh - (laughter) - and by depriving the holders of the stimulus which ownership in every period of history and every part of the world has always given to agri­cultural progress - we think that wholly and utterly absurd. (Hear, hear.) We think that if the conditions of labour are to be improved, above all if there is to be a great reform of the Poor Laws - (hear, hear) and all causes analogous to relief but outside relief, such as provision for old age - (hear, hear) - that if those are to be carried out it will not be aided by wasting some years in a great political revolution, of which the result is to destroy one of the immemorial ele­ments of the British Constitution. (Hear, hear) We have before us a great task. I asked you at the beginning of my speech now, I am sorry to say, a very long time ago - (\u2018No!\u2019) - I asked you at the beginning of my speech, whether the Unionist party had or had not that great sense of public obligation and public mission which alone makes it worthwhile organising and re­organising, and spending such efforts as those of  which you have all been witnesses today. Can anyone doubt that we have such a mission? We have the great cause of fiscal reform - (cheers) - in all its branches, the revenue branch, the foreign branch, the colonial branch - we have it in all those branches before us to deal with.The Work before the PartyWe have the great cause of social reform, deal­ing, as I have said, with the condition of the workers, the condition of the livers in urban and rural districts, the increase of small ownership, the complete remodelling of the Poor Law - (cheers) - and the attempt to deal with the mighty problem of the whole. All these we have before us, for we are untrammelled with the necessity of abolishing anything or anybody - (cheers) - except abolishing the present majority in the House of Commons. (Cheers.) Surely, my lords, ladies and gentlemen, that is a prospect which should inspire the heart of every Unionist, should fill him with enthusiasm, should make him equal to any effort, should make him feel that his patriotic task is one worthy of the highest efforts of which he is capable, and all the talents of which God has made him master. (Applause.) May I appeal to you, who come from all the various constituencies in England, to carry to your respective regions the message which I have, however imperfectly, endeavoured to give you? May I appeal to you to fill them with enthusiasm for these great objects of national endeavour, and if, as I doubt not, you fulfil that mission, if you use the enthusiasm which you have shown today, both in the proceedings of this afternoon and this evening, if you use that enthusiasm in propagating the great cause of which we are the guardians, can anybody doubt, can any human being doubt, that the time is not far distant when we shall be able to resume the thread of Imperial Government and social reform, interrupted briefly by a dark episode, but inter­rupted only to make the original cause shine out more clearly and more resplendently - (applause) - and that many of the annual meetings of this great company will not occur before I, or someone standing in my place, will be able to tell yon that the great task is taken in hand not merely as a matter of theory or speculation, but as the work of a responsible Government, having behind it the confidence of a great people. (Prolonged cheers.)

aVMy lords, ladies and gentlemen, your chairman in his introductory remarks has just told you what you all know, that the fortunes of the party are now in a very different position from what they were twelve months ago, still more two years ago. But he has attributed that happy change in our fortunes to such efforts as I and my col­leagues have been able to make to restore the fortunes of a cause, which never, indeed, were lost fortunes, but which for the moment were in abeyance. He has attributed to our efforts the great and revolutionary change which has taken place in the position of the party. I am most grateful to Lord Plymouth for what he has said, and to you for the way in which you have received what he has said, and let me tell you that there are others to whom a larger measure of gratitude is due, and those others are his Majesty\u2019s present Government. (Laughter and cheers.) We have done our best. It may be small indeed, but we have done our best. But what would our efforts have been if we had not been seconded by that admir­able phalanx of sillies who sit opposite to us in the House of Commons, and who in their hunt for votes throughout the country have alienated every section of the population? (Cheers.)Foreign AffairsNow, ladies and gentlemen, I shall have to revert to this controversial aspect of the present situation, but before I come to con­troversy let me say on this occasion that I suppose it is my duty to make some refer­ence, at all events, to that which is uppermost in the minds of large sections of the popula­tion. Let me say one word, and it shall only be a word, about foreign affairs. All of us, irrespective of party, have watched, and are still watching, with anxiety the position of matters in Europe. We have abstained in the House of Commons and in the House of Lords from anything in the nature of criticism - indeed from anything in the nature of commentary - upon what the Foreign Secretary and his colleagues have done, for we believe that they are carrying on the continuous tradition of Lord Lansdowne and his predecessors - (cheers) - and we are resolved, so far as we are concerned, that nothing that we say and nothing that we do shall weaken the voice of Great Britain in the councils of Europe. (Hear, hear.) Ladies and gentlemen, there have been times in the history of our country when the friendship of friends has been cooled, and the enmity of enemies has been heated to a white heat, by the idea that the party system in Great Britain was weakening the forces of our country, that we could easily be counted for by our enemies, and could offer but a poor assistance to our friends. Such periods have existed, as you all know. They shall not exist if we can help it during the period that we are called upon rather to take the role of critics than to accept the great responsibility of directing and, it may be, initiating foreign policy. (Hear, hear.) Of course, I do not say that we, the Opposi­tion, are going necessarily to abstain from comment or criticism. Such a position could never be taken up. But I do say, and I say it with a deep sense of responsibility, that criticism should be indulged in with great caution on such subjects and that in no case shall we aim at any party advantage to the disadvantage of the national policy of this country. (Applause.) I rejoice to think that foreign affairs are, at all events at the pre­sent time and as far as I can penetrate the future, likely to be entirely outside the sphere of party controversy, and I am glad to think also that the recent statement by the Prime Minister makes it likely that on one great part of the problem of national defence we may rest content that the present Government are likely, and intend to carry out what has been the traditionary policy of successive Governments with regard to the maintenance of the Navy in the state it should be, and there was this, indeed, in my judgment, in a statement by the Prime Minister made a few days ago in the House of Commons, and I understood him to make exactly the same statement in substance as far back as April, I think it was, or March, when we were discussing the Navy Estimates.Naval PolicyI then understood him to say, as I know now that he intended to say, that we were going to maintain our two-Power standard in the sense in which the two-Power standard has always been understood, namely, the equality of strength with any two other Powers, with the necessary margin. (Applause.) There were those - I never was one of them - but there have been those who thought that when a statement somewhat less precise was made by the Prime Minister six or seven months ago he intended to preserve a loophole for escape. I never thought that, and I know now what I have always believed, that that was not the fact, and I rejoice to think that, however we may differ, perhaps, on other ques­tions connected with Naval policy, upon this fundamental, capital, and all-important point of national safety the Prime Minister of a Radical Government has announced his full adhesion to that policy to which his predecessors and our predecessors have alike professed allegiance. One other point, and one other point only, shall I make in connection with Naval defence. Never forget that a fleet without an army is a fleet robbed of half its virtues. (Applause.) Let no man be so foolish as to dream that we in these two islands can remain safely sheltered from the storms that shake the outside world, protected from every danger by our overwhelming Naval strength. That is a vain and empty dream if the British Empire is to remain an Empire. In the first place it is not a fact that the Navy and the Navy alone can give us adequate home defence. The Navy must be supplemented by an adequate home force, and it is folly to suppose, and no instructed soldier or sailor does suppose, that merely by multiplying your ironclads, but wholly neglecting the problem of military defence, you can flatter yourselves that in all contingences you can sleep safely is your bed. But apart from that - apart from home defence, which I am quite certain has not been taken sufficiently to heart by the general community - apart from home defence, we have got interests so vast in our Colonial and Indian Empire that we cannot ignore the necessity of keep­ing an adequate military force, and I am quite sure if you look back over the century and a half in British history you will see that this country has never yet been disinterested in what is going on on the Continent. (Applause.) The most pacif\u000a\u000aic of Ministers, the most reluctant of nations, the most difficult of House of Com­mons have found themselves again and again forced to take part in struggles in which this country, though remotely, were so closely and indissolubly involved that we could not stand aside and see the battle fought out elsewhere without our assistance, except by the sacrifice of the most vital national interests. (Cheers.) Look then to your Army - look then to your Volunteers in their new shape - see that they are made adequate for all that we can reasonably anticipate if they were called upon. To do short of that you will be failing in your first duty as citizens of the Empire. (Cheers.)The Government\u2019s ProgrammeI turn, Lord Plymouth, from these general questions, which I am glad to think, at all events for the present, are entirely outside the region of mere party controversy. I turn to subjects upon which the population of these islands is sharply divided, and turn to the legislative programme of the government. (Hear, hear.) The present holders of office have an insatiable appetite for legislation. (Laughter.) They are perpetually bringing in new Bills. They are sometimes withdrawing old Bills. They require, sometimes with notice and sometimes without  notice, sometimes in the possession of oar natural system of debate, more often without any freedom of debate at all, to deal in breathless haste, without intermission and with almost as little thought as the Government themselves give to their own measures, with one strange scheme of legislation after another. I admire this omnivorous appetite. It has something almost of a Gargantuan sublimity about it, but though they have a wonderful appetite for legislation they are rather coarse feeders. (Loud laughter.) They are strangely indifferent to the manner in which these plentiful meals are prepared.EducationI am almost bewildered by the rapidity of their legislative procedure. I hear by telegram, for instance, tonight, from friends who are unable to be present here, being detained by their Parliamentary duties in London - I hear the Government have withdrawn their Education Bill - (loud cheers) - but they are going to introduce a new one - (laughter) - ­and they are going to ask us to deal with it not later than next Wednesday. (Renewed laughter.) Can we have a finer example of their fertility and their versatility? They have been in office since the end of 1905. The general election was in 1906; we are now in the third quarter of 1908 - not a very long period in the history of a Ministry, but in that period I make out that they have had six different Ministers of Education - (laughter) - three at the head of the office and three subordinates - all changed, and th\u000a\u000aat these six gentlemen have had in charge no less than three Bills, all of which have been either dropped or withdrawn, and that those three Bills are now to be succeeded by a fourth. That is surely the most amazing legislative performance which we have ever seen in the whole history of this country. (Hear, hear.) What the new Bill is to contain, of course, we do not as yet know. I daresay it will be an improvement on its predecessor. It could hardly be worse - (\u2018Hear, hear,\u2019 and laugh­ter) - and I am sure the Opposition will give it, as we always give every proposal by a responsible Government - (laughter) - a consi­deration which is respectful, or, at least, as respectful as it deserves. (\u2018Hear, hear,\u2019 and laughter.) I do not comment further upon legislation of which we shall know more, I suppose, on Saturday - (laughter) - and still more on Wednesday, but of which we know nothing at present. I do not need to comment on that, and I shall come to measures of which we do know something.DisestablishmentAs regards the future, as regards next session, I do not profess to have loaded my memory with all the pledges that the Government have given as to the manner in which next session is to be occupied, but at all events, we know one thing, that, so far as Wales is concerned, there is to be a Bill for severing the ancient Church of this country - (\u2018Shame!\u2019) - for dividing it from the other portions of the Established Church, and for depriving it of its property. (Voice: \u2018No, never,\u2019 and applause.) I need not say that to that measure, when it comes forward, we shall give again as we have given before, the most strenuous opposition - (loud applause) - and I venture before its introduction to make this appeal to those who, though not members of the Church of England, do not blind their eyes to the great work which the National Church has done and is doing, both in Wales and elsewhere. Now, remember this is a Government which is always talking about social reform. They have not got time to give us to discuss their social reforms, which always have to be got through under excep­tional measures of closure, but of the time which is still given them before the nation calls them to account they are going to spend deliberately a large fraction next session in carrying out a measure which I venture to say no man not actually blinded by reli­gions and partisan bigotry can regard as anything else but a social crime. (Applause.) I would ask - if my voice can reach them - I would ask those Nonconformists, the great­ness of whose work I should be the last to deny, whether that work is carried out in England or in Wales - I would ask them whether they think the cause of humanity, of morality, of religion, of social reform, or any of the great causes to which our opponents make such glib appeal on the platform, and for which they do so little off the platform - I would ask them whether they think that any of these great causes is going to be served by depriving of its property and severing and cutting in half a Church which most undoubtedly shows, by every symptom that a Church could have, that it is a living, vital force working for all that is best in humanity? (Applause.) It is not only folly, but it is worse than folly, to suppose that you are doing anything to advance the fortunes of a party by such a policy, and, if I may venture to make a suggestion - a purely wire-pulling suggestion - to my politi­cal opponents, it is that they will find that they will get as few votes by this particular procedure as they have by any other expedients to which they have had resource in order to stem the flowing tide which is gradually sweeping them to destruction. (Applause.) Further, ladies and gentlemen, this Bill is in the future, and though the future is not apparently very remote, it is possible that there may be accidents - (laughter) - even before that future arrives.Licensing InjusticeI turn, therefore, to the present - (hear, hear) - and one final word upon that Licens­ing Bill - (cheers) - which has occupied so much of our time during the last six weeks, which will, I suppose, be read a third time tomorrow in the House of Commons, then go up to the House of Lords. Now, I do not mean in the few final remarks that I shall make on this Bill to dwell at length upon the gross and scandalous injustice­ - (hear, hear) - which I think it does to a very large section of our countrymen, neither do I wish to dwell upon the corollary issue, namely, the general discredit - the general effect upon confidence in this country, that is, after all, the basis of commercial prosperity, the very life-blood of commercial enterprise. I wish in these valedictory remarks - (laughter and cheers) - to touch more particularly upon its aspect as a measure of social reform. And I do this because I am well aware that there are many persons, for whom I have the pro­foundest respect, in the community who, while not blind to the weaknesses or even the injustices of this measure, are, never­theless, not prepared to treat as I think it deserves to be treated, what they regard as a great step forward in the cause of temperance. Now, if I thought that this was a great step forward in the cause of temperance, it would not alter my views as to its injustice - (cheers) - nor as to the iniquity of passing it in its present shape. But should say if the public - the great British public - believes really that the cause of temperance is going to be greatly advanced by these restrictions upon licence­-holders, let them by all means pay a fair price to the license-holders - (cheers) - and then carry out what they believe to be a great instrument of moral regeneration. (Cheers.) I am very sorry to say that I have listened to these debates, going on day after day and night after night, and I am more than ever convinced that persons who call themselves temperance reformers are some­times only teetotal fanatics, and I am more than ever convinced that with the best intentions they are working on the wrong lines. (Cheers.)Legislative RestrictionI don\u2019t believe that by this simple method of restriction you are really going to change the morals and habits of the people, and it is only by changing their morals and habits that you are going to make a reform worth having, and if you ask me whether I have any evidence for that opinion I would make two answers. The first is that nobody has been able in the course of all these debates to show that where a policy of restriction is carried to its logical consequence, and where such a policy becomes a policy of prohibition, you have done anything except add the immorality of breaking the law of the land to the immorality of exceed­ing the use of strong drink. (Cheers.) Never. No evidence whatever has been pro­duced to show that real reform has resulted from legislative restriction. And why should it? Why should it? Is it on legislation that the moral reformers, the religious reformers, the clergy, rely when they are dealing with any other topic connected with the advance of human morality? They rely upon persua­sion, upon argument, upon the growth of better feeling, of that gradual progress and improvement of the whole social environment which gradually makes that which is not a legal crime a social disgrace - (hear, hear) - and which does produce a general change in the disposition of the community which we may truly call a solidly based reform, not depending upon an Act of Parliament - not depending upon police interference or the infliction of fines, but depending upon those subtle - great and subtle - changes which are the true cause and index of social progress, and on which, for my own part, I rely so greatly for the future improvement of the community in this as in all other moral and ethical respects. (Cheers.)Position of the ClubsI have a much stronger argument than that. I have the argument drawn from the Bill itself. The Bill and the framers of the Bill seem to suppose, or go on the assumption, that if you restrict the opportunities for drinking in licensed premises you are going to produce a change in the habits of the people. If that is their view, if restriction be genuinely their creed, then why have they not touched the off-licences, and why have they not touched the clubs? (Cheers.) Is it not folly, verging on hypocrisy? (Hear, hear.) Is it not folly verging on hypocrisy to say that you are going to improve the whole habits of the people by preventing them consuming alcohol under police restrictions and supervision, while you do not touch their opportunities in the smallest degree for obtaining as much alcohol as they like by those two other channels, the holder of the off-licences and the club, which this Bill does practically nothing to touch at all. I never can believe that any man can regard this Bill as a great step in advancing the morality of the country unless he is either ignorant of the provisions of the Bill, or so extra­ordinarily incapable of seeing that you must have a coherent and consistent system of restriction - I never can see that he can be a sincere believer in his own creed when he does not touch either the clubs or the off-licences. (Hear, hear.) I don\u2019t believe you can touch either the clubs or the off-licences in any effectual way. I don\u2019t think you ought to. (Applause.) I don\u2019t believe in any restrictions carried out in the way this Government appear to think they are going to carry great social reforms. (Applause.) But, then, at all events, I am consistent. I don\u2019t wish to carry the restriction of clubs further than it was car­ried in our Act of 1902. (A Voice: \u20181904.\u2019) No, in our Act of 1902. I don\u2019t wish to restrict licences beyond what was carried out in the Act of 1904. But, then, I am consistent. But what are you to say of people who describe us who oppose the Bill as slaves prepared to sacrifice the morals of the community for a temporary political advan­tage? What are we to say about people who indulge in this kind of criticism and have not the courage and consistency to carry out their own doctrine to its logical conclu­sion, but leave the working classes, whom they wish to reform, no opportunity for getting alcohol in one direction, whilst they give them every opportunity to get it in another? It is folly, I consider, and immoral folly. I confess when I hear excellent people describe themselves as advocates of some higher mode of political thought than we, poor politicians, are able to arrive at, and I see them contentedly acquiescing in such illogical and inconsis­tent courses, I despair of social reform if committed to such hands as these.The House of LordsI need not say that the views I have been expressing are not the views of the Government. (Laughter.) Mr. Birrell, the Irish Secretary, in particular made a most un­measured attack on the House of Lords for what he supposed the House of Lords were going to do when this Bill went up to them. I couldn\u2019t help comparing the free flowing invective in which Mr. Birrell indulged when he was attacking the House of Lords with the carefully weighed and measured judgements which he passes upon Irish law breakers. (Laughter and applause.) If he would use among those who boycott their neighbours, who tyrannise over whole dis­tricts in the West of Ireland, who drive their neighbours\u2019 cattle, who occupy their neighbours\u2019 lands - if he would use the same vigour and invective against them, and follow it up - (laughter) - if he would use the same invective against them as he uses against the House of Lords, well, then, gentlemen. I shouldn\u2019t take so dark a view as I do at present of the government of Ireland. (Ap­plause.) But after all have the House of Lords so much to fear? (\u2018No, no,\u2019 and laughter.) I daresay you have forgotten what I had almost forgotten, which is a resolution against the House of Lords - (laughter) - proposed, I think, only a year and a half ago - in June of last year - debated three nights in the House of Commons, and in which all the heavy Radical artillery was brought to bear upon the Second Chamber. I had almost for­gotten it - (laughter and applause) - they have almost forgotten it - (renewed laughter and applause) - and I am quite confident that the country does not retain a shred of recol­lection of it. And, indeed, isn\u2019t it a myth? These gentlemen have been filling up the cup for two and a half years or thereabouts, with the only result that the more full the cup the more the country likes the House of Lords. The fact is that the more the cup is filled the country say that the irresponsible and here­ditary chamber is perfectly right. (Applause.) And all this bluster on the part of Mr. Birrell and his friends is really completely out of date. It may have suited the note - ­harmonised with the general picture - when the Government came in with their 300-odd majority and Chinese labour - (laughter) but I can assure them that it is totally out of perspective now. (Hear, hear.) It offends my artistic sense. (Loud laughter.) And they really ought not to repeat these ancient fragments of vituperative rhetoric the next time they come in with a majority of 300. (Laughter and \u2018Hear, hear.\u2019) But I think the House of Lords, in spite of Mr. Birrell\u2019s thunder - (laughter) - is per­fectly safe. (Cheers.) I think them as safe - and I don\u2019t know that I can find a more expressive metaphor - as safe as if they were cattle-drivers in Cork. (Loud laughter and applause.)Fiscal ReformAn abstract resolution against the House of Lords is not, however, the only abstract resolution out of which I have derived much private enjoyment during the last two or three years. I remember another brought in most gratuitously, finished most tyrannically, and that was an abstract resolution to which the Government devoted two or three days in their first session, and in which they made this House of Commons express its unalterable determination to maintain the cause of Free Trade. I remember asking some questions at the time as to what exactly they meant by this strange declaration of policy, which could not bind their successor, could not bind the next Parliament, and, as a matter of fact, was not bound by this Parliament. I got no answer, or, at all events, the only answer which comes most readily to the lips of the present Government - I get only the answer of the closure being moved. But I thought at the time, and my anticipations have not been disappointed, that the mere progress of events would supply the best commentary on this eccentric Parliamentary performance­ - (laughter) - and I have not been disappointed.Shipping and SugarI just ask you, ladies and gentlemen, to con­sider for one moment the two measures which the Government in their two and a half years of office have brought in and carried. The one relates, and I dare say gentlemen in Cardiff are well acquainted with its provisions - one deals with the pro­vision of all the restrictions affecting British shipping to foreign shipping which use our ports. As you all know, we do not allow British ships to go to sea except with certain regulations as to load-line, and all the rest, intended for the safety of our sailors - most proper regulations - (hear, hear) - but which, of course, necessarily involve - rightly in­volve, but necessarily involve - more cost to the ship-owner. We have no power to inflict these regulations upon foreigners. All we can do is to do what we have done, and I think quite rightly done, which is to say that if the foreigner chooses to use our ports he must submit to our - to similar regulations - (hear, hear) - an excellent system. But how, I ask, is it to be reconciled with that par­ticular profession of regard for the consumer which is the fundamentally economic doc­trine by which the present Government pro­fess to direct all their legislative and fiscal efforts? After all, their theory when they are dealing with sugar - their theory is ­\u2013 all you have got to do is to consider the interests of the community qua consumer, and the interest of the community qua producer will look after themselves. That is their theory, and that really is the so-called Free Trade theory. Then why don\u2019t they act upon it? The consumer, that is to say the man who wishes to have his freights as low as possible, would, of course, like to use the ships where the cost of freight is not raised by any regulations - the foreigner, in fact - and that is exactly what the present Government have said about sugar. They say, \u2018Why not welcome dumped sugar into this country? Quite true, it might not be permanent, and it might ruin your West Indian sugar industry.\u2019 But it might be all that so long as the foreigner is fool enough to dump sugar onto our shore under cost price. I say that is utterly abandoned when you are dealing with this shipping question. Is it not to protect the interests of the ship-owner, to safe­guard the interests of the British ship-owner against the foreigner that this has been done? Is it not to prevent unfair competition - the cardinal doctrine of our political and fiscal faith? (Hear, hear.) Yes, ladies and gentlemen, the cardinal doctrine of our fiscal faith. How about the Government\u2019s fiscal faith? I thought they did not consider the producer at all; that unfair competition provided it ended in giving it cheaper to everybody, was a thing not only you are to tolerate, but which you ought to tolerate - the foolish and idiotic doctrine which they themselves had to abandon when they were dealing with the shipping industry. Of course, you may say - or some apologists of the Government may say - I don\u2019t know whether they have said it or not - that it was not to please the shipping interest, the owners of ships, and the British sailors, but to protect the foreign sailors, that they have done this - that it was in the interest of a widespread humanity that they require foreign ships to conform with our doctrine of the load-line. Well, if that is their theory, how far is it going to carry us? I suppose then it would be their duty, and it would be their successors\u2019 duty, to consider with regard to Protection whether the goods that compete with our labour were produced by sweated labour or underpaid labour, or labour under improper and unhealthy con­ditions. Are the Government going to say that is their doctrine? If that is their doc­trine, how is it consistent with the only theory of Free Trade, which, as I have been able to understand, they have announced and perfected as it could be done, by the abstract resolution passed in 1806.The UnemployedAnd the same extraordinary inconsistency makes itself perfectly patent when they come to the question of the unemployed. Remember the Free Trade theory as they have been in the habit of expounding it is this, that if you look after the consumer, if you devote all your efforts to getting goods at the lowest price in the British market, that is the best way to obtain employment for the British working men. (\u2018No.\u2019) That is their theory. Then I don\u2019t understand, if that is their theory, how they justify spend­ing vast sums of money out of the rates in order to deal with the unemployed, and make them do things which are either of very little use or which certainly would not be regarded as worth making if it wasn\u2019t that they desire to give employment. Then where does the consumer theory come in? I have never been able to bring together the two halves of the doctrine of the present Govern­ment - I have never been able to make their economical theory of the consumer fit in with the practical theory of how to deal with the unemployed. After all, the extremist Protectionist only desires to see men in their own country doing work for which they are fitted - (applause) - and producing goods somebody wants. (Hear, hear.) Is it any important advantage on the extremest view of Protection to pay out of the rates for that which they are not fitted to produce and which nobody wants, and if you are going to say that the State in its public dealings is never to con­sider the interests of the producer - if, in other words, you regard the community as consumers and absolutely ignore the inte­rests of the producers, how then can you consistently give artificial contribution for the sake of the producer under conditions which make production profitably utterly im­possible, which prevent them doing that for which they are fitted, compelling then to do something nobody wants at a price so much that the State has to come to the assistance and to pay the difference between the value of the article and the cost of procuring it? (Applause.) I confess I have been surprised when we hear from the present Government all these ancient orthodoxies. (Loud laughter and applause.) They were quite ready to throw them in our face when it suited their interest to do so, but whenever the practical necessity faced them they, as practical men, abandoned all these theories and accepted the very doctrine of regarding the producer quite as well worth looking after as the consumer and the doctrine of protecting against illegitimate competition those who were engaged in production within our own shores. (Hear, hear.)Looking BackwardNow, in the light of these events, is not everything which the National Union decided upon just this time a year ago at Birmingham - (hear, hear) - amply justified? (Hear, hear.) Look back upon the doctrines which you then endorsed by universal acceptance. Look back upon the views that were expressed with regard to the necessities of revenue, to the arrangements with our Colonies, and to the safeguarding against illegitimate competition of our own indus­tries. (Hear, hear.) Look back upon these three cardinal points, and ask yourselves whether everything that has occurred since November 1907 has received farther endorsement by November 1908. (Cheers.) In 1907 the whole party represented here to­night at Birmingham gave its unqualified adhesion to those principles of fiscal reform - (cheers) - which I ventured in their name to enunciate. I am convinced that the twelve months which have elapsed since that date have induced such doubters in our ranks as there were to modify, if not wholly to abandon, any objections they may once have had to that view, and that month after month, as the policy of the present Govern­ment develops, and as the necessities of the situation make themselves felt more and more, it becomes clear to friends and to foes alike, to the sympathiser in our Colonies, to the alarmed spectator among our commercial friends elsewhere, that fiscal reform is no remote ideal - (cheers) - is no distant prospect of which men scarcely dare to dream, no far-off landscape which only shows itself dimly upon the vanishing hori­zon, but all the movement, all the thought, all the political forces, all the trend of economic speculation are alike driving us to this great change in our system - (\u2018Hear, hear\u2019 and cheers) - and that most surely, if political controversy be worth anything, most surely the time is not far distant - is, indeed, within the gaze, within the reach of vision of all the great audience I am now addressing - the time, I say, is coming when that great policy will be translated from the ardent hope into practical reality - (cheers) - and from the very furthest corners of the British Empire, the very heart of that Empire in this great country the effects will be seen in a closer knitting of our Imperial bonds -(hear, hear) - in the steadying of the whole industrial machine, to the mitigation of the ever-present problem of unemploy­ment - (hear, hear) - in the safeguarding of great interests against that combination of increasing industrial efficiency backed by the use - I was going to say unscrupulous, but at all events, the unregarding use - of hostile tariffs by every other commercial country in the world - the time, I say, will come when all these great problems will receive if not a complete solution - what problems receive a complete solution, how­ever you manage your affairs? - it will receive a solution - an approach to a solution by the rational, reasonable rearrange­ment of our fiscal system, rendered necessary in any case by the wild financial policy of the present Government - (hear, hear) - which, quite apart from that, has justifica­tions which, in my judgment, must appeal, in the first place, to every economist; in the second place, to every man who has realised the truth that you cannot look at a great industrial community merely as people who consume, and not as people who produce; and, in the third place, to every man who realises that the British Empire depends for its pre-eminence, its power, and its existence upon the encouragement of those common sentiments of citizenship which cannot have their base and root in a centralised Govern­ment, but which may, nevertheless, flourish perennially, usefully, and fruitfully if only we use every method by which every race, wherever they may be planted, may look to this country, not merely as the head of the Empire, but as a collaborator in the great work of industrial production. (Applause.) We have not concealed our convic­tions on this point. Has the country made no response? (Cries of \u2018Yes,\u2019 and cheers.) I tell you that every man on the other side, however loudly he may have talked of his fiscal views two years ago, now knows, in his heart, that the moment of change is approaching, that the first breath of a new era is making itself felt, that the dawn of a new day is visible above the horizon, and that when - and it will not be long  - the great party represented in this room is called upon to resume its duties and to carry out a constructive policy, they will be able, they will set themselves to the task of carrying out these doctrines into practical shape, they will have had a mission given them by their fellow countrymen (applause) - and whatever be the difficulties of the task, they will neither shrink from it nor fail in it. (Loud and prolonged cheers, during which Mr. Balfour resumed his seat.)

aVLord Derby, my Lords, ladies and gentlemen. This, I think, is the first time that I have had the pleasure and the honour of addressing a Manchester audience since my official connection with this city was terminated three years ago (Shame.) I well remember that day. It was probably the lowest in the political fortunes of our party, and I do not blush to acknowledge, I am not ashamed to acknowledge, that I re­gretted the severance of a connection of 20 years with this great centre of political life and energy. Ladies and gentlemen, if I read the signs of the time aright, since then a mighty revolution has been effected in the opinions and sentiments of our countrymen. They have had this three years in which to consider and compare the promises and performances of our successors in office. They have measured these performances and weighed these promises, and I do not think that the result is likely to be in favour of those who have succeeded us in the responsibilities of Government. However that may be, I am a not going to detain you today with a survey of the past. The present and the future is what concerns the politician - (cheers) - and he leaves, and rightly leaves, the past to be discussed and dealt with by the historian. How, then, about the present and the immediate future? What are we to say of the great questions which now exercise the mind of every person who concerns himself with the fate of his country and of the Empire \u2013 ­every man who knows how much depends, and will depend for months and years, upon the decision which in a few weeks must be taken by our countrymen? (Cheers.) Now, I am not going to attempt anything so rash as to survey within the course of an hour\u2019s speech the whole field of political controversy, nor am I even going to touch upon matters which I think may engage, and even absorb, our attention at no very distant date, and which I am well aware are cast into the background at the present moment by the insistent results, the overmastering excitement, naturally aroused by the crisis with which we find ourselves directly face to face.Home Rule and the NavyI am going, therefore, not to refer, except by mentioning them, to two such questions vital to the future of this country - Home Rule and the Navy. (Hear, hear.) No man who listens to me underrates the importance of these questions. They will be, I am convinced, in your minds when you are asked to give your vote at the poll. You will ask yourselves - I hope every elector will ask himself - whether the vote he means to give is a vote apart from all the pressing and immediate controversies on which I am going in the main to speak tonight. He will ask himself whether the vote he is going to give is a vote for preserving the unity of the United Kingdom from internal disruption, or whether it is a vote that is going to secure the unity of the Empire which depends on it from external aggression. (Cheers.) These points cannot be, and ought not to be, absent from your minds, but I am well aware that it is neither Home Rule nor the naval position of this country which at this moment is exercising your mind, but a group of very different problems closely related to each other indistinguishably - not indistinguishably, but yet inextricably - interconnected, and it is on these that I mean to speak to you tonight.Tariff ReformWhat are they? Tariff Reform - (prolonged cheers) - the Budget - (cheers) - Socialism - (\u2018Boo\u2019) - and the House of Lords. (Cheers.) Now, ladies and gentlemen, I am told that the feeling in favour of Tariff Reform in Lancashire is more lukewarm, is less ardent, than is certainly to be found in other great centres of the country. (\u2018No.\u2019) Well, I may be right, and I may be wrong, but what I am told is that there are a certain number of persons, otherwise by sym­pathy, by tradition, and by connection, members of the party to which we all belong, who look with considerable distrust and suspicion at the effect which a fiscal change is likely to have upon that great industry with which the fortunes of Lan­cashire are all so intimately bound up, and forms so great and honourable a part of the in­dustrial activity of our industrial country. What is the reason? If acts be true, what is the rea­son of this? I am told that the reason is that there are persons who fear in the first place that a fiscal change will increase the cost of living to the workingman of this country, and that by increasing the cost of living to the workingman of this country it will throw the burden on the industries in which they are engaged which will react unfavourably on the industry - the cotton industry as a whole. (Cheers.) I do not believe a word of that (Cheers.) Of course, anything that diminishes the prosperity of the workingman of this country would affect not merely them - they are the most important element in the country, but it would affect all other classes also. (Cheers.) But certainly I should never touch, I should never give my adhesion to any fiscal change of importance which increased the cost of living - the ordinary Budget expenditure of the working classes of this country. (Cheers)The Cotton IndustryNo man of common sense can deny that Fiscal Reform disposes of the fears that import duties are going to hamper Lancashire.I cannot even imagine it is supposed that that result will follow, and I do not believe it will follow. But, mark you that is not the only reason, perhaps it is not the main reason, why is supposed by some unwise, unsympathetic thinkers in Lancashire that the fiscal system is going to injure the staple industry of Lancashire. There are other reasons. They say the cost of manufacture will be augmented. I was given yesterday a very interesting article which appeared in a Radical newspaper intended for consumption in Lancashire, in which the case against fiscal reform in relation to the cotton industry was set out as length, and I confess I read that article with great astonishment, not unmingled with some amusement. The article stated that the cotton industry, those engaged in the cotton industry in Lancashire, were now fighting for their lives to keep down prices in international competitive trade. They stated further that fiscal reform in the form of import duty would hamper the industry of Lancashire in international competition, in the competition of neutral markets. Lancashire is now struggling to keep its head above water; it is fighting a difficult fight against international competition in order to keep our position in the cotton trade in neutral markets. I suppose that this newspaper knew what if was talking about. (\u2018No.\u2019) Well, at all events, it knew the opinions of those it quoted. It knew ­the opinions of the various people engaged in the Lancashire cotton industry which it quoted; and the phrase that I have given you is one of those that it quoted. But observe what follows from that. The whole theory is that wherever import duties are put on competitive industry is endangered in neutral markets, that the country which puts on these duties handicaps itself in the international struggle. Well, that is very interesting. But who are we struggling against? (Cheers.) Who are these competitors? Who are these nations against whom we can just, but only just, hold our own, and against whom we shall be no longer able to hold our own if any form of import duty, unbalanced import duty, is put on? Who are they? Protected countries - (cheers) - which have the tariffs, which I certainly do not recommend, personally, this or any other country to adopt. But they are labouring under this difficulty in an aggravated form, which even in its lightest and most innocuous form we are told will ruin Lancashire in the markets of the world. (Cheers.) But is not that nonsense on the face of it? How on earth can anybody seriously say that when they see that in protected neutral markets a protected country like Germany is increasing faster than we are, I do not think that proves one way or another that Fiscal Reform is right, but surely no man of common sense can deny that it disposes of these fears that the import duties are going to hamper the great industry of Lancashire. Here I am, for I am still glad to identify myself with a Lancashire audience, here are we with the traditions of more than a century, far more than a century behind in the cotton trade, and all that tradition gives us, and the knowledge and education of our people, with the best machinery and the best climate and other circumstances which should aid us, and then comes the least happily circum­stanced country on us, and gains on us we are to be told that the import duties required for these revenue purposes are going to destroy our trade.On DumpingIs that what they understand by Free Trade? That is not all I learned from this interesting article. I gathered that they were afraid that these import duties might prevent the dumping of steel, for instance - that was the example given - by the Steel Trust of America. If that goes on, says the article, if you are going to put duties on steel, from the steel trust, and on machinery, from the machinery trust, the industry of \u2018dumping\u2019 is gone. Is that what they understand by Free Trade? (Cheers.) Remember that if steel is to be dumped, it is not because steel can be produced more cheaply elsewhere than it can here, but because the high protective duties in America enable a great cor­poration like the Steel Trust to \u2018dump\u2019 their steel here at prices at which it would not pay the English producer of steel to turn out that commodity. This is the whole theory of dumping in a word, and now we are told on the authority of their writers \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 we are told that Free Trade is necessary to Lancashire, to the cotton industry of Lancashire, because, without what they choose to call Free Trade, steel made in a protective country would not be dumped in this country to the injury of our own producers. In other words, the Free Trade of those advo­cates of the cotton industry means, and means only, that some other British industry shall be unfairly competed with (Cheers.) Do not tell me that that was the meaning of the word free trade, which those in whose honour this hall was built would not have repudiated with indignation. I am not here to defend the idea of Mr. Cobden. I dissent, and have always dissented, from, his Imperial views, from his economic views, and from his social views. I think he was too much of a little Englander. (Cheers.) I think he hated social reform with a sincere hatred; I mean he hated the measures we call social reform - and rightly so - and he opposed them in his lifetime, and his whole scheme of political thought was one which I have never been able to sympathise with. Do not tell me he would have given in to absurdities such as these. He never would have told one industry \u2018you must submit to be unfairly competed with in order that some other industry may flourish.\u2019So-Called Free TradeHis idea was Free Trade all round. (Cheers.) He hoped and he believed, firstly, that he would live to see; and secondly, that if he did not live to see, that at all events it would come in a brief period. It has not come, and it is not coming, in the lifetime of any man, even the youngest whom I am now addressing. But at all events neither Mr. Cobden nor Mr. Bright I believe would have given their adhesion to that absurd and bastard form of Free Trade which does not say let each country produce and sell its produce to another country freely without the barrier of tariffs. That was his idea. He would never have said let the country, under the head of Protection and tariffs, produce commodities and then sell its surplus to its neighbours in such a way as to ruin the legitimate interests of its neighbours; but at least the modern Fiscal Reformer and the ancient old Radical Free Trader may shake hands and may join in repudiating the new school which has sprung up, which is as oblivious to the old doctrines of economic Free Trade as it is to the new conditions of modern competitive industry. (Cheers.) Now, if I do not, for these reasons, hold the view that the cotton industry is going to suffer, you may, well ask me - you will be right in asking me - is the cotton industry going to gain? I think it is going to gain. (Cheers.) And I think it is going to gain in two ways. I think, in the first place, it is going to gain by the commercial treaty-making power - (cheers) - which Fiscal Reform - and Fiscal Reform alone -(cheers) - can give you. Why is it that Germany, for instance, is gaining on us in the markets of Central Europe in the matter of the cotton industry? Partly, it is proximity, but not mainly. Largely, I have no doubt, it is due to effective treaties. And the more the current industry goes along its present channel, the longer the present system -inter­national system - prevails the more certain it is that whatever part the labour difficulty, the complication, and the friction arising from these international arrangements will continue. I do not say that under the new system the Foreign Minister will have an easier time; he will have a much harder task. I do not say that compli­cations will be avoided, or difficult questions in the House of Commons and in the country may not be raised. (Cheers.) Believe me, it is quite impossible for us under modern conditions to hold our own against countries not less well equipped than ourselves, for the great industrial fight - international fight - when we deliberately throw away the one weapon which they find effective. (Cheers.) We are too proud - or too stupid - (loud cheers) - to turn it to full account. (Cheers.) That is the first and positive gain which I think will accrue to the great staple industry of this part of England - (hear, hear) - and I do not mean to say that will occur in the first few months that Tariff Reform is passed, but it is a weapon you will have to use year by year with various successes towards immense advantage. Colonial MarketsI am confining myself to hard business, commercial facts.What is the other? The other is Colonial Preference. (Cheers and renewed cheering.) My lords, ladies and gentlemen, the time was when it was the fashion to sneer at Colonial Preference when the idea that this country had much to gain by closer commercial relations with our Colonies, was hardly regarded as worthy of the consideration of any practical statesmen or economists, and was regarded as a dream of ideal Imperialists. That view is abandoned. There can be no doubt, and there is no doubt, that at this moment, while the Colonies chose to give us preference we gain immensely thereby - (cheers) - and I believe that the gain which is great now will augment year by year as time goes on, and, as these great sister States increase in population, increase in wealth, increase in their demand, preference will mean more and more to the great industries of this country. (Cheers.) I have not time today to dwell on a side of this question which appeals to me quite as much, I admit, appeals to me perhaps more than anything which can be expressed in pounds, shillings, and pence. I have not time to dwell on all that the Imperial aspect of Colonial Preference means to those who think with me; on this question, so intimately bound up with the future of our country. I am, for the moment, confining myself to the hard business, commercial facts, and I say that the cotton industry of Lancashire is not merely threatened by the growth of com­petition in the Central States of Europe; but that it is threatened also in the East by American competition - of which you have only seen, be­lieve me, the beginning - by Japanese competi­tion - of which you have only seen the beginning also. And it is threatened also - though I am no pessimist, and do not wish to speak in terms of pessimism - by difficulties of supply of the raw material on which our very existence, the exist­ence of the cotton industry, depends. Now, some of these dangers, no action of this Government - I mean of the Government of this country - can easily prevent. Other dangers there are which I think it would prevent, and in any case it can do all in its power to reserve what will in the future be some of the best markets on which we have got to depend. Are you going to do it or not? Is there a man in the cotton industry who seriously says, \u2018I am indifferent to the colonial market; I am ready to take all my risks there, though I admit they are growing communities whose demand will increase year by year, though I admit they give us a preference, and though I admit this very immense benefit, and that it is a growing benefit, I am so wedded to the caricature and travesty of a doctrine based on a system of 50 years ago that I won\u2019t move a finger either to extend or to preserve that preference from which economically, as well as materially, so much is to be gained?\u2019Appeal to Free TradersTo those so-called Free Traders I would venture to make this appeal. They must have been embarrassed in comparing their economic doctrines with historic fact to see how enorm­ously German prosperity and American pros­perity have grown up at the very moment, or at all events contemporaneously with the imposi­tion of high protective duties. But I will suggest to them an answer conforming with their own doctrines. I suggest to them that a part of that marvellous growth has been due to the fact that, whereas in times past Germany was cut up into different states, with different tariff systems, it is now a great homogenous empire, with free trade with its other states, which from these commercial treaties are brought into economic relation, and extend the area through which Free Trade - or perhaps I should say freer - is allowed to prevail. To return to America, you have the same phenomenon in the enormous area within which there is this free interchange of economic forces. May I suggest to them that if they really be open to learn from the lessons of their age, if they can modify their theoretical teaching in conformity with experience, they ought to make a great effort to extend the economic bounds of these islands, and bring into freer economic relations with us those parts of the Empire bound to us by senti­ment, but divided from us more or less by these fiscal arrangements. (Cheers.) My belief is that if the author of the French Treaty could be with us - he might not indeed agree with me or others who take strong views on this subject - ­I am perfectly confident he would hold very different views from what in his name are put forward as Cobdenite ideas; but he would open his eyes to the actual facts of the world in which we live, and being deprived of his dream of universal Free Trade he would modify his views as to the commercial value of empires, and would say \u2018let us have a freer trade if we were isolated and highly protected communities, we could hope to attain.\u2019 Well I don\u2019t mean to - I have got a good many things I want to say - and I don\u2019t mean to deal further with this particular aspect of the question.Budget of Bad FinanceDisastrous to Lancashire and every other great industry.I turn now to another reason why Lancashire ought to welcome the advent to power of the party to which I belong. The only practical alternative - of practical politics as we all know them to be - the only practical alternative to Tariff Reform is the Budget. (\u2018Hear, hear,\u2019 and \u2018No, no.\u2019) Some gentlemen seem to think they have another expedient, and if they were in power that expedient might take shape, but any man who looks at the world in which we live, at all events, knows that in November 1909 there is before the country no other than those two alter­natives - the Budget or Fiscal Reform. (Cheers.) Put me down in my study with pens, ink, and paper, and I can discover a dozen things which might look like alternatives. But the only two practical alternatives are these two. And the Budget, I say, for reasons I am to give you, is disastrous - (cheers) - disastrous to Lancashire and for every other great industry in this country. (Cheers.) Now, just for a moment consider what that Budget is. (\u2018Whose Budget is it?\u2019) I am not going to attempt to enumerate the number of speeches I have made on it, and I am not to repeat, or even attempt to summarise them, but you may say truly of this Budget that it is a combination of bad finance - (cheers) \u2013 and muddle-headed Socialism. (Loud cheers.) It is bad finance because, for instance, it has raised the tobacco duties to a point which is perfectly pre­posterous. It has destroyed the spirit duties, it has rendered alcohol useless as a fiscal engine at all. It has thrown a gigantic burden on the country the necessity to carry out a universal land survey which is to bring in nothing in the immediate future, and as I believe, very little in the remote future. (Cheers.) And some of its provisions seem to me directly calculated, some of its purely financial provisions, the great augmentation of the old death duties, seem to be directly calculated to produce unemployment in many parts of the country. (Cheers.) I do not see that anyone has ever explained how you can take great fragments of capital suddenly on the death of an individual, which may happen at any moment, how you can take these great masses of capital and put them in the Exchequer without injuring the industry of the locality where that capital is invested. (Cheers.) Well, that I call bad finance, but I am not going to discuss that part of the Budget which deals with bad finance. I am going to deal with another part of it, which I describe as muddle-headed Socialism. (Cheers.) There are more than one part of the Budget which comes under that description. I think, for example, that the method of dealing with licenses is abominable and unjust. (Loud cheers.)Muddle-Headed SocialismSome remark not very audible was made by a member of the audience, but the chairman asked the speaker not to pay any attention to it.Mr. Balfour said: I did not hear it, and I should like to pay attention to it. I am not going to discuss them, having given this concise and unexaggerated view of my estimate and their character, because they are complicated with controversies about temperance, controversies about the monopoly value given by the State, and the rest of it. I am going to take as what I am told is the popular part of the Budget, the land taxes. I am told that is the only popular part of the Budget. Those who like nothing else about the Budget like that. That is the thing that anybody who wishes to do his best, I will not say to instruct his countrymen, but to give his ideas to his countrymen irrespective of whether it is popular or unpopular. Very well, then, may I just say what I think about the tenure of land in a few sentences in this country. There are people who tell you that the land of the country belongs to the people. When you ask them what they mean by that they tell you they do not believe it belongs to the people of the country. They think it ought to belong to some public office which should manage the whole land of the country. In other words, the land is not to belong to the individual of the country at all. I do not think that that is a reasonable way of looking at land; and it is not the way that any progressive community has ever looked at land. I think the land, personally, ought to be in private ownership, and the wider that private ownership is extended - (cheers) - the better that would be. I do not want all the land of the country to belong to the Woods and Forests. I want it to be distributed as far as possible in private ownership; that it should be held widely by individuals; that it should be regarded a favourite investment for building societies; that it should be regarded as perfectly safe for invest­ing benefit funds; that it should be regarded as a legitimate way in which friendly societies might put those great resources which the thrift of the community has so happily committed to their charge.The Taxation of LandThe land values of Manchester are not going to Manchester.And I wish also to see that business in land shall be like any other business, freely transacted without perpetual interference by a depart­ment, or a valuer, or an inspector, or anybody else. (Cheers.) I am, of course, in favour of land being taken at a fair value, but the idea that you are going to improve the lot of any man in this country by destroying private ownership in land, or by endangering it, appears to me to be pettifogging. I am one of those who are most anxious to see small agricultural ownership greatly increased. (Cheers.) What is one of the reasons why I am anxious to see that? I am anxious to see it because ownership, not the ownership of the State, but under the individual, carries with it now, and through all history carried with it, a stimulus, an energy and self-sacrifice which nothing else can give. It is a great mistake to suppose that as a matter of plain and obvious necessity the life of the agricultural small owner is easier than that of the agricultural labourer. It is a harder life, but it has great advantages, and those who feel that they have in them the spirit of the agriculturist and the power to improve, let us help them by all means, let us help them by every means that either the State or the individual can give to obtain that ownership, which does not carry with great hopes of immense profits, but which, though laborious, is honourable, which is independent, and which is certainly in the interests of the community at large. Now I should like to know how you are going to estab­lish agricultural small ownership, or indeed any other kind of small ownership. (A voice: \u2018By the taxation of land values.\u2019) Here is a gentleman who thinks that the security of the agricultural small owner and his happiness in his holding will be increased by the taxation of land values. (Laughter.) I beg most respectfully to differ from him. If you are honestly desirous of encouraging this form of ownership do not subject it to special and invidious treatment at the hands of the Chan­cellor of the Exchequer. No man who really understands what he is talking about - (cheers) - no man can really say that the multiplication of small owners, whether in town or country, can be promoted by the kind of legislation about land for which this Government has made itself responsible. If that is true of the small owner­ship, it is also true of that other department of energy and enterprise connected with the land, the land treated as a business for building investment. (Cheers.) I venture to assert that no competent authority has ever suggested that the treatment which land near towns is receiving under this Budget will not diminish enterprise in that land, because it diminished security. (Cheers.) And distinguish in your own minds between two things which are perpetually con­fused by the advocates of the Budget They say the taxation of land values for the purposes of the rates has been recommended by a great many quite independent individuals, many of them well known. How does the taxation suggested in the Budget differ from the taxation of land values?Taxation of Land ValuesIt differs by the whole difference between the Pole and the Equator. (Laughter.) Taxation of land values for rating purposes is legitimate if it can be shown that the land or the values which they desire to rate are values which are not paying their fair share of the local rates. (Hear, hear.) That is a perfectly legitimate argument in my opinion, just as it is legitimate to say that the personalty in the town which certainly does not pay its fair share might be legitimately asked it you can discover the necessary machinery to contribute to the rates from which it profits, and that all forms of property which benefit by rates should contribute if you can find machinery for it. I have no quarrel with the broad doctrine whether it be applied to personalty or realty. That is not the doctrine of the Budget. The doctrine of the Budget was - (loud laughter) - that all these land values should be taxed, not for the benefit of the rates, but for the benefit of the Exchequer. (Hear, hear and a voice, \u2018Lloyd George.\u2019) Some gentleman in the audience has summarised by saying \u2018Lloyd George.\u2019 Well, that was modified. It is quite true that it \u2018was\u2019 - (cheers) - but now let us say \u2018is.\u2019 The doctrine of the Budget is that half of these rates are to go to the Exchequer and the other half - to the rates? Not a bit of it. Nobody knows where they are going. (Laughter and cheers.) All we do know is that the land values of Manchester are not going to Manchester, but we do not know where else \u2013 whether to a bog in Ireland, or a mountain in Wales \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 or wherever it may be. (Cheers.) They are, at all events, not going to Manchester, and the whole point of these observations of mine is this - taxation of land valuation - or, at all events, the principles I have enunciated - means a dropping of the rates. What the Budget does is to select a par­ticular form of property - it may belong to the rich, it may belong to the poor, it may belong to any class of the community at all and isolates it and puts it on a special taxation. Now let me tell you that you cannot do that avowedly, of set purpose, and as a principle of your Budget without endangering that security which is the very basis of all enterprises whether in Lancashire or elsewhere. (Cheers.) A correspondent has been kind enough to send me this morning an extract from a Socialist newspaper of repute - (laughter) - which seems to me to bear precisely on this point. The three lines which I am going to read to you are very well worth the study especially of Liberal politicians. (Laugh­ter.) I will read you three lines. \u2018The Liberal Party,\u2019 says this Socialist organ, \u2018is digging its own grave by using arguments against the landowner which are at least applicable to capitalists.\u2019 I do not think that Socialists are practical, but they are logical, and there is not the slightest doubt that what this Socialist organ says is absolutely true. (Cheers.) You cannot invent a series of work like this which the present Government has invented against not merely a particular kind of property in general, but a particular kind of land with which I am glad to say I have no connection.The Security of PropertyThe so-called popular part of the Budget requires the serious attention of the working classes.The Government cannot invent or use these arguments without destroying the security of every kind of property. If you think a rich man ought to pay more than he does to the national needs tax him according to his wealth, but do not tax him according to the kind of property he holds or happens to have. (Cheers.) Nothing will justify that, nothing will justify it in policy. It is very difficult to frame systems of taxation which shall be fair all round, but these people are doing it on purpose. (Cheers.) It is not an unhappy incident of their Budget, it was the object of their Budget, and an object like that destroys all security, and my Socialist friend whom I quoted is absolutely right, and the Liberal Party are undermining their position by using arguments against one particular kind of property which, in the words of the article, are at least as applicable to the capitalist as they are to the landlord. (Hear, hear.) Let Lancashire, and let Britain, beware of anything which shall render a man insecure in the possession of that which he has honourably acquired by honourable means, and invested in legal investments. (Cheers.) Cast these principles to the winds, and, in my judgment, you will have done more to prompt the owners of capital to employ it else­where, to diminish the employment of your people, to aggravate the evils under which we all suffer, than any other kind of legislation, any other kind of either wisdom or folly, in the matter of arrangement of tariffs, can possibly produce. I feel that it is this part of the Budget, so-called popular part of the Budget, which requires the serious attention of the working classes of this country, more than any other part; and it is to that part of the Budget that I would I respectfully invite them to give their attention. Don\u2019t let them entertain the folly of supposing that they are attacking a rich class. They are doing nothing of the kind. They are first attacking the owner, rich or poor. If you attack the mortgagee you attack the debenture holder, and if you attack the debenture holder you are not far from attacking the shareholder, and there comes into our competitive system of modern industry that fear of insecurity you have rashly produced at the base of your fabric, and which will spread through every vein and fibre of the system. (Cheers.) After what I have said, is there a man or woman who doubts that the issue which the Government have raised with this Budget is one of the greatest questions before the country within the memory of most who are present here tonight. If it be an issue of that gravity, who is going to decide it? (Cries of \u2018The people.\u2019)What Happened in 1906Is it going to be the Chinese Labour Majority? (\u2018No!\u2019 and cheers.) Is it going to be the Chinese Labour majority of 1906? If it is, can we any longer really maintain that the people of this country manage there own affairs? Was there anybody in 1906 who foresaw a Budget of this character? (\u2018No,\u2019 cheers, and a Voice: \u2018Only Churchill.\u2019) Even he (Mr. Churchill) kept his prophetic powers secret. (Cheers.) Compare the treatment which two successive Governments have given to two great fiscal issues. The fiscal controversy, as you all know, was raised before the late Government left office. We always said it had never been before the people of the country, that they had never had an opportunity of pronouncing on it, and that it would have been a misuse of the majority which we were given in 1900 if that majority had been used to press forward Tariff Reform. We may have been right or we may have been wrong - that was our view. Now this Government have not the smallest right to come forward with these novel, and, as I think, dangerous proposals - (cheers) - force them through the House of Commons in these endless sittings, and then make them law before the people of the country had had a word to say on the subject. (Cheers.) For my own part, there­fore, I rejoice to see that Lord Lansdowne - (prolonged cheers) - has embodied in one concise and complete phrase the whole doctrine I have endeavoured to preach to you. He has moved, or he has put down on the paper to be moved next Monday, a resolution which, as you know, is couched in these words:'That this House (the House of Lords) is not justified in giving its consent to this Bill until it has been submitted to the judgment of the country.'(Loud and prolonged cheers.) Your cheers tell me that, at all events, in your judgement, he was amply justified in the course which he has taken. (Hear, hear.) And surely that is so. I am not going to weary you - (cries of \u2018Go on\u2019) - with antiquarian law as to the precise historic position of the House of Lords in connection with money Bills.Duty of the House of LordsTo see that there shall be referred to the people that which concerns the people.Like all histories of the evolution of our institutions, there are controverted points in it.  It is difficult to reduce it to an absolutely coherent or logical theory. And to all events I do not mean to deal with it tonight. I mean to take broader grounds. Nobody really doubts that Mr. Glad­stone was right when he said that the House of Lords were perfectly justified in rejecting a Budget - technically it was within their power as part of the constitutional machinery of the country, to carry out this course. No one really doubts that. Again, I imagine nobody doubts that the course is a grave one; that it involves a serious responsibility and raises important issues. We are all agreed in these two propositions, I think. I am going to suggest a third one, which you won\u2019t find in the textbooks of con­stitutional lawyers, which has been embodied in no resolution I know of either to the House of Lords or to the House of Commons, but never­theless is a most important element to the free institutions under which we live. What is the principle? The principle is that the old equality between the two Chambers has been modified in the course of time, and that we all recognise that it is a representative Chamber which in most respects takes a leading share, and has a leading responsibility in proposing legisla­tion, and more especially in dealing with money Bills. But there is another side than that. While the House of Lords is no longer, as I think, in the position that many people supposed it to be, let us say, one hundred years ago, of co-equal authority, it will be absolutely fatal to the free institutions of this country if you were to deprive it of the power of saying there are some matters of such grave moment on which the country has been ill-informed or with which it has so few opportunities of considering that we much insist that the country shall declare its will before we give our assent. What is the object according to the modern constitutional power. The object of a Second Chamber is not and never has been to prevent the people, the mass of the community, the electorate, the constituencies, determining what policy they shall pursue. It does not exist for that. It is for the purpose of seeing on great issues that the policy which is pursued is not the policy of a temporary majority elected for a different purpose, that represents the several convictions of the people who are returned to the House of Commons for the few years in which they exercise their mandates, and uses the power with which they have endowed it. There are other purposes, important purposes but subsidiary, but the great function which the House of Lords has to perform is to see that the Govern­ment of this country is a popular Government. (Hear, hear.) What it has to do on this fortunately rare, but all the more important, occasion is to insist that this or that Ministry, powerful for the time, whose powerful principles - no longer powerful it may be - that this or that Ministry is not to be clothed with that all-tyrannical power we have done so much to prevent. (Hear, hear.) The object is to see that there shall be referred the people that which concerns the people, and that the people shall not be betrayed by hasty legislation, interested legislation, legislation having had, it may be, some electoral object in view, or some vindictive policy to carry out (Cheers.) They exist in order to see that before such abuses are permitted, the country, at all events, shall make itself responsible for the action, and if the action ends in disaster, the country, and the country alone, will have to beat the responsibility. That course Lord Lansdowne has recommended the House of Lords to take. He has asked them, or is going to ask them, on Monday next, to take such action as will compel the constituencies of this country to be consulted before they commit themselves to a scheme which I, at all events, from my heart believe inimical to the interests of the poor. (Cheers.) Is he wrong? (Voices: \u2018No.\u2019) He is abundantly right. Never was there an occasion on which this power vested by Constitution in the Second Chamber could be more legitimately exercised. It may be a matter of doubt how the country will pronounce. (Cries of \u2018No.\u2019) You and I may hold that good sense, honesty, public interest, the recognition of all that is involved in public faith and public security will ensure that this unhappy Budget will be rejected just as we may hope, and as I do hope, that a wiser system of taxation, one more suited to modern times, to modern necessities - (hear, hear) - to the modern difficulties of a great producti­ve country may be put in its place.The Great IssueWhatever be the issue which is going to take place before the only final tribunal of arbitrament that we know, whatever the final issue of that trial, I say that Lord Lansdowne is right - (cheers) - and unless I greatly mistake the temper which this great meeting has shown, unless I am wholly wrong in my estimate of the feeling which prevails with increasing strength day by day, week by week, in every constituency in the country, we may yet hope that our countrymen will show now, as they have ever done in crises so many and so varied in our long history, that moderation and that resolution which has prevented our suffering from any of the catastrophes that have visited our neighbours, and that it may yet please Heaven to see us through all the difficulties, and they are not small, which beset our path both as an industrial and as a military community in the near future. These, ladies and gentlemen, are the thoughts suggested to me on this great occasion by the crisis in which we find ourselves. I believe that you feel as I feel, and that all of us are prepared to come forward and take our part in the contest which is before us, knowing that the contest will be severe, knowing that it will involve sacrifice, labour, and energy on the part of any one of us, and knowing also that in its results are involved great issues for good and evil for the country and for the empire to which we belong. (Pro­longed cheers.)

aVMy Lord Duke, ladies and gentlemen; I do not care to think how many years in succession I have taken a part in the pro­ceedings of the National Union, or how often I have been one of the speakers at the great meeting with which our proceedings conclude. But surely never, never in our whole history, have we met at a moment more full of great possibilities for the nation, the empire, and the party, than we do at this moment. (Cheers.) Surely never have we come together to consult over the great political issues of the day with a fuller consciousness that on the decision to which the country may come within a few weeks hence de­pend the prosperity, the security, the reputation for political sobriety, which hitherto we have enjoyed among all other nations according to the judgment of even our severest critics. Now, we are met at a moment in which every mist of misrepresenta­tion seems to exhale from the unauthorised reports of what went on at the recent conference. Don\u2019t believe a word of them. (Cheers.) Don\u2019t believe that there was the smallest want of absolute unanimity in all those on whom was thrown the duty of representing your interests, your views, your policy, at a conference which I believe - although ineffectual and unfruitful as it has proved - will not be without good results to the country, and which may well be a precedent for other conferences deal­ing with great national interests which may miti­gate the evils incident to party divisions.The DecisionAnd don\u2019t you believe for one instant that the decision at which we arrived is one which, had you had all the facts before you, you would have dissented from. On the contrary, I am perfectly certain that we should have been regarded as traitors to our cause had we gone further than we did go, further than we did go in the direction of that peace and goodwill between the Parties which, I readily admit, our four Radical colleagues in the conference were anxious to further. (Hear, hear.) I readily admit I believe we all desired an agreement, but if we had agreed upon the only terms upon which the agreement was possible you would have regarded us as not supporting, but as betraying your cause. (\u2018Hear, hear,\u2019 and cheers.) Well, my lords and gentlemen, the conference has unhappily failed, and now rumour will have it that we are to be met with a surprise election. These military surprises, as history shows, are full of disappointments - (laughter) - for those who attempt them - (laughter and cheers) - and I observe that already the Government forces have suffered under a kind of misfortune to which all surprise expe­ditions are liable, and that one ardent recruit - (laughter) - in the shape of the Home Secretary - ­(laughter) - has already fired off his rifle - (laughter) - before he was within range of the enemy. (Laughter and cheers.)Forewarned, Forearmed!We are forewarned, and being forewarned, we are forearmed - (cheers) - and, believe me, we look forward to the fight, whenever it takes place, with full confidence of the results. (Cheers.) We are prepared to meet our opponents across the floor of the House of Commons and the House of Lords - (cheers) - if that is what they want, but if they prefer to put this question in December, on an old register with general inconvenience, before the constituencies within the next few days, again we are ready. (Loud cheers.) We believe in our cause; we believe in our countrymen, and as your chairman has most justly said, we propose to wage no defensive warfare. (Cheers.) We are not going to wait within our lines until we are attacked. (Cheers.)Domestic and Imperial PolicyWe are going to show the country that we have a policy, an Imperial policy - (cheers) - a domestic policy - (cheers) - both of them consistent with our great traditions, both of them, as we believe, carry­ing with them infinite advantages to the whole community within these islands, each of them carry­ing out, and bringing to fruition, that long history of British freedom, in which we have never shown, in which the nation has never shown itself in­capable of moulding and developing our old traditional institutions, copied and ill-copied as they have been in other parts of the world -  incapable of moulding these institutions to meet our needs, so that we shall remain in the future what we have been in the past, the model and the mirror of all that a free and self-governing community should be, the guardians of everything valuable in the way of national self-development, of individual freedom - (cheers) - of sobriety of judgment, and of Imperial patriotism, qualities on which the empire has been based, and which, if we abandon them, or which if they abandon us, the empire, believe me, is inevitably doomed. (Hear, hear.) Now, my lords and gentlemen, the difficulty of a speaker on this annual occasion is that he is expected to survey the whole field of party politics, and it is impossible to do that. It is absolutely impossible, in any detail, and I must ask this audience, representing as they do every part of England, to take what I say tonight in connection with other speeches that I have made quite recently, develop­ing what, at all events, my friends and I conceive to be the true policy of the Unionist party. I must therefore be forgiven, and I know that you will forgive me, if I pass with only a reference - a mention - over such immense questions as the Osborne judgement and our land policy. I have dealt with those in quite recent utterances. (Hear, hear.) I have dealt with them at considerable length, and I won\u2019t repeat what I have previously said except perhaps to emphasise them.The Land ProblemSo far as our land policy is concerned, we as a party desire to see the number of freehold owners, large as it is now in spite of what our enemies say, increased. (Cheers.) We desire to see small occupations, where small occupations are economically possible, and when there are small occupations we desire to see them not occupations at the will of a County Council or of a Government Department, or of what is better for the tenant than either a County Council or a Government Department, a landlord. We desire to see them freehold ownerships. And we desire further to see that those occupiers of land who already have experience and knowledge of what the occupation of land means - we desire to see them where suitable arrangements can be made - sitting tenants, in other words - we desire to see the sitting tenant becoming the sitting owner, as may well often be the case. That is, in accordance with his interests and desires, and the general justice and equity of the situation. (Hear, hear.) Well, these are two big subjects, but I have got some very big things to talk about tonight, and these I must put on one side, for I have often spoken of them before. Neither shall I dwell upon those uncontroversial aspects of social legislation which I believe both sides quite honestly wish to carry into effect - I mean such things as reform of the poor law, or insurance against in­validity. (Hear, hear.) Both of them are great questions. The poor law is a tremendous question. (Hear, hear.)As regards invalidity, we should indeed be false to our own traditions if we did not desire to see the policy of the Workmen\u2019s Insurance Act - associated forever with the name of Mr. Chamberlain - (loud cheers) - extended to those other forms of misfortune which make the competent workman no longer able to support wife and family, or to give his normal contribution to the work of the community, or to support those who naturally look to him and are naturally dependent upon him. (Hear, hear.) These are questions of great difficulty, but they are not questions of party controversy - (hear, hear) - and, worthy as they are of extended treatment, it is not this evening that I propose to treat of them.The Navy What am I to say of another topic, of which I should like to assert that it was outside party, but of which I am not sure whether it is outside party or not - the navy. (Cheers.) On this also I have pleaded in the House of Commons and out of the House of Commons - (hear, hear) - ever since it became evident that through the unhappy policy of the Government we had allowed ourselves to be approached in the race for naval supremacy by another great Power on the Continent. Whenever I have so pleaded I have been accused of being animated by party motives. A more baseless charge - (\u2018Hear, hear,\u2019 and cheers) - never was levelled at any leader of Opposition. I venture to say, and my friends around me who have been associated in the work of opposition with me for these four or five years, that never in the history of an Opposition has so much trouble been taken to keep foreign questions and questions affecting the defence of the empire as far as may be possible away from all political controversy. (Hear, hear.) But after all, my lords and gentlemen, the navy is the very basis of our whole national and Imperial structure. (Cheers.) There is no use thinking what your order of architecture is going to be if your foundations are rotten. All these controversies that divide parties - as to the constitution of a Second Chamber, or whether there shall be a. Second Chamber - I won\u2019t go over the whole list - what do they matter unless the British Empire itself is based solidly and securely upon sea power. (Prolonged cheers.) They matter nothing. Why talk about unconsidered trifles not worthy of the anxiety of a practical man unless we can look round the world and say with assurance, we are secure whoever comes against us. (Cheers.)A Determined FightWhether or not the Government have now awoken out of their sleep, whether or not they do seriously propose to deal with the situation, which is full of peril, I know not. If they are still slumbering, no matter what charges of partisanship are levelled against us, we will fight for a strong navy. (Cheers.) If they have awoken we shall support them - (cheers) - we shall support them in the House of Commons against either the less patriotic or the more short-sighted element in their own party­ - (cheers) - and never will we attempt to make capital out of any effort that they may make to put the empire back again in the situation in which it was five or six years ago. (Cheers.) There are two questions which I must mention, otherwise I know I shall be reproached for having left them alone, but on which, with all I have got to say to you, it is quite impossible that I shall dwell. I mean the way we should deal - the way the party should deal, and insofar as they have power to deal - with the provisions of the Budget. Those are two questions which I believe have been thoroughly thrashed out today at the conference. I could not be present myself but that I under­stand to be the case. I would only say this: In our opinion it is absolutely necessary that we should do what we can to remedy the gross injus­tice which has been done to the licence holders - (cheers) - who have been treated, as we have often pointed out before, as no legitimate interest has ever been treated before. (Cheers.)Agricultural LandAs far as the other controversial branch - or one of the other controversial branches I ought to say - of the Budget are concerned, we think that the avowed policy of the Government should be explicitly em­bodied in legislation that agricultural land - agriculture already overburdened, already unduly taxed - should be wholly free, as they admit that it ought to be, from the oppressive action of the new taxes; that the serious effects which, as I am told, are being produced on the building trade and on all that depends on, or is connected with, the building trade, should be, insofar as possible, relieved. But, above all, if you are going to raise taxes from urban land, those taxes should go to the city communities in which the land is situated. (Cheers.) They should be used as they ought to be used, for the territory in which the land is situated, and not be dissipated broadcast over the whole area of the country with which they have no direct connection whatever. (Hear, hear.)Tariff ReformNow I comp to the three big questions on which I shall engage your attention for the rest of my speech. The first of these questions is tariff reform. (Loud and prolonged cheers.) Perhaps you will say what new have you got to tell us about tariff reform! (Laughter.) On the principles of tariff reform, ladies and gentlemen, I have nothing new to say. Tariff reform stands where it did. (Cheers.) It is now, what it has been for years past, the great constructive policy to which, in my judgment, the party stands committed. (Cheers.) I am told by some political observers - (laughter) - that tariff reform has lost its popularity - (laughter) - or at all events lost some of its popularity - (No, no) - since trade became good. (Laughter.) Well, a very able friend of mine on this platform has explained to the conference today that in his judgment the supposed improvement of trade is largely illusory. I hope it is not, but I venture to suggest that whether trade is good or whether it is bad, whether it is better or whether it is worse, has nothing whatever to do with the great policy of tariff reform. Whatever tariff policy you adopt, whether it be the foolish one which we now accept as traditional, or whether it be some extravagant aberrations in the other direction such as are adopted by some foreign countries - whatever policy you adopt, this, at all events, is certain: there will be ups in trade and downs in trade, oscillations will take place, there will be improvements and deteriorations. That has nothing to do with, and ought not to move by a hair\u2019s breadth the judgment of any rational man as to what policy his country ought to adopt. It would be as reasonable to say that the improve­ment of trade, if there be an improvement, is due to Free Trade as to say that the increased price of living is due to Free Trade. (Laughter and cheers.)The Price of LivingIt is undeniable, it is common pro­perty of all parties, that the price of living for the poor has increased, and it has increased under a Free Trade Govern­ment. (Hear, hear.) I can\u2019t help thinking what would have happened if precisely the same increase had occurred under a fiscal reform Government. (Laughter.) I haven\u2019t the slightest doubt that at this moment the rooms of the Radical central office are choked to the ceiling with placards about the price of food, ready to be issued as soon as the word is given that a dissolution is imminent. What would those placards have been if the rise in the price of food which has occurred in the last few years had occurred when tariff reform was in force? (Hear, hear.) Is there a single Free Trade lecturer, is there a single Minister of the Crown, who would not have gone about saying, \u2018Now you see the result - (laughter and cheers) - this is what we always told you would come (laughter) - the poor have got to pay more for the necessaries of life. You think you have got a great advantage to the country. But who are the sufferers?\u2019 And tongues more eloquent than mine - (\u2018No, no\u2019) - painters with a command of a more lurid shade of colour­ - (laughter) - would have pictured the misery of the poor brought about by tariff reform. (Cheers.) Well, fortunately or unfortunately, it is under Free Trade, and not under tariff reform, that food has risen in price. (Hear, hear.) I do not for a moment suggest - my methods are quite antiquated - (laughter) - and I am quite unable, however willing I might be, to imitate the happy methods of my opponents, and, therefore, I do not for a moment suppose that food has risen because trade is free. Of course it is not.There are these great oscillations in price, as there are great oscillations in trade, and what we have always said is - and surely we have said it truly - that any variation in the price of living which could by any conceivable possibility follow upon the sort of duties contemplated by tariff reformers would be lost, drowned, submerged - would altogether vanish - in comparison with the natured oscillations to which we are all accus­tomed, and to which we all have to submit. (\u2018Hear, hear,\u2019 and cheers.) Now, my lords and gentlemen, I told you that I had nothing to say new about tariff re­form, nor have I as regards its principles.Necessity for ChangeBut who can watch the course of events even since the last general election, and not have borne in upon them with increased strength the absolute necessity for some change in our fiscal system? What are the foreign markets? What are the markets outside these islands on which we have to depend very largely. Very largely they are tropical markets, markets which are not under the control of great industrial communities. Directly they get under the control of great industrial communities what happens? You are put at a disadvantage then and there. Look what has happened in Korea, look what has happened in Japan. Japan is now one of the great Powers, and has followed the example of every other great Power except Great Britain - (cheers) - in protecting, safeguarding her own manufactures, and she has taken care not merely to safeguard her own manufactures, but she has put you at a disadvantage in a market which was once open to you along with the rest of the world, namely Korea. Are we to blame her? (\u2018No.\u2019) Certainly not. She has followed the universal example. And again, are we to look on at this universal example - (\u2018No\u2019) - with perfect serenity, a smiling countenance, and an approving nod? Are we, in other words, to find ourselves, and ourselves alone among the great commercial nations of the world without any weapon what­ever - (\u2018No\u2019) - for seeing that we get fair ­play in those markets on which the very livelihood of our population depends? (Hear, hear.) And if I turn to other markets, if I turn to the markets presented not by tropical regions, not by regions hitherto free from the domination of great indus­trial communities - if I turn to the self-governing portions of the empire, are there no lessons to be learned there as to the imminent and present necessity of fiscal reform? (Hear, hear.)Trying the Sister StatesI say that you are trying the self-governing and sister States of which this empire consists, you are trying them too highly when you defer indefinitely making any response to the preference which they so generously and gladly give to the mother coun­try. Canada is naturally, necessarily, rightly making its own arrangements, utterly irrespective of our Foreign Office, or our Board of Trade, with this foreign or that foreign country. How could she do otherwise? We refuse to have anything to do in the way of reciprocity with her. (\u2018Shame.\u2019) Naturally, while she maintains steadily her desire for Imperial preference she must consider her own interests. She is bound to consider her own interests. She is bound, there­fore, to make treaties which may hamper the future of that fiscal union among different parts of the empire, that increased Free Trade from one end of his Majesty\u2019s dominions to the other, which is the ideal of the fiscal reformer, and surely ought to be the ideal of every Free Trader. (Cheers.) Every class must gain by tariff reform, and if every class did not gain, and especially if the working classes did not gain, what would be the use of it? But we are told by some who are strong - un­doubtedly very strong and consistent fiscal reformers - we are told that the working classes are afraid that the burden of a reform of which they admit the benefits, shall be thrown upon their shoulders out of all due proportion. Well, all I can say is that whatever were the benefits of tariff reform, if those benefits can only be purchased by throwing additional burdens upon the shoulders of the wage-earning classes in this country, I would not touch it. (Loud cheers.)To Benefit Wage Earners The whole object I have in view, the whole object my friends have in view, is to benefit the wage earning class. Then they say to me, \u2018Well, it may be a benefit in one way to the wage earning class, but, after all, it will increase\u2019 - and this is the eternal refrain - \u2018it will increase the price of living to the working classes.\u2019 I say it will not. (Cheers.) I say it will not for two reasons, which are quite distinct, and which I do beg of you who have got thrown upon you the duty of explaining this question in different parts of the country, thoroughly to understand. They are quite different reasons. This first reason why I say it will not throw any additional burden on the working classes is one about which there may be controversy. I say it won\u2019t throw a burden, because it is ludicrous, as I think, to suppose that when your duty - on wheat, let us say - is confined to foreign wheat alone­ (cheers) - the cost of bread can be increased by any appreciable amount. That is my belief. I go fur­ther, and I say that even those who put at the highest possible the increase in the price of the loaf that would be made by fiscal reform, it is so small that it would not make a workman go from Nottingham to Derby if the price of bread at Nottingham were higher than the price of bread at Derby by the amount which this could possibly place on bread. (Hear, hear.) I say further with regard to that part of the argument that the duty of which I speak must expand those great fields of wheat supply, unlimited in amount, largely situated within the empire, from which wheat will come in free, and will come in freer and cheaper the more you encourage the extension of agriculture in those vast wheat-producing fields. (Cheers.) I put it very concisely; but that is one half of the argument. Believe me, it is not the most important part of the argument as far as this par­ticular calumny is concerned.No Increase to Cost of LivingI go further, and I say, grant for the sake of argument that the price of bread (we will say) is increased, it shall not increase the cost of living to the working man. (Cheers.) Now con­sider the great mass of voters in this country belong to the wage-earning class. They pay, they are ready to pay, they know they ought to pay, and they do pay a share of the heavy and increasing burdens which modern Governments exact from modern citizens. How do they pay it? They pay it in the shape of indirect taxes on articles they consume habitually - tea, sugar, tobacco, beer, and so on - (A Voice: \u2018Cocoa!\u2019) - yes, and cocoa. (Laughter and cheers.) The pledge I give, on behalf of the party which for the time being I represent, is that no increase, if increase be pos­sible or be imagined in the cost of living due to any change in these taxes on articles or consump­tion in consequence of tariff reform, shall fall on the working man\u2019s Budget with increased severity, because we have it in our power, and the power shall be exercised - (loud cheers) - we have the power of reducing those other indirect taxes, the taxes, for example, on tea and on sugar, At all events, on the consumption of the working man - that is the point - it shall fully compensate for any loss, if loss there be, which I do not admit. Do observe that these are two quite separate arguments, and it is no answer to the first to enter into a long discussion as to whether a 2s. duty on foreign corn will increase the price of bread, and how much it would increase it. I do not think it would increase it, but, grant that it does increase it, no working man or work­ing woman shall suffer thereby. (Cheers.) It is possible that some of our opponents may dis­believe the promise. It is probable that many of them will misrepresent it. (\u2018Hear, hear,\u2019 and laughter.) I venture to say that it is impossible, even for the author of a Radical leaflet, to mis­understand it. (\u2018Hear, hear,\u2019 and cheers.) Well, perhaps you will say that is all old. It may be old, but it is worth repeating. I hope I have repeated it clearly and explicitly. (Cheers.)The House of LordsI now come to what is new. I now come to the House of Lords, the question of the House of Lords. I gather from the utterances of distinguished Cabinet Ministers - (laughter) - who seem tumbling over each other to be the first in the field - (laughter) - with a showy misrepresentation that in their view the reason the conference failed was because a certain number of obstructive Tory peers refused to see the necessity of any change whatever in the existing system, I am conscious that I do great in­justice to the vigour of their statements, and I have not got their words here, but if I remember rightly they suggest that there are a body of six hundred and odd gentlemen on one side, a body of forty millions and odd on the other, and that the six hundred-odd gentlemen on the one side are constantly occupied in refusing to grant the most reasonable requests preferred by the forty millions on the other side. (Laughter.) Considering that the charge against the House of Lords is that it is too Unionist, and that the Unionists in this country do not differ numerically very much from the collection of parties who are non-Unionist - (laughter) - and considering that whatever difference there may be will not improbably be a difference in favour of the Unionists after the next election - (hear, hear) - against the collection of parties who are non-Unionist, this arithmetical division of the community in the 600 and something peers, and 40 million and something people who are not peers, but who are always being deprived of what they want by those who are peers - it appears, it seems to me - (loud laughter) - to be a picture of contemporary politics which is so unlikely, it hardly amounts to a caricature. Now let us leave this region of Bengal lights and fairy lamps for the reality, for the daylight reality of facts.Let me venture to lay before you as briefly as I can what I regard as the true policy that this country ought to pursue with re­gard to the Second Chamber - (hear, hear) - May I lay down these propositions? In the first place I say a Second Chamber is necessary. (Cheers.) Every great country in the world has a Second Chamber, and in most great countries the Second Chamber is a more powerful element in the Constitution than our Second Chamber is at the present moment. Very well, that is my first proposition. My second proposition is that if you have got a Second Chamber it must be a real and not a sham Second Chamber. (Cheers.) It must exercise that moderating influence upon the legislation for which Second Chambers exist, which they exercise in all sound Constitutions.The Dominant ElementI lay down a third proposition, which is that in a Constitution consisting of two Chambers, it is not the Second Chamber which should be the dominant one, but it is the so-called popular Chamber, it is the immediately representative Chamber, it is the House of Commons which is now, which for genera­tions has been, and which, in my opinion ought to remain in that co-partnership, the dominant element. I lay down these three propositions which I believe every constitutionalist of every nation will probably agree to. Now what are the evils that we have got to try and mitigate in any reform of this two-Chamber system, granting that it is to be a real two-Chamber system. We have got, in the first place, to remedy the deadlock. Deadlocks have been grossly exaggerated. (Cheers.) You would really suppose that when an ardent young Cabinet Minister - (laughter) - is describing the tyranny which a Second Chamber exercises over the first, that the first had never been able to do anything good or useful for the people, Well, when they admit they have done nothing good or useful for the people since 1906 - when that is admitted by them - I will consider the force of their argument about dead-locks. But I quite agree that it is not a good system. It is not a whole­some state of things when there are two Chambers so widely diversified in political complexion as were the House of Commons in 1906 and the House of Lords at the same time. I agree to that. Very well. That is one of the things that has to be dealt with. Then will you agree with me in another proposition, which is that if the two Chambers dissent, and if the ques­tion on which they dissent is of sufficient importance, there is but one arbiter? (Hear, hear.)The PeopleThat arbiter is the people of the country. (Loud cheers.) What nonsense it is to talk of the 600 peers on the one side and the 40 millions on the other, when all we ask is that there should be an appeal both from the 600 in the Second Chamber and the 600 in the Lower Chamber, to the people on whom both depend and for whose interests both exist. (Cheers.) The misrepresentation is patent, and the folly of the statement is equally clear. Before I tell you what I think ought to be done with the House of Lords, I have only one more proposition to lay before you, and that is that on any reformed Second Chamber you should graft your reform upon the Second Chamber which has been handed down to you from immemorial times. That is the way a great and continuous Constitu­tion is built up. We have never, and it is our glory, broken with the past. (Cheers.) We are built on the past. We have never thought that the past was to dominate us. We have always thought that the past could give us material, institutions, traditions of which we could make use for purposes of the present. (Hear, hear.) That is sound statesmanship - (cheers) - and it was sound statesmanship at one time. It used to be common to both great parties in the State, although I see symptoms which somewhat disquiet me on that point. (Hear, hear.) Now, then. I have told you the general principle. I have told you within what limits we ought to work. Now let me tell you how I think the thing should be done. (Loud cheers.) Remember, in the first place, that the House of Lords under Lord Rosebery\u2019s guidance has accepted the principle that no man, merely be­cause he is a hereditary peer, should have a right to a legislative seat in that Assembly. (Hear, hear.) That has been done. That is not a declaration of opinion which we still await with anxiety; that is a declaration of opinion which is on record. (Cheers.)The Working Second ChamberAnother point, on which I believe all are agreed, is that the second, the working Second Chamber should be greatly diminished in numbers. (Hear, hear.) On that, I think, there need be, and ought to be, no controversy. The third proposition I lay down is that in this diminished Chamber should sit persons qualified by admitted public service. (Hear, hear.) Do consider how much richer the Second Chamber is, and must always be, under our present system, how much richer it is for a certain amount of administrative and Impe­rial experience. All the great pro-Consuls, to use the cant phrase, all belong to the Second Chamber, your greatest soldiers, your governors, your greatest civil servants, all are members of the Second Chamber - never, or hardly ever, of the House of Commons. And don\u2019t suppose that that is an old and forgotten tradition. Don\u2019t suppose that it is one of the rags and relics of a feudal past. (Laughter.) Within the last few months, the present Government have appointed three Commoners to great positions representing their Sovereign abroad. They made every one of them a peer. (Laughter.) The Governor of New Zealand, a respected mem­ber of the House of Commons - once a member of our party - has been made a peer. The late Home Secretary has been sent to repre­sent the King in South Africa - Mr. Gladstone becomes Lord Gladstone. One of the greatest and most difficult posts in the whole empire has just been filled by a most distinguished public servant, Sir Charles Hardinge, and Sir Charles Hardinge is now Lord Hardinge. Are you going to deprive yourselves of this wealth of administrative experience which, by the action of every Government, Radical and Unionist, is supplied by the House of Lords, and is not supplied and cannot be supplied by the House of Commons. The thing is absurd. I, therefore, assume I carry you with me, and I believe I carry every sober man in the country with me in saying that these qualified members of the House shall be members of the Second Chamber. Then I think there should be an element in the House of Lords selected by the peers. I am sure that is right. (Hear, hear.) It carried on the tradition, it keeps the continuity, and whatever may be said against the members of the Second House in their collective capacity, there is very little to be said against the members of the Second House in the districts where they live. (\u2018Hear, hear,\u2019 and cheers.)External OpinionI have given you two elements now, observe, in the Second Chamber as I desire to see it reformed. But there is a third element which should at least equal the other two together, and that is an element brought into the Second Chamber by some external machinery, election or otherwise, but not by the Second Chamber itself, brought in from outside, forming an integral part of the body, representing, if the other members do not represent it - (laughter) - representing the community at large, the move­ments of public ideas, great bodies of external public opinion. This elected or selected body, if selected - not selected by the House of Lords itself - this elected or selected body should at least be equal, in my judgment, to the peers who sit there by right of public service, or the peers who sit there by election among their fellows. (Cheers.) Now, if you have a body of that kind, if you go beyond that, and have a body elected throughout, what is the inevitable result? The inevitable re­sult will be in this country, as it has been in other countries, that the Second Chamber usurps the position of the First Chamber. You cannot have an elected Second Chamber, taken out of the very elite of the community, having behind them their electorate as we in the House of Commons have behind us our electorate, you cannot have them there and keep them in a subordinate position. They will be the respected, they will be the dominating assembly as they are in France, and as they are in America. (Cheers.)Does Not Want an Elected ChamberI, therefore, for my own part, speaking now as a member of the House of Commons - I don\u2019t want to see an elected Second Chamber. (Cheers.) I do want to see a Second Chamber which has, and feels that it has in its members, men who owe their position there not to hereditary right, not to what is rather ludicrously called an accident of birth, but to some other cause more in harmony with modern theories of government. If you do that, you will have what I conceive to be the ideal. You will have a Second Chamber to which nobody can point and say, \u2018This represents 670 gentlemen who have nothing but their fathers to boast of.\u2019 (Laughter.) You will have a Second Chamber which will, I believe, carry with it the consent and respect of all, which will carry out those great functions which we must have carried out by a Second Chamber - the moderate functions which will have power, but not too much power, which will be a real Second Chamber, and will yet not drive the House of Commons from its position of priority. That is the policy I recommend. Perhaps you will say to me, \u2018this may be a very good ideal of reform, but it will take time. Why not settle at once the relations between the two houses before you set to work to reform the Second Chamber?\u2019 (Hear, hear.) I am glad to find that there is one gentleman at the back of the hall who feels the force of the contention, which I know, is felt strongly by the other side. The answer which I have to give is, in my opinion, complete, and I believe I shall convince my friend. I have told you that on great occasions when the Houses differ, the only appeal can be, and ought to be, to the people them­selves. (Cheers.) But you cannot, of course, ap­peal either by referendum or general election - you cannot appeal to the people on every small occasion. That is granted.DeadlocksWell, then, how are you going to deal with dead­locks? You can only deal with deadlocks by an amicable conference, between the two Houses, or by a joint sitting, in which the House of Commons shall have added to it members of the House of Lords, from a Second Chamber, or from the members of a Second Chamber. If that be granted, I put this question to every man who wishes seriously to consider the problem - and a most difficult problem it is - how can you settle these joint sittings, unless you know by whom Second Chamber is to be composed? I don\u2019t suppose that those whom I am addressing have been thinking over this problem as I have been for the last five months, but observe, if you cannot have the two Houses sitting together entirely, and that may be - I don\u2019t say it is impossible, far from it - but it may be impossible, the proportion in which the Second Chamber will be required in the joint sit­tings must depend on the constitution of the Second Chamber, and cannot be settled until the constitution of the Second Chamber is settled. You are driven to that conclusion by irresistible logic. If you attempt to make a permanent arrangement with regard to the two Houses, or to alter the constitution of the Second Chamber, I tell you, you postpone the alteration of the Second House inde­finitely. You cannot re-alter your arrangements when you have reformed or re-altered the con­stitution of the Second House. You must do it, you can only do it, as part of a great settlement which places upon a new and permanent basis a bi­cameral, a two-Chamber system, adequate, fitted to deal with all modern necessities, and all modern problems, which shall not merely give that security to the Constitution which men of all parties ought to desire; but which will give to our opponents that which they so passionately claim, viz., the power of carrying out great reforms - or what they conceive to be great reforms. (Laughter.) When they are sent back in a majority to the House, without the fear that if the people of this country are on their side, it will be in the power of any Second Chamber to resist their will (Hear, hear) It is no effort to make the Constitution a mere instrument in the hands of one party. It is an honest and a genuine attempt to give that security which two Chambers alone can give, to give it without the destruction, the permanent destruction, of the House of Commons, to give it in a form which will graft the new institutions upon the old institutions which we have inherited from our fathers, and to give even to the gentleman who thinks himself most progressive, every hope of carrying any change, however important, if only he has behind him the great mass of the people of this country. (Cheers.)The Threatened RevolutionsMy lords and gentlemen, I really am ashamed of the length of time I have been speaking - (cries of \u2018Go on.\u2019) - but I want to ask one question, and really it leads to the conclusion of the whole matter. It is represented, mark you, the revolution of the Government Veto Bill, in its recent form, is presented to you as if it was the wish of the people of this country. At whose wish is this revolution to be undertaken and carried through? (Cries of \u2018Redmond.\u2019) Not at the wish of the Unionist party, not at the wish of the traditional Liberal and Radical party. (Hear; hear) The driving force behind this revolution are two other parties - (hear, hear) - two other parties in the State, against whose honesty I make no accusation, but who would almost, I think, themselves admit that in the sense in which we use the word patriotism, they were unpatriotic. (\u2018Hear, hear,\u2019 and cheers.) When these excellent Cabinet Ministers tell you that they represent the people of the country, and that it is in obedience to the passionate will of the people of the country that they are driving you on to this revolution, they are themselves driven on - (cheers) - by these two parties against which the great majority of their own followers are in tacit, if not open rebellion - the Parliamentary Socialist party, which, whenever there is trouble in any part of our complex empire, always takes part against the representatives of this country. They have already captured the organisation of the trades unions, not the members of the trades unions. (Cheers.)Mr. Redmond\u2019s Many PoliciesThey purpose, by a reversal of the Osborne judgement, to turn the trades unions for their old, original, historic purpose, into a great political machine, and if they succeed there is not the slightest doubt that they will destroy not only the trades unions, but the Constitution of this country. (Hear, hear.) Trades unions will cease to be what they ought to be, a great trade protection and benefit, a great association of the wage earners in a trade, and a great benefit association for the wage earners in a trade. They will cease to be that. They will become the mere engine and instrument of those who have social and political revolution as their ultimate ideal. (Hear, hear.) Well, that is one party. Who are the others? (Laughter.) The others are a party of whom at all events we may say this - they are perfectly open and perfectly candid both as to their object and their methods - (hear, hear) - more candid, per­haps, as to their methods than as to their objects (laughter) - because I have to admit on reflection that I am quite unable to understand precisely what the avowed and official policy of the leader of the Irish party is, because it seems to me, though perhaps I am unjust, it seems to me to be a United States policy - (laughter and cheers) - a Canadian policy, and an Irish policy. And I am not sure that he has not got a Westminster policy as well, but that may be because I have not had authentic reports of his speeches, and am unable to collate them; but as to his methods there is no doubt, and it is on the methods I wish you to concentrate your attention. The present Government talk as if they were going to destroy our Constitution in obedience to the will of the British democracy. They are going to destroy the Constitution in obedience to the will of American subscribers. (Cheers.) What does Mr. Redmond say quite openly? He says: \u2018I mean - I, with my 200,000 dollars jingling in my pockets - I mean to use the difficulties and complexities of English political party life to ex­tract for Ireland everything I want.\u2019 He means, in other words, to use our British party system to give himself something, and to give himself and his friends something which neither party wants to give them. (Cheers.) He wants to use the whole of our traditional Parliamentary machinery, our party system with it merits and demerits; he wants to use the existing situation in which we find ourselves, to squeeze out of us, as the conqueror squeezes out of a conquered country, the terms which he insists upon, and that, and that alone, is the real secret of the revolutionary policy of men, who, had they their will, probably are no more revolutionists than you or I. (Laughter and cheers.)Where Parnell StoodDo these Irish gentlemen for a moment pretend that what they want is to improve the British Constitution for the sake of British subjects? (Laughter.) Not at all. \u2018Smash the House of Lords, in order that we may get Home Rule!\u2019 That is their cry. (Hear, hear.) That is almost their words - ­I believe it is their actual words. I believe these are the words which Mr. Redmond has used more than once, both in Ireland and America. At all events, I am not misrepresenting him. Now, is it credible that if the Government insists on an appeal being made to our countrymen, they are going to give up their heritage because this kind of pressure is being put upon the Government partly by Socialists, and partly by Home Rulers? (\u2018No, no.\u2019) It seems to me to be highly incredible. Remember there is no concession on the part of Mr. Redmond, in some of his speeches at all events, with regard to what he wants in the shape of Home Rule. He stands where Mr. Parnell stood. He stands, therefore, exactly where the Irish party stood when, on two successive occasions, the great mass of our fellow countrymen said, \u2018This is not justice to Ireland that you are asking; it is injustice to Great Britain.\u2019 (Cheers.) And it is in order to get what the people of this country have twice refused that he is asking you for all time to shatter your Constitution. And he has asked it by the help of gentlemen whose motives, I am sure, are excellent, but who do not happen to possess the privilege of British citizenship. (Cheers.) Is that the way we are going to be governed? (\u2018No. \u2018)Britain for the BritishIs it to that degree of degradation that party Government is to bring us? I have always been a party man. I have always believed that the destinies of this country were best entrusted to great organised parties in the House of Commons, but if either one - I don\u2019t care which it is - if either of the two great parties in the State, whose be­ginnings go back for 200 years or more, are becom­ing the temporary slaves of this section of Socialists, or that section of Home Rulers, then I say the party system has broken down. (Cheers.) Then we are no longer a self-governing country, and we are not governed either by an absolute monarch or even by hereditary peers. We are governed by a log-rolling faction of men who care nothing for your empire or your country. (Prolonged cheers, the whole audience upstanding.) The appeal I make goes far beyond the limits of this room, it is far beyond the limits of the party to which we all belong. I appeal to every man, whatever his tradition, whatever be his party, or his upbringing, or his state in life. I ask him that Great Britain shall manage the affairs of Great Britain. (Loud cheers, the audience again rising.) And I ask that if and when we alter the fabric of our immemorial Constitution it shall be of our own free will - (loud cheers) - and not at the bidding of those who care nothing for our Constitution and nothing for our history. (Cheers.) So, and so only, can we hope to retain our self-respect as a nation and the respect of those other great nations whose friends and whose rivals we are. (Loud and protracted cheering.)

aVMr. Chairman, my Lords, Ladies, and Gentlemen, I thank you from my heart for the warmth of this reception, but if I am to proceed I shall not speak of it; I shall try not to think of it. I have in my time made many political speeches, but never have I felt so much need of the indulgence of my audience, and never have I been so certain that I should receive it. (Hear, hear and cheers.) My first duty is to express on my own behalf - after the resolution which has been read it is unnecessary to express it on yours - my deep regret at the retirement of the chief who has led us so long. I have always felt, and I feel now, an admiration, not only for the towering intellect - the adjective is none too strong - but for the character of Mr. Balfour which it is impossible for me to exaggerate. (Hear, hear.) No truer words were ever said of any man than the words used the other day by Sir Oliver Lodge about him. I shall read the exact words:Other men, he said could lead a party, but not every one could take the wide survey of human know­ledge, or bring to profound questions the trained intelligence, the critical acumen, and the comprehensive grasp of Mr. Balfour.I see it has been suggested in the Radical Press that the message sent to Mr. Balfour by the Unionist members, though suffi­ciently cordial, contained no invitation to return. Let there be no misunderstanding, ladies and gentlemen. The leaders of the party knew with absolute certainty that he could not reconsider his decision, and that was the reason, and the sole reason, why we did not urge our old leader to return to his old position. (Cheers.) I see also that the kindly suggestion has been made that when Mr. Balfour returns to the House of Com­mons, and asserts again, as he will assert, his old supremacy over the Assembly which he has dominated so long, it will be awkward for me. (Laughter and cheers.) Don\u2019t imagine that such a thought ever enters my mind. (Hear, hear.) Whatever my weaknesses, jealousy is not one of them. (Cheers.) And jealousy on my part towards Mr. Balfour would be ridiculous.There is no one who rejoices more than I in the thought that in the coming struggle for the unity of our country we shall have at our side the man who last led us to victory in the same fight, and who will, I believe, play no small part in securing the victory which will again be ours. (Cheers.) Next to Mr. Balfour, I should like to say that I have seen Lord Lansdowne, the leader of our party in the House of Lords, and I can assure you that no one will work with him more heartily or more willingly for the success of the cause for which we are responsible than I shall do in the future. (Cheers.) Now, ladies and gentlemen, I am sure your attention has been called to it before, and I feel bound to call your attention to it again.Self-Sacrificing ColleaguesIn the whole personal history of the Conservative Party, or indeed in any party, there is nothing of which we have more reason to feel proud than the spirit of self-sacrifice - (hear, hear) - which was shown by Mr. Austen Chamberlain­ (cheers) - who, as you know from the letter which you have just heard read, would have been with us tonight had he not been fighting our battle elsewhere, and by Mr. Walter Long - (cheers) - who is beside me now. As soon as the proposed solution of the leadership was mentioned to me, I at once saw both of those gentle­men. They received me with a generosity which I shall never forget. I should never have undertaken the duties of my new position if I had not known, as I do know, that they had made the proposal not only in the interests of the party, but with a feeling of goodwill and of personal friendship towards myself­ - (cheers) - personal friendship which I am sure will last as long as we live. (Hear, hear.) Now, ladies and gentlemen, I have been received in the same way by all my colleagues on the Front Bench. I cannot mention them all. But I should like to say that from no one have I received a more whole-hearted promise of support than from Sir Edward Carson - (cheers) - and from no one do I value it more. (Hear, hear.)Now, ladies and gentlemen, one word more only on this personal aspect. When I returned to the House of Commons in my new position I received a welcome from our old friends which, when in time difficulties arise, as they will arise, will always be in my mind to call to my recollection how sincere their welcome was towards me. I received also a welcome from my political opponents which touched me. (Hear, hear.) It is not to their interests that our leadership should be effective, and to any one who does not know the House of Commons their welcome might not have seemed a good omen for my success. (Laughter.)I have been long enough a member to know how generous are the instincts of the House of Commons - (hear, hear) - and I was not discouraged. The Radical Press, too, has treated me on the whole not ungenerously. But I have had my attention called to some passages not entirely friendly, and I read them with pleasure. (Laughter.) They have also given me some advice. I am, I think, by nature tolerant of differences of opinion, and I have always believed, and believe now, that it is possible to dislike, even to detest, opinions, whilst still respecting the man who honestly holds those opinions.It is with reference to that subject that the advice was given. It was that in the House of Commons in the future I should not be so rude - (laughter) - as I have been in the past. It is possibly good advice, and I shall at least remember it. (Laughter.) But in the severe, and, I am afraid, bitter fight which lies before us - a fight for everything which we hold dear - (cheers) - I have really no hope of acting in such a way as to satisfy the giver of that advice.First Duty of the PartyI said at the outset that I needed your indulgence. In any case under the circumstances in which we are met here tonight I could not expect to cover the whole field of current political controversy, but I have more than that to say. If anyone supposes that because there has been a change in the leader in the House of Commons there is going to be a new programme he will be disappointed. I do not believe in elaborate, still less in varying programmes. Our opponents tried it. During their period of opposition they had a new programme for every new year. (Laughter.) It was not very successful. Do not let us imitate them.If I can be of any service to the party it will be simply by urging that party to move straightforward without haste, but without rest, to the goal which lies before it. (Loud cheers.) The goal is in the first place to get rid of the present Government - (hear, hear, and laughter) - which from the beginning has been a danger to our country - (hear, hear) - and which now is tearing down the destructive path with ever-increas­ing rapidity.When that is accomplished it will be our duty to face the new problems which new conditions and a new age have brought by new, but by Conservative methods. (Hear, hear.) No Government of which I or my colleagues on this platform are members would ever be a Government purely of reaction. It is quite possible, and I think it probable, that without regard to our merits or demerits if we give the Government a little more rope we may step into their place. (Laughter and cheers.)Under such circumstances there would be a temptation to form a Government simply of resistance, but what would be the result? It would be like building a dam against which the waters would pile themselves in ever-increasing volume. Sooner or later that dam would burst, and the floods would flow with irresistible force, carrying ruin and devastation throughout the land. That is not what we propose. It was once said by Burke, \u2018The desire to preserve and the ability to improve, taken together, would be my standard of a statesman.\u2019 (Hear, hear.) If ever our countrymen entrust us with power it is in the spirit of those words that we shall undertake that trust. (Cheers.)Welsh DisestablishmentNow, ladies and gentlemen, the first of the destruc­tive proposals of the Government to which I shall refer is their determination to destroy the Church of England in Wales. (Hear, hear.) That proposal we shall resist to the utmost of our power. (Cheers.) It is a proposal which has, in my judgment, nothing to justify it - (hear, hear) - which has nothing even to ex­plain it, except prejudice and bigotry. (Cheers.) We have had in Scotland an experience of what disendow­ment means, which, while familiar to me, is probably new to you.There was a Church there called the Free Church of Scotland, which was founded in support of the principle of the State establishment of religion. A few years ago that Church joined with a voluntary Church in Scotland. After the union the courts of law decided that the resources belonged to the small minority which still adhered to the old principle. And what happened? It was felt by every one that if that decision held, a great institution which was doing a great work in Scotland would be crippled.And the British Government, and a Conservative Government - I am proud to have been a member of it - a Conservative Government actually passed through an Act to return to the majority the share of the funds which had legally been taken from it. Now, there is an analogy. Parliament in that case intervened to prevent the weakening of a great Church by depriving it of its resources; Parliament is asked now to intervene for the very reverse purpose - to de­prive a great Church of the resources of which it stands in absolute need. (Cheers.)Ladies and gentlemen, in an age of materialism, and, as I believe, in an age of growing materialism, when any of my friends, for instance, who live in Lon­don, or any of you who visit London, if you choose to go to Hyde Park, will find many orators - always with good voices - (laughter) - advocating many causes, but you will find always that the advocate who has the largest audience is he who proclaims that there is no God. In such an age I cannot understand how any Christian, to whatever denomination he belongs - how any man can desire to weaken, if not destroy, a Church - (hear, hear) - which has undoubtedly been doing a great work, and doing it with ever-increasing efficiency - a work not only in the interests of Christianity, but in the interests of humanity. (Cheers.)A Move in the Home Rule GameThe next subject to which I shall turn is the question of Home Rule, with which is connected a constitu­tional question; for, so far as the present Government have dealt with the Constitutional question, they have dealt with it simply as a move in the Home Rule game. (Hear, hear.) The keynote of the policy of the present Government, since the January election a year ago, has been not merely that they are dependent upon, but that they are absolutely dominated by a small faction in the House of Commons, and a faction which, small as it is, is far larger than it ought to be in comparison. (Cheers.)It is due to that domination that now - at this hour, probably - the Insurance Bill, which affects the vital interests of almost every man, woman, and child in this country, is passing mechanically through the House of Commons without discussion, without the possibility of those whose interests are affected having the opportunity of having their objections, even con­sidered. (Hear, hear.)The vital interests, the most direct and personal in­terests of the whole population of these islands, are being sacrificed today. Why? In order to clear the line for the Home Rule express. (Hear, hear and \u2018Shame.\u2019) It is also due, I believe, to the necessity under which the Government felt of retaining the Irish vote at all costs. It is due to that, and, in my belief, to that alone, that the Conference last year was not carried to a successful issue. (Hear, hear.) Now, ladies and gentlemen, it may be said - it has been said to me in the House of Commons \u2013 \u2018You are pretty Unionists to discriminate between members of the House because they come from different parts of the United Kingdom.\u2019That sounds plausible, but its plausibility disappears the moment you examine it. If Irish members judged British questions and voted on British questions on their merits they would have as much right as anyone else to let their in­fluence be felt on British questions. They do nothing of the kind. (Hear, hear.) They do not pretend to do anything of the kind. (Hear, hear.) I myself heard the leader of the Nationalist party in the House of Commons say practically this - I have his exact words in my pocket if anybody wants to hear them­ - (laughter) - that neither he nor his friends knew anything or cared anything about British political ques­tions.Mr. Asquith in Other DaysWell, ladies and gentlemen, that is all very well for them, but what about us? If they know nothing and care nothing about British politics then it is utterly in­tolerable that they should dominate British politics (Loud cheers.) The views which I have just expressed were once held by the Prime Minister - (laughter) - not many years ago when he was in opposition, when his mind was less biased, when he was free to consider it on its merits. (Laughter and cheers.) He said the Liberal party ought never to assume the respon­sibility of office except with an independent majority. He does not say that now. (Laughter.) Why? Because he has yielded to the temptation which Mr. Gladstone foresaw - (hear, hear.) - the most insidious temptation which can come in the way (under our political system) to any statesman - the temptation of sacrificing his own judgment, and, unconsciously, I am sure, but not less really, sacrificing not only his own judgment but sacrificing the interest of his country - (hear, hear) - not for his own sake - Mr. Asquith would not do that - but for the sake of the interests of the party of which he is a member. (Cheers.)Well, ladies and gentlemen, we are living today under a provisional Constitution. That is admitted. The Prime Minister said a week or two ago that in due course - whatever that may mean - (laughter) - they will establish a proper Second Chamber. Well, they tell us that at the last election they received a mandate for the Parliament Bill. But the Parliament Bill had two proposals, one to adjust the relations be­tween the two houses, the other to reform the Second Chamber. If they had a mandate for the one they had equally a mandate for the other. (Hear, hear.) They have done the one \u2013 they have left the other undone.Now, look at this from the plain, common-sense, business standpoint to which our Chairmen has re­ferred. Everyone knows that nothing can be worse for trade and industry than political uncertainty. (Hear, hear.) The Government have these two great changes, two great reforms, as they call them, to make. Surely, common sense should have taught them that they should be made together - that they should at least arrive at a settlement which has some possibility of permanence. No Government, surely - not even the present Government - is so much in love with revolution for its own sake that when they have the choice they deliberately prefer two revolutions rather than one.Why the Constitution was SuspendedWhy have they adopted this course? They have given one explanation; they have all given one explana­tion only. They say - I am sure we in the House of Commons have all heard it a dozen times - there is no use passing a Bill to reform the House of Lords which the House of Lords would have rejected; we must have power of retaliation, negotiating powers - phrases which we have heard before - (laughter) - in order to carry through our reform of the House of Lords. Now examine that explanation. By what means did they carry one half of their proposals through the House of Lords? They carried them by what Mr. Balfour described in words which were not too strong, \u2018a felon stroke\u2019 - (cheers) - by a gross outrage not only on the spirit, but, as I believe, on the letter of our Constitution. (Cheers.)Does anyone doubt that the same means which enabled them to pass half their proposals world not have enabled them to pass the whole of them? Dees anyone doubt that it would not have been less of a constitutional outrage, less of a breach with the past to have reformed than to have destroyed the House of Lords? (Hear, hear.) That is not an explanation, it is an excuse. (Hear, hear.) The explanation is very different, and we all know it. The head of the Government gave them no alternative.Mr. Redmond knows just as well as Mr. Asquith knows that if Home Rule were submitted to the people of this country as a clear issue, the same answer would be returned in the same decisive way in which it has been given twice before. (Cheers.) Mr. Redmond knows also, just as Mr. Asquith knows, that if we had an effective Second Chamber, no matter how it was constituted, however democratic it might be, if there were an effective Chamber of any kind, a great change like this would not be permitted to pass until there was clear proof that the people of this country desired it. (Hear, hear.)That is why our Constitution is suspended. We know now what due course means. Due course may arrive after Home Rule is carried. They may perhaps be quite willing after the steed has fled, carefully to lock the stable door. I am not going tonight into the general argument on the subject of Home Rule. I wish to impress upon you one aspect of that question, and one only, and that is whether it is right to carry a great change like this while our Constitution is in suspense, and while it is at least doubtful whether the majority of the people of this country desire the change. (Hear, hear.)That it is doubtful ought to be conceded, even if we admit for the sake of argument the claim of the Government that they received a mandate for Home Rule at the last election - a claim which I utterly repudiate - (cheers) - even if we admitted it, there would still be doubt. Mr. Gladstone fought the election of 1892 on Home Rule. He told us the Bill of 1886 was dead, but declined to tell us what was going to take its place. He won the election, but his proposals had then to be defined. They were discussed. They were submitted to the country, and in spite of his victory on the words Home Rule, they were defeated by an overwhelming majority. (Cheers.)Can anyone pretend that the same thing might not happen now? Can anyone maintain that on a vital question like this the people of this country have not the right to decide not on frail, but clear and definite proposals? Now, Mr. Chairman, the sole ground, so far as I can under­stand, on which Home Rule is justified is the nationality of Ireland, but people do not become a nation because they happen to live in the same island. If there is one nation in Ireland there are two nations in Ireland - (cheers) - two nations separated from each other far more acutely than either of them is separated from the people of Great Britain. We do not suggest that the minority should dominate the majority.\u2018An Intolerable Curse\u2019No! But we say it is equally unjust that a majority, because it is in Ireland, should dominate a minority because it is also in Ireland. They are both - majority and minority alike - not only inhabitants of Ireland, but citizens of the United Kingdom. (Hear, hear.) And both can rely on obtaining justice in a way in which neither perhaps can rely on receiving it from the other - from the British House of Commons, in which both are represented. (Cheers.) Now, ladies and gentlemen, to one of these sections Home Rule comes perhaps as a boon. To the other it comes not merely as a grievance, but as an intolerable curse. (Hear, hear.)They may be quite wrong. The Nationalists may be the most tolerant people who ever existed in the world - (laughter) - and to judge by Mr. Redmond\u2019s speeches now - he has not always spoken quite in the same way - but to judge by his speeches now, the whole characteristic of himself and of those whom he repre­sents, their one burning ambition is when they are smitten on one cheek to turn the other to the smiter. (Laughter.) That may be their characteristic, but the minority don\u2019t think so. (Laughter and hear, hear.) And what is that minority? It is important from the point of view even of numbers, for it comprises at least a quarter, more than a quarter, of the whole population of Ireland. It is far more important from every other point of view, and its power and its real weight is enormously increased by the way in which that minority is concentrated.Well, these people, not accepting strictly and literally Mr. Redmond\u2019s present declaration, have de­clared that under existing conditions they will not submit to such a government. Their moral force in taking up that attitude is increased to an extent which is simply incalculable by the fact that they will say, and that they will be entitled to say, that this intolerable tyranny, as they regard it, is being forced upon them against the will of the majority of their fellow citizens in the United Kingdom. (Cheers.) Now, I said in one of the debates in the House of Commons, and I venture to repeat it here, that in my belief, the Government, under Irish domination, have not only destroyed our Constitu­tion, but they are putting in danger our whole system of representative government.On what does that representative government rest? It rests on a convention, and nothing more. It rests on the convention that a majority at any given time represents the balance of forces in the country. But majorities are not always stronger than minorities, and that convention can only continue to be respected so long as the majority uses its powers with moderation - (hear, hear) - and with a due regard to the convictions and the strength of those to whom they are opposed. (Hear, hear.) It cannot continue if a majority - and a small majority - tries to ride rough-shod over the minority. (Hear, hear.) If the Government, there­fore, really try to carry out - I think they are beginning to realise its difficulties - if they really try to carry out the programme which they have so light-heartedly sketched, then in my belief - and this will be my last word to you on this subject - in my belief they will strain our Parliamentary institutions to the breaking-point. (Loud cheers.)Social Condition of the PeopleI should like to speak to you now, with your permission - (a Voice: \u2018Go on!\u2019) - on the social condi­tion of the people of this country, with special reference to Tariff Reform. (Loud and prolonged cheers.) Each kind of government has its own kind of dangers. In the old days of despotic rule, one of the greatest enemies of the people was the King\u2019s friend, who played upon the weaknesses of his Sovereign for his own advantage. Under new conditions the same evil appears in a new form. The King\u2019s flatterers have become the flatterers of the mob - (hear, hear) - for under democratic institu­tions in every age and in every country the greatest enemy of the democracy has always been the demagogue. (Cheers.) How easy it is to make eloquent or at least rhetorical speeches based on the glaring anomalies, the glaring contrasts, between the luxuries of the rich and the hardships of the poor. (Hear, hear.) How easy it is, and how successfully it has been done - (laughter) - to represent the political conflict in which we have been recently engaged as a struggle between Peers and people. How easy it is to repre­sent us as the party of privilege and class, and as the party of the rich. We are not, ladies and gentlemen, the party of privilege. It is our aim, as it was the aim of Disraeli throughout his long life - (cheers)­ - to be the party not of a class, but a party of the nation. We realise as strongly as any man that the greatness of a nation does not depend upon the trade, but upon the character of its people. (Cheers.)But we know that character cannot be formed except under good social conditions. There is, as our Chairman has reminded us, a great feeling of labour unrest, which is not confined to this country, which is to be found elsewhere. And to whatever extent it is wide­spread it means simply this - your Chairman has said the same thing - that the working classes think they are entitled to have, and they want to try to obtain, a larger share of the profits of industry. Ladies and gentlemen, in this country there are two special causes which have accentuated that feeling. One of these is the Budget campaign of two years ago. (Hear, hear.) That campaign stirred every constituency - almost every family in the kingdom - and did undoubtedly induce the poor to believe that the passing of the Budget would be for them the beginning of a golden age. (Laughter.)Well, the Budget is passed, and the outbreak last August, an outbreak of a kind unprecedented in this country, is, in my belief, simply the ripening fruit of the seed that was sown two years ago. (Cheers.) That is one cause, but there is another. During the last ten years there has been a considerable increase in the total wealth of this country.But in that period the condition of the working classes has not improved; it has actually deteriorated. (\u2018Quite right.\u2019) From information supplied by the Board of Trade, we know that during that period the cost of living has gone up almost 10 per cent, and wages have remained stationary. That is a cause, and a sufficient explanation of a good deal of discontent. (Hear, hear.) I said a minute or two ago, that the working classes thought they were entitled to a larger share. I go further, and I say now that in my belief, so far as I can judge, all classes, including employers - and what your Chairman said confirms for his part what I am now going to say - all classes would like the working classes to have as large a share of industry as is compatible with the success of that industry. (Cheers.)How is that result to be obtained? There is one method - the method adopted by the Government. It is to take from the rich in taxes and to hand it to the poor in doles. That is a very simple way. But it has its dangers. If you attack capital suddenly and unexpec­tedly, it is apt to fly beyond your reach. The Prime Minister, whose economic views are at least original - (laughter) - has told us that the more capital flies from this country to be invested abroad, the better for us.If he is right, we never have had benefactors like the present Government. (Laughter.) During the short time they have been in office the amount of capital that has gone abroad for investment, as shown even in the very imperfect returns of the Inland Revenue Commissioners, is greater, taking the ave­rage of the five-year period, than in the twenty years before they came into office. (Hear, hear.) That is one fact. But there is another. We have been passing through a period which, so far as statistics can guide us, is a period of good trade. And in spite of that good trade there has been a steady, an enormous emigration from our shores. (Hear, hear.)Do you think there is no connection between these two facts? I think there is. If you attack capital, as I said a moment ago, unexpectedly, if you attack it vindictively - (cheers) - and - what is worse far than any­thing they have done, actually done - if the men at the head of the Government speak of those who have accumulated wealth as if they were outcasts, treat them as if they were beasts of prey to be shot at sight - (hear, hear) - well, you will indeed injure the capitalist, but you will injure far more vitally the man whose only capital is his skill and his industry, and who has to depend for the employment of that capital of his not only on accumulated wealth, but on the energy of the men who are capable of accumulating that wealth. (Hear, hear.) That is one method; there is another.Change of Fiscal SystemIn my belief the greatest of all possible social reforms would be to raise the standard of wages throughout this country - (hear, hear) - for in that way you would not so much help the working classes directly as put them in a position to help themselves. (Hear, hear.) For many years now I have advocated a change in our fiscal system but in advocating that change, however mis­taken I may have been, I have never, and I hope I never shall, make any claim in which I do not in my heart believe. We do not pretend that a change in our fiscal system would cure all evils; but we do contend that such a change would do much to help what is the greatest of all our social evils - chronic unemployment. (Loud cheers.) In making this claim we have some­thing at least to justify us. A rise in the cost of living, without any corresponding rise in wages, is found in this country.It is not found elsewhere. In Germany, for instance, there has been a rise perhaps as great, certainly not greater, but as we know from the authoritative report of our own Consul to this Government, there has been a rise in wages which more than compensates for the increased cost of living. (Cheers.) Now, ladies and gentlemen, I do believe that Tariff Reform would tend to raise the level of wages, but I am sure of this, that without some change in our fiscal system a general rise in the level of wages is absolutely impossible. (Cheers.) In proof of this take the Insurance Bill, to which I have already referred. That Bill, whatever its merits - (laughter) - and I hope it has some merit greater than fourpence for ninepence­ (loud laughter) - perhaps my slip was nearer the truth than I thought - whatever its merits it does add a new burden to industry in this country.I have taken a great deal of trouble to find out what is the extent of this burden, and it is a very heavy one. I have examined returns from more than a hundred em­ployers in different trades, and the employers\u2019 contribu­tion alone, without counting the workmen\u2019s, means, when stated in terms of additional income tax, a new burden varying in some cases from less than a shilling to in other cases more than twenty shillings in the pound. Now, that is a heavy burden, especially the twenty shillings in the pound. (Laughter and hear, hear.) Can anyone suggest that the whole of that burden ought to be borne by the producer? Should not part of it at least fall on the consumer? (Hear, hear.) Even Mr. Lloyd George has himself suggested that the consumer should bear part - (hear, hear) - but under our existing fiscal system how is that possible? (Hear, hear.) Of all the manufactured goods consumed in this country some­thing like 10 per cent come from abroad. That is not a large proportion, you may say, but there is no businessman in this room who does not know that it is quite a largo enough proportion to regulate prices. (Hear, hear.)The Example of GermanyIf you impose a new burden on the home product, and no corresponding burden on the foreign product, is it not evident - is it not certain - that the intensity, the severity, and the extent of that foreign competition must be increased (Cheers.) Mr. Lloyd George, I am glad to admit, is improving. (Laughter.) After passing his old age pension scheme, he took a voyage across the North Sea, where, incidentally, he discovered Germany - (laughter) - in order to examine the pension scheme there.He has done better in regard to the insurance scheme; he took his journey before and not after passing the Bill. But in spite of that improvement, he has missed the one lesson which German experience should have taught him. It was Prince Bismarck who passed the insurance scheme for Germany, but it was Prince Bismarck who gave to the German workman security in the German market - (hear, hear) - and it was the change in the fiscal system, and not the insurance scheme, which came first. (Loud cheers.) He first stopped the leak which was sinking the ship, and afterwards it was easy to improve her sailing quali­ties.We must do the same. (Hear, hear.) If we do not, then most certainly Bills introduced, with the best intentions, perhaps, for helping the poor, for helping unemployment, will inevitably turn out to be Bills to increase the number of the poor and to create unemployment. (Loud cheers.)The Canadian ElectionsThe last subject on which I should like to speak to you tonight is the general election which has just taken place in Canada. (Cheers.) That election was described by Mr. Balfour as the great event of the year in the history of the British Empire. It may prove to be - and I believe it will prove to be - a landmark in the history of the world. (Hear, hear.) In common with the other leaders of our party, while the result was in suspense I never said a word in criticism of Sir Wilfrid Laurier\u2019s Government. To have does so would have been the height of folly, for however much the question concerned us it concerned Canada more, and it was for them and not for us to decide. (Hear, hear.) It would have been not only the height of folly, it would have been really the height of ingratitude. For we must never forget - and this is not by any means the only occasion that I have recalled that it was the Government of Sir Wilfrid Laurier which gave to the work of our people at home a preference on the Canadian market. (Cheers.) We are grateful to him for that, but we are grateful to him also for this, that the example which was set by him has now been followed by every one of the self-governing Dominions. (Hear, hear.) Let us remember, also, that while the British Government defended that treaty on the ground that it would destroy Preference, Sir Wilfrid Laurier defended it always because in his belief it would not injure Preference. I differed from him, but that difference did not weaken in any way my respect for him, and has not lessened the admiration which I feel for his great intellect and his great eloquence. But now that the Canadian people have decided, we have the right to rejoice in their decision. (Hear, hear.)If you wish to understand what these elec­tions really mean you must not look at what Radical speakers or Radical newspapers say about it now. Look at what they said about it when they thought the result was going to be different. (Hear, hear.) We were told then that this treaty was a great step towards Free Trade. If that were true, then the rejection of the treaty is not a step, it is a leap backwards from what they call Free Trade. We were told that it was a death-blow - ­not the first by many - (laughter) - a death-blow to the cause of Preference. If that were true then the rejec­tion of the treaty gives new life to the cause of Prefer­ence. We were told that the treaty was just another proof that trade must be governed by natural laws and controlled by natural forces. That is true, but the rejection of the treaty proves what our opponents always forget, viz., that the greatest natural forces are human character and human sentiment. (Cheers.) The real meaning of the rejection of that treaty was simply this - that Canadian people believed, and I agree with them, that President Taft was right when he said it was a case of now or never, because they believed that that election would decide, and perhaps finally decide, whether Canada was to continue to grow as an autonomous nation more closely bound to the British Empire, or whether it was to be more and more closely united socially, economically, and ultimately politically with the great friendly nation lying to the South. They tell us that it has no bearing upon the question of Preference. A more ignorant claim was never made. (Cheers.)Reciprocal PreferenceFor many years at every opportunity the Colonial Prime Ministers of every self-governing Colony have urged upon the Mother Country the policy of reciprocal Preference, which means simply this - that each part of the Empire should give to every other different terms and better terms than those given to the rest of the world. (Hear, hear.) And the Canadian election is supply an emphatic re­minder to us that that is still the policy of the self-governing dominions of the Crown. (Cheers.) I re­ferred the other day to an incident in my own experi­ence which I shall repeat to you tonight. A friend of mine, who was a candidate for the House of Com­mons at the last election, was in Canada while the elec­tions were going on. As soon as they were over this, he tells me, was the message that was everywhere given to him: \u2018We have done our part; it is up to the old country now.\u2019 (Cheers.) It is up to the old country now. (Hear, hear.) We have thrown away many opportunities. We are fortunate. We shall have one other opportunity and one only, and at the next elec­tion, I am satisfied that we shall not throw it away.Ladies and gentlemen, as you probably know, most of you, I was born in Canada. (Cheers.) I spent the early years of my life there. Among the many dis­qualifications for the position which I now hold - and no one feels them more strongly than myself - that is not a disqualification. (Cheers.) It is an advantage. (Cheers.) For 25 years the determination to maintain the integrity of the United Kingdom has given a name to our party. We are the Unionist party. (Hear, hear.) But ours is now a larger Union. It is for us not only to preserve; it is for us also to create. It is for us to maintain, and we shall maintain, in spite of the lowering clouds which now threaten us, the integrity of the United Kingdom. But it is for us also, it is for the men of this generation, to guard the vital Union of the British Empire. (Loud cheers, during which the right hon. gentleman resumed his seat, having spoken for an hour and ten minutes.)

aVMr. Chairman, ladies, and gentlemen. Under the circumstances in which we are met tonight I expected that you would give your leaders a warm welcome. (Cheers.) But the welcome which you have just given to me so far exceeds anything which I have experienced or have been a witness of that I am so touched by it that I find it difficult to begin speaking to you. (Voices \u2013 \u2018You deserved it!\u2019) It is a privilege to me to stand for the first time in our new position on the same platform as Lord Lansdowne. (Cheers.) I rejoice in it not merely because it is a sign that the two branches of our party, which during my whole political life have been one in fact have become also one in name. I rejoice in it because during the year in which he and I have shared the responsi­bilities of leadership I have had opportunities of knowing him better, and the result of those oppor­tunities is that if it is possible I respect him more than ever for his single-mindedness, his ability, and his devotion to the duty of his country. (Cheers.)Lord Lansdowne has spoken to you on Tariff Reform. That is a subject on which I have made more speeches than on any other, and it is a subject on which for that reason it is perhaps easier for me to speak. I shall say now only this - that I concur in every word which has fallen from Lord Lansdowne (cheers), and if I have time after I have spoken upon some other subjects I shall perhaps say a few words on that subject also. Tariff Reform has been de­scribed, and truly, for years as our first constructive plank. (Cheers.)A Government of GamblersBut for the moment we have another duty, another necessity which comes before anything else, and that is to get rid of his Majesty\u2019s present advisers. (Cheers.) I am not, and I do not pretend to be, impartial. (Laughter.) But it is not, I think sincerely, party prejudice which makes me say and believe that at this moment we are governed by what the late Professor Lecky described as the worst of all possible Governments - a Government of gamblers and adventurers (loud cheers), a Government which, if it is allowed to carry out its programme, will lead this country headlong to ruin. (Cheers.) All Governments in this country have been party Governments. But there is a distinction. Up till now every Govern­ment when it assumed office ceased to be the repre­sentative of a party and became the Government of a nation. (Cheers.) From the first day on which this Government assumed office to this present hour they have not been national statesmen; they have been wire-pullers of a political caucus. (Cheers.) Their one idea of statesmanship has been and is to use the influence and the patronage which Govern­ment gives them in order to strengthen their party ties and to do the one thing which they understand - and they do understand it - to use the power which is placed in their hands to strengthen their party and to win elections.The Land InquiryIf you wish proof of this, take their latest escapade, to which Lord Lansdowne has referred - their land inquiry. It is not the inquiry of a Government. They have not even the courage to be responsible for it (cheers), though it is they who are the sole cause of it. It is, as Lord Lansdowne has told you, con­ducted in secret by backstairs arrangements, and it is conducted in such a way that every honest man in their own party must be ashamed of it. If there is need for land legislation, and I think there is, and if there is a necessity for a previous inquiry, and I am sure there is, if the object of that inquiry is to legis­late for a nation, surely any honest, any decent Government would have had an open Commission (cheers), which would have examined into it openly and impartially and which would have given the means of making the changes which are in the interests not of a party, but of the whole people. (Cheers.) But that is not their object. They do not wish legislation for the nation; they wish a party cry for a political party. They wish to find some means by which they can preach again, in a new sermon, the old gospel of class hatred, on which they have unfortunately thriven. They succeeded once: the people know now how much these promises were worth, and I can venture to prophesy that they will need a new tune before they will get them to dance again to their piping. (Cheers.) Burke once said this in speaking of the men in power in another country: \u2018They have had power given them, like that of the evil principle, to subvert and destroy, but none to construct, except such machines as are fitted for further subversion and further de­struction.\u2019 There you have written in advance the life history of the present Government. (Cheers.) They have no power, except to destroy; their one constructive effort was a machine of destruction - the Parliament Act. They have set that in motion, but I think they are finding that it is something in the nature of a boomerang (laughter); that it is not going, as they thought, to destroy their enemies, but is coming back to wound and to kill those who are wielding it.Welsh DisestablishmentIn the meantime the machine goes merrily. But for the change in the procedure of the House of Commons which has taken place today (cheers), and to which I shall refer later, they would have been engaged tomorrow in destroying, or trying to destroy, the branch of a great Church which is doing a great work in circumstances of great difficulty. (Cheers.) They are trying to take away from that poor Church its poor endowments, all too small for the noble work which is being done by them. (Cheers.) They are trying to take them away, not because these endowments are not well used, but because they are too well used (cheers) and are exciting the worst passions of envy and of malice. They are trying to take them away, and what has been the effect on the country? It is the meanest proposal, and it is pressed forward in the meanest way of any proposal which has come before the House of Commons. It is not Churchmen alone who are ashamed of it. Great bodies of Nonconformists look upon it with disgust. (Cheers.) And I venture to say this, that through­out the whole of Nonconformity - and I can speak without prejudice, for I am not a member of the Church of England - there is this distinction: Those desire it who put their politics before their religion; those hate it who put their religion before their politics. (Cheers)The Home Rule BillThe next object of their destructive violence is the integrity of the United Kingdom. Twice they have tried to carry out their destructive measures by persuading the people to accept them. They are trying now to carry them out not only without the consent but, as they know, against the will of the people of this country. (Cheers.) We have been discussing Home Rule in the House of Commons. It is a kind of discussion (laughter), but short as it has been, ludicrous as it has been, it has been too long for the Government. (Cheers.) Day after day the injustice, and what is more damaging perhaps the absurdities, of that Bill have been proved to demonstration in the House of Commons, and they have been met with one answer only - the fall of the guillotine.Now I am not going - it is not worthwhile (laughter) - to attempt an exhaustive analysis of the Home Rule Bill, but I shall refer to two aspects of it which affect the people of Great Britain. The first is the arrangement in regard to Customs. I remember that, when I was speaking in this hall at the beginning of the year, I expressed a belief that one of the reasons for the delay in the production of the Home Rule Bill was that the Nationalists were demanding the control of the Customs and that the Government did not then see their way to give it them. I pointed out then that to surrender the Customs would be to break pledges given up to the hilt by his Majesty\u2019s Ministers. I do not think that was a great safeguard (laughter and cheers), and it has not proved to be a great safeguard, but I did think, and I think now, that that is something which the people of the United Kingdom will not stand. (Hear, hear.) I have some reason to think so. Perhaps some of you may have noticed that on Monday the Government were defeated (laughter and loud cheers). It was on a resolution which affected this question of the Customs, and we know from statements made in the House of Commons that there is a large number of Liberal members who have declared to the Government their opposition to this proposal. I do not suggest that their opposition means that when the time comes when they have to decide between their convictions and their seats (loud laughter) that they will not prefer their seats. But I do suggest that the fact that they have expressed that opinion does show that their constituents, who have not got seats, will have no hesitation in expressing their opinion on the subject. (Cheers.)The Customs QuestionNow just think what it means. For nine years these people have been preaching to us about the dis­advantage and the crimes of Tariff Custom House barriers. But they are proposing to erect barriers, not between us and a foreign country, but between different parts of what they still call the United Kingdom. (Cheers.) That is no exaggeration if this Bill passes. (Voices - \u2018If!\u2019) I have not much doubt about it. (Laughter and cheers.) But if this Bill passes the Irish Government can lower or take away altogether the duty on tea or on tobacco. If they do that it will pay you and me to take an occa­sional trip to Ireland to lay in a store of these com­modities. (Laughter.) Whatever other industry may languish, a new industry will be created. There will be a good time for smugglers. (Laughter.) It will pay us still better to have all our supplies come by parcel post. Now think what that means. It means that every ship which comes from Ireland to England must be subjected to the same restraints which are now put upon the foreign-going ship. It means that every passenger between these different parts of the same kingdom must be stopped and examined as we are at Dover and Calais in order to see that he has no tobacco or tea. It will mean that every parcel which comes through the Post Office must be opened - and that is done by a Government which, above all things else, is devoted to Free Trade. (Laughter and cheers.) But there is another aspect of that question, and a serious one. The whole experience of the world has shown that a single Custom House system is not only the symbol of national unity, but is a necessity to national unity. That is true of every country. It was the single fiscal system which made the German Empire possible. It was not the War of Independence which made the United States a nation. After the war differ­ent States, from jealousies between those on the coast and those inside, were more than once on the point of war. That great statesman, Alexander Hamilton, succeeded in establishing a single Custom House system, and then, and then only, the United States became a nation. (Cheers.) It is true of our own colonies, every one of them. When, the other day, or a few years ago - it seems the other day - the Aus­tralian Commonwealth was created, one of the States of that Commonwealth believed, and believed strongly, in Free Trade. But the statesmen belong­ing to that State realised that a real union of the Commonwealth was impossible unless there was a single fiscal system, and for the sake of unity they sacrificed their Free Trade view. What are our Government doing? They are sacrificing their Free Trade views, not to unite, but to divide. (Cheers.) I said in the early days of my leadership in the House of Commons, without premeditation, as it happened, that this was a Government without convictions. That was in the days of the new style (laughter and cheers), which has become the old style already. There is no mystery about it: it consists in saying what you mean and meaning what you say. I said it then because I thought it. I think it still. (Cheers.) They have preferences, but they have no preference which they feel strong enough to sacrifice on the altar of party advantage.The Irish Vote at WestminsterThere is only one other aspect of the Home Rule Bill on which I should like to say a few words to you. It has been already referred to by Lord Lansdowne. That is the retention of the Irish members in the British House of Commons. The Government today are not very popular. They know it and we know it. They give many explanations of lost elections; but in my belief the cause which more than any other is influencing the people of this country is the feeling that we are under a Government where responsibility is in the hands of one set of men and where power is in the hands of another set of men. (Cheers.) And the people of this country have got tired of having their affairs governed by a faction which does not profess to be interested in them, which does not profess to under­stand them, which does not give its votes on what it thinks the merits, but gives them to secure ad­vantages of another kind. (Cheers.) We are getting tired of that. It is part of the price we have to pay for a United Kingdom, and a United Kingdom is worth the price, but are we to go on paying the price after the United Kingdom has ceased to exist? (\u2018No!\u2019) On what ground do they justify Home Rule? They say that the Irish people - I do not know who they are (laughter) - are entitled to manage their own affairs. If that is true are we not entitled to manage our own affairs? (Cheers.) When we have not the smallest voice in anything which concerns them, are they to have a voice in everything which concerns us? And it is not merely a voice, but through the closeness of party ties - and the ex­perience of the last year or two has shown, I think, that they are too close - they will not only have a voice, but they will decide affairs which do not concern them, but which vitally concern us. Such a system Mr. Gladstone declared would mean the creation of a sovereign and a subordinate Parliament, but he added, and added truly, that under such an arrangement the sovereign Parliament would be in Ireland and the subordinate Parliament would be in Westminster. (Cheers.) Well, I am not an Englishman, but I have had the honour of representing two English constituencies. I know that the English are a magnanimous people, and I know that they are a long-suffering people: but they are not fools. (Laughter.) They will stand much, but there are limits. That is trying them too high, and the Government will find that they will not stand that.The Political CrisisNow I daresay you are thinking - my mind is full - of what happened in the House of Commons yester­day. (Cheers.) I know, nobody better, how serious it was. I know that when in a Parliament, through disorder or from any other cause, debate is not permitted, a fatal blow, or a serious blow which may be fatal, is struck at Parliamentary institutions. I realise that, and in spite of what has happened to­day and let me say I rejoice in what has happened today - (cheers) - what occurred yesterday will leave serious and lasting effects. I realise that. It is right that you should realise it. But it is for you and for our countrymen to judge on whose shoulders the responsibility rests. (Cheers.) I am proud of the House of Commons. I hate disorder, and I have found - I say it freely - that in the House of Commons, even from my political opponents, both before and since I became in that House the leader of your party, I have been fairly treated. I hate disorder. I prize, no one more, the traditions of the House of Commons, and we have shown that we prize them. During the year that I have had the honour of leading our party there, there has been no disorder, and never in the whole history of Parliament has there been such provocation. (Cheers.) Never in the whole history of the House of Commons, except during the Long Parliament, has that House been so degraded and have the minority been so ruthlessly trampled upon.And that is not the only provocation. A member of the Government, a Cabinet Minister, actually went to the country and taunted us with our meekness. He went to the country and boasted that because we still respected the traditions of the House of Commons there was no reality in our opposition, and they need not be afraid of not being able to carry their pro­gramme. (Cries of \u2018Shame!\u2019) Even that provoca­tion did not move us. We still respected the tradi­tions of the House. But there are limits which pass the powers of human endurance and limits which ought not to be endured. (Cheers.) These limits were passed yesterday. Whatever injury was done to the House of Commons was not done by us. It was done by the Government, whose one duty it ought to have been to have cherished the history of the House of Commons, to have regarded it as some­thing for which they were trustees, and to do nothing which would break down that wall of common law on which the liberties of the House and of the people depend. (Cheers.)Mr. Bonar Law\u2019s ResponsibilityNow, I wish to tell you quite plainly and quite openly what my responsibility in connexion with yesterday\u2019s events was. I did not suggest a dis­turbance, but I have this responsibility - I felt it then; I feel it now - I did not shirk from it. (Cheers.) I did not attempt in any way to interfere with what my colleagues in the House of Commons desired to do. (Cheers.) I do not know - the passion against injustice was so strong - whether my interference would have made any difference, but if I had thought it my duty I would have tried it, whatever the effect. I did not try it (loud cheers), and under similar cir­cumstances I never shall try it. (Cheers.) If that resolution of the Government had been allowed to go through and become a precedent the House of Commons would have been destroyed, and de­stroyed for ever. (Loud and prolonged cheers.)What did they propose? The Prime Minister (hisses and groans, and cries of \u2018Traitor\u2019), in a speech which I suppose made the best of his case, but it was worthy of the case (laughter and cheers), treated it as if it was a matter of no importance. They actually proposed that a vote of the House of Commons should declare that the previous division was of no consequence and that the House should treat it as if that particular day had never existed. (Laughter.) Well, what does that mean? If that is a proper method - we know they have a majority­ - why should we divide, why should we discuss, why should we go to the House of Commons at all? Why should not the Cabinet pass their laws and call the House of Commons together once in three months to sanction what they had done? That is what it means. And I say deliberately that if we had allowed that to be done we, too, would have shared in the responsibility (loud cheers) for the destruction of the liberties of the House of Commons. Well, as I said, I am glad that a way out seems to have been found. We do not like disorder. We shall rejoice if it is possible, and I think it will be possible from the Speaker\u2019s intervention - (hear, hear) - we shall rejoice if it is possible to continue again discussion under even these truncated Parliamentary forms. We shall be glad to do it.The Meaning of Home RuleBut do not be under any mistake. That does not end the crisis. (Cheers.) The Government, under the Parliament Act, are attempting something which they have no moral right to do. (Cheers.) The Bill in connexion with which they were defeated was the Home Rule Bill. What does that mean? They call it a Bill to give self-government to Ireland. It is not a Bill to give the Nationalists a right to govern themselves. It is a Bill to give them the right to compel, or rather to call upon British troops to compel, a great homogeneous population which is separated from them in everything more widely than you are separated from them - it gives, under the name of local self-government, the right to compel those people to change their allegiance, to go out of the Union of which they are proud and in which they are content, and to accept a foreign yoke, as they regard it, which they look upon with horror and dismay. That is what it means. Does anyone think that that can be done? (\u2018No!\u2019) For this nation to do it deliberately is impossible, and they have shown that it is impossible. But for a body of political geniuses (laughter), who are there today and will be gone tomorrow (loud cheers) - for those people to attempt to do it is not only a crime, it is a folly worse than any crime. And how can they do it? The people of Ulster (cheers) have shown in a way which must command the respect of every sincere man what their wishes are, and they have shown what their determination is. They have shown it without bluster. It would be bluster if they did not mean it, and to people who mean nothing even it does seem bluster. (Laughter.) But they do mean it. They say, and they have the right to say, that this outrage is being inflicted upon them without the consent of their fellow citizens in the United Kingdom. (Hear, hear.) They will not submit to it. (Cheers.)The Intention of the OppositionAnd we have shown in a way which now no one can misunderstand that so long as the people of this country have not clearly expressed their intentions the cause of Ulster is our cause (cheers), that it is not the case of a wretched Government dealing with the people of Ulster alone; they will have to deal with the overwhelming majority of the people of Great Britain as well. (Cheers.) We shall try, and continue to try, to wreck this Bill in the House of Commons. But if - though that if will never come - if it becomes law we shall not try; we shall wreck it then. (Cheers.) The thing is impossible. It is impossible because Ulster will not submit, and because Great Britain will not permit Ulster to be coerced. (Cheers.) Now under these circumstances we make the claim, and by every means in our power we shall press the claim, that they have no right to carry through a programme like that without the consent of the people of this country. (Cheers.) We claim, and we shall press the claim, that if they pretend that they have the approval of the country they are bound to submit to the test and let the people decide between them and us. (Cheers.) Till they do that we shall respect the traditions of the House of Commons, but we shall also try to avert a calamity greater even than the degradation of the House of Commons - we shall try to prevent civil war within the United Kingdom. (Cheers.)Tariff ReformI am afraid it is impossible to speak to you on the subject to which I referred. I shall try to say a few sentences only about it, and in the first place I would remind you of this - that in submitting these proposals to the people of this country we have behind us the experience of the whole civilised world. There are people, ignorant themselves, or who trade upon the ignorance of others, who tell you that there is a move­ment in other countries towards what they call Free Trade. I was told when I was a boy at school a long, long time ago that America was on the point of adopting Free Trade. She was nearer it then than she is now. (Laughter and cheers.) Radical papers claim that the victory of Dr. Wilson is a victory for Free Trade, and a member of the Government, a member who has distinguished himself in other directions, actually suggested that a telegram of congratulation should be sent to him on that account (Laughter.) Well, Dr. Wilson ought to know more about it himself. He had noticed this thing in British papers, and he was so afraid it would destroy chance of winning the election that he said openly, and more than once, that neither he nor his party stood for Free Trade or anything like Free Trade. (Cheers.) At this moment throughout the whole world there is not a single Government and - what is stranger - there is not a single Opposition which proposes to return to the system which is still good enough for the United Kingdom. They have all abandoned it, and it is the working classes who are responsible for its abandonment, because they have realised the obvious truth that you cannot raise the standard of living, that you cannot protect labour, without also protecting the products of labour. (Cheers.)Now, there is one other general observation I should like to make. I am, and I have been for many years, a Tariff Reformer. But I am a Conservative, not only as a party name, but conservative by nature and by instinct. And I can assure you of this - that any change for which we are responsible will not be a revolutionary change, and will cause the smallest possible dislocation of the ordinary business arrange­ments compatible with making this necessary change.The Canadian PreferenceAs Lord Lansdowne has pointed out, our object is to give to our own people a preference in the over-sea markets of the British Empire. That is as neces­sary for them from a pure trade point of view as security on the home market. Its value is admitted. At the Colonial Conference the present Prime Minister and the present Chancellor of the Exchequer (booing) both said that this preference was of enormous value to the trade of this country. Well, if it is of any value, enormous or not, is it not worth keeping? And was not the next step, the inevitable step, to find out what the value was, to consider what the advantage of it was, and to weigh against that any possible disadvantage? They never dreamt of doing that. Why? Because they realised, and they were right, that the dear loaf was a good party cry. They seized it. It has served them well. The Government have been living upon it, metaphorically, for nine years, and the people of this country have been living upon it, not metaphorically but actually. (Laughter and cheers.) I do not deny that it is still a good election cry, but its value, believe me, depends on this: that our opponents say always, and they get some people to believe them, that they are the party of the poor - they are the party who live on the poor (laughter) - and that we are the party of the rich. It is not true. Disraeli, in one of the greatest speeches he ever made, said this: \u2018The Conservative Party is the party of the nation or it is nothing.\u2019 (Cheers.) It is still true. We are not the party of the rich. We are the party of the nation. And I say this: that no matter how strongly I believe that later on it would benefit even all classes in this country, I feel that there is such a large fraction of our popula­tion living, partly because of our fiscal system, so near the verge of poverty that they cannot afford to pay any premium of insurance for the future, that I should not advocate a policy which, whatever its other merits, added the smallest feather-weight to the burden which these people have to bear. (Cheers.)A Readjustment of TaxationAs Lord Lansdowne has told you, we shall not treat any revenue derived from so-called food taxes, whatever they are, which may be imposed for preference, as ordinary revenue. We shall use it to diminish the burdens which in other ways are falling upon the poorer classes of this country. It will not be an addition to taxation; it will be a readjustment of taxation. And owing to this revenue, and owing to the expansion which I am certain will come with this change of system, I say that instead of adding to the cost of living the adjust­ment which we shall make will make the burden smaller and not larger that falls upon the working classes. (Cheers.)A Tribute to Mr. BalfourNow that is all I can say tonight, but I do not wish on this second time that I have addressed the National Union as one of its leaders to do so without saying something a little more personal. I wish, in the first place, to say a word or two about my predecessor. (Cheers.) So long as Mr. Balfour was my leader (cheers), until, at least, I knew that he was going to give it up, I never said a word in his praise, for I did not think it was my business, or would help him, but I can now without any restraint say exactly what I think. (Hear, hear.) I have always had for him - I have today - an admiration both for his intellect and his character which I cannot exaggerate. He has ceased to be the leader of a party, but he is still the greatest Parliamentary figure of his time. (Cheers.) For such a man to come back to the arena which he had dominated so long in a position even nominally subordinate would he difficult for anyone, would be impossible for some, as it was impossible for Mr. Gladstone. Mr. Balfour has tried and has succeeded in making himself not a hindrance but a help to his successor. (Cheers.) In debates such as we have had he has played the most brilliant part, and to the deep debt of gratitude which we as a party owe him for having led us so long we owe the additional debt of the services he has rendered, and will continue to render, since he has ceased to be our leader. (Loud cheers.)A United PartyNow perhaps you will permit me to say one word only about my own position. As my colleagues know, I did not seek the honour which was bestowed upon me. I was afraid of it. I have held the position for a year, and I can say this - that I have succeeded. (Cheers.) I have succeeded better than I expected. (Laughter and cheers.) For my success I have to thank two causes, one insignificant, the other vital. I have been helped by the bitterness of the attacks of our opponents. They have done more by choosing me as their target to establish me in the confidence of my friends (cheers), they have done more in a year than I could have done with my unaided efforts in a lifetime. (Laughter and cheers.) The other cause is not insignificant. It is due first to the encouragement which on every occasion when I have met our supporters outside they have given me. But it is due, above all, to - I won\u2019t call it loyalty, but to the friendship and goodwill of my colleagues in the House of Commons, who have always shown the best proof of confidence by giving me the most hearty support when I least deserved it. I am not strong enough to lead, and I should not try to lead a divided party. (Hear, hear.) We are not divided. (Cheers.) We are, in my opinion, more united at this moment than any political party has been in my time. (Cheers.) And we are, in my belief - it is not merely my wish, it is my conviction, that we are moving, and moving rapidly, to inevitable victory. (Loud and prolonged cheers.)

aVSir Ailwyn Fellowes and Gentlemen \u2013 I was very much interested, I need not say, by the reminiscence which you just presented to us of my first entry into the House of Commons.  You said that nothing was further from your thoughts than that I should occupy the position which I now hold.  Nothing was further from mine; and I can say further that the one thing and the only thing which could possibly reconcile me to that position is the feeling that in some degree at least I have the confidence of the party which I represent.  (Cheers.)  This is the third time that I have the honour of addressing the National Union, and in speaking to you, the representatives of the fighting forces of our party, I naturally turn back to the first occasion on which I addressed you, that at Leeds two years ago.  There has been a great change in the position, and it is not a change for the worse.  (Hear, hear.)  Even then we believed that the tide had turned, but it had only begun to turn.  Now it is in flood.  (Cheers.)Found OutThe Government have lost, and they know it, have lost utterly the confidence of the country.  (Cheers.)  They have suffered the greatest misfortune which could possibly befall them, the one calamity from which there can be no recovery.  They have been found out.  For years they have posed as the Pharisees of politics, they have made broad their phylacteries; they were not as other men - (laughter) - or even as these Tories \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 and now words are unnecessary.  (Laughter.)  They stand before the country for what they are, Pharisees still \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 but Pharisees stripped of their phylacteries naked and not even ashamed.  (Laughter.)  From the party point of view no political party ever met under conditions more hopeful than those in which we are associated here tonight \u2013 (cheers) \u2013 but from the national point of view so long as the Government persist or seem to persist in their Irish policy the position is one of danger, which it is simply impossible to exaggerate.  That is the subject which fills my mind to the exclusion of every other; that is the subject also which ought to dominate, and which I think now at last does dominate the mind of the people of the country.  (Cheers.)TARIFF REFORMA United FrontBut before I speak on that subject I think it right, at the annual meeting of our party, to speak to you for a little on one or other or two other subjects.  The first of these on which I shall speak is Tariff Reform.  It is a subject on which I have made more speeches by far than on any other, and though I am not a good judge perhaps they have not been worse speeches than on other subjects.  I know this at least that our policy on this question is plain, straightforward, and cannot be misunderstood.  (Hear, hear.)  I know also \u2013 for I never think there is any advantage in trying either to shut my own eyes to facts or to pretend that I do not see them \u2013 I know that on that question there is still some difference of opinion in our party.  There is on the one hand a large number who are devoted to the whole policy of Tariff Reform, including the immediate imposition of agricultural duties.  On the other there are some who are opposed to any change in our fiscal system.  Both these sections have recognised that, important as our fiscal system is in comparison with other dangers by which we are now threatened, it sinks into insignificance, and each section has recognised that the only way by which we can present a united front to our common enemy is that each should abate something of its demand \u2013 (cheers) \u2013 and as a consequence we do present a united front on this question.  (Cheers.)  I shall content myself, therefore, tonight in restating that argument, for as I have, unfortunately for me, many speeches still to make, I shall find another opportunity for arguing the question.  I shall content myself with restating what our policy is, and what, if we are in power in the new Parliament, we intend to do.  (Cheers.)NO NEW DUTIES ON FOODModerate Tariffs on Manufactured GoodsWe shall not impose any new duties on any articles of food \u2013 (cheers) \u2013 but we shall impose a moderate tariff on foreign manufactured goods \u2013 a tariff not exceeding an average of ten per cent, a scale of duties, remember, which is only something like a third of the reduced scale in the new American tariff, which Radical newspapers are constantly telling us is practically a Free Trade system.  (Laughter.)  In my belief duties such as these, apart from any other consideration, can be justified on the strictest Free Trade principles by the needs of revenue.  They can be justified on precisely the same ground on which revenue tariffs have been imposed by Free Trade Governments in India and in Egypt.  We should all, gentlemen, at the same time establish at once the principle of imperial preference.  (Cheers.)  We shall give to our self-governing dominions what at every conference for more than twenty-five years they have unanimously asked from us, and that is all that they have formally asked.  We shall give them immediately a preference on all duties imposed in the United Kingdom.  (Cheers.)THE FARMERS\u2019 POSITIONBurdens on Agriculture to be ReducedNow on this subject I have only one thing more to say.  I believe that farmers and agriculturalists would be justified in being hostile to that policy if it stood alone.  But it does not stand alone.  I have already in the House of Commons, on behalf of our party, made this pledge, which I repeat tonight, that apart altogether from the readjustment on general lines of local taxation, which is urgently required \u2013 (hear, hear) \u2013 apart from that readjustment, at the same time that we impose a tariff we shall take part of the revenue of that tariff and use it in reducing the burdens of agriculture \u2013 (cheers) \u2013 in order to make sure that the farmer will at least be compensated, and more than compensated, for any additional price which, as the result of the tariff, he may by any possibility be called upon to pay.Well, gentlemen, that is our policy, and I can say this with confidence, that it has already secured the support, the practically unanimous support, of our own party, and I believe it will command the approval of the country.  (Cheers.)THE LAND CAMPAIGNMr. Lloyd George\u2019s MethodsThe second of these subjects on which I wish to speak to you is that which has been referred to by our chairman \u2013 the Government\u2019s land campaign.  (Laughter.)  It is in one respect unique \u2013 (more laughter) \u2013 perhaps in more than one respect.  (Hear, hear.)  It is said to be the policy of the united Cabinet, but already two members of the Government, and not unimportant members \u2013 the Foreign Secretary and the Secretary for India \u2013 have said in effect that this is not now a practical question, that it can only arise after the present policy of the Government has been carried out.  (Laughter)  It is therefore the policy of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.  (Some booing.)  I have a great deal to say about him; don\u2019t waste your breath at present.  (More laughter.)  It is the policy of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who has been sent out into the cold world alone to sink or swim with it as best he can.  (Laughter.)  Well I happened, when speaking at Newcastle a few days ago to make a casual reference to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and in consequence I received quite a number of letters from members of our party, who were rather angry with me because I had given him as they said a certificate of character.  (Laughter.)  It did not strike me in that light at the time \u2013 (renewed laughter) \u2013 but perhaps they were right, for I saw that the Daily News \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 described my speech as a tribute to Mr. Lloyd George.  (Oh, oh!)  Well, perhaps I cannot tell, as what I am going to say now I shall render myself liable to the same condemnation.  (A Voice: \u2018Never mind.\u2019)  Among those whom I am addressing there are many I am sure who in one way or the other are engaged in business.  If so, your experience must be the same as mine.  There must have been occasions when people have come to you with proposals for making your fortunes, which on the face of them looked plausible.  When that happened, what was your first step?  You inquired into the past of your would-be benefactor.  (Hear, hear.)  You asked about his character.  (A Voice: \u2018He ain\u2019t got one,\u2019 and laughter.)  You tried to find out his record.  You asked what previous transactions he had been engaged in \u2013 (laughter and a Voice: \u2018Marconis\u2019) \u2013 and whether they had succeeded or failed.  (Laughter.)  How would Mr. Lloyd George stand in that test?  (Renewed laughter.)  Stormy Petrel or OstrichIn one of his bursts of rhetoric he compared himself to the stormy petrel, but I think there is another bird which he more closely resembles.  When I was at school I was taught that the ostrich had the habit of dropping its eggs in the sand and leaving their subsequent fate to be decided by sun or wind.  (Laughter.)  That, I believe, is false natural history, but whatever may be the habits of the ostrich that is precisely the method adopted by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.  (Laughter and cheers.)  He drops his egg, and when it is dropped as far as possible, he is done with it.  (Laughter.)  He leaves it to be hatched by chance, or, perhaps, by Mr. Masterman \u2013 (loud laughter) \u2013 and when it becomes addled, when it begins to smell \u2013 (renewed laughter) \u2013 he hops off and lays another.  (Loud laughter.)  The one and only object of his ambition being to make sure that the second egg is bigger than the first.The Land TaxesThe first of these droppings \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 is represented by the land taxes.  If any of you have time which hangs heavily on your hands, I would recommend you to read a book which had a great vogue when it was published, but which is rather dull now \u2013 \u2018The People\u2019s Budget \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 explained by the Right Hon. David Lloyd George.\u2019  No promises which by any possibility he can make now can exceed them, can hardly equal the brilliancy and the variety of the promises which he made then.  The resources of rhetoric were utterly exhausted.  The wilderness, including I suppose deer forests, at 22s. 6d. an acre \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 the wilderness was to rejoice and to blossom like the rose, and what is the result of it all.  Since these taxes were instituted they have brought into the Exchequer in all £223,000, and the State has paid out in valuation and collection £1,390,000.  (Oh, and cheers.)  But Mr. Lloyd George has a great advantage as a controversialist.  He is never hampered today by what he said yesterday.  (Laughter.)  He tells us now, I heard it in the House of Commons last session, that he never thought these taxes would bring any considerable revenue except in the future.  I don\u2019t know what he thought, but I do know what he said.  (Laughter and cheers.)  In the House of Commons when the Budget was going through in 1909 he used these words, \u2018Even in the case of the Dreadnoughts which you are laying down this year, the real expenditure will be next year, so that when the revenue comes in from the land taxes next year it will be revenue which will be used just as much for Dreadnoughts as for old age pensions.\u2019  That was in 1909.  The revenue which came in in 1910-11 was £2700.  (Laughter.)  But perhaps he meant the second year of their imposition.  The revenue for the second year was £57,000.  So far he has omitted to tell us how it was divided.  (Laughter and cheers.)  How much of it was spent in Dreadnoughts and how much was left over for old age pensions.  (Laughter.)  That was his first egg \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 and I think he would give something, and I am sure his party would give a great deal to have it decently buried.  (Laughter.)THE INSURANCE ACT\u2018The Work of Gamblers\u2019Now, the second of these eggs, and it was big enough, was the Insurance Act.  I don\u2019t believe that in the whole record of human folly you will find an example where a measure like this of such vast importance which touched on every point the lives of the whole nation, was rushed through with such haste, with such recklessness, and with such ignorance.  (Cheers.)  It was the work of gamblers, and of gamblers whose audacity was only surpassed by their folly, and what is the result?Position of the Friendly SocietiesThe friendly societies set an example of thrift which was not equalled anywhere else in the world, and what was the position now?  We have appointed a committee, I mean Lord Lansdowne and myself, we have appointed a committee to study the Act, and the effect of it,  and I say to you from what knowledge I have been able to gain on the subject, that the position is far worse probably than any of you imagine.  In my belief these great friendly societies are many of them drifting, and drifting rapidly, to insolvency \u2013 (Hear, hear) \u2013 and that is not the only effect or the worst effect.  The worst effect is upon the character of our people.  In the old days the men who directed the friendly societies were proud, and justly proud, of their work.  And the members of these societies shared that pride.  It was no uncommon thing at meetings of these societies to find men get up and glory in the fact that though they had been many years members they had never withdrawn anything from the funds.  (Cheers.)  All this has changed.  The insured people have to pay, whether they like it or not, their fourpence, and they were naturally anxious and determined if they can to get the ninepence which the Chancellor so generously promised them with this result, that the whole position is reversed, that instead of being proud of helping their societies their pride now consists in getting as much as they can out of the funds of the society.A Voluntary SystemWell, gentlemen, in my belief, the defects of the Act are radical, and cannot be cured by any patchwork such as the amending Bill which went through last session.  About two years ago, I think, I said in the House of Commons that if we happened to come into power before the Act was in operation we should repeal it with a view of amending it.  (Hear, hear.)  And it would have been a good thing for this country if it had been suspended.  (Hear, hear.)  But what is to be done now it is not so easy to say.  Governments are like men: the evil that they do lives after them.  This only I can say, that if the opportunity is given us we shall do what the Government ought to have done, and what they refused to do.  We shall appoint a committee, as far as possible non-political, impartial, and competent, which will examine into the whole subject, not only into the working of the Act, but to the whole principle of the Act, and will consider this, whether or not it is possible, and whether it is in the interests of the nation even yet to turn it into a voluntary system.  (Cheers.)Well, gentlemen, that is the position.  Here is this social reformer coming forward with his new remedy for all ills, when, as a matter of fact, the one social reform which at this moment is more needed, I believe, than any other is to undo the evil effects which he has done by his Insurance Act.GOOD AND BAD LANDLORDSCo-operation Instead of CampaignAnd now we come to the land, and judging by the size the greatest of these eggs is the land campaign, it is an amazing performance.  Here we have a Government which is in power \u2013 it has been eight years in office \u2013 if the evils are such as they now describe them, why did they not remedy them long ago instead of only now beginning to talk about them.  A land policy I can understand, land reform I can understand, but land campaign, why and against whom?  (Laughter and cheers.)  Mr. Lloyd George has left us no doubt about that.  (Laughter.)  It is against the wicked landlord.  In one of his recent speeches he made the interesting discovery that property in land has duties as well as rights.  I agree with him, but I do not agree with his limitation.  I think, and there is nothing on which I feel more strongly that all property owners have duties as well as rights \u2013 (cheers) \u2013 and if the duties are not fulfilled the rights are impaired, and ought to be, but that does not apply to one class of property alone.  (Hear, hear.)  It applies to all kinds of property, property even derived from the Stock Exchange \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 as well as to property in land.  It is my belief that among the property owners of this country there is no class which, to a greater extent than landowners, does recognise their responsibilities, and does try to fulfil the duties of their position.  (Cheers.)  That is not my belief alone.  It was Mr. Lloyd George\u2019s even until a few years ago.  (Mr. Bonar Law stopped for a moment to look through his papers for a quotation.)  I have not got it.  I am sorry (he said), but I can tell you the substance of it.  In the House of Commons in 1909, I think, he said this, or something almost exactly in these words: \u2018There are, of course, good and bad landlords, but the good landlords are so overwhelmingly in the majority that they set the standard which even bad landlords have to follow.\u2019  (Laughter and cheers.)  Well, if that be the truth or anything like the truth, surely if the object of the Government were not to help a party, but to benefit the nation, surely what they would have done would have been to try to secure the co-operation of all classes interested in the land and not to direct the campaign against any class; and only when that co-operation was refused should they have stepped in and done what was necessary without.  Surely that was the proper method.  Believe me that that is, and always will be, the best way of securing reform.  Indeed, I can go further and say this, that every real reform which has ever benefited the nation has been carried out first by the attempt to secure the co-operation of those who are interested in it.Comparisons with BelgiumI am not going to criticise these proposals in detail.  But there is one consideration which I would like you to have clearly in your minds, because I think it utterly destroys the whole airy fabric with which such floods of words the Chancellor has erected.  He has compared Belgium and the United Kingdom.  He has pointed out that the produce from the soil in Belgium is far greater than here, and that the number of people employed on the land is far greater in proportion than in the United Kingdom.  These facts are true.  And what is his explanation?  It is that it is all due to the land monopoly.  Well, now suppose that it were the case that land in the United Kingdom could be got by anyone who wanted to use it at a lower price than it could be got in Belgium.  What would become of the land monopoly theory?  Well, what are the facts?  The facts are \u2013 and they are admitted \u2013 that here in England agricultural land, the freehold of it, the absolute freehold, with complete immunity from pheasants or any other birds of prey \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 that the price of land is only half what the price of similar land is in Belgium today.  (Hear, hear.)  That therefore cannot be the explanation.  There are many reasons for it.  I shall give you only two, but they are two of the most important.  In Belgium the burdens of agricultural land are far lower than the burdens of agricultural land here.  (Hear, hear.)  And this Government, whose one desire is to help agriculture, during their eight years of office have not only not mitigated those burdens, but have deliberately and systematically added to the unfairness of them.  (Hear, hear.)Pride of OwnershipThe other reason is that in Belgium the soil is largely cultivated by the men who own it.  (Cheers.)  That is the explanation.  It is the magic of ownership; it is the industry, the energy, and the pride of ownership which not only in Belgium, but in all the great countries nearly of Europe, and before our own eyes in Ireland \u2013 (cheers) \u2013 it is the pride of ownership which everywhere has produced the best results; and this Government deliberately precludes itself from adopting the one system, or helping to have it instituted, the one system which everywhere else in the world has proved to be the best for agriculture.  (Cheers.)Why Not an Honest Inquiry?Now, ladies and gentlemen, I have only this more to say.  Why did they not have an inquiry, and an honest inquiry?  They have themselves appointed a commission to inquire into the railways.  Well, the railways are a complicated problem, but they are not half so complicated as the land.  Why did they not adopt for the bigger problem the same method that they adopted for the smaller?  If they had adopted it, or if they would adopt it now, we should gladly co-operate with them in getting at a knowledge of the facts, which is the first consideration.  (Hear, hear.)  Take, for instance, one of the evils, and the greatest evil probably, of the conditions of life on the land \u2013 the low wages paid in many agricultural districts.  They are so low I believe in some districts that at any cost they ought to be raised.  (Cheers.)SUPPORT FOR MINIMUM WAGEBut Facts Must be ExaminedThe Government have gone for a minimum wage.  Well, gentlemen, I am not frightened by the words minimum wage.  Not in the least.  In the case of sweated industries I supported it.  I knew all the economic objections against it, but I supported it, because on the whole I believed that a remedy was necessary, and that in those cases was the only remedy.  Well, I take precisely the same view about this problem.  Let us have, and surely it is the first essential, let us have an inquiry on the spot, impartial and competent.  Let us know the facts.  Let us find out, so far as knowledge can inform us, what the effect of a minimum wage would be, not on landlords or tenants, but on the labourers themselves.  (Hear, hear.)  It seems to me \u2013 I admit that on this subject I speak absolutely without the kind of knowledge which I value most, the kind which comes from practical experience \u2013 indeed, I am probably almost as ignorant on the subject as Mr. Lloyd George himself \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 but there is this difference.  He likes ignorance.  (Laughter.)  Perhaps it is an advantage to him \u2013 (renewed laughter) \u2013 for it enables him to speak much more freely than would be the case if he knew more about it \u2013 well I think that knowledge is essential, and that it is the first essential in this or in any other question.  Now isn\u2019t it possible that though you may fix the rate of the minimum wage you may actually diminish the amount of employment given to individuals.  Is it not possible that the economic effect of it will be to do the very thing you are trying to prevent, to turn land which today is arable into pasture, because of the smaller amount of labour which would be required.  (Cheers.)  That is what we want, an examination into the facts.  If there were such an examination it would command the respect of the whole community, and whatever legislation were necessary could go forward, not by means of a campaign against anybody, but with the goodwill of every man, woman, and child throughout the country.  (Cheers.)    ULSTERRemarkable DemonstrationNow, gentlemen, I have, I see, taken up more time than I anticipated \u2013 (Loud cries of \u2018No!\u2019 and \u2018Go on!\u2019) \u2013 with these subsidiary subjects, and I must therefore be somewhat brief with what I say on the dominating issue of the hour.I do not think that matters because there is no change in the position since I spoke at Wallsend ten days ago, and in any case I can only repeat in other words what I said then.  Gentlemen, if the Government really persist in obeying the orders of Mr. Redmond, Mr. Devlin, and I see by today\u2019s paper that Mr. Dillon has added his \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 if they obey these orders then we are face to face with national disaster, and perhaps national ruin.  If they do persist our duty as a party is clear, and I am sure that we shall fulfil that duty.  (Cheers.)  I have said on behalf of the party, with the approval of the party, that if the Government attempt to coerce Ulster before they have received the sanction of the people, we shall support Ulster in her resistance.There was a great outburst of cheering at this announcement, and after it had died down many sprang to their feet and started the singing of \u2018Rule Britannia,\u2019 which was taken up with great gusto by the rest of the audience, loud cheers again being given at its conclusion.  It was some minutes before Mr. Bonar Law could resume, and when he did he continued:  I am glad to receive that expression of your approval of what I have just said, but I ask you, gentlemen, to think what it means.  (Hear, hear.)  It involves a great deal; it involves something more than making speeches \u2013 (Hear, hear) \u2013 and from that pledge we as a party will never go back.  (Renewed cheers.)  It means this \u2013 and long and very many months before I gave the speech at Blenheim I realised exactly what it does mean \u2013 it means this: that when the time comes we should be bound in honour \u2013 (Hear, hear) \u2013 to use every means, any means, which seem to us effective to prevent British troops being used to shoot down loyal British subjects.  (Loud and prolonged cheers.)At Aberdeen the other night Mr. Balfour \u2013 (cheers) \u2013 said that the Irish question could never have got into its present position but for the sluggish imagination of our people.  That is a great truth, and it explains the present situation.  I said somewhere \u2013 I think it was in the House of Commons \u2013 that in my belief statesmanship really consists in imagination.  It consists in the power of looking forward \u2013 (Hear, hear) \u2013 of having in your mind a clear picture of what the conditions will be when the events which you foresee have actually occurred.  Well, I ask you, gentlemen, to use your imaginations.When British Troops are Sent to UlsterNow picture to yourselves what the effect will be when the order is given to send British troops to Belfast.  Think of the effect on the Army itself.  On Ireland, on Great Britain, on the British Empire.  (Hear, hear.)  It is a picture which I confess utterly appals me.  In face of dangers such as these, though I am a party man \u2013 and I suppose I may say that I have at least as strong a personal interest in the success of our party as any one of you \u2013 though I am a party man, party advantage or disadvantage in face of such a problem as that seems to me to account for nothing. GOVERNMENT PROPOSALS WILL BE CONSIDEREDDemand for an ElectionWell, now, gentlemen, it is because I feel this, and feel it strongly, that I said at Wallsend, and I repeat here tonight, that if the Government have any proposals to make which will avert the horrors that I have tried to depict to you, we will consider these proposals carefully, honestly, and with sole regard not to the interest of a party, but to the welfare of the nation.  (Cheers.)  But though I say that I feel more strongly than ever that the plain, clear duty of the Government is to submit their proposals either at a General Election or by means of a referendum \u2013 (Hear, hear) \u2013 I do not care which they choose \u2013 to submit their proposals to the judgement of the people who alone are entitled to decide this question.  (Cheers.) Now I shall give you my reasons for saying that that is their duty, I believe, as I am sure you all believe, that the Government at the last election received no mandate of any kind for this Home Rule Bill.  (Cheers.)  But I am not going now to argue that question, which has been \u2013 I won\u2019t call it argued, because I really do not think there are any arguments on the other side \u2013 but which has been discussed over and over again.  I shall base my claim on this ground, and I think it is a claim which on this ground alone is absolutely unanswerable, and it is on the change in the conditions which have occurred since the General Election took place.  You all know that at the time of the General Election Mr. Redmond said there was no Ulster question.  Will even he say that today?  (Cries of \u2018No!\u2019)  He was not alone in holding that view.  Mr. Asquith said practically the same thing.  He was asked during his election campaign that question: \u2018Will you be prepared to permit the soldiers of the Crown to shoot down any of the Protestant minority if, and when the latter should take up arms in defence of their present liberty?\u2019  Ad this is Mr. Asquith\u2019s answer.  \u2018We have not the least reason to fear that the contingency apprehended will ever arise.\u2019  Can he say now that there is not the least reason to fear that the contingency will not arise, and if he cannot then that also is the whole condition, and makes it absolutely essential that the people and not the Government should decide the issue.Solidarity of Ulster ProtestantsI know of nothing in the history of our country more remarkable than the absolute solidarity of the Protestant population of Ulster on this question.  In all previous controversies before Home Rule they were divided.  The Presbyterians in Ulster \u2013 the great bulk of them \u2013 supported Mr. Gladstone in disestablishing the Irish Church, they supported him in his land law, but now there is no section in Ulster which is more determined; there is, I believe, no section which is so determined as the Presbyterian to resist to the death this proposal.   In Deadly EarnestIn our great cities the line of division among our people is very largely, unhappily as I think, disputes between capital and labour.  The conditions in Belfast in that respect are precisely the same as in the great towns of England and Scotland.  Yet the dread of Home Rule is so utterly overpowering that these things which weigh so much everywhere else have ceased to exist in Ulster.  When the Ulster movement first took place we were told by Radical speakers, and by the whole Radical Press, that this was a movement which was engineered from above, that the democracy had nothing to do with it.  Then they changed their tune suddenly.  They said until the other day that it was only the Belfast mob which was doing it, and that the businessmen of Belfast, who had something to lose, took no part in such disorderly proceedings.  Well, they have been answered.  (Cheers.)  The meeting in Belfast last week in the Ulster Hall, and the overflow meeting in the Presbyterian Assembly were, in my belief, the most striking event which has so far happened in this movement.  That meeting consisted of practically the whole business community of Belfast.  They are the very class which hate disorder, which know that disorder injures their business, perhaps ruins their business, yet that class unanimously showed an enthusiasm which equalled, if not surpassed, the enthusiasm of the workers in the shipyards, and they declared without a dissentient voice that though they have counted the cost they will resist this Bill, and will back up and obey the Provisional Government which is set up in Ulster.  (Cheers.)  Facts like these alter the whole situation.  Let me enforce, if I may, the argument which I am now putting before you by an illustration from the action of another Government, and of a Radical Government.  You remember Majuba Hill, and what followed.  You remember that the Boers agitated, they drilled, they threatened.  Mr. Gladstone paid no attention.  They then took up arms and defeated the British Army, and he at once yielded to their plea.  Now this is an old controversy.  I do not raise it for a moment either in condemnation or criticism of what took place then.  I raise it because it is an exact analogy to the present position.  Surely it would have been wiser for the Government then to have granted the claims if they were just before and not after our troops had been used.  (Hear, hear.)  Mr. Gladstone knew \u2013 he well knew \u2013 that if he chose to use the forces of the British Empire, he would at that time have had no difficulty in overcoming the resistance of the Boers.  He refused to use that force.  He said it would bring blood guiltiness upon him to use it.  Why?  I remember the controversy well, and this was his reason, I think the sole reason.  He felt that since those men were willing in that cause to risk their lives, the course he was pursuing was not the right one.  Well, is not the position exactly the same in Ulster?  In Ulster we know, and the Government knows, that there are thousands and tens of thousands of men \u2013 (A Voice: \u2018Hundreds of thousands\u2019) \u2013 who, rather than submit, will sacrifice their lives.  (Hear, hear.)  Does not that make it in a free country absolutely impossible that you could coerce them?  (Cheers.)  Surely all that is left for the Government to decide is this, and this only \u2013 whether they will recognise the facts and bow to the facts before, and not after, blood had been shed.  (Cheers.)APPEAL TO THE COUNTRYPremier\u2019s Grave ResponsibilityGentlemen, I said at Wallsend that in my belief the Government had before them three possible alternatives.  There are three nominally, but in reality there are only two.  The responsibility for the present position rests not on the Cabinet.  It rests with one man \u2013 the Prime Minister \u2013 (Hear, hear) \u2013 and it is a responsibility which he cannot avoid, which he cannot even share, for he, and he alone, will be judged at the bar of public opinion now, and at the bar of history hereafter.  (Cheers.)  I do not wish to be unfair to Mr. Asquith.  I think I understand his difficulties, at least some of them.  I know how strong party ties are, and I think what is happening shows us that they are perhaps too strong for the benefit of the nation with both parties.  I know what the strength of party ties is; but in my belief Mr. Asquith has now only two possible courses open to him.  He can, if he thinks it possible, try to arrange a settlement which will avert these evils.  But if he fails, then as a statesman, as indeed an honest man, there is only one course open to him, and I am sure that he will take it, and that is to appeal to the people of this country.  (Loud cheers.)

aVWith seven years almost since the last meeting of the National Union of Conservative Associations \u2013 what a time we have gone through in the interval which has elapsed since that date.  What anxieties, what doubts, and uncertainties, what hopes and fears; but never, I am proud to say \u2013 on the part of the Government or of the nation \u2013 any doubt as to the carrying to the end the struggle in which we have been engaged.  (Cheers.)  In these circumstances, it is, I think, right that, for a few minutes, I should consider what the action of our party has been in that time, and what its position is today.  But I do not want in praising, as I am going to praise, the part that we have played, to give any suggestion that that praise is due to us alone.  It is easy for an individual, it is easy for a nation, to rise in a moment of enthusiasm above themselves; but it is very difficult to live year in and year out on that higher level and display that staying power \u2013 and it is that and not enthusiasm \u2013 which has brought us through this struggle.  Our nation has lived through that time in that spirit.  We cannot look back on all we have gone through; we cannot recall the part played by every section, by every class, by every sect, without feeling that, glorious as our history was in the past, we have never risen to a nobler height than, as a nation, we rose in that war.  When we think of those who played the chief part, of those who made the supreme sacrifice, we remember this \u2013 that there were no sheltered lives; that, if the anguish of the war is felt in the castle, it is also felt in the cottage; and I hope, and I am sure, that so far as this generation is concerned, however much we may drop back into old controversies and old quarrels \u2013 perhaps, worst of all, into class differences \u2013 we will never forget the part that was played by every class in the supreme hour of the nation\u2019s history.We Did Nothing MeanDuring the war we had very few party meetings of any kind, but I recall well the first, in the autumn of 1914.  At that meeting I said something like this \u2013 it was as near an approach to a peroration as I have ever attempted.  \u2018We each of us play our part, important or unimportant, on a great stage, and the great honour that we can look forward to is that when the war is over we can truthfully say as a party that we did nothing common, did nothing mean upon that memorable stage.\u2019  Ladies and gentlemen, I look back upon that time \u2013 look back upon it as leader of a party \u2013 and I say that we can truthfully make that claim.  I am not going to go into the whole history of it, but let me remind you of some of the things that happened when war broke out.  The Government in power was a Liberal Government, and a Government with which at that time, we had been in very bitter conflict.  For ten months, I think, we occupied the Opposition benches, but we never opposed anything during the whole of that time.  I can say truthfully no action was ever taken by our party, directly or indirectly, which could interfere with the Government in the conduct of the war.  Well, that is not so easy as perhaps it seems to you.  Party fighting is the life of politicians, and it was not an easy change to throw away every advantage of hitting our opponents, even in that supreme hour.  Time came when that Government could not continue.  That was evident.  We had to choose between supporting a real opposition with the object of changing the Government or forming a Coalition.  None of us liked the idea of a Coalition, and I believed then, and I am sure my colleagues believed too, that if we had chosen to wait for a few months, it is certain that there would have been a change of Government, and that your party would have carried on with the war to its conclusion.  We never even thought of that.  If we had taken any other course we would have been condemned by our party because they realised that unity of the nation could not have been so well secured.  All through, in supporting the Government, our colleagues in the House of Commons and our party in the country showed a fixity of purpose which justifies us in saying that that at no time did they think of anything but the interests of the nation as a whole.  What is the result?  The future, the political future, is very uncertain, but at this moment our party is a united party as much as when the war began.  Well, that could not have happened if as a party we had acted foolishly, and if, as I think, we acted on the whole wisely \u2013 there was no Machiavellism in the business \u2013 it consisted simply in this: That the party has come well out of it because at no stage did we think of the interests of the party, but at every stage we thought of the good of the nation.  (Applause.)Coalition Still NecessaryNow, ladies and gentlemen, everyone admits that by means of a Coalition we did get a better use of the national force than could have been got in any other way.  But, we are told, the war is over; why don\u2019t we fall back on our old party divisions.  We are told, as the chairman has pointed out, that a Coalition represents the abandonment of principles.  Let us examine that.  Let us say first that in my life experience \u2013 which, though Mr. Chamberlain spoke of me as a young politician \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 has been a pretty long one \u2013 I have not found on the whole that the men who talk most about principle are very different in their actions from the rest of us who don\u2019t talk about principle.  But let us consider what that means.  There is principle in politics.  There can be, and there should be, no compromise between truth and falsehood, between right and wrong.  But is not there a habit of confusing political principle with political prejudice, and does not it happen generally that when we are talking of political principle we are really thinking of political prejudice?  Just look at it.  There are some subjects where principle is the whole question, but they are not very numerous.  Politics is the science of life, and you will find, if you look back on the controversies of the last hundred years, that in almost every case the point at which one party left off was the starting point of another party in a subsequent generation.  We are told that there cannot be unity, real unity, in a Coalition.  Well, now, do you think that is so?  We have all been members of a party.  Did we always think alike on every subject?  Is it not the fact that we had to choose on broad lines which party we would belong to, and that over and over again there was even in our party the most acute differences on subjects of vital importance?  Unity of purpose does not depend on a name; it depends on something more than that, and I venture to say with a certainty that I am right that there is more unity of purpose in the present Government than has been the case of any other Government in the war, and I believe as much, if not more than, in any Government in my life.  Now, I have got here a phrase which defines the general idea about political consistency and unity.  They are very nice words: \u2018An independent political force, inspired by common convictions, arriving at common ends, marching on the same road to a common goal.\u2019  Well, if there is any party where you should think it easy to have this unity of purpose, it ought to be easier when the party is small.  There words were used by Mr. Asquith \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 whom I gladly served under, and of whom, like your chairman, I shall never speak or think except with respect.  But \u2018Here we are, the independent political force \u2013 a great army marching on the same road to a common goal.\u2019  There are 33 of them in the House of Commons.  (Laughter.)  They may be marching to the common goal, by the same road, but they are never marching to it through the same division lobby.  (Laughter.)  No, ladies and gentlemen.  Even this small group is unable to hide its differences in the face of the enemy and is united by nothing \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 except a name and a real dislike of the present Government.  That is the political principle which unites them.No Compromise on NationalisationTake an illustration of it.  There was a division on the question of nationalisation.  Like your chairman, I think that perhaps more than any other, and not the old party issues are the things which are going to count in the years which are going to come.  On that there is no compromise.  In my view there can be no question whatever that any system which tries to get rid of the initiative of the individual, the energy of the individual, is a system which is against history, is against common sense, and is fatal to any nation.  (Applause.)  Well, even on this, this political force, united by a great principle, and marching on a common road to a common goal \u2013 they cannot agree.  Well, they, at least, should not talk to us about a want of unity of purpose in the course which we are pursuing.  But, consider what is the alternative to a Government such as exists now.  I think we can get a lesson from what has happened and is happening in the other nations of the world.  The war is over, but the effects of the war are not over.  (Hear, hear.)  Look what is happening in other countries.  Take the United States of America.  She played a great part in the last days of the war.  (Laughter and applause.)  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, she did, and we, as a nation have glory enough not to need to grudge it to any of our Allies.  She did.  But she was far off in the struggle.  She was not driven as we were by the force of the danger to form a national government, and what happened the moment the war was over?A World CalamityI blame nobody in America.  They reverted to the most intense party fighting with what result?  The result that they are playing no part whatever, you may say, in that reconstruction after the war, which is almost as vital as the winning of the war itself.  And it is one of the calamities of the world that America is left out in all the work that is to be done.  But it is not true of America only.  Look at what has happened in Germany in the last year.  It is said of the English people \u2013 I don\u2019t know that it is applied to the other races to one of which I belong \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 it is said of the English people that they have a genius for compromise.What does that mean?  It means simply that they hate extremes, that they chose the middle way.  And that is our safety.  (Hear, hear.)  What has happened in Germany is that the extremes of both sides have won, and the problem as to the way of dealing with Germany, of the recovery of Germany \u2013 for believe me that if chaos similar to what has happened in Russia should come it is a calamity not only to Germany, but to the world as a whole.  (Hear, hear.)  They had not our instinct of the middle way.  I do not know what will happen, but the danger is very great.  Look even at our Allies.  France and Italy had coalition Governments; but it is not enough to have a coalition of parties in name.  You must work together as one party if you are to be effective.  In France during the time of the existence of this Government \u2013 since the autumn of 1916 \u2013 there have been, I think, five different Governments; in Italy there have been four.  Ladies and gentlemen, that is not a good thing.  Stability is of the essence of recovery, and you can only get stability by choosing the middle path, avoiding extremes on the one side and on the other.  But look at the history of our own country.  Put your minds back to what the position was in February and March of last year.  I remember it well, for the Prime Minister was in Paris, and I and my colleagues had the whole of the responsibility.  You remember it.  Disorders of an extreme kind \u2013 not, as far as I remember, in Birmingham \u2013 in Glasgow, in Liverpool, in Belfast.  In London, the danger of the City being thrown at any moment in darkness.  Worse than that \u2013 we can speak of it now because our troops played so glorious a part that this small incident does not count \u2013 but there were signs of discontent which at another time would have been considered mutiny.  That was followed by the railway strike.  Well, we came well all through that time, because we had public opinion behind us \u2013 (applause) \u2013 and I do not believe for a moment that the Government of any party, whatever it was, would have commanded in the same degree the general support of the public opinion of this country.  Now, our chairman has spoken of what is said about the position of the Prime Minister and myself.  It is quite true, as he said, that you read one day in one newspaper that I and my colleagues are the tools of Mr. Lloyd George, that this Government, supported by the Conservative majority, are really carrying through Bolshevism in disguise.  On the same day in another newspaper, or the next day in the same newspaper \u2013 (laughter and applause) \u2013 you will read \u2013 not, perhaps, exactly as the chairman put it \u2013 that I have swallowed Mr. Lloyd George.  (Laughter.)  I would not like to do it.  (Laughter.)  My digestion would never be good again.  Not that.  But we read that Mr. Lloyd George has gone back on all his principles, that he is the leader of a reactionary party.  Well, now, ladies and gentlemen, both these statements cannot be true.  One or other is false.  Which is true?  (Laughter.)  That is a conundrum which is not easily answered.  Don\u2019t you think that perhaps a simple explanation is the real explanation?  Don\u2019t you think hard facts are as we said them to be, believed them to be, think them to be?  That we as a Government \u2013 and this is the sole justification for our existence \u2013 that we are looking at each problem as it arises on its merits, without regard to party prejudice or party feeling, and that the one desire is to solve it in the best interests of the nation.National FinanceThat is the only justification, and that is what we think we are doing.  Well, those who are opposed to us may call that want of political principle.  I don\u2019t think so.  I will tell you what I think it is.  It is not opportunism; is it statesmanship.  (Cheers.)  Now in illustration of what I have been saying, let me deal with one or two of the problems with which we are faced today.  Take first the position of our national finance.  That is not a simple problem.  For some years during the war I had to face it.  I did not think it easy then, but I knew that perhaps some people might think there was something like cowardice in what happened.  I knew it would be far more difficult after the war was over.  It has been far more difficult.  I am not going today to argue, as I have argued, and the chairman has argued more than once in the House of Commons, questions of our extravagance.  You know, if you judge us by one mode of examination, we are not only an extravagant Government, but we love to be extravagant.  (Laughter.)  Well, that is wrong.  I do not say \u2013 the Chancellor of the Exchequer would not say \u2013 that a great deal of money is not being spent unnecessarily.  I do not say that for a moment.  I am sure many of those I am addressing are men connected with very big businesses.  Can you imagine any big business where there is not some difficulty after a period of boom in getting expenditure down to the normal level?  It is not easy, but I say that no Government, and no Chancellor of the Exchequer, has ever tried more sincerely and earnestly to avoid unnecessary expenditure than is being tried by this Government and this Chancellor of the Exchequer.  (Cheers.)  I want you to consider another subject which was discussed only this week.  I am afraid it is rather dull.  I was going to say I am going to repeat our chairman\u2019s arguments, but my introduction was bad for the purpose.  (Laughter.)  Well, the subject is dull, and I am going to repeat very largely his arguments.Taxation of War WealthThere was a proposal to put a special tax on war wealth.  Now, that is very attractive.  It is attractive not only to the Labour party, it is attractive to the vast masses of our countrymen who feel that if they are worse off in every direction it is hardly right others should be very much better off in consequence of the war.  There is that strong feeling.  We all sympathise with it.  But you have to consider not merely feeling, but the effect of what you do.  Now, look at it from that point of view.  Examinations of the subject show that it is impossible to separate wealth won in consequence of the war from wealth which had grown during the war.  That is a great problem.  Consider the justice of it.  I have no hesitation in saying \u2013 and I showed it, and so did the Government when we put on 80% excess profits duty \u2013 that no one who during the war made an income as large as he made before it has any cause for complaint.  But that is rather a different thing from saying that there is no difference between the man who spent all his income during these five years, and the man who saved it.  There is a difference there surely.  And let me remind you of this: That the estimate of increased wealth during the five years of war is 4,000 millions.  I saw an estimate by an economist the other day of the increase of the five years before the war, and it was put at 1,500 millions.  Consider what that means.  If you had put on that tax a very large part of it would have represented the savings during these five years, and during the war there was nothing which any man could do in the public interest more important \u2013 and there was nothing that, we as a Government and myself urged more \u2013 than that, that man should save, in the interests of the State.  (Applause.)  I cannot see it would be fair to tax their savings in those five years, and leave untaxed savings made in other years.  But that is not my main argument.  You have got to consider the effect of what you propose to do.  Where is the 500 millions you would have got from this tax?  It is largely, in one form or another, in business.  That means you can only get it by valuing your assets.  That is the difficult thing.  You know that this money cannot be collected except over a certain number of years.  Is there anyone who doubts that very likely before the money was collected and paid there would be a fall in the nominal value, which had taken away to a large extent the nominal increase of wealth.  That is not doubtful.  The date fixed was June last year.  Already in many commodities there has been a fall, which would have swept away the whole of the wealth which you were supposed to have made.  But there is a stronger reason against it.  Mr. Clynes, one of the men who at present lead the Labour party \u2013 and if they were all as sensible as he, I would not be so afraid of them \u2013 (applause) \u2013 said the first thing to prevent unemployment was confidence.  That is true.  Look at the effect of this.  It would take at least one year, perhaps two years, to assess the amount that a man had to pay.Only One Argument in FavourDuring the whole of those two years, if it took that time, not only would the man who would ultimately have to pay the tax, not know how much money he had in his business, but tens of thousands of men who would be free from the tax would not be certain that they would not be liable.  I can imagine nothing worse for business.  In speaking in a city like Birmingham I know I am speaking to men who understand these things.  Businesses are carried on to a large extent on credits from your banks.  Well, during these two years, or whatever it was, the bank manager would not know how much your assets were, and nothing is more certain than this, that the amount of credit given would be diminished in consequence of that uncertainty.  I am not going to say anything more about it than this: It is admitted that you would not have got as much money by that method as by the method we are adopting.  In these circumstances there is only one argument in favour of it, and it is an argument which might influence some Governments; it is that it is very popular.  Well, our justification as a Government, the justification for this kind of a Government, is that we are going to hold the scales even; that we are going to hold them fairly between class and class, and not going to be influenced by anything except what we believe to be in the national interests.  (Applause.)  Now look at another point.  There is an impression that the rich are not paying enough.  I really want the whole country to know what the level of taxation we have drawn from the well-to-do is.  Let me try to put it before you.  Before the war the largest amount of direct taxation, that is taxation collected largely from the well-to-do in any one year, was 93 millions.  Last year the amount of the same kind of taxation was 721 millions sterling.  But that is not all.  Look over the whole period of seven years, and you will find that over and above the annual contribution of the 93 millions, taking into account the excess profits duty which is due but will not be collected by the end of this year, we have collected in direct taxation from the well-to-do practically 3,000 millions sterling.  There has never been anything like it, anything approaching it during this war or any other, in the whole history of the world; and when there is so much talk about the greed of the capitalist \u2013 I do not deny that every class is inclined to think that the national interests must more or less coincide with his own interests \u2013 but I say throughout the war, and even now, that class has borne these burdens with an equanimity and absence of complaint on the whole, of which there has been no record in our past history, and no record in any other.  But, ladies and gentlemen, that is one side.  We have refused to impose taxation which we think unwise.  We know that the National Debt is a terrific burden; we know that on the whole trade and industry is prosperous.  Well, what are we to do?  That prosperity won\u2019t continue indefinitely, and I am sure many of those I am addressing know that as well as I do.  Is it not our duty, when prosperity is there to use to the utmost of our power every effort to lessen the burden which will come in the lean years?  And where can we get it?  We cannot take it from the ordinary professional classes with fixed incomes, because they are worse off in consequence of the war.  We can only take it fairly from those who are making money.  That is the only fair way.  I know that a burden of that kind is heavy on industry, but can anyone suggest that we can put on burdens without hampering industry?  It is necessary to make a beginning in the reduction of our national debt, and just as we shall not be driven to unwise taxation by the public clamour, so we shall do equally right in getting a fair amount of taxation from those able to pay it.Russian NegotiationsThere are so many subjects to talk about that it is rather difficult to choose.  But we should discuss subjects which are most in evidence at the moment, and I am going to speak to you for a little on a subject on which the Government has been much criticised \u2013 namely, our attempt to reopen trade with Russia.  Let me say at once there is a widespread feeling, which I share, of dislike to having anything to do in any shape or form with a Government such as that which controls Russia.  But the longer I continue in political life the more I am convinced that all kinds of political problems, including foreign problems, are best dealt with by the exercise of a quality which is one of the most uncommon, the quality of common sense, and I am going to ask you to look at that problem and use your own common sense.  In the first place, the doctrine that you are not to deal with a country whose Government you may dislike or detest is a new doctrine and an absurd doctrine.  Let me take an analogy.  The French Revolution broke out in 1789.  For nearly four years, till war was declared, we traded freely with France in spite of the eloquence of Burke and the September massacres.  After the imprisonment of the King we ceased to recognise the French Government, but we did not cease to have commercial intercourse.  We did not do it until war broke out.  There have been many cases where, for one reason or another, we have broken off diplomatic relations, but that did not mean that all trade relations must cease.  We have got to face one of two alternatives.  We have got to make up our minds that we will put down this kind of Government, but I venture to say there is not one man in a hundred in the United Kingdom who would be willing to spend British money or British lives on a war in Russia at the present time.  The other alternative is to make the best of the situation, and that however long this Government will last we will have nothing to do with Russia until things have changed.Well, that is a possible point, but it is not a sound point.  Consider what the position is.  It is not to the advantage of the Soviet Government that we think of renewing relations.  Russia is the storehouse of the raw materials of the world.  Before the war Russia exported something like nine million tonnes a year of grain and flour; of wheat alone it exported a quarter of the whole quantity that was exported from all the other countries of the world put together.  Well, look at the position.  We know what the price of foodstuffs is today, but there is something more.  Those who make estimates as to what next year will be at this year\u2019s costs, tell us that great as is the scarcity this year, it is going to be much greater next year, unless Russia is brought into the pool.What is Good for the World Well, ladies and gentlemen, it is not a question of sympathy or anything else; it is a question of what is good for the world in the policy that we are willing to take in a matter of this kind.  Now I am not going to deal with the kind of criticism that is made about our action.  As you know, it was decided by all the Allies that these trade negotiations should be opened up.  An agent came to London for that purpose.  We are told we are offending the conscience of the world because Mr. Lloyd George and other Cabinet Ministers dealt with this man.  It would be all right, apparently, if we had employed civil servants, and even under-secretaries; but for a Cabinet Minister to do it \u2013 that is the end of the world!  Well, that is nonsense.  It is too stupid for words.  If it is right to do it, it is right to do it in the best way.  (Applause.)  Consider what is involved.  The British Government is not going to buy or sell to another Government.  We want our traders to get to work, but we are not willing to allow even that till some things are done.  We are not willing to allow it until British prisoners, until British subjects in Russia who wish to leave, are allowed to leave.  (Applause.)  We are not willing to do it until we know that this Government is not going to be hostile, to stir up trouble throughout the British Empire and throughout all our Allied countries.  These things we must have as a preliminary for trading.  (Applause.)  Is it not right to try to get them settled?  Think of this first.  I don\u2019t suppose there is a man or woman in this room who dislikes that kind of a Government more than I do.  But I go much further than that.  We have all believed all our lives that a Conservative Government is an impossibility, that it is contrary to human nature.  I read today a report of an interview of a Labour delegate who has just come from Russia.  He has got a very open mind about Soviet government \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 but he says their ideals are all right, but that this Communist Government cannot come for two or three generations.  Well, that is good enough for me.  (Laughter.)  That is only saying in another way what I say, that a Government of that kind, so long as men and women are human beings, and not angels, is an impossible Government.  Very well, then, what is most likely to end that kind of government.  You run a great risk, it has been proved, of strengthening a Government by employing foreign forces to fight against them.  In my belief \u2013 events may show, perhaps, in a reasonable time whether I am right or wrong \u2013 just because that kind of government is an absurdity, is contrary to human nature, so the one thing to end it is to restore normal conditions and get reasonable trade going between one country and another.  I have dealt with this subject, not because I thought you would like it specially \u2013 you don\u2019t love the Bolsheviks, you have got samples enough of them at home to imagine what they are like abroad.  (Laughter and applause.)  I don\u2019t suppose you like them.  But we have to think of something more than our likes and dislikes.  It may well be that nothing now may come of these negotiations.  It may be, as we are told \u2013 there is very conflicting testimony \u2013 that there is nothing to come from Russia.  I do not know, but I know this: that, whenever you begin, nothing will come for a long time.  But if you begin this year there is a chance of something next year; that, if you wait until next year there is not a chance of anything worth having next year.  And I say to you that, on this subject there is not, as has been suggested, any difference of opinion between the Unionist members of the Cabinet and Mr. Lloyd George.  (Hear, hear.)  We all believe that it is in the interests not of England \u2013 we do not wish to trade between Russia and England, but between Russia and the world, and the idea that we are pursuing some selfish policy is absurd.  Food is scarce with us, but we are much better able to pay for it than most other nations, and if Russia is opened up it is not Britain it is the world which will benefit by the change which will take place in that case.IrelandI cannot refrain from saying a word or two about the problem which is the most difficult to the Government at this moment, and that is saying a good deal.  (Applause.)  For I can assure you that hard as the task was during the war from the point of view not only of the amount we have to do, but of the difficulties, of the problems which we have to face, the position of Ministers is far more difficult than it was even during the war.  The most difficult of these problems is Ireland.  (Applause.)  What have we to say about it?  It is one of the tragedies of the world \u2013 (hear, hear) \u2013 that we are still in the same old rut in regard to Ireland.  I have not time, and I do not think it is necessary to dwell in any detail upon proposals which we are making for the Government of Ireland.  But let me say this.  Do not imagine that this is a new policy imposed upon us by the wickedness of our Radical colleagues.  Before the war at a conference at Buckingham Palace, at which I was one of the Unionist delegates, we would gladly have jumped for our party at the solution which is proposed in this bill.  The Home Rule Bill is on the Statute Book.  You cannot go back to the position of ten or twenty years ago.  You have got to face the position as it is.  Well, now, what is the proposal of our bill.  During the war, in the year 1916, while Mr. Asquith was still Premier, an attempt was made to solve this problem by agreement.  That attempt was based on leaving out the six counties of Ulster and giving the largest measure of local government possible to the rest of Ireland.  It did not succeed, but very nearly succeeded.  For a time it seemed as if the Nationalists were willing to accept it.  Well, now, if in a time like that, when there was a general desire for agreement, such a proposal was put forward, do you not think it probable that that is the fairest proposal now which the circumstances enable us to make?  I think it is.  (Hear, hear.)  We are bound by certain conditions, not the Unionist party only.  The Liberal Party, and no one expressed it more clearly than Mr. Asquith \u2013 the nation itself has declared that North-East Ulster has as much right to be free from Dublin \u2013 and more \u2013 as a Dublin Parliament has to be free from a British one.On that there can be no controversy.  Short of that we are giving the largest measure of self-government which is compatible with the security of the British Empire.  (Hear, hear.)  I do not say the prospects of its acceptance are good, but I do say this, that we have made on broad lines the fairest proposal that it is possible to make, and we cannot do more.  (Cheers.)  But for the Government, what we are thinking of is not so much this bill we are struggling with in the House of Commons.  What we are thinking of is the condition of Ireland.  (Hear, hear.)  It is deplorable.  I am not one of those who think, to use Mr. Gladstone\u2019s phrase, that the Irish have a double dose of original sin.  I do not believe for a moment that any large proportion of the Southern Irish sympathise with this conspiracy of dastardly murder which is going on.  I don\u2019t believe it.  (Hear, hear.)  But the curse of Ireland \u2013 I don\u2019t know how it happened \u2013 the curse of Ireland is the want of moral courage, and the terrorism which prevails which enables these murders to be committed, with comparative impunity.No Coercion of OpinionsWell, we are doing, we have done, we will continue to do everything which is in the power of the British Government to put down the most dastardly conspiracy that has ever occurred in the world.  (Cheers.)  We are not exercising force against opinions.  There is no coercion of opinion.  We are exercising, and will continue to exercise, whatever force we can against crime.  We have had the same thing before, and bad enough it was; and heaven knows there are very few people in this country who would not pay almost any price to get rid of this intolerable curse.  We have had the same thing many times before.  We have dealt with it.  We have got as a nation to put this down, to restore civilised conditions again in Ireland.  (Cheers.)Now I have only one more thing to say.  Our chairman said he was not going to prophesy as to the length of time the Coalition would continue.  Neither do I.  It does not worry me.  Really it does not worry me in the least.  I will tell you what I think about it.  Nobody can foresee what differences may arise \u2013 differences which may perhaps split it on the old party lines \u2013 I see no sign of it \u2013 but I say this, that we work together with our present Liberal colleagues, that we work together with the present Prime Minister, who in my deliberate judgement played the greatest part of any Briton in the war.  (Applause.)  We worked together with him in the war, we have worked with him now in reconstruction, and we shall work with him as long as we can honestly believe that our co-operation is for the good of the nation as a whole.  (Applause.)  In this city, and under the chairmanship of a man who bears the name \u2013 (applause) \u2013 which has made this city famous, which has added new glory to it, I cannot refrain from looking back on that other kind of co-operation which lasted for a very long time.  It did not mean that the Conservative party or our allies, the Liberal Unionists, remained in their old position.  It had this effect on all of us \u2013 it modified our policy, but do any of you think that was a bad thing?  I do not.  And just as that co-operation was undoubtedly for the good even of our party, and still more of the nation, so I hope and believe that the present co-operation will have the same good results on our history.  (Loud applause.)

aVLord Derby, my lords, ladies and gentlemen. My first words, my Lord, must be to thank you for the kind words in which you have spoken of an old colleague, and, I venture to say, an old friend. My next must be words of thanks to you, ladies and gentlemen of this great gathering, for the kindly reception and the great encouragement you have given me in my difficult and responsible task. My Lord, you have spoken of my predecessor. He won our confidence; he won something more - he won our affection. (Hear, hear.) And it is as a Unionist speaking to Unionists that I shall address you tonight.Appeal for PatienceNow, it would be foolish to deny and futile to ignore the existence of great anxiety among our party today. Many circumstances com­bine to produce that state of unrest and anxiety. New problems present themselves for solution, or new problems present them­selves under new phases, and it is not always easy to ascertain what is the proper application of the fundamental principles on which our party rests to these new problems or to these new aspects of old questions.I recognise that there is that unrest. I recognise that the very fact that the Govern­ment which you are asked to support is not a Government drawn solely from your own ranks, but a Government formed out of a union of parties adds to the disturbance and increases the anxiety. And beyond all above all looms once again the Irish question that has so often dominated over English politics and foiled our British statesmen.I recognise, and I think it best to recognise at once and frankly, that these suspicions cannot be wholly removed, these anxieties cannot be wholly allayed until the time comes when those to whom you have given your confidence can lay their hearts bare, toll you the whole story and ask your judgement on their actions. (Cheers.)For the moment, upon all of us, most of all upon those of us who are personally engaged in these negotiations, a great measure of restraint and reticence is imposed.Ladies and gentlemen, you can make war in the open; you can fight in the public eye, but if you want peace in any negotiations, there must be some measure of patience - (cheers) - some measure of confidence accorded by the different parties to those who represent them. Reticence NecessaryThere must be some reticence. You cannot conduct negotiations, with any hope of suc­cess, be they between nations, be they in our own public affairs, be they in any industrial dispute, if everything that is said in the council room is at once to be shouted front the house tops, if every tentative suggestion that is made is at once to be blazoned in the street, and no man can indicate that he will make some advance from the position which he first took up without knowing that it will be in the daily papers next morning.I ask you therefore to show that spirit of fair play for which I appealed in a letter that was in the hands of our conference today. (Hear, hear.) When you chose your leaders you knew something of them; they were not men who stepped into the arena at the moment for the first time. They had a record behind them in which you had some confi­dence.Give us a little time - We do not ask for much, and the whole story shall be told to you, and you shall judge whether we have kept faith, whether we have betrayed our trust. (Cheers.)Tonight some measure of reticence is imposed upon us. But I will speak as frankly as I can. Let me say a word first about our party position. We are met here tonight as Unionists and Conservatives - I was born in a different camp. (Laughter, and a voice: \u2018A British camp.\u2019)Let me say the name of Radical doesn\u2019t frighten me, but I have a good deal of affection for the old British word Tory. (Cheers.)What is our party position? We are met as members of the Unionist party, but my colleagues in the House of Commons who sit around me were elected to this Parliament not only as members of the Unionist party but as supporters of the Coalition based upon a programme approved and signed by the Prime Minister and Mr. Bonar Law. (Cheers.) I am told that Coalition is unpopular. You said so, my lord. (Laughter.) Well, most Governments are unpopular. I remember a wise and witty Civil Servant telling me that the result of his long experience was that he thought all Governments were very much alike, but with a tendency on the part of the last to be the worst. (Laughter.) Well, I make one claim for the Coalition. We have been in office for three years - three such years as you cannot parallel in the history of our country. In those three years we have carried out with a single exception the programme which our leaders put before you at the last general election. (Hear, hear.)One question remains for settlement - the reform of the House of Lords - (hear, hear, and cheers) - and the revision of its powers, and I think, without betraying my Privy Councillor\u2019s Oath, I may tell you that the Cabinet Committee has been busily at work upon that question, and we shall be ready to submit our proposals when Parliament meets again next year. (Cheers.)But the very name of Coalition indicates that it is a temporary expedient, a passing state of things. There have been coalitions and coalitions in the past. Some, after the emergency which called them into being has passed away, have broken up, and parties have resumed their old boundaries, and the party fight has been resumed upon its old lines. Others there have been, and we here as we meet tonight, are the creation of one such, are gathered together in a great emergency, even in their common action the basis of the future opinion which broadened the ideas of both, strengthened the Conser­vative forces in the country, and wrote a chapter in the new chapter in the history of the Empire. (Cheers.)A New PartyI will not prophecy. The future is in the lap of the gods. Sooner or later, sooner rather than later, the decision must be given. Either we of the present Coalition dissolve, breaking the forms of order, weakening the party of stability and con­stitutional progress. I don\u2019t hesitate to say that out of that Coalition, formed in the midst of war, at a time when national necessity, cemented by common action in years of difficulty and danger, since the war hardly less so, out of that Coalition will come a new party, constitutional, demo­cratic, national. (Cheers.)Ladies and gentlemen, the future will bring its own problem, and one of our great historic party, whether associated with others welded into one with them, or standing alone, will face those new problems with a new pro­gramme of constructive, administrative, and constitutional reform. (Hear, hear.).But before that time comes there is other work for us to do, work which cannot be done without our help, work which cannot be done by us alone. The need of the world at this moment is for peace. (Hear, hear) Nowhere is there greater need of peace than here, peace, national and international, peace political, and peace industrial - (cheers) - peace and security, the confidence which peace and secu­rity bring, to set going once more the springs of trade, to restore our shattered finances and lighten our burden to enable us to face the world - a great nation emerging from a great struggle, united, hopeful, and determined. (Cheers.)Need For PeaceTrade - and I speak of trade at a moment when a million and three quarters of our fellow citizens are out of work, anxious how they shall afford bread for their household; at a moment when the Government, bound by every tie of duty to try and reduce expenditure, has had to dip deep into the taxpayers\u2019 pocket to alleviate distress - trade cannot re­vive without peace. Trade cannot revive without confidence. Peace and confidence are greatest gift that any Government can bring to our people at this time. (Cheers.)I am glad to find that there are some signs of a revival, but confidence is a tender plant. A single unkindly frost will nip its buds and prevent its growth. Watch it, guard it, help it in its recovery.Whet is happening among employers and employed? We have passed through the greatest industrial conflict that this country has even seen; we have passed through it be it said with all credit to the law-abiding character of our people - (cheers) - to their good sense and to their patriotism, and may I add - not without credit to the poor discredited Government. (Cheers and laughter.)We passed through that great crisis in peace and in good temper such as no other country could have preserved throughout such a struggle. (Cheers.) What is happening? In countless industries and trades employers and employed have met in conference; conference has led to understanding, understanding has brought sympathy, and out of these confer­ences have come agreements where before they entered upon a prospect of agreement appeared hopeless.Is there not a lesson that we politicians can draw from our fellow men, employers or employed; who are conducting the great industries of this country. There are at this moment two momentous conferences meeting, one on this side of the Atlantic and one on the other. One seeks to bring peace to the world; the other seeks to bring peace to these islands. (Cheers.) Give us your goodwill in both efforts. (Loud cheers, and a voice: \u2018Give us your security.\u2019)The Washington ConferenceI will come to that. The first conference is that which is meeting at Washington. The opening address of President Harding and the statement made by Secretary of State Hughes mark a new page in the world\u2019s history. (Hear, hear.) They open a new era. By one great act of faith they have removed moun­tains of misunderstanding - (hear, hear) - and swept away suspicion. By one great act of faith they have secured the success of that conference and opened for the world a happier and a better era.Once again the United States take their rightful place as a leader among the nations of the world, and we of the British Empire hail their action with enthusiasm. We promise them our support, and throughout the conference our effort will be not to belittle the proposal which they have made, but to fulfil and to complete it. (Cheers.) I say that I believe that the great act of the United States Government has secured the success of the Washington Conference from its opening day. (Cheers.)What of the other conference, the conference that is meeting in London? Is that, too, to be successful, or is failure once again to dog our steps, to frustrate the efforts of statesman­ship, and to plunge Irishmen, yes, and Englishmen, once more into fratricidal strife? I cannot speak to you freely of the proceed­ings of that conference. Such secrets as they are are other men\u2019s secrets besides my own. (Hear, hear.) Partial disclosure is always unfair - (hear, hear) - nearly always mischievous, and always a betrayal of trust. (Cheers.) I have, therefore, no revelations to make.But I want to put to you two questions, and I want an answer today. The first question is whether we were right to try for peace. (Cries of \u2018Yes.\u2019) We have heard a great deal recently of Die-hards. (Laughter.) I am not going to say an unkind word about Die-hards. I have been a Die-hard myself. (Laughter) If some people had their way I should very soon be a Die-hard again. When the colonel of the Middlesex Regiment fell mortally wounded at Albuera, calling to his men, \u2018Die hard, my men, die hard,\u2019 he knew what he was fighting for. He knew it was a cause worth giving his life for, and he called upon his men to do the same. Don\u2019t let anybody die before it is necessary. (Laughter.) I don\u2019t want them to die. I want them to live to fight beside us, and I am convinced that if they will have a little patience, and if they will wait until they know, there will be no split amongst us - (hear, hear) - there will be no discord, and whether the result of the Conference be peace or war, be good or evil, we shall stand a united patty in the great decisions that have to be taken. (Cheers.) No.I have no quarrel with \u2018Die-hards.\u2019 They are men of sincere conviction - (hear, hear) - and of strong faith. (Hear, hear.) All I can ask of them is that they should wait until they have the material for adjusting.I our not afraid of \u2018Die-hards.\u2019 I am afraid of men with hot-heads today, who have cold feet tomorrow. (Laughter and cheers.) You know them, you know the type. We see them in every struggle - the men who halloos you on to fight today, who ask tomorrow whether you weren\u2019t a little hasty, and who a few days later find the means by which you pursue your ends too coarse for their queasy stomachs, and after a few weeks scuttling to the rear ready to surrender anything and make peace at any price.Peace with Honour - or WarIf it must be war it shall be war. If peace cannot be had with honour - (cheers) - if peace cannot be had without broken pledges, there can be no peace, and if the country is convinced that honour is not safe, it will make sacrifices which are necessary, fight out the battle, and will endure for as long as the struggle lasts.But make no mistake, war is a cruel thing. Civil war is the most horrible form of war. Civil war is the most terrible form of war, and before the country enters on a struggle it will require them to place at the disposal of the Government resources that we have not yet had to raise, forces which do not now exist, to spend millions which we must get as we can, and to sacrifice life again for a great cause as we sacrificed it in the great war.Before the country is asked to do that, be­fore I ask you to do that - you of my own party - you must know that I have tried to make peace. You must know that I have exhausted patience and conciliation, and that if I call upon you, you of my own party for this sacrifice - (a voice: \u2018We shall be there\u2019) - it is not until all other means have been found in vain and no other course is left open. (Cheers.)Ladies and gentlemen, the limits within which we can make peace are known to you all.No British Government can barter away the allegiance of British subjects to the Crown. (Cheers.)No British Government can barter away portions of our great Empire. No British Government can deprive itself of that full power over ports and harbours and seaways which necessary to the life of our nation and to the free communications of the Empire.No Government, of which your representa­tives are members, no Government, of which the Prime Minister is a member, will coerce Ulster. (Cheers.)Those are the limits set by stern necessity and solemn pledges to the liberty of those who are negotiating in your behalf. It is within those limits that we seek a settlement. I hope - I dare not say more - I hope that with patience, with goodwill, with consideration, we may yet find a way to peace within those bounds. (Cheers.)Unionist SupportNow there is a second question that I want to put. I think if I rightly gather your feeling you say as the House of Commons said - yes, and not only the House of Commons - you say that we have a right to try for peace before we went to the extreme measures that were necessary in the other alternative. (Cheers.)As the House of Commons said - but not only the House of Commons, I should not have been content, I doubt if I should have been here if that vote had been carried only by the help of parties that are opposed to us. I should not have been content - I doubt if I should have been here - if that vote had been carried only by the Allies closely asso­ciated with us but still not of us. It was the fact of the Unionist party in the House, no less than of any other section of the House, and the vote which was approved and repeated in the great conference held here today. (Cheers.) It is to them that I hold my authority. It is to their approval that I find myself strong, and while they support me I will do my best to carry this policy through. (Cheers.)But now assume, as I think I may, that the great bulk of you are with us so far, you may say, \u2018Yes, but we went too far in our offer of the Dominion status or something very like it to the representatives of Southern Ire­land.\u2019 We invited them to take their place freely and voluntarily as loyal subjects of the King, a Free State in the great Commonwealth of nations that makes the British Empire.You way think we went too far. I want to say a word upon that. Why did our old Unionist policy fail? Not, in my belief, at any rate, because it was wrong. I think it was right. (Hear, hear.) It failed because the country would not pursue it consistently through good fortune and through bad. It failed because, after Mr. Gladstone\u2019s conversion, the Union was no longer a national policy but a party policy, and Ireland is too close to us, her affairs react too constantly upon us, she is too ever-present with us at Westminster, and every day, to enable you to build upon a party basis a permanent solution of the Irish question. (Hear, hear.)What, then, were we to do? Our object was to find at this great crisis, at this hour, after so many failures, some solid foundation on which to build once again a national policy, to find some policy from which no British Government could or would depart, and once again to remove the Irish question from the scene of party conflict, where it followed our fortunes, upset our fortunes, and was itself the shuttlecock, tossed from battledore to battledore, and a great opportunity offered, and was such as was not open to our prede­cessors and those whose memory we revere.The growth of the Dominions, the new position which they had assumed the more vital, the most vital partnership of Empire already come to birth before the war, and developed during the war, offered a basis that had never before been at the command of any British statesman. It was the kind of chance that Chatham, with his eagle eye, would have fixed upon. It was a chance which a Disraeli with his deep insight and prophetic vision, would have prayed and worked for - (cheers) - and it is a chance - forgive me for saying this - which Joseph Chamberlain would have seized and made his own. (Loud cheers.) We have taken it. It is perhaps the last chance of settlement that these islands will see. (Cheers.)I have one more observation to make. It is my last, and it is in the nature of a confession. I have been in Parliament for very nearly thirty years: I have given goodness knows how many votes. There are some that I would not repeat with my later knowledge and experi­ence. (Laughter.) There are only one or two that I would undo, and I will tell you one of them. The South African war was a just and necessary war. (Cheers.) But if the issues then fought out and settled there could have been no lasting peace in that country.But though peace was signed, though alle­giance was sworn, reconciliation lagged behind. Then came a change of Government, and with the new Government a new policy. By a great act of daring faith - (hear, hear) - they con­ferred upon our recent enemies in the Transvaal and Orange Free State, on the morrow of our victory, full self-government. I voted against them. I thought it a rash and wicked thing to do.Ah, if we could have seen further into the future, if I could have voted in the division, with the knowledge I have today, I should have known that that great act of faith was not, as I thought it, the destruction of our policy, but its completion and its fulfilment. (Cheers.) That is the vote that I would undo if I could undo a vote once given. That great act, that daring act of faith led directly to the reconciliation of the races in South Africa. It led to the Union of South Africa, it brought South Africa into the war with us - (hear, hear) it added German East Africa and German Southwest Africa to the British ter­ritory. (Cheers.)Now and again in the affairs of men there comes a moment when courage is safer than prudence, when some great act of faith, touch­ing the hearts and stirring the emotions of men, achieves the miracle, that no arts of may be passing before our eyes now that we statesmanship can compass. Such a moment meet here. I pray to God with all my heart and soul that each of us to whom responsi­bility is brought may be given vision to see the faith and to act with courage and persevere. (Loud cheers, during which Mr. Chamberlain resumed his seat, having spoken for three-quarters of an hour).
p198
aVMr. Chairman, my Lords, ladies and gentlemen - I am deeply touched by the warmth of the welcome you have just given me, but I know that your feeling of goodwill will extend even to this extent that as I have been making in the last few weeks a larger number of speeches than ever before in my life you will not be disappointed if I do not take up a great deal of your time now.  We are met today, partly at least, to express our sense of rejoicing at the result of the last election.  (Cheers)  Whatever may happen in the future, that result justifies, in my belief, the action which was taken by us.  (Cheers)  It justifies it, not merely because we have once again a Unionist Government, supported by a Unionist majority in the House of Commons, but because the change, in my sincere belief, is one which has been good for the nation as a whole.  (Cheers)\u2018Political Meteorologists\u2019Now, ladies and gentlemen, there is no doubt about the completeness of our success.  I dare say you have noticed that some people who have been taking an interest in showing that although apparently we have a majority, in reality it does not exist.  (Laughter)  That kind of political meteorologist \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 has not been unknown in the past.  I have myself, when in a minority, occasionally amused myself by dealing with that kind of subject.  (Laughter)  I was rather surprised that Mr. Lloyd George, with all his experience, should have thought it worth his while to start that ancient game.  (Laughter)  It is a proof at which we all rejoice, that his freedom from great responsibilities has enabled him to begin again to enjoy life on a lower plane. (Laughter)  Now, what are the conditions?  It is that we represent a minority.  Let us examine it.  If you have four or five parties fighting in a great many of the constituencies, it is obvious that no single party can expect to get a majority of the votes, and the sole ground for any justification of that kind would be the assumption, which, of course, is made, that everyone who does not vote for us would have voted for some other Parliamentary Party which the political meteorologist had in mind.  What truth is there in that?I think it is safe to say that those who supported particular candidates, if they had not had those candidates, would have been more likely to give their vote to us than to any other party.  (Laughter)  Take, for instance, the two sections of the Liberal Party.  There may be Liberal reunion \u2013 I confess I would be rather glad to see it \u2013 but at the last election \u2013 I am, I think, not uncharitable in saying that a supporter of either of the Liberal parties would rather have given his vote to us than to his other Liberal.  (Laughter)In regard to the Labour Party \u2013 which we call by courtesy the Labour Party \u2013 (hear, hear and cheers) \u2013 but who by no means represent Labour to as great an extent as we do \u2013 (cheers) \u2013 if we can judge by what I have seen in the House of Commons \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 I think that they, too, although they have no special love for us, would, if they had to choose, have given their votes to us rather than to either of the Liberal parties.  (Laughter)  Mr. Lloyd George went on to say that the fact that we were the representatives of a minority in the nation made it impossible for us to deal as a Government could deal who represents the majority.  That would be a strange doctrine from anyone, and from him it is peculiarly strange.  For five or six years, from 1910 onwards, the Government in the House of Commons represented the Liberal Party, who, so far from having a majority vote, had not so large a vote as was given to the Unionist Party, and all through our party was equal in numbers, and latterly exceeded, the Liberal strength.  You will perhaps remember that this Government of a party which was in a minority did not hesitate to carry through Parliament the most extreme measures of every kind.  I am not alarmed by that criticism.  We have our majority \u2013 (hear, hear) \u2013 and I have not the slightest hesitation in saying that we shall use it to pass the measures which we think in the interest of the country.  (Cheers)\u2018Not a Bad Government\u2019I would like to say a word about our Government.  I do not think it is a bad Government.  (Laughter)  We may not have \u2013 at least I would not like to assert that we have \u2013 a monopoly of first-class brains.  (Laughter)  But we are, I hope, and I believe, a Government composed of men with good judgement \u2013 (hear, hear) \u2013 and what is perhaps not less important, they are a Government of first-class loyalty.  (Cheers)  We are working together, and I am sure will continue to work together as a team without personal ambitions or jealousies, with the desire to serve the country.  (Cheers)Our party in the House of Commons has, during this short session, been very severely tried.  We have had a number of late sittings, which, I think, is always deplorable, but which I certainly believe in this case were inevitable.  The crisis which caused the election came so late that we had no choice as to the time that Parliament could be called together.  A certain amount of business had to be done, and, thanks to the loyalty of our supporters, it has been done.  (Cheers)I have been a long time a member of the House of Commons, and I say that never in my experience in that House has the attendance of members supporting the Government at these late sittings been so good as it was during the session just ended.  (Cheers)Danger of Large MajoritiesIt was suggested to me that I should have called together the members of our party in the House of Commons and addressed them on their duties.  I declined to do so.  I felt certain that they realised them as well as I did.  But as there are so many members of the House of Commons here today they will not, I am sure, take it amiss if I point out to them two or three things which make the present position quite different from what it was in the previous Parliament.  The first of these things is this.  On divisions we very often get very large majorities, and there is a danger that our supporters might think that their absence would make no difference.  I impute no evil motives to anybody, but a Government is a Government, and an Opposition is an Opposition, and you may be sure of this, that if at any time it looks as if the Government were going to be beaten the conscientious objections of all members of all parties in the Opposition will make it impossible for them to support us on an occasion like that.  (Laughter)  We have, therefore, to rely upon ourselves, and that means that there must be closer attendance.  It must be looked upon as a duty that there should be closer attendance than was the case in the last Parliament.  In that respect the members of the Government propose to set an example.  It is, indeed, very often an inconvenience for the head of a Department to do his work in the room in the House of Commons, but we realise the new situation, and whenever possible the work will be done there, so that the members of the Government will be available when their votes are required.Loyalty to PartyOnly one other thing I wish to say in that connection is this: In the last Parliament the majority was so large that people were able to do to a large extent what is impossible in Party Government, viz., to vote on any question in precisely the way it struck them.  (Laughter)  In the new conditions that is impossible, and I can assure you it does not mean any loss of principles on the part of those who support the Government.  There are questions which are vital on which there can be no doubt at all, but the great majority of questions which arise in Parliament on which there might be a difference of opinion are questions on which probably, when discussed in the Cabinet there were certain differences of opinion.  But when, after consultation, we decide what is the best method to pursue we must adhere to it.I put this with perfect confidence to every member of our Party in the House of Commons, that Party Government must cease unless we support the Party which, on the whole, we believe is right, and that on minor questions we must subordinate our own views to the general interest of the more important causes which we are supporting.  (Cheers)  I say that not at all from any sense that it is necessary to say it.  I do say to you that the Government could not continue unless we had the complete confidence not only of our Party in the House of Commons, but of the representatives of our Party throughout the constituencies.I said long ago, when I first became leader of our Party, that I would not attempt to lead a divided Party.  I have no fears in that connection.  I have received so far, both from the constituencies and from the members of our Party in the House of Commons, evidences of goodwill and confidence greater than I had any right to expect and greater far than I pretend to deserve.  (Cheers)I am not going to repeat what I said during the election, and it was not my saying it, but the fact that it was true, that enabled us to win the election \u2013 and that is that at this moment what the country needs so far as it is possible for any Government to give it is rest \u2013 (hear, hear) \u2013 freedom from any controversial question it is not necessary to raise so that our people may devote their own energies to relieving the situation in which the war has left us.  (Cheers)  I need not tell you that when I agreed to undertake the task which has fallen upon me I was not in the least ignorant of what it meant and of what the difficulties were in front of us.  I spoke over and over again and it became a joke \u2013 which I did not mind \u2013 about tranquillity.  (Laughter)  I promised to do my best to give that tranquillity to the country, but I was never for a moment foolish enough to think I would get any of it for myself.  (Laughter)  I believe that the main thing upon which the recovery of this country depends is the revival of trade and the restoring of confidence of those engaged in industry by making them feel that nothing unexpected or surprising is going to be sprung upon them at any moment.  The best thing we can do for trade is to create a sense of security.Lausanne ConferenceAllies Working as OneBut there are circumstances which are beyond our control.  The greatest danger is in connection with foreign affairs.  It is a commonplace to say that at any time, and most of all at a time like this, prosperity and tranquillity at home depend upon peace abroad.  At the election I put it as one of my strongest points that we were going back to the old system of leaving the work of the Departments to be done by the Departments, and that in no case was that so important as in foreign affairs.  (Cheers)I think, although nothing definite has yet been accomplished, that the change we have made has already justified itself.  Take the Conference at Lausanne.  You know want the position was, that we were at a declared difference of opinion with our Allies, that we were in danger of having to act alone, and of going to war alone.  Under the new system the Allies have worked together as one at Lausanne, and I feel sure that they will continue so to work.  I am equally sure that unity of action, and that alone, will secure that peace which the world so much requires.  (Cheers)In this connection, though it is absurd for a member of a Government to praise one of his colleagues, I feel bound to say something about the Foreign Secretary.  I have heard \u2013 not from him, though he found time to write me a letter almost every day on what was going on, in spite of being at work until two or three o\u2019clock every morning \u2013 that there is nothing but praise from all sides for the manner in which his work was conducted.  (Hear, hear)  Everyone who knew him knew that he had mental powers of a very exceptional order.  He has always shown a readiness to undertake great responsibilities, because he knows that the Government is behind him, and will back him up.Reparations ProblemI was present myself at a meeting of Prime Ministers.  In spite of my desire to devolve all foreign affairs on the Foreign Office that is impossible; I have to take my share.  Here, again, the difficulty was reparations, which had seemed to me almost an insoluble problem, so much so that I hesitated as to whether I could undertake my present task.  It is a terribly difficult problem.  This at least I can tell you.In the House of Commons yesterday I spoke only about the French.  There were two other Allied Prime Ministers present.  There was Belgium, which has always shown a wisdom and a desire to prevent complications which are above praise.  There was also the new Prime Minister of Italy \u2013 and I am sure that neither the Government nor the people of this country will ever forget that Italy came into the struggle at a time when it was vital to the Allies, and that Italy played a noble part therein.  Whatever the result may be, there was nothing but goodwill throughout the whole of that Conference; and, in my opinion, however difficult any problem may be, the chance of solving it is increased enormously when all those engaged wish to solve it if they can. Situation at HomeAs regards the home situation, I am sanguine enough to believe \u2013 and I get my views from men whom I used to know in business, and on whose judgement I rely \u2013 that the worst of the trade trouble is over, and that we are on the way to better times.That is undoubtedly true in many trades.  I learnt yesterday a fact to which I won\u2019t attach very much importance, but it is worth knowing.  Of all industries shipbuilding is the worst.  Well, I heard from a Glasgow friend something about a gentleman who in past years made a great deal of money \u2013 which our Labour friends regard as a crime, but on which I do not take the same view \u2013 by buying old ships when nobody else would buy them, and selling them afterwards.  That gentleman has laid down two or three ships as a speculation, because he thinks he could not do better later. (Hear, hear)  That, in my opinion, is a very good sign.The House of Commons has been greatly instructed, or amused, by the development of views on social questions to which we had not been accustomed in the House.  A great many of the most striking of these speeches came from compatriots of mine.  Perhaps for that reason I listened to them with more interest than, possibly, was given by other members.  It was, to me, a psychological problem.  They spoke very well, so well that I was not surprised that in a city where there is so much unemployment they should have won elections.  Perhaps, again, because they are compatriots, I am not sure that they mean so badly; and I have the hope that contact \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 with the realities \u2013 (more laughter) \u2013 as represented by the views expressed in other parts of the House will convince them that the millennium is not going to happen tomorrow.  That will be a great gain. Helping the UnemployedThey spoke of unemployment.  I am addressing a gathering from all parts of the country which is supposed to represent, if we are to believe our opponents, the reactionary class.  I do not believe there is a man or a woman here who does not realise what a terrible problem this is.  It is not merely the money we have to spend \u2013 though we cannot go on spending it for many years without disaster \u2013 but the fact that so many men lose the habit of working.  That is a disaster greater than the money which has to be spent to enable them to live.  Any Government, therefore, must do its best to deal with the question.  We have laid down proposals in the House of Commons, but that is not our last word.  Our Unemployment Committee is sitting continuously.I will tell you quite frankly what our view of the problem is.  There is not the slightest use in putting men on relief works which are not useful, and which they know themselves are not useful.  But it is right, and we shall not hesitate in the matter, to advance the money when works are useful.  I am not holding out any great hopes, for not many opportunities are in sight.  But we can help in financing work which is in itself useful, and is only going to be done now rather than later.I thank you again for your welcome.  In spite of what our critics have said, we have received a vote of confidence.  But it is not for those who are putting on their armour to boast as those who are taking it off.  We have to justify that confidence, and, with your support, we shall do our utmost to achieve that end.  (Loud cheers)

aVMy Lord Duke, my lords, ladies, and gentlemen. The first question which I proposed to put to you when I stood on this platform was \u2018Are you ready?\u2019 (\u2018Yes,\u2019 and cheers.) I knew when I entered the hall that you were - (laughter) - and I want to congratu­late you not only on this meeting, but also on the successful conference which you are holding in Newcastle, on the handling of the problems which you have discussed, in the character of the speeches that have been made, and on the admirable spirit which has characterised the work you have done.Nothing has given me more pleasure than to find that one of my ambitions is being realised, and that the working men of this country are coming to take their proper place in the ranks of our Party - (cheers) - ­and that a ladder is being set an amongst us which may serve them no less effectually than that ladder that exists today in the Labour Party, by which a man, whatever his means or his origin, may hope, by the exercise of his own natural ability, to ren­der service to his country into whatsoever office he may he called. (Applause.) We have suffered in the past from the lack of close association in our counsels with those who are in many ways nearest to us; and because of that many today are now in the ranks of Labour who ought to be with us - (applause) - for there are no more crusted Tories in England than many of those who sit not only in the Back but on the Front Bench of the Labour Ministry today. (Applause.)I want to talk to you tonight for a short time on one or two topics upon which we ought to have clear minds before we go into the fight that is now imminent.Dawes ReportI want to begin by saying a few words about the recent arrangement that has been made in London with the Allies and Germany with regard to what is called the Dawes Report. We have all been familiar for years past - and it has been put from every platform - with the theory of which I am myself a supporter - that you can get no permanent improvement of the trade of the country until you have stability restored throughout the nations of the earth. It was to that end that successive Governments have worked, and it has been reserved to the present Prime Minister to bring to a successful issue labours initiated by his predecessors. And I, for one, am not envious of him. I congratulate him, as I shall have something very different to say by and bye - (laughter) - on the result of the work done this summer in London. When the trade machine fails to function, through any large country being out of operation, the trade of the whole world suffers.In the case of Germany, if her foreign trade be destroyed, or interfered with seri­ously, it prevents her from purchasing overseas, the results of which purchase result in the sacrifice for those countries which in their turn are employed in the purchase of manufactured goods, of which we in our turn are bound to get whatever share we may be able to. But it is per­fectly true that the increased trade that will come through the rehabilitation of Ger­many - that is to say, the increased world trade - must be coupled at the same time with an increased competitive power in Germany, and you have to weigh the bal­ance of advantage.There is no doubt about regarding the world as the whole balance of advantage in the rehabilitation of German trade. The probability in my view is that the balance on the whole is to our advantage, but subject to one or two observations I shall have to make in a few moments. But it has been common knowledge to all students of this subject that no rehabilita­tion of German trade was possible until inside that country they could succeed in stabilising their currencies, and as a consequence regulating the foreign exchanges with that country.Loan a NecessityNow to achieve that result a loan is an absolute necessity. That has always been recognised, and those who have spoken loudest in the past in favour of securing reparations from Germany must have known, if they realised that reparations could only be paid from increased exports, that those increased exports could not come until that preliminary condition of stabilisation had been obtained. The Dawes report has shown clearly that the preliminary step is the negotiation of a loan for Germany. Now what kind of a loan is that, because I shall be speaking presently of the proposed loan to Russia, and I want you to remember clearly in your minds what the essential difference is between these two loans? (Cheers.) The loan proposed to Germany is a loan to be raised by private subscription with no form of Government guarantee. (Cheers.) That means that the liability for the loss, if any, will fall on those and those alone who subscribed to that loan. (Cheers.) The loan is to be subscribed for in the various Allied countries who took part in the war, and the largest part - as is only proper - is to be contributed by the United States of America. (Hear, hear.) Now, so far as the German currency may be stabilised, and the equilibrium in her exchanges affected by means of this loan, to that extent the competitive power of Germany will be reduced, because she will lose those fortuitous advantages that have accrued to her from the debased state of her currency, and from the unsettled state of the exchanges. But, all the same, there is a real risk to our trade in this country with Germany - relieved as she has been by the very debasement of her currency, relieved as she has been of all her mort­gage debts and prior charges - that she may have such an advantage in competi­tion that we may find that her exports may do us serious damage. (Hear, hear.)Safeguards for IndustryOn that I only want to say two or three words.I want to repeat what. I have said on several occasions - that at this forth­coming election the general tariff is no part of our programme. We do not stand for it, but we hold ourselves at liberty to safeguard any efficient industry in which unemployment may be caused by unfair competition of any kind.The safeguarding of that industry by such a measure of safeguarding as, after careful study and consideration, may seem to us the most effective instrument for that purpose. (Cheers.) That has all along been our policy since I declared it last January. It is a policy to which most people, irrespective of Party in this country, would today give their assent. It is a policy for which we stand, and it as an essential policy having regard to the fact that we support the findings of the Dawes Report - the Commission which we ourselves called into being. And, indeed, to support the Dawes Report and not to be prepared to take these steps that I have indicated would be an act of lunacy.But there are opponents to the carrying out of the Dawes Report. There are oppo­nents to the loan to Germany, and there are opponents to the rehabilitation of German trade.Now this has not been pointed out in public before, but it is a matter of very grave importance. Who are the opponents of the arrangements negotiated by the Labour Party, supported by us and sup­ported - I have no reason to think otherwise - by the Liberals? The opponents of the Dawes Report are the Communist Party.Communist OppositionRecently there was a whole column in the daily Press reporting a meeting of that Party and stating that they objected to the carrying out of this report on the ground that it would make Germany a servile State. But why do the Communist Party in England object to it? Because they have their orders from Moscow. Why does Moscow object to it? Because Moscow has now repudiated the ideas for which she has stood for the last few years to cause world revolution, and she knows that a settled Germany and a contented Germany will offer a barrier to her ambitions that a Germany in her present condi­tion cannot do. Because, although it may be a fact that there are men today in Germany who are making fortunes, it is also a fact that you cannot have a prosper­ous and a contented working class where your currency is debased or your values are changing from day to day and the rewards of labour are not comparable to the rewards of capital.Western Europe has a civilisation to pre­serve, and it is our duty to do all we can to preserve it in these days. And the barrier of Western European civilisation must be made strong and firm against any subversive onslaughts that may come from the East - and there is no surer and better way of doing that than to begin by carry­ing out the terms of the Dawes Report, and bringing once more the great German market into contact with the markets of the world.No one knows better than I do that cheap and easy arguments may be used against this, and I ask you to think seriously and deeply on this subject as to whether our plain duty to Europe and to the world is not, as I say, to do all that we can to strengthen that common civilisa­tion to which all of us belong in the West of Europe.The West of Europe has its own problems, I know. It has its own problems of peace - and difficult enough they are.We have one among us tonight, my old friend, Lord Cecil - (cheers) - who has devoted with rare enthusiasm his great abilities for years past to trying to solve those difficult questions at the League of Nations. (Cheers.) And we must all of us wish him in his efforts well, and hope that the Conferences of that League in time, guided by wisdom and by experi­ence, may render some real help in bring­ing about what is essential to us in this world, and that is a better prospect of a lengthy period of peace throughout that part of Europe to which we belong.The Russian LoanNow I pass naturally from considering the case of Germany and the Dawes Report, and the proposed loan to Germany to the proposed loan to Russia. I make no apology for speaking about that loan, for it is the very key and lynch-pin of the Russian Treaty.I have read a very interesting letter in The Times from Dr. Shadwell, a man whose views I always regard with respect, and he gives reasons why he desires the confirmation of that Treaty. His reason is that if it were confirmed it would be such an object lesson to the people of this country in its result that they would learn - as they could by no other means - certain elementary lessons, of which they stand in need. If I were a tactician I would agree with Dr. Shadwell all the way. But unfortunately I am trying to be a statesman, and I cannot agree with him. And in spite of what may be said or thought of our action, I am resolved to do all in my power to prevent that loan ever becoming an accomplished fact. (Cheers.)I want to give you my objection - my principal objection - to the Treaty. There are many objections and it will be argued very closely in the House of Commons, and I do not propose tonight to go into details. But I can give you in a few words why I am opposed to assenting to that Treaty.A Question of HonourIf there is one thing in this world which England stands for it is the honour of her word once given. (Cheers.) Our credit is based upon it, our reputation in every country of the world.No Government could honestly affix its signature to that Treaty because if it did so it would give an implicit under­taking to the Soviet Government that this country would guarantee a loan to them at a future date.The Government must know as well as I know, and you know, that in no circumstances would Parliament or the country at any time guarantee a loan to that Government. (Cheers.) Therefore, by affixing our signature to that Treaty we are pretending that we are going to do something that we know we cannot do - (hear, hear) - and we are leading the Russian Government to believe that we shall do something which we have no intention of doing - (hear, hear) - and for that our honour, our word, suffers. No Government has any right to give that implicit assurance unless it knows that it has the assent of the country behind it. (Hear, hear.)Now, what does the guarantee involve? I told you that with regard to the German Loan the loss, if any resulted through default of interest or principal, would fall on the investor and the investor alone. The investor is presumed to be able to look after himself but, with a guaranteed loan, if the person to whom you lend the money under the guarantee fails in the matter of this interest or of principal, the taxpayer of this country has to make good the deficit. (Hear, hear.) That is the difference and, for more than a generation, this country, to the best of my recollection, has never in any circumstances guaranteed a loan to a foreign country. The only guarantee that I can recall that has been made was the joint guarantee under the auspices of the League of Nations to help Austria to recover her credit, and the guarantee of the loan was coupled with the most stringent conditions, under which a nominee of the League of the Nations was given practical control over the finances of Austria until they were rehabilitated - a completely different thing. (Hear, hear.)Incalculable FollyThis country has not so much money today that she can afford to run these risks. (Cheers.) The guaranteeing of a loan to Russia at the price - if, indeed, any price would bring subscriptions - (laughter) - the guaranteeing of a loan at the price that might bring subscriptions would tend to depress all the Government stocks in this country. And to contem­plate a loan of that kind - and I say nothing tonight about the Russian Gov­ernment - let me merely say that in a country which is but a secondary market to us, when you think of our Dominions - ­(cheers) - it is to me incalculable folly.I may perhaps ask here - not that I can get an answer, but we shall ask it in the House of Commons - what the Prime Minister meant on the 18th of June in the House of Commons when he said that the Government did not propose to consider a guarantee to any Russian obligation, and then, within seven weeks, at 24 hours\u2019 notice, he was prepared not only to con­sider it but to accept it?Again the Prime Minister gave us a pledge that he would consider amend­ments, whereas Mr. Ponsonby - (\u2018Oh\u2019 and laughter) - in a report just published for the use of the people, has told us that any amendment to the Treaty would alter the principle upon which it was based, what­ever that may mean, and would be a mere subterfuge on the part of those who had a cowardly fear of taking the responsibility of direct opposition. We shall endeavour to effect a reconciliation of these statements.Fate of GeorgiaFor the rest of the Treaty there is hardly a clause in it that will stand examination. I do not propose to weary you tonight; but I would remind you that Mr. Lloyd George, who has a far wider vocabulary than I, and could rise to infinitely greater heights and, if I may add, plumb far pro­founder depths, has described it. I endorse his description. (Applause.)Let me remind you in passing while I am on this subject - if I may devote five minutes to it - let me remind you of the fate of the Socialist Republic of Georgia. Let me remind you of the praise it received from the present Prime Minister, and how he and the Minister of Labour (Mr. Shaw) went out there in 1920, shortly after the month of May of that year, when it had been guaranteed independence by the Soviet Government, and how they reported that it was a model of everything that a Socialist Republic should be. Let me remind you of that guarantee of indepen­dence by the Soviet in May 1920. In February of the following year the Red Army, without any declaration of war, overran that little country, overran it and gave it up to pillage, murder, and rapine. They took possession of it. They destroyed its Constitution. They took its oil, and it is now part of the Soviet Union. (\u2018Shame.\u2019)I mention that because a little over a year ago we had one or two questions in the House of Commons from Mr. Snowden, the Chancellor of the Exchequer. He asked the Government, of which I was then the head, if we were aware of the executions and persecutions of the Georgian people which were being carried out by the Bolshevist Government, and so on. And we had to admit the accuracy of the fact, and lament, in answer to supple­mentary questions, that we were unable by any ordinary diplomatic methods to do anything to help them.And Mr. Snowden said - and it is in Hansard of the 17th of July of last year - \u2018Should the question of the recognition of the Soviet Government arise, will the British Government, in considering the matter, insist in the conditions of recognition that the independence of these States should be recognised?\u2019Question for Mr. SnowdenI want to know if that question was considered when recognition was granted to the Soviet Government. If not, I want to know if Mr. Snowden has changed his mind. And, incidentally, while I am ask­ing, very respectfully, a question of Mr. Snowden, I would like to know if he approves, or not, of the loan to Russia.I have only one or two more observa­tions to make on this Treaty, the life of which I think is limited. I would make this observation following on what I have just said about Georgia. If you throw your mind back some years, you will remember that, under the old regime, events used to take place in the Turkish Empire that filled our people - and the Labour Party as much as anyone - with horror.I have no recollection that recognition was withheld from Turkey, but I venture to say this - that if a proposal had been made by our Government to guarantee a loan to the Turks at that time there would have been some objections raised in the Labour Party. (Laughter and cheers.)I should like to know whether the Dominions were consulted in that 24 hours during which the Government decided to come to an agreement with Russia as to the terms of the agreement. We have had more than one debate during this last Session on the importance of consult­ing at every point, in negotiating foreign Treaties, the Governments of our Dominions - (cheers) - and the present Secretary of State for the Colonies has expressed himself no less anxious to take that course than any other section in the House. Was that course taken, and if so what replies were received from the Dominions? (Hear, hear.)Repudiation of DebtOne other point. In signing this Treaty we tacitly assent to the Russian doctrine of repudiation of debt. (Hear, hear.) Has the Government considered how we compromise the position of our old Allies, especially the position of France - (hear, hear) - whose people probably hold more stock in the various Russian loans than any other people in Europe? Have they considered how far more difficult we make it for them when the time comes for them to negotiate on behalf of their nationals by the surrender we have made in con­sidering the case of our own nationals?And have the Government further con­sidered how difficult they have made it for any future British Government in negotiating on the question of Allied loans due to this country, when we have dealt separately, or propose to deal separately, with Russia - which was at one time an ally, and, as an ally, received large loans from us - in accepting their position that they will only pay, if at all, what they think they will be able, which means, in other words, what they can get out of us. (Laughter.)It is rather curious, when you look at that part of the Treaty, to hear what is said, and to read what is written in Labour literature about the immense potential wealth of Russia. I offer no comment myself at the moment on what that potential wealth may be, but if Russia is, as they represent, the country of immense potential wealth, why allow her to say that she will never be able to pay more than a fraction of her debts? I wonder again what the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who is the guardian of all our pockets - although during that guardian­ship he reserves to himself alone the right to rifle them at pleasure - I wonder what he has to say to that.Uneconomic WisdomShall I say that our objections to this Treaty are political, and did exist only because we dislike your form of Govern­ment, although they are always ready to say in the House of Commons that they do not like the form of Government them­selves? No, it is not that.If the Russian Government was a Government of angels, and I were Prime Minister, I would say they are such silly angels that in their uneconomic wisdom I would not attempt to do business with them.We should be inundated by and by with promises - no, they cannot be greater than the promises made before, but promises of the amount of trade that this Treaty would bring us from Russia. But I cannot help thinking myself that the promises, from whatever quarter they may be made, are a little shop-soiled. Last year our trade with Russia amounted to about one-third of one per cent. To believe that there is an immense trade to be done with Russia at present is a delusion. It is a delusion, like the bulging corn bags, which, if they bulge at all, bulge with nothing but gas. (Laughter.)No Treaties can make trade in the absence of just one or two little things. I have said it before many times, but I am going to repeat it - trade will only go when the trader feels that he will be paid for the goods he delivers, and when he can obtain justice in the country where he sells in case of trouble.Question of Trade Just insofar, and no farther than those conditions are fulfilled, trade will increase with Russia. If those conditions can be fulfilled, trade will begin to increase more rapidly. But let us remember this - and this is where I think the Labour Party are inclined sometimes to go off the rails - you can never call a man an educated man until he knows what he does not know - (laughter and applause) - and if that be a test, many of my friends who sit opposite to me in the House of Commons cannot yet pass it. (Laughter.)Russia has never yet been, and I don\u2019t believe ever will be, one of our principal markets. Geographically and linguisti­cally, the conditions are against it, just as those same conditions are against us in trading on the lower waters of the Danube.I know trade is done, special trade, and here and there people have done well out of it.But our natural markets are the Dominions - (cheers) - and South America and the East. There we have a better chance of competing with the world.Germany\u2019s AdvantageWhether we like it or not, the natural exploiter of Russian trade is Germany. They have always done the largest trade in Russia, because geographically they are most favourably situated, and they study the Russian language. They understand Russian methods of business.And, in my view - and I expressed this last year - the best thing for world trade, of which we should get our share, would be the development of Russian trade, as and when it becomes possible, by Ger­many - that she should turn into that market, which some day, but not yet, would be a great market - and return to that country that surplus of exports which has to provide for the payment of reparations, and, incidentally, some of our interest to America. That she should do, rather than that the bulk of that surplus should be turned either into this country or our own special markets which I have described.InternationalismNo, there is something mysterious in the present - and I hope temporary - affinity between the Labour Party and Russia. I think it has come through so many of them following that unhappy Will-o\u2019-the­-Wisp called Internationalism. If you judge a tree by the fruits, the only fruits of Internationalism I have been able to perceive are fruits of hatred, and those fruits are poisonous. But I recognise that many men, especially among the working classes, in their attraction to what is called Internationalism are led by an ideal, however misleading it may be. And although in my view it can only lead the way to disaster, I think that the difficulty arises perhaps in this way.It is very difficult for foreign nations to understand one another, and those who know least of them, of their history, of their language, of their culture, perhaps least realise those difficulties. (Hear, hear.) There can be in reality no common measure of progress between races and countries which are in different periods of evolution in history and in economic history. There can be little really in common to enable us to understand each other without study and imagination between a people like ourselves, who have lived through the Renaissance, the Reformation, the scientific studies of the last century and a half, and nations like those in the East of Europe who, owing to their his­torical circumstances, have experienced none of these things. (Cheers.)No. Isn\u2019t it true that if everybody in the street tried to sweep everybody else\u2019s doorstep it would be the dirtiest street is Newcastle. (Laughter.) Surely the wise thing is to make your own front step so radiantly beautiful that everybody else will desire to emulate it. (Cheers.) And so it is that I believe that in talking too much of internationalism you are beginning at the wrong end to achieve what we desire to achieve. (Hear, hear.)Just as the man who is a good father, a good husband, a good son, makes the best citizen, so the man who is the best Englishman makes the best citizen of the world. (Loud cheers.)There can be no loftier ambition than to spend your life in service for your own people whom you know, in the knowledge that in that way better than in any other will you be rendering not only service to them, but to the whole world. (Hear, hear.)The Struggle AheadWe are meeting tonight at a very critical time. We may find ourselves once more before long taking part in an appeal to the country. (A Voice: \u2018I hope so.\u2019)When that appeal comes I think our course is clear. We can never compete - and I shall not attempt to compete - with anyone, whoever he may be, in the making of promises - (cheers) - I want people to believe, as I think they are beginning to believe - when the Conserva­tive Party says it will try and do some­thing it will try and do it. (Cheers.)But I believe that when that appeal comes there will be a very great rally of the sober common sense of the country to try and secure a stable Government of this country, to give it a majority which will enable it to function, and which will prevent these frequent appeals being made to the country which only arouse its passions and disturb the course of its business.Outside SupportWe have a programme to which not only is our own Party devoted, but to support which we may expect many of those will come who cannot call them­selves by our name. We were all rejoiced to see the help we had the other day in Edinburgh from Mr. Churchill. (Cheers.) In one of those brilliant speeches which he alone can make, showing that on all the essential issues of the day he is whole­heartedly with us. We welcome his co-operation and we welcome the co-opera­tion of those who may find themselves able when the time comes to render similar help.Now with regard to you whom I see before me tonight. There is no need to ask for your help. You have been waiting to help, and I know that whenever the time comes - whether in the immediate future or a little longer than we expect your answer will be the same.You will go to the essential work which will require to be done with faith, conviction and energy that will carry all before it, and will put once more into power in this country a sober, steady, honest Government - (cheers) - which will be strengthened in its grave undertaking by the knowledge that it rests secure on the will of the great majority of the people of this country. (Cheers.)

aVMy lords, ladies and gentlemen. I re­joice to meet this great and represen­tative gathering of colleagues of the greatest political Party in this country (loud cheers), to render some account of the stewardship of my colleagues and myself since you returned us to power nearly twelve months ago. We have, it is true, been in office a short time; but I think I can convince you that the months that have passed have been months of work, not unfruitful. I make no exaggerated claim for the Government.A Great TraditionWe have never been a Party to make promises. If we cannot base ourselves on truth, advance our cause by its own justice, and persuade the public to reason, we no longer own the great Conservative tradition (applause). There are those in these days who regard the work of the Government as a melodrama or a film production (laughter), but you cannot run the country on capital letters and head­lines (hear, hear, and loud applause). One thing I will admit. We are not experts in the art of advertisement. We are handicapped by old-fashioned modesty. We do good but we blush to proclaim it. We work better than we talk (laughter and applause). We are not even first-class window dressers; but we do deliver the goods (applause).Others Talk: We DoMany people have talked about pensions for widows. We are giving them (hear, hear). One of the most prominent features in our election campaign was the undertaking to give those pensions, and we redeemed our pledge in our first session: pensions for widows, allowances for children, pensions to orphans, and to the aged at 65, merging them from the restric­tions under the existing scheme. In a few months from today more than half a million widows and children will benefit, not from our talk but from the Act on the Statute Book (applause). That one measure of the Unionist Party will drive out more anxiety from the homes of the poor and introduce more security than all the promises and schemes of the other parties in the country.Food PricesOne of the first administrative acts in accordance with our promise was to set up a Royal Commission on food prices, which resulted, as you know, in the establishment, under the President of the Board of Trade, of a permanent Food Council whose duty it was to watch our prices and sup­plies of foodstuffs, particularly in the interest of the consumers. A few days ago a Report was issued on bread prices. I am hoping from the publicity given to this, that it has resulted already, in many cities, in a reduction in the price of bread. I am confident that when the full force of public opinion, based upon the facts estab­lished by that Council, is brought to bear upon the question, the effect will be seen in further reduction (hear, hear).A Hint to Consumers The Food Council is continuing its inquiries into the prices of other articles of food, and I am entitled to claim that the policy we foreshadowed at the General Election is working out with satisfaction. Nobody today seriously suggests that the Government should have control of the prices. It is neither desirable nor practicable; but I do urge that the public should endeavour to restrict, so far as pos­sible, their purchases to those shops whose prices conform to the reasonable standard laid down by the Food Council (hear, hear). We have ful­filled our promises, and it is for the public to back us up (hear, hear).The Housing ProblemOne of the worst legacies of the war was the shortage of houses. We are delivering the houses (hear, hear). Successive Governments have wrestled with this problem, but when the his­tory of the last three or four years comes to be written, the name of one man will stand out above all others as a housing reformer - the name of Neville Chamberlain (loud applause). The Minister of Health has been true to the best Unionist traditions. He has not only sought to meet the urgent and exceptional needs by State help, but he had never lost sight of the importance of encouraging private build­ing and private ownership.A Great RecordSince the war, under State schemes, 322,000 houses have been built, but dur­ing the last two and a half years 160,000 have been built without State assistance. Not only that, but prior to 1923 £800,000 had been advanced to owner-occupiers under the Small Dwellings Acquisition Act, and since that date the amount sanctioned under that Act has amounted, by subsequent legislation, to over £9,000,000. And that is not all. Two years ago we empowered local authorities to ad­vance money to builders of new houses, whether for their own occupa­tion or otherwise, and already loans to over £6,000,000 have been sanctioned for this purpose. But, great as the relief which these figures suggest, the shortage continues.Meeting the DemandsAll the evidence points to a large, un­satisfied demand. I dealt with this matter at Glasgow, last week. It does seem a paradox that with thousands clamouring for houses and tens of thousands clamouring for work, we should be confronted with a shortage of bricklayers and plasterers. That was the position described to me in Scotland, and it is for that reason that the Ministry of Health have authorised the erection of houses to be built by methods other than the traditional bricks and mortar for ad­ministrative purposes and to meet what, I hope and believe, will be a temporary need. We want the public to see and judge for themselves the merits of houses built by those methods and in Scotland, where the need is greatest and progress slowest, I announced our readiness to assist in the provision of thousands of steel houses of different types.\u2018Our Greatest Interest\u2019We have been working, and we are making satisfactorily for the pacifica­tion of Europe. This is our greatest interest. Nothing could more demon­strate what our pacific foreign policy has been than that impressive record that Lord Grey has just published, and which I hope will be read throughout the world - the policy of straight deal­ing between nations. It attempts to eliminate distrust and suspicion. That has always been our policy. It is our policy today, and it has been pursued with success. You will remember that in my first administration we brought the Dawes Committee into being. Mr. McDonald continued with energy and success that work.Pushing on with SettlementThe Chancellor of the Exchequer has taken advantage of the arrangement come to under that scheme to push on with the settlement of the French debt; and the clearing away of the Reparations problem has enabled an attempt to be made to deal with the question of security, which had been too long awaiting solution and which has been and is still an effective bar until it is settled to any further hope of success in the matter of disarmament.Making the World SafeWe all have our view as to which way the world may be made safe for peace. There is the older method of alliance. You have, on the other hand and as an extreme alternative, some schemes aiming at a universal application of worldwide security, like the Protocol, and you have various devices which fall between them. A new conception was introduced by the German memor­andum of last February, and the Government lost no time in seizing upon it. It was the idea of agreement. It was an idea of grouping Powers in a particular area not to interfere with others in another group but to keep peace among themselves by a system of mutual protection.Simple and Straightforward­The idea is simple and straightforward. The difficulty has been to keep it so and to avoid the introduction of complicated factors. We have kept steadily to the main purpose. We make the proposed treaty of mutual guarantee subject, as a whole, to the one condition that Germany must join the League of Nations (hear, hear). As regards the treaty itself, the principles upon which we are working are these. The treaty must be bilateral and mutual, purely defensive in character, and framed in the spirit of the League Covenant and worked in close harmony with the League and under its guidance. Any new obligation undertaken by his Majesty\u2019s Government must be specified and limited to the existing territorial arrangements in that area which is vital to British security; that is, the frontier between Germany and her Western neighbours.Hope of Material BenefitWe trust the result will be a system which, with the minimum of fresh commitments, will materially benefit this country by diminishing the prospect of war and helping in the restora­tion of Europe. The negotiations had been prolonged - that is not wholly a disadvantage, because it has given time for thorough ventilation of the subject in all the countries concerned. The first meeting between the Powers concerned is now being held, and there is not a statesman among those gathered at Locarno who is not determined, as far as he can, to bring the matter to a successful issue.Devotion to a Great CauseI should like to pay here a tribute to the incessant work which Mr. Austen Chamberlain has devoted (applause) to this great cause, and to express - what you all know - the confidence that I and all my colleagues have in him, that our interests will be safe in his hands at Locarno, and that if success can he achieved it will be achieved by him (applause). I used, in one speech I made earlier in the year, the figure of speech that this Pact would be the filling in of one end of a great morass - that quaking bog of Europe. And so it will; and when we have filled that end in and made it sound and secure, I have every hope that the same principles that have guided us to the point we have reached now in the West may be applied to the permanent pacification of Eastern Europe as it is being applied in the West (applause).In the Far EastAs you all know, in the Far East, in China, there have been troubles which have gravely affected our trade and have disturbed - I hope only temporarily - the close and, in the main, happy relations which have subsisted so long between our people and the people of China. I think the clouds are lifting. A conference to revise the Chinese Customs tariff is about to be made, and I trust that there the foundations will be laid for a new era of fraternal co-operation between China and the outside world, and that the tariff conference will be the first step in a comprehensive revision of the treaties which at present regulate the position of foreigners in China.MosulNow I wish to speak to you for a few minutes on the subject about which there has been a great deal of mis­apprehension - the subject of Mosul. I shall confine my remarks to explaining the position as it stands today, and shall purposely refrain from entering into any speculative consideration of the future, having regard to the fact that at this moment we are waiting for the decision of the Arbitration by the League of Nations. I have seen it stated in lurid language (laughter) that on this question the Government is pursuing the provocative policy calculated to bring about war with Turkey; that it is claiming, on behalf of Iraq, a territory to which it has no right; and that it is undertaking costly and dangerous commitments for which there is no necessity and no authority.A True PerspectiveLet us try to obtain a true perspective. We have been concerned not with an issue of war or one calculated to lead to war, but with the implementing of a treaty of peace. In the Treaty of Lausanne, Turkey and ourselves agreed that if the disputed question of the frontier between Turkey and Iraq could not be settled by direct negotia­tions within nine months it should be referred to the Council of the League of Nations. It was so referred a year ago, by both parties agree­ing in advance to accept the declaration of the Council whatever it might be. The Council sent out a special Commission to investi­gate and report. It has been en­gaged in considering that Report, and the case which both sides have laid before it on behalf of the British Government and Iraq, and that case has been stated with cogency and, I might also add, with studied moderation by Mr. Amery (applause).The Commission\u2019s ReportIs it the suggestion that it is an act of provocation to state a case, as we are entitled to state it under the Treaty, or to base that case, as we have done throughout, upon the Report of the League of Nations\u2019 own Commission? That Commission reported that from the point of view of the interests of the population concerned, and from the point of view of their wishes, it was best that the whole of the territories should remain united as Iraq - for let me make it quite clear that, ex­cept for a portion of territory with which we are not concerned, there was no question of claiming territory from the Turks that is not in our control today. The city and defences of Mosul were liberated from Turkish rule by our troops (hear, hear), but they constitute an integral part of Iraq, and they enjoy the same administration. They have participated, through their representatives, in the establishment of the constitution of that country in the Treaty of Alliance with Great Britain, and support the National Government drawn from every part of the country.Legal Right of IraqThe legal right of Iraq and the province of Mosul is exactly as good as is the legal right of any other part of British territory (applause). Our relations with Iraq are governed not by an ordinary mandate but by a Treaty of Alliance, which aims at establishing in Iraq a national life, in accordance with our general principle of self-government, wherever such self-government can work effectively, and in order to limit our own financial and military commitments and responsibilities. The present Treaty was originally to have been signed for a period of 20 years, but the period was reduced to four years from the ratifi­cation of the peace with Turkey. This was partly on our side, because we wished to make it clear to the new Government of Iraq that they can rely indefinitely upon British financial and military support so long as Iraq keeps its house in order and is in a position to stand on its own feet within a reasonable space of time.The Contemplated ReplacementThe preamble to the present Treaty not only contemplated this replacement by a fresh agreement, but it stipulated a reversal of the negotiations, for that object was continually before the authors of the Treaty. When the Secre­tary of State for the Colonies visited Iraq, in the spring, he reported that the policy under which we were working had been a success from the point of view of the relations between the Iraq Government and its British ad­visers, and they were all for economy. The expenditure of that country, which a few years ago amounted to £20,000,000, has come down to £4,000,000; a substantial portion of which is ap­propriated to the cost of the Army and the Air Service employed there, which, of course, would have to be paid for in whatever part of the world it was quar­tered. He said there was every reason to give support to a settlement of the frontier question.AnticipationsHe anticipated such a reduction in the near future as would lead, in a few years, to a position in which Iraq can make itself not only responsible for its administration, but for the main­tenance of its security and the paying of its own way. But he added that in the opinion of all those whom he had met, what Britain and Iraq alike wanted, for the future development of the country, was an assurance that the Government of this country would carry out the undertaking implied in the protocol of the present Treaty, and replace it by a further treaty given to the Iraq Government to continue all the help they had received from the British advisers during the past years The same point of view obviously im­pressed itself upon the Commissioners sent out by the League of Nations.A Direct QuestionThe Report of the Commission, in fact, involved the direct question as to whether the British Government were prepared to carry out the preamble of the existing Treaty and replace it by a new one. There can only be one pos­sible answer to that, namely, that we do intend to replace the preamble and to continue to co-operate with the Government of Iraq to ensure the stability and progress of the country until such time as our help is no longer necessary, because to have given any other answer would have been a breach of principle towards those whose cause we were fighting, and would have been inconsistent with the policy which has been the policy in Iraq by all Governments since the mandate was conceded to us (hear, hear).Obligations of HonourAnd last, but not least, it would have been an act of folly, from the point of view of those who urge economy. The sacrifice of the richest part of the territory of Iraq, and the substitution of an indefensible for a defensible frontier, would have undone all the good work of recent years, and left us either with the alternative of com­plete chaos in that part of Asia, with consequences resulting therefrom which no one could foresee, and a reversal of the process of the reduction of expenditure in order to make up for the lessened resources, the increased burdens and the impaired stability of Iraq. In this matter we are not deal­ing alone with our own practical interests but with the obligations of honour (loud applause). We are under obligations to Iraq which we have brought into being.The Christian PopulationWe are under obligations less formal, but no less real, towards the Christian population in North Iraq, who have achieved, under the present constitu­tion, a condition of freedom and pros­perity to which they have been strangers for centuries. Their case was eloquently urged by the Arch­bishop of Canterbury in the letter which he sent to me a few days ago. Is it conceivable we should abandon these people without even endeavour­ing to urge their case as fully and strongly as we are entitled to do before the League of Nations? The action of the Secretary of State, throughout this business, has the Government\u2019s full approval (hear, hear). And that is the strongest possible proof of the willingness of his Majesty\u2019s Government to submit to arbitration questions of the highest importance to them, and to abide by the arbitrators\u2019 sentence (hear, hear). And now I ask you for patience to await the result of that arbitration, and believe with me that we have no reason to think that Turkey will not, equally with ourselves, fulfil her obligation of honour (hear, hear, and applause).House of LordsThere is one matter, in which the Party are obliged to take action, which is at present engaging the serious and exhaustive consideration of a Cabinet Committee. I refer to the reform of the House of Lords (applause). Dur­ing the last ten years there have been many schemes and many suggestions. The difficulty has been, and is, to pro­duce a scheme which will satisfy, let me say, many sections of opinion. I will say no more just now than that we are carefully comparing the merits of all the schemes which have hitherto been produced, and that we hope, before the close of the present Parliament, to introduce a scheme and give effect to it (applause).Agricultural ProposalsIn regard to the agricultural proposals of the Government, I hope that we shall be in a position, before long, to lay them before the House of Com­mons. I would merely say, at this meeting here, that we are as alive to the urgency of these problems as any other Party in the State (hear, hear). But we are practical men (hear, hear), and we recognise the economic difficulties which are real and consider­able whenever you wish to make any serious effort; and we do realise - per­haps more than other parties in the State - that you cannot work in agri­culture, any more than in any other branch of human activity, a miracle by Government assistance or by Government compulsion (applause).EconomyNow I think, at a meeting of our Party, it will be well to devote a few minutes to the subject of economy (hear, hear, and applause). And in speaking of economy, on that subject more than any other it is necessary to preserve your perspective. There is no subject that lends itself more easily to the pen of the writer of fiction (laughter). Let us consider, in the first place, what the problem is. I will weary you with as few figures as possible. I must give you some. I don\u2019t propose to make any comparison be­tween the expenditure today and the expenditure in the first year after the war. That was an abnormal year, and the accounts were complicated by various expenses connected with demobilisation.A Five-Years\u2019 RecordBut I think it is essential to re­member, before we begin to speak of economy, that in the last five years this country, through the efforts of the different Governments that have been in power during that time, has re­duced the national expenditure, and consequently taxation, by no less than one-third. Now, that is a stupendous accomplishment (applause), and the nation which, in spite of all the diffi­culties which have confronted it, has accomplished that, has done something of which it may well be proud. In 1920-21 the tax revenue was £1,031,000,000, or £22 per head of the population. This year the tax revenue is £686,000,000, or £15 4s. (applause).A Further ReminderAnd I may remind you that if you took at the taxes themselves which have been reduced, you will find that the income tax has been lowered from 6s. to 4s.; the excess profits duty, corporation profits tax, and the inhabited house duty have all disappeared; the tea duty has been reduced from 1s. to 4d.; the sugar duty from 2¾ d. to 1½ d.; the beer duty has been lowered by one penny a pint (laughter); and substantial reductions have been made in the postal and telephone charges. But it is obvious that the very success of these efforts does not make it easier to continue the process of ameliora­tion.Effective FiguresI should like very much to trace some of the other figures with you, but I am only going to give you one more. I want you to analyse our national ex­penditure with me. Of the total budget of about £800,000,000, £305,000,000 re­presents contractual payments to the shareholders of Government securities, and £50,000,000 represents the statutory sinking fund. A large proportion of that last sum is attached definitely, under contract, to specific issues or Government stock. Of the remaining £445,000.000 of expenditure, no less than £217,000,000 is either statutory or covered by contractual applications and definite pledges of public pay­ment; and thus, in the region of con­tractual and statutory expenditure, we get 72 per cent of the whole of our ex­penditure.A Vital NecessityThere still remains £828,000,000. Of this, £121,000,000 is accounted for by the needs of national defence, and though I am hopeful of effecting economies in detail in this block of expenditure, yet I regard it as vital that we should re­tain our defences (applause) at the level necessary for national and Im­perial defence. A further 52½ millions represents the cost of the Post Office service, which more than pays for itself; £12,000,000 is spent on the Revenue Department, and that this figure is not excessive I deduce from the fact that we collect today tax revenue four times that of 1914 at less than double the cost. We have, in the course of this analysis, which I beg you to study for yourself, accounted for 95 per cent of our national expenditure.The Conclusion to be DrawnAnd what conclusion do we draw from that? That although we have every in­tention of effecting economies in de­tail in the region of expenditure that is not covered by contract, by statute, by the minimum requirements of our national defence and the efficiency of the revenue collection, it is clear that really big economies can only be achieved if we plunge into that field of statutory and contractual expenditure. And let it be clearly understood that spectacular economies of that kind can only be achieved by real sacrifices which would have to be spread widely over all classes of the community (hear, hear). But let me repeat that I do not at all mean that we are not rigorously pursuing the smaller and less spectacular economies which are open to us.Substantial Reductions in StoreThe Chancellor of the Exchequer is de­termined to make substantial reduc­tions in the estimates for next year (applause). The Cabinet Committee, which has been set up, and over which I propose to preside myself, will labour incessantly for that end in the months which are left before the presentation of next year\u2019s estimates. When our labours in this field are ended we shall be in a position to consider if any and, if so what economies are required, and then will be the time to weigh against each other sacrifices on the one hand and the benefits on the other which are involved. But let me remind you that any Government which practices economy will be to that extent unpopu­lar, and the moment you lay your finger on a vested interest of expendi­ture half the country will rise up and call for your blood (applause).Our Own CountryAnd now I want to talk to you for the short time that remains on what is really the most important subject we have to consider, and that is the condition of our own country (applause). And it is a very difficult thing to talk about in a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes; but I do think it is of the first importance that our Party should have here, more than in any other subject we have been discussing, a true perspective. We have to con­sider, in discussing the condition of the country, unemployment. Now bear this in mind: nearly ninety per cent of the workers of this country today are employed, but two consequences flow from that small percentage of the whole which is unemployed today. I will touch rather on the human aspect last.The Economic AspectLet me say first one word on the economic aspect. The result of this unemployment is that we are faced, today, with a growing excess of imports which, if continued, will be a real danger to the economic stability of the country, which relies on foreign counties and on overseas for the bulk of its food (hear, hear). That renders it all the more important that, as we were denied the remedy for which we asked two years ago (applause), our people should make a point - every member of the Party - of buying British goods (prolonged applause). The mere fact of the millions who belong to our Party insisting, in business and in their private purchases, in ordering British goods would he felt from one end of the country to the other (hear, hear), and if they would second that by ordering whenever they cannot get British goods, Empire goods (applause), the reflex action would then go round the world. I need say no more to an audience like this to urge them to do what is the obvious duty of every patriotic Briton today (applause).The Gravest FeatureBut what is the gravest feature of this unemployment? The grave unemployment today is very largely localised in certain definite industries of importance, and in addition to being localised, in most of the cases where it exists it has gone on now, not week after week or month after month, but year after year, and it has killed all hope in thousands of breasts. That is the damage it has done. This problem of unemployment has been with me night and day for three years past, as it must be with every man who thinks of the future of his country, who can visualise what it means to those who directly suffer from it (hear, hear).When Men Lose HopeWhen men lose hope they are ready to grasp at anything, and they become receptive to the wildest teaching. There are those among them who, in their hopelessness, feel then that the destruction of the existing system would be better than that it should continue. That is the great evil wrought by unemployment, and to men suffering come those who would use them for their own ends (hear, hear, and applause). Communism, a foreign production, is begotten of ignorance out of misery (applause), and there must always be danger until the worker has learned - as he will learn - to distinguish those who are striving to better his lot and those who are exploiting his misery for their own political ends (applause).Extremist PropagandaThere has never been more favourable ground for the dissemination of ex­tremist propaganda than exists today in certain districts of the country, and I knew beforehand that my own efforts towards peace and co-operation would cause the efforts of the extremists to he redoubled (hear, hear). I knew that there would be a response to what I have preached in this country in the hearts of thousands of the workers of this country (applause), and I knew that to try and check that re­sponse there would be a concentration on our country by all the alien Com­munists of the world. They have failed in the United States of America; they have failed in Germany; they are beginning - I think I see signs that they are beginning - to concentrate in France. They will fail in France, and they will fail here (applause).The Cause of AnxietyIt is this extremist movement that is causing so much anxiety today to the Parliamentary Labour Party, because they know that so long as their Party is associated in the public mind with the extremists they will never succeed in obtaining a Parliamentary majority in this country (applause). Hence the importance of our Party (hear, hear). We have always stood, as we stand today, for the supreme authority of Parliament as representing the will of the majority; for orderly progress; for democratic freedom, and for the utmost liberty consistent with the safety of the State. Today it is we who hold aloft the torch of demo­cracy, while the Labour Party is engaged in snuffing the wick of the lamp that is burning too dimly.The Gospel of Brute Force But we are challenged, as any Govern­ment today would be challenged, by a small minority, very vociferous, who have made no secret of their desire to undermine the constitution by revolutionary threats, by industrial war, by the suppression of free speech, and by intimidation. That is the gospel of brute force, and those who preach it are the enemies of democracy, and the real reactionaries (applause). The one thing they dread is prosperity (hear, hear). But no minority, how­ever they are organised, can he allowed to tyrannise over a majority (applause). The country, a little less than a year ago, gave its verdict with no uncertain voice, and until the country reverses that verdict in the usual constitutional manner we stay where we are (loud applause).Freedom of SpeechIn this country we claim, with pride, that there is a greater latitude of free expression than obtains in any other country in the world (applause). Our great tradition of freedom of speech was dearly won by our forefathers, and it is one of the most highly prized of the privileges and liberties of the Constitution. But every kind of free­dom is liable to abuse - and freedom of speech is abused if advantage is taken of that freedom to exceed the defined limits of legitimate public utterances (hear, hear). The law has never re­cognised the right to publish anything which has a seditious intention (hear, hear).The Government\u2019s DeterminationBy seditions the law means intention to bring into hatred or contempt, or to excite disaffection against the King and the Constitution as by law estab­lished, or to incite people to attempt, by violence or unlawful means, the constitution of the constituted order of things. The Government will employ all the powers which the law gives them to deal with attempts to seduce the loyalty of the troops (applause), or to persuade the troops to break their oath and to neglect their duty (applause). The Government will use to the full the powers the law gives them to deal with speech or action which they deem, after due considera­tion, to be of a seditious nature (applause). I endorse emphatically the words spoken by the Attorney General, and I can assure this audience and the country that the Government is fully alive to the danger which may result from the preaching of such doctrines as I have indicated, and you may rely on them to do all in their power to protect the best interests of the country (applause).A Kindred SubjectI would like to say just one word with regard to a kindred subject, because I think it is desirable to state clearly the position of the Government in rela­tion to industrial disputes (hear, hear). In the first place I hold it to be the duty of the Government to do all in its power to promote conditions for indus­trial peace, and the policy of the Conservative Party has been, and will be, directed to that end. We must en­sure that there exists conciliatory machinery through which the parties in large industries can settle their own affairs. This means that workers, employers, and trades unions should be encouraged to set up and use promptly and effectively, appro­priate machinery of their own for settling their disputes, and that the Government should assist the working of the machinery by insisting upon its full use before intervention, and by seeing that where the public interest is involved the use of machinery or courts of inquiry should be considered so that means could be taken, up to the 59th minute of the eleventh hour, in their efforts to secure industrial peace.Educating the Public In the process public opinion would be educated as to the merits of the dispute. If the public is once educated no Government need fear the result; but if there is failure to effect a settlement and a stoppage of essen­tial services occur, the Government ought to face the fact that it must maintain law and order (applause). This is its first duty. Its other duty - and it is one which other parties have attempted to upset - is to ensure the maintenance of the public services (hear, hear). Whatever may be the political complexion of the Govern­ment of the day, it will be called upon to ensure that life and wealth are not endangered. It must he remembered that there is a latent intention in every community to protect itself against aggression, whether that aggression comes from outside in the form of war, or from inside in the form of the attempted deprivation of food or other essentials (hear, hear). It is the duty of Government, first and foremost, to strive for industrial peace. It is equally the duty of the Government to respond to the demand of the community for protection if and when, in the opinion of the com­munity, circumstances have arisen which make such protection necessary (applause).\u2018Our Own Party\u2019 Now I wish, in closing, to say a few words about our own Party. There are at the present moment a good many disgruntled people knocking about the country (laughter). I want to tell them that there is no originality in that (laughter). They have got them in the Liberal Party. You can see that by the reception of the land policy (laughter), which has fallen as flat as a cold linseed poultice (laughter and applause). They have them in the Labour Party, where I think a very interesting struggle is in course of development. And to those in our Party who may think that other parties manage better, let me com­mend a few words of a Labour intel­lectual on the programme of his own Party: \u2018There are no guiding lines in it, no inspiring ideas,\u2019 writes the editor of the \u2018New Leader.\u2019 \u2018We are borne along from one proposal to another, assenting to most of them but never getting a glimpse of the real purpose in view. And so one goes on from the new branch of Imperialism, from the old Fabian policy for unemployment and the old Radical policy of land taxation until the programme fades away in pro­posals to Socialise the supply of artificial teeth\u2019 (laughter).\u2018Don\u2019t be Downhearted!\u2019After that, don\u2019t be downhearted whatever is said to you (laughter). I don\u2019t mind criticism myself, although nearly all the criticism I get is just like that of the weary mother who says to the nurse \u2018Just go upstairs and see what Tommy\u2019s doing and tell him not to\u2019 (laughter). Criticism from our own Party I welcome when it is criti­cism directed to the improvement of the Party (hear, hear), and of our prospects. I don\u2019t much care for criticism that comes from people with hot heads and cold feet (laughter). They had better get a cold compress to the head and a hot water bottle to the feet. Remember that whenever a Party does anything, it always evokes criticism, and we have done a great deal this year - some people think too much. After all this provokes criticism.The Coal SubsidyAnd we have been criticised, too, by a great many people, as I knew we should be, for our attitude over the coal crisis. Now I dislike a subsidy as much as anybody in this room, but if I may sum up in two or three words what made the Government take the line they did, it was not cowardice, it was not want of preparation, it was because they knew that an industrial struggle on a large scale, leaving out every other issue, would cause the country what the country today could but ill afford, and would set back the trade of the country, bad as it is in many places, by months, and perhaps years. And they took the risk of doing an unpopular thing for which many wrong motives would be assigned, in the hope and in the belief that in time the country would learn, would think, would understand, that wiser counsels might prevail, and that, contrary to every expectation this year, next year we might yet be able to ride through what looks as if it might be a stormy sea.Other CriticismsOther criticisms I have had. I have been told this country wants a Mussolini (laughter). I have a great respect for the chief Minister of a great country like Italy (hear, hear, and applause), but I know the tem­perament of my own people. The English people will never tolerate a dictator (applause). The English people will never tolerate being Prussianised, nor, may I add, being Russianised (applause). All the kind of criticisms that go on in the corners of clubs - (laughter) there is not a single leader we have had in my time of whom I have not heard the same things said, that I know have been said about me. I remember when people got together and said with an air of mystery, \u2018Balfour is played out\u2019; \u2018Bonar is not the man he was.\u2019They Always ExistI have heard them all, and they always exist. When the Party wants to change its leader I will step down, but not till then (loud and long continued applause). And remember this, that whether this country is going to get through the diffi­cult years that lie immediately ahead of us depends more than anything else on the strength, the stability, and the loyalty of one to another and each to all (applause).

aV\u2018It seems but a short time since we met at Brighton - and how much has happened since then - and this meeting comes most opportunely to enable me to meet the workers of our party gathered together in this beautiful town from all corners of the kingdom to give an account to you of our stewardship in the Govern­ment, to hear from you at first hand the result of your deliberations, embodying as they do the new ideas, the new ambitions, and the new aspirations of our great party.\u2019 What the Government had done during the last year formed a remarkable record, in the face of the unparalleled diffi­culties with which they had been faced. Dealing first with foreign policy, the Premier said the entry of Germany into the League of Nations, together with the ratification of the Locarno Treaty, had set the seal upon a great work, the first stages of which were actually in progress when they met last year. By that Treaty the principal nations of Europe, collectively and severally, guaranteed the inviolability of the frontiers between Germany and France, and Germany and Belgium, a con­summation which he regarded as a signal triumph for British diplomacy. He thought the Conference would share the pride of himself and his colleagues in the achieve­ments of the Foreign Secretary, and in the part which the representatives of this country had played in the promotion of peace in Europe.Falsified Predictions\u2018A year ago, you will remember,\u2019 he continued, \u2018we were vigorously attacked for our foreign policy towards Turkey. We were told we were leading the country into a disastrous war and the conduct of diplo­matic relations in the Near East was no longer safe in our hands. We knew the value to place upon such criticism. I tried a year ago to allay your fears, which I do not think were very great. (Laugh­ter.) We proceeded undisturbed in the policy we had laid down. What was the result? The Treaty of Angora was signed by the Turkish Government in June; rati­fications were exchanged in July. They will shortly be registered with the League of Nations. Our policy has been com­pletely successful. (Cheers.) We have succeeded in putting an end to the disturbed relations with Turkey that have existed ever since the conclusion of the war.\u2019In other spheres of foreign policy the administration of the Government had been no less successful. \u2018We have made satisfactory arrangements with France and Italy about their debts on terms which we believe, in all the circumstances, to be just, and the first payments have already been made.\u2019 (Cheers.)The only anxiety, perhaps, at the moment lay in the Far East, in China, where our interests had been wantonly damaged by some of the insurgent ele­ments in that disturbed country. \u2018But in consequence of the firm attitude adopted by the Government I trust our difficulties are in a fair way to solution - (cheers) - though I think it necessary to add that although we shall in no whit depart from our policy of conciliation and patience with China, we shall not hesitate to take whatever steps may be necessary to pro­tect the lives and property of our fellow countrymen.\u2019 (Cheers.)Imperial ConferenceHeavy Programme to be FacedTurning to Imperial affairs, the Pre­mier said: The most important event is the forthcoming Imperial Conference, which will begin on the 19th of the present month. It is a matter of profound satis­faction that the Prime Ministers of all the Dominions should have found it possible to attend in London, and I should like to add that the action whereby all parties in Canada, immediately after the General Election, have united to facilitate the presence of Mr. Mackenzie King is, to my mind, a remarkable illustration of that spirit by which all over the Empire endeavour is now made to place the interests of the Empire above the interests of local party politics.Empire FilmsThe work of the Conference will, as in past years, be heavy. It will include a general review of foreign policy, of de­fence, and of the questions to which these subjects give rise. Consideration will be given to the development and improvement of the system of communication and consultation between the Governments of the Empire on matters of importance and com­mon concern. I will not detail to you the other subjects which will come under review, but, of course, attention will have to be paid to the pressing question of over­seas settlement and inter-Imperial trade­ - (cheers) - including the work of the Econo­mic Conference of the Empire, Marketing Board, communications, which will include the work of the Imperial Shipping Commit­tee, and the question of Imperial air ser­vices. Then there come questions of research and a very important question, the exhibition in the Empire of Empire films. (Cheers.)We for our part shall enter the Confer­ence with one single object in view - to pro­mote to the utmost of our power wise development on the political side, consis­tent progress on the economic side and the relation between these many communi­ties which together make up the British Empire.Agricultural PolicySchemes Delayed By Labour DisputesComing to agriculture, which he termed a difficult subject, Mr. Baldwin said he thought it was well to spend a few minutes in considering the solid achievements, not spectacular, of the Government, and con­tinued: We made it clear at the beginning of this year that we are not prepared to lend ourselves to any kind of fantastic experiments. The industry has suffered enough from Government experiments during the last few years, and we have to remember that experiments, which involve large public expenditure, must necessarily be postponed, as I shall have occasion to show later, by the events which have taken place during this year.The system of subsidies, which was tried on so large a scale by the Coalition Government, failed, and I think the farmers have not forgotten their experience.We are definitely opposed as a Government to any form of compulsory control of cultivation by committees or by officials.It is contrary to the instincts and the traditions of our people, who naturally, and I venture to think rightly, prefer to manage their own business in their own way. (Hear, hear.) In the words of the White Paper, which we published early in the year, the right course in the best interests of the industry and of the nation is to proceed on the line of education and encouragement, rather than of coercion, to endeavour to create that confidence which is essential for progress, to stimu­late private enterprise, to assist those engaged in the industry to organise them­selves on an economic basis, and to protect them from the dislocation or the reversal of policy and from rash proposals which would impair progress and breed inse­curity.Practical AchievementsI know that is not the kind of policy which will commend itself to the Liberal party or the Labour party, but I would like to give you, by way of illustration, some of the practical things that we have done and are doing to help that indus­try. It is our policy to undertake reforms, some of them matters of detail, for which there is a genuine demand. They are very often matters of a technical char­acter, so that they may not be appreciated by the general public at their proper value, but that is of little consequence if we can give the agricultural community what they want. I would like just to mention, what many of you know, how much the Government has been helped by the Agricultural Committee of the party in the House of Commons, under the able chairmanship of my old friend, Sir George Courthope.We have made provision in the estimates for near three-quarters of a million in aid of agricultural education and research, and it is a great satisfaction to know that every year the advantages of scientific fanning are being better known and appre­ciated all over the country. A serious attempt has been made to improve the condition and the character of a great deal of water-logged and ill-drained land, which remains in this country, and a sum of £1,000,000, to be spent over five years, is being provided for grants in aid to ap­proved schemes carried out by statutory drainage authorities, and an Act has been passed to increase the powers of the County Councils for dealing with small drainage problems.Rating ReliefThe Rating and Valuation Act, passed at the close of last year, not only gave permanent relief to agricultural land to the extent of three-quarters of its rateable value, but for the first time in England and Wales provides that the farm build­ings, which are in effect part of the ordi­nary work and equipment of the farmer, shall be assessed on the same basis, a con­cession which, I believe, is much appre­ciated, and will afford material help. Some relief in rates has been given in rural dis­tricts by grants in aid. For this purpose £1,400,000 has been given this year from the Road Fund, which, as you know, de­rives its funds in turn from the proceeds of motor taxation.The policy of the Government in developing the growth of the new rural in­dustry, that of sugar beet, is meeting with great success in various parts of the country. Nine factories were working last winter, and four more are expected to start this autumn, and the acreage under culti­vation is already about 125,000 acres.I should like to mention two or three comparatively small Acts, just to show you the extent of the ground which has been covered in a year, both busy in the ordinary work of Parliament, and perhaps more full of anxiety and difficult problems for solution than any year in recent times. The Seeds Amendment Act will secure for the farmer that the potatoes he buys for seed purposes are true to description and variety. The Markets and Fairs Weigh­ing of Cattle Act secures for the farmer fair play in the sale of cattle, by providing that fat cattle must be weighed in market before sale. The Diseases of Animals Act enables the Government to pay compensa­tion for the slaughter of cattle suffering from the worst form of tuberculosis, and over 18,000 affected cattle have been elimi­nated from our herds within the last twelve months.Bills before ParliamentThe Horticultural Produce Sales and Provisions Bill will provide that commis­sion salesmen shall render proper accounts of their transactions, showing the prices they received for goods entrusted to them for sale, a measure which, I believe, all farmers and growers of market produce will find of great value.The Fertilisers and Foodstuffs Bill will protect farmers against fraud in the periods of fertilisation, where, as you know, it is difficult to detect fraud without expert analysis.There are two other measures before Parliament which will be carried into law in this year, the Smallholders\u2019 and Allotments Bill, which sets up a new system of smallholdings on the basis of ownership by fair annual instalments over a period of years. This Bill is of great importance to labour, because for the first time in a measure of this kind, its terms are applic­able to copyholding. Upon the same prin­ciple the labourer will acquire freehold, upon payment in annual instalments.The other Bill is the Merchandise Marks Bill. It is intended that all imported goods and agricultural products shall be labelled with the country of origin, and for the first time the public will be in a position to know whether they are really buying British or foreign goods.The crux of the agricultural position, of course, is the question of prices, and, as the experience of other countries shows, the farmers\u2019 hope of better prices lies mainly in improved methods of marketing. Like other businessmen they must organise their selling scientifically and study the requirements of the markets. The investigations carried out by the Minister of Agriculture are pointing the way. It remains for the farmers them­selves to take action on the lines suggested.The Empire Markets Board so realises the importance of this that they have granted the sum of £40,000 for further in­quiries into the marketing of home-grown produce, and I hope from that sum good and practical results may ensue.Housing ProgressBeginning to Catch Up the ArrearsA closely allied subject, one that touches the people throughout the country, is the question of housing - the policy of the Government in regard to housing, under the able administration of Mr. Neville Chamberlain. (Cheers.) As this question has baffled every Government since the war, I think here we may take a little credit to ourselves for what has been done. Not only are sufficient houses being built to meet the normal growth of the population, but at last we are beginning to catch up the arrears.I will give you one little illustration, which may be familiar to you, to give you an idea of what is being done. Since the Armistice there have been more houses built throughout the country than the whole of the private dwellings in Leeds, Sheffield, Birmingham, and Manchester put together. (Cheers.) What is more satisfactory is that the progress under Mr. Chamberlain\u2019s Act has been achieved at comparatively low cost to the Exchequer. Under his Act each house costs £6 a year to the State for twenty years, whereas, under the Socialist Act of 1924, the cost to the Exchequer is £9 a year for forty years, and under Dr. Addison\u2019s scheme £41 a year, of which a substantial part will con­tinue for sixty years. (Laughter.) During the twelve months ended on March 31 last, nearly three times as many houses of all classes were completed as the annual average for the three years before the war, and the greater progress continues to increase.I think, therefore, we may say, not only that success has attended the Government\u2019s efforts, but that the promises we gave on this subject at the general election have been literally and faithfully fulfilled. (Cheers.)In addition to that, you may have noticed a modest Bill introduced just before the recess to meet special cases of housing in agricultural districts, the need of which has never been adequately met by the out­put of houses under the Housing Acts. In many districts there is a serious shortage of cottages at a rent within the reach of the labourer, and, owing to the high cost of building, owners of estates are unable to provide all the cottages required on their land. On the other hand, much can be done by alteration and improvement of existing houses so as to bring them up to modern standards. The purpose of the Bill is to assist holders of agricultural land to undertake this work themselves. The operation of the Bill is strictly limited to cottages for bona fide farm workers. (Cheers.)Help to LeaseholdersA matter that might be of interest to business firms and shopkeepers in large towns and which deserves serious ex­amination, is the question of leasehold reform. Complaints are frequently made by tenants. For example, it not infre­quently happens that substantial improve­ment of the property made at the expense of the tenant passes to the landlord at the end of the term without payment to the tenant of any compensation. Sometimes a considerable business grows up in particular premises; during a lease. A valuable goodwill is created which is liable to be destroyed on the expiry of the lease if a renewal cannot be obtained on reasonable terms.This subject is one which bristles with difficulties, because ill-advised legislation might easily do more harm than good. We must be certain that any legislation proposed will not bring into existence greater evils than those which prevail. There are causes of legitimate grievance, and we are at present engaged in examining where it is possible to amend the law to meet those cases in which there is genuine need for reform. (Cheers.)Although I have tried to take you over very briefly the whole field of our activities during the last year, I don\u2019t think I ought to go further without reminding you that the contributory pensions scheme, which was passed into law in the first year of our office, is now in operation, and is working smoothly. Payments in respect of claims on the part of widows and orphans already cover more than 400,000 persons. In January of the year after next nearly half a million men and women between 65 and 70 will become entitled to old age pensions. A. very con­siderable degree of co-ordination has been secured in the administration of health and unemployment schemes. As a direct consequence of the passing of the Act, the calls on the poor law relief have been reduced by more than two millions a year.Security to the WorkerI think it is very important to remember this: that while the social services pro­vided by the State are today of an exten­sive character, they are at the same time consistent with the encouragement of thrift and forethought. Our party has always recognised the immense importance of maintaining these qualities, and therein, I think, lies one of the great distinctions between us and our political opponents. It is the consistent aim to offer such assistance from the State as is legitimate, and is within its economic resources without impairing the independence of the recipient.By their various schemes the Government hope to complete the security for the worker, security which will be mainly won by his own efforts, by his own self-sacrifice, though it will be substantially assisted by the help of employers and from the State.Cheap ElectricityOne word about a measure which shortly, I hope, will become law - the Electricity Bill. In view of misconceptions which seem still to prevail in some quarters, it is very desirable to explain that the Bill does not provide for nationalisation, nor is the State undertaking the supply of electricity. Owing to the parochial line upon which electricity has grown up in this country, Great Britain is far behind her competitors in the production of cheaply-generated elec­tricity, and, in consequence, its use for power purposes is far less than half of what it should be when you look at what has been accomplished in foreign countries.By the Bill, generating stations will be developed on the most suitable sites and on the most efficient lines, and will he linked up all over the country. The saving in capital charges and through the im­proved load factor will, I hope, enable current to be supplied to authorised undertakings at less than half the average present cost, and at a lower price than even the best installation can produce today.Careful provision is made in the Bill that the benefit of cheap generation shall be passed on to the consumer. The expert advisers, who have made a detached examination, assure the Government that the saving in capital expenditure during the next few years will be more than sufficient to pay for the whole cost of the transmission lines, and at the end of that period the annual saving in cost of gener­ating will be approximately £11,000,000 a year.Naturally, the amount spread over a vast multitude of consumers only means a small benefit to the individual, but the result of the benefit to the community at large is very great; and the reduction in costs should lead to a great extension in the use of electricity in industry, and render it possible to supply many rural districts which are at present outside the area of supply.I think that the broad outline which I have given you of achievements and of purposes is one which, without any undue complacency, we may feel proud.General StrikeSocialist Leaders\u2019 Lack of CourageI have only to mention the handicaps from which our efforts during the past year have suffered, and the setback, on which I shall say some words, the setback which social progress has received from the pro­tracted dispute in the coal industry and from the upheaval caused by the General Strike. The one, unhappily, is still with us, but, as regards the other, the time that has elapsed since its termination en­ables us to review it without passion, and I am glad to see that you have been in your Conference addressing your minds to some of the problems which it raised.Since the Great War no such threat has been made to the British community. (Hear, hear.) Nor did the war itself threaten in the same way the institutions upon which the life of our Commonwealth is based. (Cheers.) There are those of its apologists who would have us believe that this was a strike like any other strike, hav­ing economic ends in view; as if, indeed, the stoppage of a nation\u2019s life and the dis­location of its industry would add one penny to the miners\u2019 wages if that strike had lasted to the crack of doom. (Cheers.)But whatever may be urged on behalf of the economic character, the logic of that strike is plain. Had it been successful, it would have over-ridden the constituted Government of the country, and the will of the community as there represented, and brought to an end our Parliamentary institutions. It so happens that the people of this country are profoundly attached to their Parliamentary institu­tions - (cheers) - institutions which are the very child of the nation. When Kings came into collision with Parliament, it was the Kings who felt the shock and not Parliament. The genius of Oliver Crom­well only made a fugitive indent in the system, which he was able to suspend for a short period. He passed, and Parlia­mentary institutions remained. Can it be thought that the institutions of centuries, which have resisted assault from the highest quarters, assaults from men of genius, are going to fall down and collapse before such an attack as they were subject to last spring?What at the moment of that crisis was the attitude of the Parliamentary Labour Party, His Majesty\u2019s Opposition? There were men among them who, for a space, had formed His Majesty\u2019s Government, who had experience of government, the experience of the responsibilities of Parlia­ment to the people, and who had the wit to understand what the challenge meant, the challenge of the General Strike, to Parliamentary institutions.No Public ProtestI confess I was never more disappointed than at the lack of statesmanship and, still more, at the lack of courage. Though not responsible for calling the General Strike, they were nevertheless silent at a moment when courage on their part might have saved thousands of their followers from being led astray, and might have saved the country from the experiences of that unhappy experiment.There is a responsibility which rests on His Majesty\u2019s Opposition, as the alternative Government of the country, and I am con­fident that the country has taken note that the leaders of that party raised not a single word in protest in public, whatever their feelings in private, upon this challenge to the State, and at this time of crisis they were unequal to their responsibility.They had an opportunity to show that they stood for law and order in this coun­try, and to speak out boldly as their duty bade them. And what contribution did they make? Sectional criticism in the House of Commons, and bitter speeches in the country.The threat which the General Strike offered was one which the Government - or any Government - was bound to resist, and the spontaneous reaction of the com­munity was such as to win the reluctant admiration of the whole world. (Cheers.) Those who called the strike learned their theories abroad, but the material with which they had to work was British, and the strikers themselves behaved with a restraint and orderliness typical of our countrymen - (cheers) - and in strange contrast to the violent doctrines which, for the time being, they were used to give expression.In the very brief account of the struggle I give, I cannot pass over alluding to the restraint of the police and the protective forces of the country. I think you will all feel with me that the highest credit is due to the Home Secretary - (cheers) - for the way in which he combined the utmost pos­sible efficiency with the most considerate and temperate use of exceptional powers with which it was necessary to arm him for this exceptional period. (Cheers.)Now there is a great deal that might be said about the causes of these troubles through which we are passing, and I hope to speak of them at meetings in the course of the winter. But this is not the place, nor have we the time. I would say in a few words, and, of course, it will be for posterity to judge, but in my view the General Strike, and very largely the same is true of the coal strike, are the inevitable results of tendencies which appeared in this country before the war, and which have been greatly accelerated by the war and the years of peace.There is a very close parallel between the industrial situation and the situation of Europe before the war. In each case you have the agglomeration of masses of men with that curious mass psychology. You have vast bodies formed on either side in the industrial struggle; and leaders and human nature being what it is, the tempta­tions to try your strength is almost irre­sistible. Collision is bound to come, the appeal to force rather than the appeal to reason, and the mere massing together of those large bodies leads in the individual to a sense of apathy and to a loss of per­sonal responsibility among the rank and file, and a curious belief that it does not matter what you do, because the Govern­ment will always step in and make it right.Can Democracy Learn?Just as the masses of men in Europe, the big armies, the ambitious leaders, led to the inevitable catastrophe, so in industry the same phenomenon occurred. The ques­tion is: Are we going to have the wisdom to learn? The events of this last year have set all men thinking. We know that if democracy can learn, it can only learn by experiments. It has made the experiment. Has it the capacity to learn? There are many results left behind. I can only deal with two obvious ones.The first is one which I have touched on earlier in my speech, and it is this: That the last months through which we have passed have postponed for some time - and whatever Government is in power - any prospect of ameliorative legislation which requires money. It means a slow­ing down of such progress as would have been easy had the strike not taken place. Everyone realises that, and there is no doubt there are many who will use this as a stick to beat the Government with for not making more progress. The fact that progress cannot be made while the country is making up the losses which she has suf­fered will be used to keep alive that dis­content which the enemies of the country long to see among them.It will be our duty to combat that in argument, by speeches, and by education to the best of our ability. My own firm con­viction is that such arguments as I have referred to will be used by all the extremists. I believe that the vast majority of our people today can trace cause and effect in a way they have never done before. (Cheers.)Trade Union LawThe Difficult Problem to be SolvedThe second point that the events of the last few months have brought into the forefront is the necessity for a re-­examination of the existing law concern­ing trade unions. There is no need tonight for us to discuss, highly interesting as those are, the causes which brought trade unionism into existence; but it is worth remembering how much they owed in their earlier days to our party. (Cheers.)Our party, in fact, did more than any other to create and to consolidate the trade union movement, and those amongst you represent the most active element in the Party, who are the spearheads of our propaganda, don\u2019t you ever let it be for­gotten in the country.I think we have to remember this: That we are still in a state of society where collective bargaining is necessary, where society still needs trade unions. You cannot smash the system, and if you could it would be wrong. (Cheers.) But the country is greater than the masters of industry, or the trade unions. (Hear, hear.)A difficult problem we have to solve is to reconcile the rights of men in combination with the rights of individuals, and both of them in relation to the wider community of which they are only a part. (Cheers.)I think we must remember, in the words of Disraeli, that the popular liberty is something more substantial than the exercise of the sacred rights of sovereignty by political classes - a very pregnant saying.Now you have today passed a resolution, to the terms of which the Government will give, as is their duty, prompt - (cheers) - and careful consideration.You know how deeply preoccupied we have been in the last few months with the exist­ing situation, and you will, I know, be patient with me if I am not able to announce tonight a decision on the details of a Bill. (Laughter.) Let me only say this: we are conscious of the wishes of our loyal sup­porters in the country. We are fully alive to the importance of the question which is so much exciting your interest. As soon as we have completed our examination of the subject, we shall prepare a Bill and pro­ceed with it in Parliament. (Cheers.)When we are in a position to present that Bill we shall rely with confidence on you - (A Voice: \u2018And we will not betray you\u2019) - (Cheers) - for support.Nothing to DispiritAnd now it seems to me hardly necessary, in the presence of a gathering of this kind, to say there is nothing in the outlook to­day to dispirit us. There is nothing to make us lose courage. There is a good deal to make us exercise patience. The man who takes ephemeral views, somehow his views are always those who come to me and say that all that I and the Government have worked for in the last three years is now exploded and done with, and that the events which followed my refusal to press home our victory by adopting Mr. Macquisten\u2019s Bill have falsified my hopes, and proved I was wrong. Not at all.It was perfectly obvious to me when I began my campaign two or three years ago that so long as I tried to teach the people of the country on these lines it would bring out of his hiding place every extremist in the country. They knew at once that if the teaching I was trying to inculcate was successful, if it gripped the man in the street, their occupation would be gone. (Cheers.) It was bound to bring us that opposition. It was bound to excite the Minority Movement, and they have worked their best ever since. They have done what they never did in private life: they have worked overtime. (Laughter and cheers.)In exactly the same way, I was not sur­prised at that burst of organised ill-manners in the House of Commons, con­fined only to the extremists, regretted by many Members of the Labour party, but done with deliberate intention to try to make the Government look contemptible in the eyes of their supporters, to weaken our authority, to throw mud on us. Such tactics cannot succeed in this country, and they will not. But I feel that tonight I must just tell you, as my friends, that I regard such manifestations as merely a form of hysteria emanating from men who knew they were beaten.A Call to DutyWorking for the Good of the Country as a WholeI told you some time ago there was much thinking going on in the country. There is. I believe that employers are thinking. I believe that trade union leaders are thinking. I believe that the working men are thinking as they have never done be­fore.I believe there is a genuine desire, when these troubles are over, amongst many men, whose minds have not hitherto been turned in that direction, to see if we cannot come together to increase the production of this country, to get work going, so that we may get better wages and more prosperity. (Loud cheers.)1 take it as a good sign that today there are trade union leaders studying problems in America instead of in Russia, and be­fore I sit down I would like to remind you of a few words used by Disraeli more than eighty years ago in a situation not only dissimilar from that in which we find our­selves today, showing with what unerring instincts he laid his finger on the spot in 1844, showing that we, who represent the Government today, however feebly, are trying to follow in the direct succession and applying to the problems of this age the temper and spirit he would have applied in his time had he had the opportunity. He was speaking in Yorkshire:Disraeli\u2019s AppealWe are asked sometimes what we want. We want, in the first place, to impress on society that there is such a thing as duty. We do not do that in any spirit of conceit or arrogance. We do not pretend that we are any better than others, but that we are anxious to do our duty, and if so we think that we have a right to call on others, whether rich or poor, to do theirs. If that principle of duty has not been lost sight of for the last fifty years you would never have heard of the classes into which England is divided. We want to put an end to that political and social exclusiveness, which we believe to be the bane of this country.We don\u2019t come out like a pack of pedants to tell you that we are prepared to remedy every grievance by the square and rule. It is not so much to the action of laws as to the influence of manners that we must look, but how are manners to influence men if they are divided into classes, if the population of a country becomes a body of sections, a group of hostile garrisons. We see but little hope for this country so long as that spirit of faction that has been so rampant of late years is fostered and encouraged. We call it a spirit of faction, for the principles on which the parties which nominally divided this country were formed have worn out and ceased to exist, and the association of men, however powerful, without political principles, is not a party, but a faction. Of such a state of society the inevitable result is that public passions are excited for private ends, and popular improve­ment is lost sight of in particular aggrandisements.The Next ElectionThere, over eighty years ago, you have expressed in words far more eloquent than I can find exactly the points upon which our party during the last three years has been working and are working and will continue to work.We have passed in Western Europe in the last ten years through a whole century of experience and of change, and as a result the world is giddy. It is the same in religion and in politics. Those who remain in parties joined together by fixed principles are the minority, and the majority are driven about this way and that, the prey of every specious speaker, of every quack, whether in religion or in politics.No longer are all the electors members of a party or parties. The voters today under the extended franchise are almost in a minority, but we are, as Mr. Lane Fox said, the largest, the most cohesive body in the country, and power will only come to those who govern the country for the people, for the people who are not attached to party will follow the Govern­ment, which as a Government knows no class, but fights for what they believe to be the good of the country as a whole.It is particularly important in gather­ings of this kind to keep that constitu­tional idea before your mind. The appeal to the country must be made in two or three years. It will be for them to give a verdict upon our work, whether in their view it is good or bad. But I say, with three definite parties and the many politi­cal combinations that exist or may be possible, there is all the more necessity for us to see that we so govern, so try to educate the country that we may re­ceive that support from the men and women of this country, that support may be given to us, because they believe that we are trying to the best of our ability to govern the country for the good of the whole country and not for a class. It is only by that support that any Government today can come in and can have the re­quisite power behind it to govern in this country at all.So let us remember that, and insofar as we keep these ideals before us, always based on the great principles of our party, which have come to us straight from Disraeli, if we only go forward in that spirit we need have no fear but that we shall be able to cope with the difficulties which occur from day to day. We need have no fear that the country when asked will endorse our action and will confirm the verdict which they gave two years ago.

aVThis year, as you have so justly said, we meet once again to review and take stock. Next year our meeting will take place at some distance, shorter or longer, before the next general election, and then will be the time to discuss our policy at that important moment. (Laughter and cheers.) Today, as you, my lord, have reminded us, I am but recently returned from Canada.I went to Canada with one object - to explode once and for all that insidious propaganda emanating from the foreigner, and alas, from the native-born, that this country is decadent and played out. I have laid that ghost. (Cheers.)Dazzling Liberal GeniusSince then I have enjoyed what we all like \u2013 a holiday. During my holidays I find that one of my most interesting and profitable pastimes is to continue that study - which I have carried on microscopically for about fifteen years - of the career and the habits of that dazzling genius who today leads the  Liberal party. For five years now he has been cruising round our well found ship trying to place a torpedo in our vitals, but, well-equipped as his submarine is, he has never yet been able to practise complete immersion, and to those who know either the periscope or the wash he is always visible. Long habit has taught me where to look for that wash. I have been following it at a distance all the time I was in France. More­over, most ships when they go to sea are accompanied by wild fowl which fly above them. (Laughter.) They are always the same, however their plumage may alter with the seasons. They hover over the place where the submarine is trying to conceal itself.There must be some reason which makes birds follow ships.I have never yet discovered it, but I accept it as a fact of natural history for which I am grateful.PensionsNow I think I cannot do better than remind a gathering of this kind of progressive Conservatives - (hear, hear) - that on January 1 next the full effect will be seen of a most beneficial piece of legislation which we passed as soon as we got into power.Much has been said about our party being a Socialistic party today and about our leader being a Socialist, and yet, is there a single Conservative in the country who, if he had his way today, would have that Act unpassed? Not only are we giving this benefit to widows and orphans - too long delayed - (hear, hear) - but we have once and for all discontinued that \u2018means limit,\u2019 which most of us for years past have felt to be the great blot on the system of old age pensions. (App­lause.)The official inquiry was harassing, was unkind to the deserving; the prevention of old persons from taking any odd jobs, in fear they would lose their pension. These things are now of the past, and the pension instead of being a charity has become a right. (Applause.) The Government has merely recognised in that legislation what the conscience of the nation has long approved, and that is that it is the national duty to provide for the aged poor.Burden on IndustryI make these observations because there have been claims made, and perhaps one could expect them, that too heavy loads are being placed today upon industry. It is quite true. The loads on industry, as on everyone and everything in the country today, are very heavy. But the load was one of a number which industry in one form or another has borne in the past, connected with their own people. The conscience of the nation has become more tender with the years and more is expected today than at the time of our fathers and grandfathers, and I say this without fear of contradiction unless industry does look after its own people never will that spirit be found among our people in which alone good co-operative work is done.Facts about TradeI want to say a word or two about trade. And I want to speak as I always try to do on this subject, clearly and in accordance with facts. I want to do justice to all the facts and not only those which tell against our own country. (Hear, hear.) I would remind you that my colleague, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in Scotland, speaking few days after I had spoken there, used these words, \u2018British industry is once more in full swing and the work of repairing the damage has already made appreciable headway.\u2019Now those words - not unduly exag­gerated, in my opinion - made Mr. Lloyd George very angry. (Laughter.) He spoke of Mr. Churchill\u2019s \u2018usual lighthearted­ness\u2019 - not a bad attribute in a statesman - and said that the position was too serious to bandy jokes about.I would only make one observation in reply to that. Sir Eric Geddes, who was chosen out of the whole country to be a Minister in Mr. Lloyd George\u2019s Ministry of All the Talents - (laughter) - said the same thing the other day. Whatever may be said of Sir Eric Geddes in his private capacity, no one has ever accused him of bandying jokes about business in public.Exports GrowingLet us take two or three facts. I will tell you my conclusions later. During the last two months the exports of manufac­tured goods have been slowly growing until in August - that is, two months ago - they were 11 per cent greater than two years ago, and the exports of raw material were nearly 30 per cent greater. Now, those are facts.In coal, in spite of terrible difficulties in the industry, on which I may say a word or two later, we are actually producing and selling more coal than we were two years ago. Let me take iron and steel, depressed possibly as much or more than any industry in the country.Let us remember two things. The world demand, which, probably, had there been no war, would have taken up the world production, today, by natural increase, has lagged behind. The war led to great productive increase. It requires time for the demand to catch it up. But also let us not forget the industrial troubles of last year, which led to contracts being placed for steel and iron abroad, which in their turn led to the phenomenal deliveries which have taken place into the country during the earlier part of the year and during the summer.I should like, while mentioning that industry, to congratulate them on the co-­operative spirit they have recently shown in devising a scheme of rebates for the home trade which, I hope, will do what those who devised it expect. (Hear, hear.)The Right WayThen there is the woollen trade: There is a trade that has been hit badly, partly by competition from abroad and partly by change of fashion. What are they doing in that trade? They are suggesting a con­ference of all these engaged in the trade - masters and men. (Hear, hear.) That is the right way. (Hear, hear.)Take the shipbuilding trade: Here the depression has not been peculiar to this country. It has existed all over the world, but I remember very well this summer the President of the Board of Trade giving figures in the House of Commons showing that we were holding our own in world competition and had actually improved our relative position last year. (Hear. hear.) And we have it from the president of the Chamber of Shipping that the outlook is not unfavour­able; and that remark of his has had some corroboration in the fact that there are more orders about today in our ship­yards. (Hear, hear.)Not Going to Hang the Harp In the new industries I can quote Mr. Lloyd George who confesses that they are making headway against all competition, and I say that if you look round and compare the position with what it was you may truly and justly say the situation is not unhopeful, and I refuse to sit down with Mr. Lloyd George and Sir Herbert Samuel and hang my harp on the weeping willow. (Applause.) I am sorry even now for a moment to allude again to the war, but in considering these questions you must never forget the poverty left by the war, but the utter destruction of the very methods of exchange themselves. And remember that for several years Europe has exhibited a welter of monetary policies under which no standard of price could be attained; no one could prophesy; no one knew. And it was in that welter that we decided an action - much criticised at the time - to anchor ourselves once more securely to the gold standard.Today practically every country has either followed, or is anxious to follow, our example. That change, of course, involved a good deal of adaptation in our internal economy. It could not be achieved without difficulty, but difficult as it was, it was far, far better than any prolonga­tion of the instability that had existed up to that time.Reaping the BenefitsToday we are beginning to reap the benefits, and the first benefit, I think, which touches every householder, may be seen in the definite and substantial reduction in the cost of living.If it had not been for the setback last year I think by now the adaptation over a large area would have been much more complete than it is. But I am quite convinced that in that anchorage we have found the way to the revival of trade. Remember this too - that once settled on that standard it becomes possible, as it was not before, for the manufacturer to calculate his costs, for the merchant to deal, being able to see further into the future, and ensure for the work­ing classes real wages. (Hear, hear.) And there is a great deal in that. (Applause.)Stable ConditionsWhat Government Has Worked ForNow the Government, in the time they have been in office, sometimes successful, sometimes unsuccessful, have been work­ing consistently for stable conditions at home and abroad. There. is so much I want to touch on tonight that I would say no more about our friends abroad than to quote a few words which have been said of us and of our policy by one whose words I think will carry weight in this country, not only on account of his own personality, but because he is a man who is chary of using words of praise, and has been chary of using them in regard to England. I mean Dr. Nansen, of Norway.Nansen\u2019s TributeHe said quite recently: \u2018I should like to say a word with regard to the British position. We have all of us been impressed by the force and conviction of Sir Austen Chamberlain\u2019s speech. (Hear, hear.) I fear that public opinion - (I am giving you the gist of it in Dr. Nansen\u2019s own words) - I fear that public opinion in Great Britain has to some extent misunderstood the attitude of those of us who are, or have been, advocates of the Protocol of l924. There has been, I think, some resentment, perhaps natural, arising from the impression that we have underestimated the enormous contribution Great Britain has made during the last nine years to strengthening the foundations of peace in the world, and particularly to strengthening them through the League of Nations. No one who has worked at the League has failed to realise that Great Britain from its first inception has given in the main constant powerful support to the League and its existing provisions.\u2019I must call your attention (continued the Prime Minister) to these last words of Dr. Nansen, and they are the last I have say on this subject. They are these: \u2018If Great Britain has hesitated to increase these commitments we all of us fully realise it is chiefly because she takes the exist­ing commitments seriously, and she is anxious not to weaken in any respects her power. She will not weaken existing engagements by contracting new ones. (Cheers.)Last Year\u2019s AftermathIt is not only the aftermath of the Great War, proceeded the Premier, we have had to deal with. There was the aftermath of last year. You can have a general strike if you like; you can have a stoppage in your coal pits for months if you like, but you cannot have them without paying for them. Part of the price is unemployment. Part of the price is the loss of revenue, both national and local.Part of the price is higher rates. Part of the price is to put a check on the expansion of social services, and part of the price is physical damage to the race. (Cheers.)We have been three years in office. Half of that time we have been beset with greater economic difficulties than any other Government that ever existed. (Cheers.) Therefore, I welcome the speeches at the recent Trades Union Congress.Labour\u2019s New NoteI perceived a new note. I trust it may be sustained. The president has proclaimed his faith in the machinery of consultation. The president is a well-known friend of industrial peace. Mr. Clynes has said there is need of a long period of agreement between the various interests.Peace in Industry How Masters and Men Must Help to Ensure itI want to recognise - and I hope we all shall - a genuine attempt to damp down the fires of agitation - (cheers) - in the face of the hard realities of trading figures. I rejoice that they have learnt - at last - that the working man\u2019s best friend is his negotiator who can honour his bond. (Cheers.) He is the man who puts wages into men\u2019s pockets, and I think - although they have not said so - they must have recognised now - taught by bitter experience - that the windy demagogue who shouts one thing in public and says the opposite very often in private - (hear, hear) - is the man who sends the poor into futile strikes and drives their families into bankruptcy. I make no complaint that these excellent speeches were interspersed with obvious attacks upon myself.I should like - if I did not consider the interests of the country - to accept the challenge tomorrow and to call a general election. We have had three in three years, and even if the general election be postponed for another year or two, that does not prevent the Trade Disputes Act being adjudicated upon. I should wel­come it to occupy as prominent a place in the campaign as anyone desires to give it. (Cheers.)A Sporting OpponentAs a sporting opponent, I refrain from pressing a general election upon the Labour party until they have had another year in which to try to whip up some opposition more successful than they have been able to raise up to now. (Cheers.) It would be taking an unfair advantage to strike now. (Laughter and cheers.)Before I leave this subject - and I have kept it to the last - there is one sentence uttered by Mr. Cramp which I must quote: \u2018Whatever goodwill might arise in the ranks of industry must be directly between the Trades Unions and the employers, with the Government out of the picture.\u2019I do not suppose Mr. Cramp has done me the honour to read the various speeches I have made for three years past. I have preached nothing else but that the Government should keep out or it. (Applause) That matter of getting together is a matter of those engaged in the industry. No politician to what­ever party he may belong can do anything but harm by \u2018butting in.\u2019Our Government, any Government, will watch with sympathy whatever may take place between those parties, and if at any time they should come to us and say we can help them by any particular form of legislation, such a request from such parties would receive the utmost consideration of any Government of which I might be the head.Congratulations to Rail CompaniesI cannot refrain from saying a word of congratulation and of sympathy with the railway companies in the efforts both sides are making today. My association with the railway companies was long and, intimate, and nothing that affects them is alien to me. I am speaking in a part of Great Britain which needs as much as any part to take heed of what is going on.Cannot you in South Wales help to lead the way with this new spirit? Your sufferings throughout this part of the country are sufficiently acute and challenging to call for extraordinary efforts on your part to reduce that suffering.Something, I rejoice to think, has recently been accomplished between the parties in the coal trade with regard to the restriction of recruitment. It is only one thing, but it is a good thing as far as it goes.\u2018Take the Men in With You\u2019 I notice in the press reports of efforts among the coal-owners today at stabi­lising prices. I would offer no opinion on that, but I would say this: In all far-reaching developments affecting your trade take the men with you. (Applause.) There is an old text \u2018He that is not with us is against us,\u2019 and I commend that to you. There is much in South Wales and in other districts on which the best brains can be brought to bear. Who does not know in every colliery district of the country the first-class brains that have come up from the ranks? (Hear, hear.) Use them wherever they are.What reasonable chance is there of absorbing quickly the unemployed in that industry and what meanwhile is happening to the youth of the Valleys? Is there going to be a permanent surplus of unemployed? These are questions that can be thrashed out by the industry far better then by anyone else, and employers cannot divest themselves even if they would of the responsibilities of leadership. (Applause.)AgricultureWhere the Government Cannot Help   There are one or two subjects on which you will expect me to say a few words, but I don\u2019t think that a gathering such as this will expect that I have come to Cardiff with a panacea in my pocket for everyone\u2019s troubles. I have not.But there are one or two remarks that I would make in connection with agriculture, a question on which you have had an interesting discussion today. I need not tell you the condition of that industry is causing the Government grave concern. I would remind you that except the coal industry there is no industry in the country to which the Government, in one way or another, has given more attention, but in spite of that, from causes over which neither we nor any other Government can have control, agriculture is passing through very, very bad times.Farmers have had to face a fall in world prices. That is beyond the control of any Government. It is a thing which hits agriculture in many another country. They have had to face, as they had had to face before, two bad seasons, and until the turn of the year we shall hardly know how badly they may have been hit by this terrible harvest weather we have had this year. Pessimism No AidOn this point I would make one passing observation. Pessimism never helped anybody, and such a campaign as appears in sections of the press is far from helping agriculture.We have tried and tried seriously to help that industry financially. It may be that in parts of the country farmers are paying higher rates than they once did; but they are not singular. They would have been paying far higher rates were it not for two great Acts of our party - one in 1896 and one four years ago. We have quite recently added to that relief and extended relief to buildings as well as land.It is natural to grumble. I grumble myself as a rural ratepayer on the expen­diture on roads. Yet let us not forget we have given an annual grant of a million and a half to the rural roads. We have just given almost as large a sum in aid of unclassified roads - small rural roads - and if that help had not been given the whole of that money would have had to be found out of rates. And we have provided, in such parts of the country as have taken advantage of it, a new and a paying crop in beet at a cost this year of £4,500,000 of subsidy to the taxpayer.More Credit for FarmersBut let me repeat what I said in Lincolnshire the day I went to Canada. We have been considering how to make more credit available for farmers, with special reference to the difficulty which faces many of them who purchased their holdings on bank overdrafts. Bank over­drafts are liable, as I know very well, to be repaid quickly. Great Britain is one of the few countries without any machinery for long credit on farmers\u2019 mortgages. That gap has to be filled. We are working on the subject still in co­operation with the banks, and I reiterate what I said in Lincolnshire, that it is our intention to bring a scheme before Parliament next year so that it may be done before we go out of office. (Applause.)One observation more, and only one - and I hope you will forgive me for introducing it. It is quite true that one swallow does not make a summer, but when you have seen one you generally see some more by­ and bye. Two years ago there arrived for me in Downing Street a box, and on the box was a label, and on the label was a picture of a map of England and Wales, and in the centre of the map was a Union Jack and these words: \u2018Produce of England and Wales.\u2019A Worcester ExampleThe box contained as fine a collection for grading and assortment of the best cooking apples that I have seen from any country for many a long day. (Hear, hear.)And with the box came a letter containing these words: \u2018This box of apples, carrying for the first time a national label signifying quality and reliability, is sent to you, sir, in recog­nition of the work done by the Ministry of Agriculture to encourage better market­ing, and is a token of the intention of Worcestershire growers to support that work and to take a leading part in re­capturing British markets for British products.\u2019 (Applause.)I do not suggest, and I never have suggested that better working is the complete cure for depressed agriculture, but I believe it to be a necessity for any agri­culture, whether depressed or prosperous, and I hope every county in England will be a competitor with Worcestershire.House of LordsChallenge to the Labour CriticsNow, sir, you have had discussions on many subjects today. You had a very interesting discussion on the House of Lords. Now the  national executive of the Labour party, the General Council of the Trade Unions Congress, have all of them decided early this year that the House of Lords ought to be abolished, and I think Mr. MacDonald in April wrote that a Second Chamber was necessary.I don\u2019t know whether the Labour party will have the courage to propose the abolition of the House of Lords at the next election. I imagine they will wait a short time to watch how that useful domestic animal is bearing his exercise.But we are opposed fundamentally, absolutely, and diametrically to such a proposal. Single chamber Government has no place in the constitution in any great progressive democratic country. (Cheers) We have, as you are aware, put forward certain sketch proposals for consideration and ventilation, and we welcome sym­pathetic and enlightened criticism - criticism which aims at a sound constitutional advance in harmony with the democratic temper of the time. The Government this autumn will consider carefully such criticism.They will consider carefully that most interesting discussion which took place amongst you today, and they will announce their decision later in the year. Economy\u2018Trying To Save Wherever We Can\u2019On the subject of economy there again you have passed a resolution with the wording of which everyone has sympathy. Let me say this, there is no subject more difficult, none more easy to talk about, none more difficult to effect. I won\u2019t say nothing, but I will say much. Now, we recognise, as all of you do, the paramount importance of this subject. We have a permanent Economy Committee of the Cabinet, which went through every estimate last year and that is doing the same this year.We are trying, wherever we can - and this is some of the most difficult work - to effect economies in great expenditure which has already been sanctioned. Wit­ness our efforts - bitterly opposed - in the reduction of the housing subsidies, which efforts by the way have led to a considerable diminution in the cost of build­ing, and also our efforts to economise in the matter of unemployment insurance. We have accomplished something in both those directions, but I do beg of you to remember - the figures have often been quoted, and I give them very briefly - that more than half the expenditure today consist in repayment of debt, interest, and pensions, that a hundred million goes in education, housing, health, and police, and a large sum on self-support­ing services, and when you come to analyse the national balance-sheet you find that out of the vast expenditure, £156,000,000 is what is left for the ordinary machinery of government, which includes the defensive forces, the Army, Navy, the Air Force, the collection of revenue, and the whole administration of the country.Cut Down DefenceWe have cut down defence, I think, pretty near to the limit of safety. (Hear, hear) Remember, wherever you try to economise you will always have a powerful group which will object to a particular economy on the things they think most of. And remember this: that our trade has been so hit, partly by world  conditions and partly by our own follies, that there has been none of that expansion of revenue which is essential to prosperity and which, when it comes, will probably accomplish more for this country than will even the reductions which today are possible. (Cheers.)I say those words, because people talk lightly of being able to write a hundred millions off the national account. Figures like that are nonsense. You must look facts in the face. (Cheers) We are with you all the way in your resolution. We are as anxious as you are for economy. We are trying - we will try.We shall have to submit when the time comes to the verdict of the country. If we have been bad stewards we shall be punished for it. Our own desires, our own self-interests, make us partners with you in the resolution which you passed today. (Cheers.)Votes for Women\u2018We Cannot Go Back On Our Pledges\u2019The only other thing on which I wish to say a few words is the question of votes for women. (Applause.) I have never wavered in my own view - (applause) - that even if you desired it, which I do not think you do, you cannot go back on the pledges given by Mr. Bonar Law and myself.Mr. Bonar Law declared himself in favour of equal franchise. To pretend that that means anything but equal fran­chise at 21 is to delude yourselves, and to make a fatal mistake on the part of Tories - that is to score by being \u2018clever.\u2019 (Applause.)Where does the principle of the opposi­tion of votes for women come from? It comes from Lord Rothermere. Many people in the party read what Lord Rother­mere says because they have believed that he is a supporter of our party. If he be a supporter of ours, his criticism is of value; if not, his advice to us is not for our good. (Applause.)But it is most important for honest politics that the people who read what he directs to be written in his papers should know under what flag he sails. You will search the columns of Hansard in vain to see any speech of his on the matter.Three Questions for Lord RothermereI am driven to ask him from this platform, openly, three questions. (Applause.)Is Lord Rothermere a supporter of the Unionist party with me as the leader? (Shouts of \u2018No.\u2019)Is Lord Rothermere a supporter of the Unionist party with someone else as leader? (Shouts of \u2018No.\u2019)Is Lord Rothermere a supporter of Mr. Lloyd George? (Shouts of \u2018Yes.\u2019)Now, I think the mind of the Conser­vative party has been made up on this question of women\u2019s votes. I do not think they are going to show at this stage a lack of faith in their country­women. (Applause.) It would be an unwarrantable slur on the efficiency and enthusiasm of the party organisation repre­sented by those present in this room tonight.There are many who forget - no one here forgets, although there are many who do forget - the great change which was wrought in this country by the Reform Bill of 1918. It was then extended further than that Committee intended when it set about its labours. It may be that that year made this country, with the exception of what we are going to do next year, a democracy in fact.Let us realise what many of those skilled in politics before the war found hard to envisage. It is not the majority of the people of this country today who belong to any organised party, and that great change was evinced in the 1923 elections. We are in a position where, in my view, no party with its party members alone can gain a victory over both the other parties combined.The Party\u2019s TaskI don\u2019t believe that any purely party programme can gain a victory over the other two parties combined. Our difficulty is, while holding fast to our principles, to build on them a national policy - (hear, hear) - which will bring to our support armies of those who owe no particular allegiance, and armies of those who prefer stable government to giving sup­port to either of the other two parties. As you will remember, perhaps, our greatest leader, Disraeli - (applause) - said that no party that failed to attract youth to its ranks could live. (Hear, hear.) Those words are truer today in our democracy than they were then. And those who say of the young women under 30 \u2018Do not give her the vote because she will vote Socialist\u2019 are denying the very thing that we as a party today are doing - attracting the youth of the country - and I welcome these new voters wholeheartedly with their brothers to come and work for us, and ensure for us in two years\u2019 time a victory no less great than we won three years ago. (Applause.)

aVI have been in politics for forty years.  I have never known a party in better spirits or in finer fighting fettle.  (Loud cheers.)  They have confidence in themselves and confidence in next year - (A voice \u2013 \u2018And confidence in you, sir.\u2019) \u2013 and they have ample justification for it.  They have justification from two sides.  They remember the victory of four years ago.  They know that 412 Unionist members were returned.  They know all about the swing of the pendulum, the unpopularity of the Government, and the attack made on it, but we still have 406 members.  We have lost six seats in four years \u2013 one and a half a year \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 and, if mathematics be true, it will take one hundred and forty years to move us.  I said there was a two-fold reason for our confidence.  We are a party rich in traditions.  We are a national party which puts the needs of the nation before the needs of a class.  (Cheers.)  We are a party of union, whereas our opponents\u2019 are parties of disunion.  (Hear, hear.)  But the other reason for our confidence is the character and record of those who would fight us. (Laughter.)  Let us consider for a moment the Socialist Party.  During the last four years in Parliament their Parliamentary record is a record of lack of discipline, without which no party can succeed.  (Hear, hear.)  A record of weakness, of absence of statesmanship; and time after time they have subordinated broad and national considerations to the narrow interests of a certain class.  (Hear, hear.)  We have seen that at the time of the general strike.  We saw it during the whole of the coal stoppage, during both of which times their leaders, who disapproved of much of what was in the policy of many of those who were leading in those troublous times, never by word during those dreary months had the courage to say in public what they felt and knew in private.  We saw it at the time of the outbreak of trouble in China when Mr. George Hicks and Mr. Wheatley regretted the flaunting of a military display in China and said what did it matter because they were not bricklayers who were going to be killed.  They have claimed to have a monopoly in representing the interests of the working classes.  A more impudent claim was never made.  (Cheers.)  If we failed to represent those interests not one of us would be on this platform.  If we need proof of my contention has the country yet forgotten the campaign against the Trades Disputes Bill when it was proved that the attitude taken up in Parliament failed to represent the attitude of the workers of the country?  (Cheers.)The Labour PartyIn years to come the Labour Party may be a great party.  I hope for the sake of the country that it will, but they have a long way to go yet, and until they learn to oppose and expose their own extremists they will never secure the suffrages of the people of England.  We saw when they were in office how their leaders yielded to their extremists in the matter of the Russian treaty.  We saw it at the time of the general strike.  We saw it in the coal stoppage.  We saw it in China.  Indeed, we see today how hard they are striving to represent themselves before the country as that constitutional and moderate party - (laughter) - which alone, as they knew in their hearts, can never succeed as rivals to ourselves.  And what are they doing to achieve that result?  They have issued a declaration of policy, a document long-winded and nebulous in which no attempt is made to show how either their proposals would work in practice, how they would achieve the results claimed for them, or how the vast capital expenditure which they involve will be raised.  The only plank on which they seem firmly to stand is that of nationalisation.  Yet what welcome has been accorded to this programme by those for whose benefit it was devised? In the \u2018New Leader,\u2019 as soon as it appeared, I noticed that one gentleman happy in alliterative expression said: \u2018While there are good phrases and points in the programme they are buried in pages and pages of philanthropic poppycock.\u2019  (Loud laughter.)  Mr. Tom Johnson, for whom I confess a sneaking regard, described the programme as a sort of dog\u2019s breakfast, in which there were scraps for every palate.  (Laughter.)  Mr. Philip Snowden, always cautious and sometimes wise - (laughter) - said this:  \u2018The Conservative Party has never committed the folly of issuing a list of a few dozen items of reform which it proposes to carry out.\u2019  Nor will it ever do so as long as I am leader.  The editor of the \u2018Socialist Review,\u2019 who I gather from his style and sentiment belongs to that select body called the intellectuals says \u2013 it is almost impossible to read a page without a yawn \u2013 that it is not going to capture democracy.Labour\u2019s \u2018Little Differences\u2019Whether it be the issue or not of that programme, what has happened has been a complete split in their ranks, heralded by the manifesto of Mr. Cook and Mr. Maxton.  The significant feature of that is this, while the Labour Party are properly trying to purge their ranks of Communism and to become purely a constitutional party, you have Mr. Maxton\u2019s manifesto, approved by the National Council of the Independent Labour Party.  Now one hundred and twelve members out of the one hundred and fifty-eight Labour members in Parliament belong to the Independent Labour Party.  That shows you how much unity has at present been achieved, and while they talk of driving out the Communists Mr. William Adamson, one of the most respected members of the Labour Party, who has given a life\u2019s service to the miners in Scotland, has been thrown out of office in his own union by the Communists.  When these little differences are adjusted it will be time to tell the people of England that the Labour party is purged of Communism.The Liberal PartyNow by a natural process of transition in discussing our opponents we pass from the Labour Party to the Liberal.  That is a much more depressing subject.  (Laughter.)  The Labour Party is after all a party in the making \u2013 a much more cheerful picture than a party in the breaking.  There has never been so far as I am aware in the political history of this country a great party more disunited in policy and in leadership than the Liberal Party today.  There are some who accept as leader Mr. Lloyd George.  There are some who do not.  There are some who accept his land policy.  There are a great many who do not.  In Parliament, if that be any indication, they have voted every way and no way the last four years.  I have been at some pains to have the voting analysed for the last four years.  I find that 6,000 votes have been cast for us.  I find that 18,000 votes have been cast for the Socialists.  I find 37,000 votes have never been cast at all.  (Loud laughter.)  In other words \u2013 if I may put it mathematically \u2013 10 per cent of the Liberal votes have gone to the Unionists, 30 per cent to Labour, and 60 per cent \u2013 (laughter and a voice \u2018Gone to bed.\u2019)  When these things happen in Parliament what about the great revival outside?  The Liberal candidate has forfeited his deposit on no fewer than eight occasions at bye-elections since the General Election, and the party which numbered forty four years ago numbers thirty-nine today.  It is a happy augury that during our session in Yarmouth Cheltenham has once more hammered in the fact that even in a borough like Cheltenham, where there has always been a large Liberal vote, where so popular a man as Sir James Agg-Gardner could not always win and often got in by small majorities, even there at this time the Liberal poll has fallen beyond all hope of redemption.The Liberal ProgrammeWhat of their future and their programme?  I am informed \u2013 I do not know whether it is correct \u2013 that at their annual conference, which I understand is to follow ours, the resolutions which will be discussed are resolutions drafted by their Executive Committee.  It seems to me a strange procedure in these democratic days, and contrasting very vividly with our method of business, but still, it is their business, not mine.  I notice for the main part in social reform they advocate little which we are not doing ourselves.  I notice their only idea of economy is to strike forty millions off national defence without saying how or where, only one thing being certain, that that sum cannot be taken off national defence without impairing national security.  I notice they still stick to the old land values, of which I thought we had heard the last when we abolished the relics of the 1918 legislation.  They undertake to abolish preference and safeguarding.  They undertake to relieve the able-bodied poor out of the exchequer, which seems to me very much like nationalising the dole, and I notice that the Labour Party say of the Liberal programme that it is lifted bodily out of theirs, but that water has been substituted for their wine.  This confirms me in my conviction which I have held for some time that while Labour is Socialism with the courage of its convictions modern Liberalism is Socialism without the courage of its convictions.What Will They Do?But whatever their programme may be, the issue at the next election will be the challenge of Socialism against constitutionalism and individualism.  Now what do the rank-and-file Liberals think about that?  There is no Liberal in this country who looks for a Liberal majority.  He knows that any success of his party or of his vote helps the Socialist and the Socialist alone.  (Hear, hear.)  The utmost he can hope to do is to hold the balance after the next election.  He won\u2019t do it, but he hopes to.  (Cheers.)  What is he going to do then?  The British electors have the right to demand before the election what will Liberals do.  Will they put Labour in again or will they not?  We only want to know where we are.THE GOVERNMENT\u2019S RECORDTribute to Sir AustenI think I have devoted more time than it is worth with our opponents, and must say something about ourselves.  (Cheers.)  I notice Mr. Lloyd George recently asked:  What have we done?  I don\u2019t mind his asking that.  I have always been told he does not read very much.  (Laughter and cheers.)  I know that he has been in Parliament very little, and I understand from the newspapers that he has been devoting a lot of time to gardening.  (Laughter.)  I gather that because I notice that for two or three years he has been spending all his time in throwing stones into his neighbour\u2019s garden.  (Laughter and cheers.)  But I am glad to have the opportunity of telling him what we have done.  I am amazed at our record.  (Cheers.)  I make no excuse for speaking about it, and I want every member of Parliament and every candidate at the next election to rub it in, because people do not realise; and after all our people are very apt to judge by what has been done.  They say public memory and political memory is short.  That may be true; but at the same time the British people are generous to good work.  We have done good work, and we must make them understand it.  I want first of all to pay tribute to my colleague, Sir Austen Chamberlain.  (Loud cheers.)  The whole country, the whole of Europe, recognises the devotion and the skill, and the patience with which he has handled foreign affairs for four years.  I have every hope and belief that he will handle them for four years more.  (Cheers.)  At Locarno, in China, in Egypt, conciliation, firmness ,and the resolution to protect the interest, and in some cases the lives, of our own people, he has constantly pursued peace, and a great part of the credit of what has been done in Europe in that direction during these four years belongs fairly to him, and in that cause he has nearly worn himself out.  (Cheers.)  In the Dominions my friend, Mr. Amery, has for the first time laid, and rightly laid, a close and intimate personal intercourse between the Government at the centre of the Empire and the Governments in the Dominions.  (Hear, hear.)  His personal visit, his personal intercourse, his speeches, will all bear rich fruit in the future and while I just allude to him do not let us forget at this meeting the services to the Dominions, to the Mother Country, to the Empire rendered at the last Imperial Conference by Lord Balfour.  (Cheers.)  The work of the Empire Marketing Board will be more and more valuable as time goes on.  The work of overseas settlement, difficult for many reasons which I cannot go into tonight, is engaging the Secretary of State\u2019s personal attention, and will, I hope, also in its time bear good fruit.  But it is at home where the record of the achievements of the present Government will go down to history.  We have not talked as much as we have done things.  We had not been in office six months before we passed the Widows, Orphans and Old Age Pensions Act.  (Cheers.)  I would say nothing more of that at this moment than this, that the president of the Friendly Societies\u2019 Conference the other day in speaking of that Act gave these remarkable figures.  Over one quarter of a million widows, over 350,000 children, over 880,000 old age pensioners - a million and half in all - are drawing benefits from that Act who would have been drawing nothing had it not been passed.  (Cheers.)  The whole conception of that Act and the passing of it was the work of the present Government.Housing Problem on the Road to SolutionAnd now I want to say a word about the work of another of my colleagues, to whom I rejoice to hear you give a welcome this afternoon worthy of him.  In housing out of the 1,100,000 houses built since the Armistice, 700,000 have been built in the term of the present Government, and in the year ending on the 30th of last September, there were 273,000 houses built, which was more than twice the number that had ever been built before in that time.  I wish that Mr. Neville Chamberlain could be kept at the Ministry of Health for the rest of his life.  (Cheers.)  Nothing has been nearer his heart than slum clearance and many conversations have he and I had on that.  He is not satisfied with the progress that has been made and yet more schemes have been approved by him than by any other Government.  I think we may safely say this.  Now that the housing problem is on the road to solution and the houses that we wanted have been in so large a part built, we shall be able when we go back again next June or July - (cheers) - to go full steam ahead with slum clearance.  (Cheers.)Progress in EducationThere is another subject on which I want to speak for four or five minutes.  It is one that plays very little part at ordinary political meetings.  It is one on which I spoke a good deal myself before the last election, and that is education.  I want to pay a tribute tonight to what Lord Eustace Percy has done without advertisement, without any shouting, what he has done in the way of the fulfilment of the pledges we gave at the election.  We made three or four main points.  We promised to go in for the modernisation of the elementary school premises.  We promised to go in for a reduction of classes.  We promised to improve advanced education for children between eleven and fifteen.  We promised to increase the opportunities of young persons to get higher education if they proved themselves fitted for it \u2013 and mind you on all of these subjects depends in no small degree the efficiency and happiness of our country.  (Hear, hear.)  On all of these points we have made great progress.  There have been over two hundred new schools built.  Plans have been approved for more than eight hundred blacklisted schools, and more than half these plans have been carried out and executed.  Large classes have been reduced by one-third, and more than eight thousand of them cut down.  There are 3700 more certificated teachers, which bears out the fact that I have just related to you.  All the local authorities in this country have now put forward schemes for advanced instruction for children from eleven to fifteen \u2013 schemes for three years from 1927 to 1930, and they are now in the course of execution.  There are 63,000 more secondary school pupils sanctioned than a year ago, 25,000 more children in the secondary schools, an increase of 16 per cent in the free places.  That is very remarkable progress \u2013 (cheers) \u2013 and I do not mind confessing to you there is nothing lies nearer my heart and the hearts of my colleagues than to go on to help with the education and the health of our people, to try to convert them from a C 8 nation to an A 1 nation.  (Cheers.)  Medical services in the schools have been improved, and half a million more children are being inspected every year.  Schemes for crippled children for orthopaedic treatment have been passed and are in action.  And in conclusion \u2013 and I rejoice in this \u2013 for the first time all qualified teachers are secure under terms settled nationally and adopted by all the local authorities, and the Government stand, as they have always stood, for national settlement in these matters.The Electricity ActWe hear very little today about the Electricity Act.  There was much talk when the Labour Party were in about what they were going to do in electrifying England.  We did not talk \u2013 we passed the Electricity Act.  For the last two or three years all those concerned in administration have been putting in splendid work in preparation.  The contracts are beginning to be put out, and we can see a time not too far distant when cheap electricity will be available from one end of the country to the other.  I venture to think that in years to come when people look back on these times there is no Act which will stand out as having been more far-sighted, as having done more for the country as a whole, than the Electricity Act, passed in the lifetime of the present Government.New Women VotersWith regard to women and children we have found in times past several useful Acts in connexion with guardianship adoption and to meet certain hardships in regard to divorce.  We have given the franchise to women.  (Cheers.)  Other parties have talked about it \u2013 we have done it, and we have done it freely and in the firm conviction that the enfranchisement of women, together with the enfranchisement of men, will lead to stability in the affairs of this country, to a deep and profound interest in all affairs, domestic and Imperial, and that politics will be all the keener and cleaner for the addition that has been made to the electorate.  (Cheers.)Helping AgricultureWe found agriculture enjoying a fifty per cent relief of the rates.  Three years ago we increased it to 75 per cent, and we included in the rating relief the farm buildings.  We are now legislating for total relief for that industry.  (Cheers.)  We have passed a Credits Act, a very remarkable piece of legislation, which I believe will be of immense value.  We have encouraged the growth and manufacture of sugar beet.  We have passed Acts for the grading and marketing of produce, just as we passed the Merchandise Marks Act for the industry of this country, which has been taken advantage of by an increasing number of industries.Mr. Churchill\u2019s RecordI do not think that at a meeting like this we ought to separate without acknowledging and paying tribute to the courage and versatility of the Chancellor of the Exchequer - (cheers) - who in spite of the unparalleled financial disasters of 1926 has succeeded in maintaining the credit of the country, in balancing his Budget and in making certain welcome reductions of taxation to large sections of the Community.  The Unemployment Insurance has been placed upon a sound financial basis, and the Minister of Health has passed Acts in Parliament to prevent wanton, extravagant, and profligate expenditure by local authorities.  (Cheers.)  We have passed the Trades Disputes Act.  (Cheers.)  I think we may say we have laid the ghost of the general strike.  We see in the country today a spirit of greater confidence, not only confidence in our own country, but what I have longed to see \u2013 confidence in ourselves and confidence in our old ability to weather the storms that may come upon us.UNEMPLOYMENT AND RATING REFORM A New Feeling of HopeWe have still, in spite of the fact that more are at work than four years ago, to face unemployment.  That, of course, has caused us great anxiety, and we are in process now of carrying out a great deal of very difficult and complicated legislation in rating and Poor Law reform, which we believe will be of the greatest assistance to industry in this country for generations to come.  (Cheers.)  But I would say to all my friends in the House of Commons that it will make demands upon your time, demands that may seem hard, but this legislation has got to be got through for the sake of the country, and I am perfectly certain that there will be no slackening in the efforts of anyone that this legislation shall be law before we go to the country.  I say no more about it here, because I understand you have been discussing it this afternoon, and you have had the advantage of hearing some observations upon it by a man who is a past master of his subject \u2013 Mr. Neville Chamberlain.  I will only say this.  Our party at its best, as it is today, has always been a party that puts the condition of the people first.  Disraeli did it and we do it - (cheers) - and the great appeal that this Poor Law reform makes to me is that I am convinced that when once put through it will offer us and offer my friend Mr. Chamberlain a fresh jumping-off point for a further campaign on behalf of the health of the people in every way in which the health services can assist them and provide for them.  Now we have got to remember with regard to unemployment that the most serious place where unemployment exists is in the coal mines, and we have got to remember that unemployment is very largely the result of that very rationalisation \u2013 to use one of those long words so popular in the present day \u2013 which has been urged upon the coal trade by everyone who has studied their problems, and by none more than the Socialist leaders.  But whereas it has always been urged upon them it has been left for this Government to try and meet the critical situation caused by the unemployment resulting; and we realise as the country realises that the only thing that can be done for the men in that trade out of work is to obtain work in other industries, whether it be in this country or overseas, because within reasonable time at least it seems improbable that they can get work again for their old employment of coal mining.  It is having that fact in view, that the Ministry of Labour now are working with intense energy to place these men in situations throughout the country.  It is too early yet to judge of the success their efforts will have.  I am hopeful at least that the beginnings of a move may be made from these derelict districts, and there need be at any rate a new feeling of hope in the breasts of the men who live in these districts when they see the helping hand at least is being held out to them.  Lord Lovat is at this moment in the Dominions studying with Ministers overseas what ways can be devised for quickening and for expediting overseas settlement, and we shall wait with eagerness the result of his labours, and I hope to be able to act upon them.SUCCESS OF SAFEGUARDINGDo Not Go Too Far in Front of Public OpinionAnd then I want to say a few words about another weapon in our armour, and that is the weapon of safeguarding.  (Loud cheers and a Voice:  \u2018Good old Stanley.\u2019)  There have been since the war meetings of economists from the different countries at Geneva doing what they can to induce the countries of Europe to remove, or at any rate to reduce, the barriers which interfere with trade between one country and another in the shape of tariffs.  I am all in favour of these meetings.  I would like to see all the barriers down - ( hear, hear) - but in the meantime when the barriers exist in other places, when employment is affected at home by longer hours, by cheaper labour, by questions of currency, what is the Liberal Party going to do to meet these cases, and what is the Labour Party going to do?  The Liberal Party say they will do nothing, so we know exactly where we stand.  They are going to take away existing safeguarding.  The Labour Party officially say they will do nothing.  There is much uneasiness in the rank and file.  Voices have been heard saying licences for imports are far more drastic than safeguarding and more dangerous in many ways.  I see one Labour member in South Wales is advocating safeguarding \u2013 (hear, hear) \u2013 and he says whatever party comes into power will safeguard.  Safeguarding was introduced by the Coalition Government and it has been the law of the land for seven years.  I think we all agree that the experimental stage is passing away.  (Loud cheers.)  There are few in this country who would contend that success has not been achieved by such experiments in safeguarding as have hitherto been made, and I know there have been many members of our party who feel that progress has been too slow.  Let me remind you of this.  It is not wise in a democracy to go too far in front of public opinion.  (Hear, hear.)  The British people are slow to make up their minds on a new question, but they are thinking and thinking hard.  This question of safeguarding is an industrial question, a question which should be judged on its merits, and on its merits alone, and I put my own position as your leader and the position of my colleagues as the Government very clearly in a letter to the Chief Whip just before the recess.PLEDGE REPEATEDNo Tax on FoodWe are agreed that there will be no tax on food. (Applause.)  I repeat the pledge which I have given that safeguarding will not be used as a side door or back door by which to introduce a general tariff until the question of a general tariff has been submitted to the country \u2013 a purely democratic proceeding, and in view of our record, in view of our treatment of this question, the country will trust us and take our word.  I say this, that no industry will be barred from making its case and proving it if it can before the appropriate tribunal.  (Applause.)  I would add one thing.  If we are returned to power we have no doubt the procedure needs simplifying and shortening.  The too protracted enquiries are bad for business.  I remember Sir Alfred Mond as he then was when he was an apostle of Free Trade once said business could flourish with tariffs, business could flourish without tariffs, but business could not flourish with uncertainty.THE COMING CAMPAIGNTribute to Party\u2019s LoyaltyI want to say one word about our organisation.  We have tributes from opponents.  They have recognised that our organisation is the best of the three parties.  That is not as high praise as I should like to give you.  (Laughter.)  I have had forty years experience of politics, most of it in the rank-and-file.  There is nothing I ask you to do that I have not done myself.  I have marked off polling cards, I have addressed envelopes - (laughter) - and I have shepherded the last batch of voters from the public house.  (Cheers and laughter.)  I gained my experience in an old borough, and there is nothing you can teach me.  I merely preface by saying this \u2013 that I believe our organisation is better than it has ever been at headquarters and in the country.  I should like to thank my friend Mr. Davidson for what he has done.  I want to say a word of congratulation to the women\u2019s organisations.  (Cheers.)  They are doing wonders, and do not ever let us forget the Junior Imperial League.  Let us pay a tribute to our literature department, which has never been so effective as it is today.  A most remarkable thing I have seen \u2013 one of our pamphlets directed against the Liberals lifted bodily into a Labour pamphlet.  And I have seen all parties asking for our literature on the Trades Disputes Bill to learn what it actually meant.  I said to Mr. Davidson today I thought it would be very valuable before the election if we could have some very good leaflets giving some extracts from Mr. Lloyd George\u2019s articles in the foreign Press, written in times of difficulty at home.  (Applause.)  That will be attended to.  Today I see a closer co-operation between the central office and the local organisations than I ever remember.  And I see unlimited enthusiasm and ability.  From today work, organise, educate.  This is the last time I shall address you before the General Election.  I want to pay a tribute here to my team in the Cabinet.  (Applause.)  Looking back over four years, no Prime Minister has ever had more loyal and consistent support than I have.  There is not one Minister who has not more than fulfilled the expectations, high as they were on my part, with which I embarked in office in 1924.  There are some who by their devotion to their labours have impaired their health.  They are wearing themselves out in your service.  We shall all do that sooner or later, but in our party we have an unlimited reservoir of youth waiting to take their places.  We are no party of reaction \u2013 we go forward in the pursuit of ordered progress.  Our first aim is peace at home and abroad and throughout the world, a peace in which we can improve the conditions of life, of health, of education for our own people.  I am proud to lead such a party with such a tradition.  I sprang from the rank-and-file and they have supported me through good times and through bad.  They stood by me after the election of 1923, when many stout hearts wavered.  They have stood by me since.  They have followed my strategy without asking too many questions.  They have trusted me.  (Cheers.)  Once more in the coming fight I ask you to continue my trust in that leadership.  I am convinced that if you will give me that same confidence that I have in you, once more we shall rout our foes, combined or separate, as we routed them four years ago, and continue again for a further period of ordered progress in the traditions of that greatest of our leaders whom we are all so proud to follow \u2013 Lord Beaconsfield.

aVWe have recently been through the fire, but our garments are not singed.  (Cheers)  There has been a certain amount of depression.  I do not understand it.  (Cheers)  I have met in my life with success and failure.  I treat those two impostors both the same.  (Cheers)  Let me remind you of some words that were uttered, when he was in Opposition, shortly before he won a glorious victory, by one of the greatest leaders we ever had \u2013 Benjamin Disraeli.  Speaking in Glasgow in 1873 he said: \u2018The reason that I have been able to lead a party for so long a period and under some circumstances of difficulty and discouragement is that the party which I lead is the most generous party which ever existed.\u2019  (Cheers)  \u2018I cannot help,\u2019 he added, \u2018smiling sometimes when I hear the constant intimations that are given by those who know all the secrets of the political world of the extreme anxiety of the Conservative Party to get rid of my services.  The fact is\u2019 \u2013 said Mr. Disraeli \u2013 not me (laughter) \u2013 \u2018the Conservative Party can get rid of my services whenever they give me the intimation that they so desire.\u2019Now, Sir, you have said truly that the last election was won largely by promises.  I have fought through many elections.  I have never known promises so wild as those which were uttered at the last election.  (Cheers)  And yet, though I do not doubt the good faith of many who made those promises, many must have known the insincerity of them.  It is like a firm in business drawing bills and the directors know those bills will never be met, though the clerks who enter them in the bill-book may have no doubt of the solidity of the firm to whom they give their service.  But at the end of three months or six months the fate of the bills is known, and in less than six months the fate of the promises made last May is known throughout the country.  I am not going to weary you with instances; but three or four I must mention to pin them down on your minds.Before the election electors read in the Labour speakers\u2019 handbook \u2013 and they heard the subject discussed from the platform ad nauseum \u2013 that at the end of December 1928, one insured worker out of eight was unemployed.  One and a half million unemployed at December 31 1928, have about 2,000,000 women and children dependent upon them and the nation.  For four years more than 1,000,000 workers have been deprived through no fault of their own of the opportunity of adding their quota to the nation\u2019s output of wealth.  In July the House of Commons \u2013 a very different place from the soap-box \u2013 the Lord Privy Seal, Mr. Thomas, said this: \u2018When we deduce from these figures [speaking of the live register] the fact that a million or more of our people are unemployed, that gives an entirely wrong picture of the situation to the outside.\u2019  And he went on to make the same explanation we made 50 times when we were in office.  It is a pity that the truth did not dawn on him in May.  (Cheers)  In May the same gentleman said: \u2018The Minister\u2019s statement that he uttered today was the half truth that there were more people employed today than when the Government took office.  To the ignorant person that seemed very plausible.\u2019  In October at Brighton he said: \u2018What are the cold facts about unemployment?  There are employed in industry today 800,000 more men than in the golden period of 1914.\u2019  In five months we have got away from hot air to cold facts (cheers), and before very long I can assure him the facts will be colder still.More QuotationsAt the end of April Mr. Clynes said: \u2018The Conservative Government have robbed men of their savings by administrative persecution which has made it impossible for men to remain on the list.\u2019  An honourable man, Mr. Clynes, never given to extreme statement; but imagine what that statement was when translated into the language of the street corner.  But in July, within three months, the Minister of Labour said in the House of Commons: \u2018I merely wish to say to the Committee that no one has ever heard me say on either side of the House that I believed that there was any body of persecution in the sense that has been stated today.\u2019  Mr. Clynes once more, on the subject of transference, which we debated in the last Parliament.  In the House of Commons in April he said: \u2018About one in every 200 out of work has a chance of transference, not a chance of a job without putting somebody else out, but a chance of taking a job which clearly somebody would like to have in that particular district.  That is not a solution of the problem.  It is part of the proved desperation of the Government.  It is a wholly ineffective plan, and one which involves the men concerned in a good deal of personal inconvenience and personal suffering which ought not to be imposed upon them.\u2019  And a member of the rank and file in the Socialist Party on the same day said: \u2018The transference scheme is all moonshine.  It is mockery to try to deal with a problem involving 1,200,000 men by such a scheme.\u2019  In July in the House of Commons the Minister of Labour said: \u2018As was pointed out by the Lord Privy Seal on July 3, there is in certain areas a surplus working population who ought to be helped to find work elsewhere.  The Government therefore propose to continue and to extend the transference scheme.\u2019And one more, though these quotations are endless.  In \u2018Labour and the Nation\u2019 before the General Election we read: \u2018The disastrous act by which the Tory Government added an hour to the working day of the miners must be at once repealed.\u2019  We know now that nothing of the kind is going to be done.  Mr. Snowden at Leicester within the last month said that the Labour Government was pledged to restore the seven-hour day and that promise would be redeemed, but again he warned them that they must face facts.  An immediate return to the seven-hour day would inflict grievous disaster on the industry, pits would close, and miners would be thrown out of work.  Five months after the election the Government are facing facts.  (Cheers)  I must just finish this story, before I pass on, with one piece of comic relief.  In the last debate we had on unemployment when I was Prime Minister, Mr. George Lansbury shook his fist in our faces and called us murderers.  He has made no contribution to unemployment so far, except to talk about mixed bathing and the kiddies in the park.  (Laughter)With such a heritage from the General Election the Government carried into office the seeds of their own dissolution.  They may travel and tread in our footsteps, they may follow the trail that we have blazed, but that will not save them.  The task of Sisyphus was a child\u2019s task to what now lies before them.  You are already privileged to see with regard to widows\u2019 pensions, with regard to unemployment insurance, with regard to coal, that their actions on the one hand fall far short of the promises made to the electorate, and yet they go far enough to raise greater discontent in the country and to throw intolerable new burdens on an industry that was slowly recovering from the slough of despond, and they will get the worst of both worlds.  At first it was roses, roses all the way, but, as I know well, \u2018Woe to you when all men speak well of you.\u2019  Flattery by the Press is giddy wine to those who are not accustomed to it, and who have had no experience of it, and, today, the glamour is wearing off.  The Government stock is falling, and business confidence is falling.  Is nothing rising to compensate?  Yes, unemployment, the expenditure of the country, and before long you will infallibly see the cost of living rising.A curious political economy dictates their movements.  The Minister of Health, Mr. Greenwood, has said, \u2018Whether a nation can afford a thing or not depends upon how much it wants it.\u2019  That is the new political economy.  Mr. Greenwood is an expert in political economy.  He is a trained political economist.  He has been a don teaching political economy at a university.  An old friend of mine, a classical don, made this observation about dons in general, but principally dons who specialise in political economy.  He said: \u2018A don is a fellow with a great capacity for accumulating knowledge, but he is usually without any capacity for drawing the right conclusion from it.\u2019  We shall watch the pursuit of the new political economy, which is neither Adam Smith nor Mill nor List, in its further researches.Peace in the EmpireBy their speeches the Government arrogate to themselves a monopoly in the championship of world peace.  The pursuit of peace is no monopoly of any party.  Our Government did a great deal for the peace of the world.  (Cheers)  No one did more for the League of Nations than the late Foreign Secretary, who never received his due either from the League of Nations in this country or from the electorate, because his statesmanship was learned in an older generation before statesmen had acquired the art of publicity or could get over the platform what Theodore Roosevelt used to call \u2018mush.\u2019  When this Government talk so much of their purpose I remember that in the days of the War a large number of those who were for peace at any price were members of the party, when we stood for peace with honour.  (Cheers)  Today we stand for peace with security.  We are all in favour of disarmament, but disarmament on our part irrespective of what foreign nations may do does not truly serve the cause of peace.  (Cheers)  We must be able to guarantee peace in our Empire.  Our Empire, free from the spirit of aggression, united, solid, and able to keep the peace within its own boundaries, one-fourth of the earth and one-fourth of her population \u2013 an Empire like that is the principal pillar of peace in the world.  (Cheers)  But if she be not able to guarantee peace within her borders she is a source of peril to the whole world, and our influence in the world is gone if we once betray the principle of peace with security.Heavier Taxation AheadNow I would like to say a word on that subject which has caused so much anxiety for many years to many Governments, the subject of unemployment, which loomed largely at the last election, and, by the promises given on that subject, contributed in no mean measure to our defeat.  Let us bear in mind certain fundamental facts:What have this Government done to meet this situation?  They are giving larger doles.  They will give us in the next Budget heavier taxation to pay for those doles.  That taxation must be personal, because they dare not touch tariffs.  Therefore, it will weigh directly \u2013 even in accordance with the newest economic teaching, I imagine \u2013 directly on the industries of the country.  There will, therefore, be increased burdens on industry.  They will reduce by taxation the amount of capital available for industry.  They are creating uncertainty, because no one knows what they will do with regard to Imperial Preference or the McKenna Duties.  And they are weakening and will weaken that spirit of self-reliance which is essential for the prosperity of the country.  (Cheers)  That is their contribution to unemployment.Trade in the New WorldWe recognise that our duty is to preserve and secure markets.  Well, now, where?  Where?  In Europe there is a shrinkage of our trade.  Europe consists of more nations than existed before the War, hedged in by more tariffs.  Our percentage of trade with Europe \u2013 our exports \u2013 is less than before the War.  The great market of the United States is more and more hedged in by tariffs as the years go by.  The only expanding markets in the world, the only markets in whose expansion we may take part without fighting to rob someone else of their share, lie in the Empire, and the Empire in the New World.  (Cheers)  You have today at your great conference passed a resolution on that subject.  (Cheers)  On behalf of my colleagues and myself I accept that resolution.  (Loud cheers, and \u2018Good old Stanley\u2019)The new world, when it came into being, acted as the force of gravity on the old, and it dragged new world empires in its train.  More than three centuries ago \u2013 more than four centuries ago \u2013 when Henry VII was building his Chapel at Westminster, Columbus of Spain and Vasco da Gama of Portugal sought the new world across the seas, and at that moment, although we knew it not, our destiny was conceived in the womb of time.  Slowly our seamen were pushing their way into Arctic seas, our sailors were raiding Spanish settlements, and in that struggle they learnt their seamanship, and they brought to that seamanship the courage and audacity of their race.  England had been but a few centuries, as history goes, the home of those who had pushed their way from Scandinavia and the Teutonic forests, and once more they felt the urge of the South Seas to the new world open to them.  The urge was upon them again, the call came upon them once more.  Our apprenticeship of the sea concluded with the Armada, and at that time unconsciously the soul of the nation turned aside from Europe and cast out to sea.Another century, and Greater Britain came into being and met with Englishmen living on the other side of the Atlantic, while in England, under Cromwell and Blake, a name that should never be forgotten, the British Navy first came into the world.  It was at that time that the great German historian said: \u2018At this moment England awoke more clearly than ever before to the consciousness of the advantages of her geographical position, and the fact that a maritime vocation was that to which she was called by Nature herself.  Until then the seas had meant the narrow seas, the Straits, and the Mediterranean; then they were the seas that rolled round the world.  When modern history begins, the Atlantic, the Pacific, the Mexican Gulf henceforth were to be the boundaries of the stage on which the great world drama was to be played.\u2019  And from the time of the Commonwealth the new world was always for us the countries latent.  A new race of men had appeared in England, not the bowmen of Crecy and Poictiers, but men whose lives were spent tossing in their tiny ships on waters which to their fathers had been trackless wastes.  The new world was the outlet for our people and for our trade.  When the religious war began to fail \u2013 and the dynastic war only continued insofar as it affected the greater question \u2013 and from the struggles with Spain, with Holland, through all the French wars of the 18th century, by whatever name they be called, it was on the bloody plains of Flanders, and on the shores of the Danube, no less than on the seas that the freedom of the new world was won for the English-speaking people.  And no man saw it more clearly than Napoleon.  (Cheers)At the CrossroadsThree centuries of dreams and events, of great strivings and intermittent lethargy, of union and schism, and we stand once more at the crossroads.  This is an age of great combinations.  The United States was welded even in the lifetime of the older ones among us by the arbitrament of war.  People talk in Europe today of a United States of Europe.  Our progress depends on our capacity to visualise the Empire, the Dominions and Colonies alike, as one eternal and indestructible unit \u2013 (cheers) \u2013 for production, for consumption, for distribution, for the maintenance and improvement of the lot of those who under Providence are dwellers within the confines of our Commonwealth.  I think we owe a word of gratitude to one \u2013 not always a supporter of our party \u2013 Lord Beaverbrook \u2013 for bringing before the country, for bringing once more before the country that idea of which we have heard too little in recent years, of a united Empire, and I pay tribute to his courage \u2013 rare in one of his profession \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 in bringing a subject in which he believes up for criticism in its proper place, the House of Parliament.  I pay tribute also to the businessmen of this country who have recently issued a manifesto which \u2013 whether I agree with it or not at the moment is immaterial \u2013 yet again brings before the people another aspect of this many-sided question, the unity of our great Empire.  There lies our problem.  It is the task of a generation to solve.  In it rests the question of the employment of our people and the continuation of the beneficent existence itself of our Empire.A Task for the YoungTo that task we must lay our hands, and to that task must our policy be framed.  (Cheers)  We cannot now dictate a policy to the Empire.  Much consultation will be necessary to help the employment of our own people, to rationalise not only our home but Imperial industry.  The framing of such a policy as will effect those ends is the task of your leaders to which they will forthwith devote themselves, and in the framing of such a policy it is essential that they should take into council the youth of the party, because a generation may be needed to effect that unity of which we dream.  The burden of the fight may well lie on the shoulders of the young.  Those of us who have borne the burden and the heat of the day cannot look forward many years.  It would be unfair to bind our younger colleagues and associates with a policy with which they were not in heartfelt agreement, but I have no doubt that complete unanimity and complete sympathy may be achieved between all sections and in all ages of our great party.  (Cheers)  I myself \u2013 I believe that close co-operation throughout our Empire is possible, for such co-operation will be of great benefit to all parts of that Empire.  I believe that as we slowly recover from the exhaustion of war the old spirit of adventure, of sturdy reliance, will again animate our people, and I believe that the growth of the well-being of our race is and will be the greatest influence making both for the peace and for the progress of this world.  (Cheers)

aVMr. Baldwin thanked Blackpool for the great welcome they had given to what he described as \u2018the great party which forms the national bulwark today.\u2019As he had not met them for two years he wanted to say a word or two about last year\u2019s election \u2013 to thank all those who had controlled the organisation for the wonderful victory which followed that election.To switch over, as in a night, from party warfare, party programme, party propaganda to the support of the National Government, was a great achievement, and an achievement no less of the organising skill of those who accomplished it than it was of the patriotism of the rank and the file.\u2018I should also like to acknowledge the patriotic devotion of those candidates up and down the country who stood down in order to give us a clear solidarity of front which was essential,\u2019 continued Mr. Baldwin.\u2018Let us not forget the spirit of the party in the House of Commons also, where many men have had to forego that legitimate and just ambition that they might have cherished, and for which they might have worked, to take their part in the government of the country.National Strength\u2018It is essential in any form of coalition \u2013 and the National Government is a coalition \u2013 it is essential that broad representation should be given to all parties, and such representation cannot be calculated by counting heads.\u2018The spirit of most of those ambitions for the time being have been disappointed was beyond all praise, and has borne its part in cementing the National party, and in helping that unity which has stood like a wall in the country for the last twelve months and stands as strong today after what has happened in the last fortnight .\u2018What have we learned in the post-war years about parliamentary government? We have watched it at home and in most of the countries of the world. The maintenance of a strong and stable executive is essential for the peaceful and progressive government of democracy, and it is the absence of that power of a strong stable executive which has been at the root of the breakdown of the parliamentary system in so many countries \u2013 in India, Germany, China and many more.\u2018The formation of a national government ensures that form of executive, because by suspending the ordinary party fighting we have suspended the very element which is apt to sap the strength of democracy.Work to be Done\u2018We have had a lot of unpleasant work to do, and we shall probably have a great deal more.This crisis is not over.  The sky is clear, but the centre of the storm has merely shifted.  The storm itself is still ominous.  That popularity which launched the National Government is waning in many quarters because men have not that whole calculated strength, courage and perseverance to stick it.Some of the omens today are more favourable, but there is much to cause us grave anxiety, and that is the moment at which three out of eight Cabinet Ministers, who do not belong to our party, thought fit to resign their responsibilities of Government.\u2018I propose to indulge in no acrimonious censure, but I may be allowed to express the difficulty I find in following their reasoning,\u2019 continued Mr. Baldwin.  \u2018It may be that I have not a subtle mind.  As a matter of fact, there is no more difficult question than to know when you render greater service to your country by resignation or by sticking to your job.\u2018My simple and direct mind tells me that, having undertaken to stick to the Prime Minister and the National Government until the sky was clear, I am going to stick to it.\u2018Obsolescent Doctrine\u2019 \u2018With these Liberals it was a certain logical loyalty to an obsolescent doctrine that compelled them to resign.  Free Trade in the days of the expanding markets of long ago may have been a beneficent dispensation.  In our time, it consisted merely of the beggarly elements of the late dispensation, and it was the late Lord Rosebery who said that the commonest error in politics was the sticking to the carcase of dead policies.\u2018I think that is the affliction from which my Liberal friends suffer.  We are not doctrinaires.  We admitted Protection not as a principle but as an expedient.  We knew the dangers as we knew the dangers of the Free Trade. We have never worshipped it.  We know what can be done in the way of log rolling in the way of excessive protection: we know what can be done in the way of corruption. \u2018With our eyes open we took every step to safeguard that policy from what we know to be the dangers associated with it.  If it fails, I do not see our party sticking to the carcase of dead policies.\u2018I do wish that narrow pedantic school would give up once and for all worshipping Free Trade as a principle, both immaculate and immutable, for no economic doctrine is, either can be, or will be.Without Fair Trial\u2018It seems to me that they have exaggerated and isolated one issue alone out of a score of issues without waiting, without giving it a fair trial.By next election that policy will be dead, and in my view I do not believe the country is interested in it one iota.  It has only one desire, and that is to see the Government get on with their job.\u2018As leader of this great party,\u2019 continued Mr. Baldwin, \u2018I cannot take in silence the charge that we have been enforcing our party policy on the Government.  The Prime Minister in his manifesto a year ago stated \u2018It is impossible to see in the changed conditions of today what may arise.  No one can set out a programme in detail on which specific pledges can be given.  The Government must, therefore be free to consider every proposal likely to help, such as tariffs, the expansion of exports and contraction of imports, commercial treaties and mutual economic arrangements with the Dominions.\u2019\u2018Those things are not today, and have not been since the election, party policies.  They were among the things for which the Prime Minister and I asked for a free hand and we got it.  (Cheers.) Ottawa Conference\u2018We have been charged with imperilling the Imperial future of the Commonwealth of Nations as a result of the Ottawa Conference.  What was the Ottawa Conference?  It was a conference called by the Canadian Prime Minister to continue the work of the Conference held during the lifetime of the late Socialist Government. \u2018What were we to do?  Refuse to attend or attend and refuse to make any agreement?  We are told that we have made a bad bargain and have given more than we have got.\u2018We have been told that we have acted unconstitutionally,\u2019 he continued, \u2018and that Parliament will act unconstitutionally if it passed these agreements, because in the Canadian agreement in certain articles, and certain articles only, we undertook to make no alteration without the permission of the Canadian Government.\u2018I am supposed to have made some observations on the position of Parliament, which my conduct at Ottawa has negatived.  Our Parliament, in the nature of things, negotiates itself.  It can only ratify or reject agreements already made, and it is familiar and fundamental constitutional law that one parliament cannot fetter or diminish the powers of a future parliament.  I have always maintained that is true today.\u2019Precedents QuotedMr. Baldwin recalled various legislative Acts in the last century or so.  There was a famous Act passed in 1778 called the Taxation of Colonies Act, which provided that from and after the starting of the Act the King and Parliament of Great Britain would not impose any duties, taxes, or assessments whatever on any of His Majesty\u2019s colonies, provinces, and plantations.\u2018Now we know it was exceedingly impossible that that Statute would ever be repealed.  The Act was, in itself, the character of a policy, the policy of the Executive at the time, and which was acceptable to Parliament for the time being.\u2018I suppose the late Home Secretary will say that Act was unconstitutional, or he may say that was in the nature of a unilateral settlement.  (Laughter.)\u2018Let me remind you of the union with Ireland.  The chief article of that treaty provided for the establishment of the Church of England and Ireland to be deemed as an essential fundamental part of the union.\u2018That bound Parliament, according to the late Home Secretary, and as a matter of fact it did for more than 60 years, but it is a fact that in 1869 Parliament, by the Irish surtax, ended what the earlier Parliament had tried to make binding.\u2018The position is in entire agreement with all I have ever said on the subject.  The Government of the day - whatever the Government is - the Government may be wise, or may not, in anticipating that Parliament will ratify any agreement it may come to, that it will not affect the propriety of making such an agreement, and there is no necessity to safeguard the rights of Parliament. Parliament is completely master of the situation.  Its rights are in no danger and no question.  That is the constitutional position, and there is nothing we have done, or are asking Parliament to do, which will conflict with the historical practice of our country.\u2018There are one or two similar things which have been done,\u2019 continued Mr. Baldwin.  \u2018May I remind you that there is still a treaty in existence made many years ago with Greece in which we are bound to refrain from taxing currants at more than two shillings.  It is constitutional to refrain from taxing goods in the interest of the foreigner, and unconstitutional to tax them in the interests of our own people.  (Cheers.)\u2018I remember myself, in 1911, a Liberal Government in office, of which Sir Herbert Samuel was a member, made a treaty with Japan, not for five years, but for ten years \u2013 a treaty which might have involved this country in war.\u2018Was that binding on future Parliaments?  Is that constitutional or unconstitutional?  It is very difficult for simple people to follow the logic of our opponents.Tribute to Delegates\u2018Of course the Ottawa agreements might have ruined our friends and sounded their death knell.For myself, I regret nothing that took place at Ottawa.  I rejoice to think that we have accomplished far more than I hoped or anticipated when we left these shores.\u2018I would like, as leader of that delegation, to pay a tribute to the members of the delegation.  I single no one out.  Everyone, without exception, contributed his share, and did all he could to help in the success of that Conference, and to bind together that band of brothers which we became during our labours.\u2018I have no doubt that in his admirable speech yesterday Mr. Chamberlain told you I had asked him to sign the Canadian agreements, but he could not tell you with what pleasure all his colleagues and the representatives of the Dominions saw the signature of the son of Mr. Joseph Chamberlain put to one of the most important trade agreements that has ever been signed on behalf of the United Kingdom.  (Cheers.)\u2018We have been told that tariffs have increased unemployment in this country.  Unemployment must cause us all the greatest anxiety.  For a year we have been striving hard, and the last figures are slightly in excess of what they were twelve months ago.  We know full well the hardships, the difficulties of the administration of the Means Test.Means Test\u2018There are few people outside the violent partisans in the Socialist party who would say that a means test is wrong in itself.  It is right, but it will be the care of the Government to examine carefully these matters in the coming winter, to ensure equal treatment and as fair administration as can be given on this most difficult subject throughout the country.\u2019Mr. Baldwin made an appeal to all the delegates to interest themselves in this problem, and not to approach it merely as a cold economic problem but as a human, vital problem, dealing with the homes of the people of this country.\u2018If you do that,\u2019 he said, \u2018you will be playing your part as good citizens and, as I believe, as good Tories too.\u2019\u2018How can we say now that tariffs have been the cause of unemployment \u2013 of the increase of unemployment which came in the summer?  It was because of the contracts which have been made \u2013 because of the world depression.\u2018It will be a year before we can judge fairly what the effect of tariffs has been.  I wanted to examine this question myself, and took some pains to get at the right figures.  I can show in a moment what the world decline has been in recent months and how we have held our own.Figures QuotedIt disposes once and for all, and for ever, of the argument that the duties which came on in March were the cause of the increase in unemployment in May and June.\u2018Take the figures of July, five months after tariffs, and compare them with February, the month before tariffs came in,\u2019 continued Mr. Baldwin.  \u2018Among our principle competitors, the German exports declined 18 per cent, French exports 19 per cent, Italian 26 per cent, United States of America 29 per cent, and the British 2½ per cent.  (Cheers.)\u2018What have we been trying to do?  We have been trying to get the foreign tariffs reduced.  They have gone up in every country in the world, including our own Dominions, until in many cases they have been prohibitive.  So long as we had an open market in the world, not a single country in the world would pay the slightest attention to us.\u2018The electors gave us a free hand, and the National Government decided to tackle the problem in a new way.  That weapon helped us to balance the Budget.  It helped us to get the Dominions tariff laws altered, helped us to get an agreement on the principle of competitive competition in the Dominions, and brought the representatives of many foreign nations to discuss with us what agreements they could make with us, and we are going to make them.\u2018I hope that no one will begrudge their praise of the courage of those who have stuck to the Government.  We have not had to have the bitter experience which they had.  We have not had to break up old friendships, old alliances.  We have not had to cut ourselves off from the party organisation and the caucus, with all its strength and with all its power.It takes real courage to do that, and I want to acknowledge here, in this testing time, the courage of those, whether they belong to the Liberal party or Labour party, who have stuck to the Prime Minister \u2013 Mr. Thomas, who was a tower of strength of Ottawa, Sir John Simon, and Mr. Runciman.\u2018The situation reminds me very much of that which I remember so vividly when I was a boy at the time of the defeat of Mr. Gladstone\u2019s Home Rule and the Liberal Unionist party under Mr. Chamberlain,\u2019 continued Mr. Baldwin.\u2018I remember how we came forward and supported them in the constituencies when they were cut off from their own party.  We worked for them.  We did not oppose them, and in a few years, looking back, there was not a member of the Tory party who did not rejoice at that infusion of fresh blood and fresh strength.\u2019I assure you that none of those who support the Ottawa Bill right through must suffer from it at the election.  We must see that they are not opposed, but that they are supported.  They must not be thrown to the wolves for having played a patriotic part.  (Loud cheers.)Present Conditions\u2018The conditions today are not without anxiety.  The general financial position has improved beyond all belief.  We enjoy once more cheap money.  We have effected a wonderful conversion, and we no longer suffer any anxiety about our currency.\u2018The industrial position is less satisfactory, but there are signs of hope.  There are very few groups of large industries today that are yet in a better position, but there is a more hopeful tone generally.  I rejoice to think that of the large industries, in which there is a more hopeful tone, we may take the great textile industries of cotton, wool and silk.  (Loud cheers.)\u2018We have statistical proof that things are better.  In the first eight months of this year the increase in the importation of raw cotton \u2013 which is the most reliable barometer of the cotton trade \u2013 the increase over last year has been 24 per cent.In the woollen trade the goods dealt with by the Bradford Conditioning House have increased in the same period by 18 per cent, and the importation of raw silk by 40 per cent.\u2018In the cotton trade there has also been an increase in the export of cotton piece goods of 30 per cent, and it is very satisfactory to find that in the China market the export from this country has more than doubled in that period.  In the Indian market it has increased by 36 per cent.  (Cheers.)\u2018Then we find here is a continuing tendency for foreigners to set up factories in this country,\u2019 continued Mr. Baldwin.  \u2018That shows confidence in our future and recognition of the competitive position of our country.\u2018World commodity prices are rising \u2013 the first movement of the kind we have had for some time \u2013 and that is a good sign so far as it goes.  Industries of all kinds, which have been suffering in the past from the competition of foreign goods, in many cases sold in the country at uneconomic productive prices \u2013 they are feeling the benefits from the tariffs.\u2018I do not put it any higher than that at this moment.  But there is evidence that that is the case, and that so far the great experiment upon which we have embarked is beginning to justify itself.\u2018And now it is up to the people of this country \u2013 the manufacturers and the businessmen \u2013 to take advantage of the opportunities in this new environment which the Government has provided for them.\u2018Governments cannot do everything.  We have made a series of helping agreements at Ottawa, but these agreements will be of no use unless the businessmen of this country have the courage and the initiative to take advantage of the opportunities offered by them.  It is up to them. European Problems\u2018Internationally the outlook is not bright.  The clouds are dark and our efforts, which have been unceasingly made by Government after Government to bring together the peoples of Europe, at the moment seem to be frustrated. There is a drifting apart in quarters where we should do all we can to bring friendship and understanding.  We are coming to the parting of the ways in Europe.\u2018There is no task more difficult and more responsible than that of the Foreign Secretary.  Many people at home and abroad are not doing their utmost to make it easier.  The Foreign Secretary, in all he is doing, has the firm and united support of the Prime Minister and Government behind him.  (Cheers.)Our part, as a Tory party, lies clear before us in the short time it is possible to look ahead in political life.  We must carry on our share in the letter and the spirit of the National Government.  Our aims must be national, and not party; our ideals must be national, and not party.\u2018There will be in the constituencies for some time, until Free Trade is dead, a certain amount of party fighting with a certain number of the Liberal party,\u2019 continued Mr. Baldwin.Fighting Socialism\u2018It may cause difficulties.  We can meet them and we can surmount them.  But what we have to fight and what you have to face in every constituency, fighting as Tories and as members of the National Government, is that crude rank Socialism which has now swept the Socialist Party Congress in the absence of those steady heads which left them a year ago.\u2018In normal times no one would listen, but in times of distress there are many people who will turn to any kind of teaching, and you have got to see that that teaching does not go down.  You should see that people are not allowed to forget that the very apostles of this gospel are the men who brought the country to the verge of ruin.\u2018The men who are good enough to run the banks for you are the men who very nearly burst the banks.  The men who say that they can cure unemployment are the men who have said it for years, and have never done anything except increase unemployment.\u2018You have to beat them in the constituencies.  The next election cannot be for some years yet.  It is a waste of time yet wondering how to approach the country \u2013 wondering what the policies will be, or what will be the new line-up of parties.  I am content to wait, to do my duty at the moment.\u2018I am sure of this,\u2019 concluded Mr. Baldwin, \u2018that if we go on as a party as we have done \u2013 perhaps to do better \u2013 if we back the National Government for all we are worth, if we preach the National Government in the constituencies, if we explain the work it is doing, the problems it has to face, and how it is trying to overcome them, then I think the loyalty we shall have shown, both in the letter and in the spirit to the principles of National Government at this time will in years to come make not the least glorious page in the history of our party, and be not the least title of the Tory party to the gratitude of the British people.\u2019  (Loud cheers.)

aVMr. Baldwin, who was received with cheers, said another year had spent its course, and he had to congratulate them on having once more come through the great annual conference of the Party successfully, and in pretty good temper.  Once more they had discussed a number of subjects.  They had brought knowledge and skill to the elucidation of difficult questions, and he and those who were counted among the leaders of the Party were grateful to them for the clear manner in which they showed them of what they were thinking and where they would like them to go.He thought in many ways their conduct of business and the way in which they applied themselves to practical politics compared not unfavourably with what had taken place at the Socialist conference in the South of England.  (Laughter)  He had not yet been able to acquaint himself with all that passed that afternoon in their discussions on agriculture, but, without having done so, he would hazard a guess that in that great hall all who had heard him would feel that the Minister of Agriculture was the right man in the right place - (applause) - that for knowledge of his subject, sympathy with those for whom he had to work, rapidity of action when necessary, he would be hard to beat.Their other topics he had followed with much interest, but it might be that before he had finished they would consider he had dealt with the root of the problem which they discussed on the previous morning in a manner that he hoped would not be out of sympathy with their views.The Financial RecoveryAs usual, he had to cover a great deal of ground.  He had to indicate to them what, in his view, were the problems immediately facing the government of the country, and possibly to point out things which might have escaped their notice, but must be borne in mind and weighed in forming a judgment as to the line the Government should take on them.  If he omitted any subject of particular interest to any individual present, he hoped that he or she would remember that, after all, that was but one speech, that he would have many other opportunities of addressing audiences in the country, and not run away with the impression that because he did not refer to a subject or deal with it at any length, that subject was not of any importance, or one which he did not value or recognise.He wanted first of all, Mr. Baldwin continued, to say a word or two on the financial position of the country.  Of all the things which this Administration was put into the power to do, the first thing, the most clamant, the most urgent, the most necessary, was the restoration of the credit of the country. \u2018I claim without fear of contradiction,\u2019 said Mr. Baldwin, \u2018that now, at the expiration of two years, that task has been performed with a courage and skill that merits the gratitude of the country.\u2019  (Applause)Britain\u2019s CreditHe was saying this with less reserve because he was only an ordinary Minister in the Government and they had the Chancellor of the Exchequer there.  The credit of the country was his especial responsibility; and as would be admitted by his colleagues, by the House of Commons and by the country, he had established a revolution.\u2018Two years ago,\u2019 Mr. Baldwin reminded his audience, \u2018our credit had nearly gone. Today, in a world of much less wealth than that before the war, our credit stands high and as unassailable as it ever has done.  But here I would remind you that, with that task before us, everything had to make way for it.  Great Britain without credit is like Samson without his locks.  It was our credit that was the greatest asset to us and to our Allies during the long term of the war; and if you feel anxiety \u2013 and anxiety is not foreign to our breasts \u2013 as to our position with armaments, remember the balance of risks that had to be run.  We felt that at the time the financial risks were so grave, so serious for our country, that until we were in a position where we could feel that these risks no longer existed, everything must give way and must wait.  That has been the situation.A Long Way to Go\u2018Greatly as the financial situation has improved, it is bringing in its train what touches more nearly the homes of our people, and that is a trade and an industrial improvement.  I am never given, I hope, to words of extravagance.  I have spoken candidly in the past two years but with reserve \u2013 so much so, indeed, that if I ever say things might be worse those who indulge in the cult of headlines call me an optimist.  But I do say deliberately today that the trade of the country is better, it is much better, than twelve months ago, and I will add this \u2013 it is better than the trade in any other industrial country in the world today.\u2018That does not mean that it is all right yet.  We have a long way to go, but we are moving forward with hope, and knowing that our heads are in the right direction.\u2019European FearsHe wanted them to bear in mind that this was a country depending largely on export trade, and some time there would come a saturation point, a point when we had advanced in the direction of prosperity as far as we cold advance on our own without world improvement.\u2018And I want to say a very serious word or two on that question.  World conditions are not good.  They are affected largely by economic conditions, but there is a psychological cause over and above the economic \u2013 an absence of confidence.  I particularly want to put this to you because, living in this island, we do not always realise the psychology of foreign nations.  That want of confidence is largely the child of fear, and fear on the continent of Europe is the fear of war.  We have smiled at that, and felt that now this nation and now this suffering from undue apprehension.  It may be; it may not be; but you have the fact to recognise, and that is one reason \u2013 if, indeed, there were no other - why it is imperative, if it can be done, to bring about a disarmament convention.A Real Limitation\u2018I know there are many sections in our party who think lightly of these matters.  But I want them to think them out.  First of all, let me say this: When I spoke about disarmament convention I did not mean disarmament on the part of this country and not on the part of any other.  I mean a limitation of armaments, a real limitation, such a one that if we, by the many gestures we have made of disarmament, find ourselves on some lower rating than the figures in such a convention, and some other country has higher figures, that country has to come down and we go up until we meet.  (Applause)  No other form of convention would be negotiated by the Government; no other form of convention is in contemplation.  But even to get that may be difficult, and if it be attained, in my view \u2013 and I am sure you will agree with me \u2013 it will be of vital importance to see that every signatory to that convention carries out what is in that convention in the letter and in the spirit.Sanctity of Agreements\u2018I would only add this: If that convention be signed, the nation that breaks it will have no friend in this civilised world.  The same is true of any nation which deliberately prevents such an agreement being reached by putting forward demands which might be acceptable after a time, but which would not be accepted today to the other co-signatories. But \u2013 and really I apologise even for alluding to this \u2013 there is a fear in the world that our country has less regard than she had for the sanctity of agreements entered into since the war which might contribute to the peace of Europe.  I say this, and I take the Treaty of Locarno as the most typical one, that Great Britain has signed she will adhere to.  (Hear, hear)  She adhered to her signature in regard to Belgium; her signature in these agreements is sacred.\u2019  (Applause)The Penalty of FailureHe wished to say a word as to the possible failure of a Disarmament Convention.  Governments had to contemplate success or failure.  There were many people who believed quite sincerely that it would not make much difference to the world.  \u2018Well,\u2019 added Mr. Baldwin, \u2018it would make this difference: the fears of which I spoke in the event of failure to agree might well become panic in some countries, and if there were no prospect of the limitation of armaments there is no country but would put to itself the question, \u201cAre we secure with our present armaments?\u201d  And I think myself, with my knowledge of the world and of world politics, that the answer to that question today in many countries would be \u201cNo, we are not safe.\u201d\u2019\u2018I see that problem drawing nearer and nearer to us until it grips us by the throat, that problem of rearmament and all that it involves.  If rearmament began in Europe you may say \u201cgoodbye\u201d to any restoration of cuts and to any reduction of taxation for a generation.\u2019It was just as well to face these things, and realise what it was they were up against.  With many nations, or with some nations, the expenditure that would be involved in increasing armaments would bring them much nearer to financial catastrophe; it might even bankrupt some, and they might imagine from that what the effect would be on the trade of the world.  Psychologically they would be back in 1914, with more knowledge than they had then.\u2018I have never disguised my own view,\u2019 added Mr. Baldwin, \u2018that another war in Europe would be the end of the civilisation we know.  Few can be so careless, so ignorant as not to have noticed how the very foundation of our mid-European and Western-European civilisation have rocked in these last fifteen years.  They cannot stand a second explosion akin to the one that wrought such damage at that time.\u2019They could not wonder, said Mr. Baldwin, at the anxiety with which the government was endeavouring, in every way it could, to ensure some agreement with regard to the limitation of arms.  (Applause)There were many people who said: \u2018Well, cut away from Europe; cut out from Europe.\u2019  It always struck him that before the intention of the internal combustion engine that might have been an arguable proposition.  Today he thought it was both crude and childish.  Traffic in the air was only beginning. The air linked them to the Continent in a manner that would not have been thought of by their parents, but very often those who expressed their desire said at the same time: \u2018Let us devote our minds to our empire.\u2019\u2018That,\u2019 said Mr. Baldwin, amid cheers, \u2018we have been doing, and not without success.\u2019  He had much else to speak of that night, and he hoped to speak on those subjects later in the year but he would like to say in Birmingham that when he came back from Ottawa he told his friends it would be twelve months before they saw the results of their work.  He thought they were seeing the results, and not only the material results, which they had seen particularly in the increase in their Indian trade, but they had seen in the recent Budget in Australia a most welcome token of how the spirit of Ottawa, without which nothing could be done, was working in the financial policy of that great Dominion.The Fruits of OttawaRecalling what was done at Ottawa, Mr. Baldwin said the influence of statesmanship would be found in the decisions there, and as we went on decade after decade, generation after generation, drawing more closely together in our trade, in our methods, he hoped and believed that some would be able to look back to the work that was done at Ottawa and say that, although at the moment there was not much done that struck the imagination, yet the foundations that were laid there firmly, securely and well.  (Applause)There had been criticism of agreements that had been made by the Government with foreign nations.  \u2018You never hear criticism from the seller who is satisfied,\u2019 said Mr. Baldwin amidst cheers.  Many had benefited by these agreements, but it was true that in many agreements they made under the tariff system, they had to give something away to get something; and in giving something away somebody was a little less well off than he was before, but a great deal better off than he was two years ago before we had a tariff.  When they looked into one of the last of such agreements \u2013 that with the Argentine \u2013 they would feel that something substantial had been won by the process of bargaining.Conservative PrinciplesAt such a meeting, where they were all of one way thought \u2013 with minor differences \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 he would say a few words on a subject to which he had given a good deal of attention. He sometimes heard it said: \u2018Let us get down to Conservative principles.\u2019  When he wanted to now all about Conservative principles, he went back, and always had done, and always would, to Disraeli.  Disraeli, after all was the founder of modern Conservatism.  He breathed new life into the party after it had been broken up at the time of the introduction of Free Trade.  His words lived, his personality lived, his influence lived.  He never shrank from democracy; he never shrank from change.What he shrank from was stagnation, and he shrank from destruction of anything \u2013 sheer destruction.  \u2018His policy,\u2019 said Mr. Baldwin, \u2018our policy \u2013 sometimes neglected but always the base of the fundamental beliefs of our party \u2013 was the condition of our people, the Empire and the Constitution.  And, indeed, no more Liberal statesman in the true sense of the word than Disraeli ever lived.Memories of Mr. J. Chamberlain\u2018There was much criticism at the time of his extension of the borough franchise of 1867, but by that he brought in a vast body of the working people of this country to correct the influence of the bourgeoisie , and it is a remarkable fact, which I want you to bear in mind, that with the advent of the people into politics at that time those attacks of the intelligentsia on the Monarchy which had characterised the earlier years of the reign of Queen Victoria died away, and the Monarchy gradually took a place in the hearts and the souls and the minds of the British people more deep, more fervent than it had ever occupied before, a place which it occupies today.\u2019  (Applause)Disraeli was the first great statesman who took up the question of health.  He gave a charter to the trade unions.  He passed some of the earliest Acts in connection with housing, which were taken advantage of to the benefit of the city of Birmingham by the father of Mr. Neville Chamberlain.  (Applause)In that hall he could not omit reference to another man who, after Disraeli\u2019s death, breathed new life certainly into the younger men of the Conservative party.  He came to them from the Radicals, and his name was Joseph Chamberlain.  He rejoiced to think that Mr. Joseph Chamberlain found in the leaders of that day \u2013 Lord Salisbury, Mr. Balfour and Mr. W. H. Smith \u2013 men with whom he could work in perfect sympathy, and men who helped him and, with his aid, obtained for this country county councils and free education.Disraelian ConservatismHe would make no comparison with those days, but it was interesting to remember that Mr. Chamberlain then found more sympathy, more willingness to go forward and less desire to stagnate among the Tory leaders than among some of the rank and file.  (Laughter)Mr. Joseph Chamberlain protested against the tendency to sag into the old negative habits.  \u2018There is no tendency today, I am thankful to say,\u2019 said Mr. Baldwin, \u2018but remember those words: \u201cLong after I have gone, whoever is leading you, remember that when the old tendency to sag comes, kick the party into some kind of life and don\u2019t let \u2019em do it.\u201d\u2019Mr. Chamberlain knew that conventional Conservatism could never hold the country, and it could not.  It was Disraelian Conservatism that had as its main objects the well-being of the people of this country, their progress, their well-being in every direction, spiritual and material, and a devotion to Constitution with which they could always win, but if they sagged into the old negative habit they never would.Mr. Baldwin recalled the last speech of Mr. Chamberlain in Bingley Hall.  Mr. Chamberlain, he said, left with them a legacy of Tariff reform, and they had seen that policy carried with enthusiasm by the whole country and so established that it would endure for many years.ExperimentsA Conservative policy, he said, should never frighten our people if it meant change.  \u2018We are living in times when change is necessary, when it is essential.  We are going, as it were, through uncharted seas economically and industrially, and I myself would shrink from no methods \u2013 nor would my colleagues \u2013 if they felt they were methods that would help the country.\u2018You see these new methods being tried today.  You have had a discussion on them this afternoon with regard to agriculture.  We are experimenting; experiments must go on, and I am quite sure that all those who look back, as every Tory must look back, to Disraeli for inspiration will never be afraid to go forward, and will never shrink responsibility because it is not one that has been borne by someone else before.\u2019Proletarian Hitlerism\u2018And now, for a few moments,\u2019 said Mr. Baldwin, \u2018I wish to speak to you about the maintenance of the constitution.  In the last century, those of us engaged in political life \u2013 and I was in a humble sphere \u2013 used to speak of the maintenance of the Constitution; but really there was very little to threaten it.  There have been in the last century growls about the Monarchy, growls about the Second Chamber, but that is all.  And, indeed, it is curious to think that in this year of Grace our Constitution, of all others, should be challenged at all.\u2018Our Constitution is no ready-made article.  It has grown through the centuries, as native to our country and to our people as oak or ash or thorn.  It has seen changes; it has seen revolutions.  It has seen the country struggling against mighty forces; it has seen her triumph.\u2018It has given her people freedom and it has taught her people the difference between freedom and license.  And this is the Constitution that is being threatened today, not quite openly yet, but tendenciously, by the sketching of a course of action by the Socialist Party in their conference that, if it takes place, means destruction of the Constitution.\u2018You may disguise that as much as you like, but in effect, to take away executive power from the House of Commons is the way in which every tyranny starts.  It is a proletarian Hitlerism, and it is nothing else, and it can be nothing else.  I want you to realise it in time.Task for Rank and FileI have spoken about it already on the platform.  I warned the people some months ago, but I want to tell you this: This is an Inkerman, a rank and a file engagement.  The problems today are so continuous. So multifarious \u2013 what time have we to come down into the country and become continually talking on these subjects?  We cannot do it.  But does not it point out to you the absolute necessity of maintaining, of recreating, if necessary, your organisation, your associations right through the country, and equipping yourselves \u2013 don\u2019t go into this struggle unequipped \u2013 to deal with the arguments that will be used, and explaining what that kind of stuff which is being put out at Socialist conferences really means and what it will lead to if persisted in?  (Applause)\u2018In the defence, the maintenance of the Constitution, you will be fighting for one of the fundamental principles of the Conservatism, of Conservatism since there was such a thing politically.  But it is not only a fundamental principle of Conservatism; it is a principle deep down in the hearts of millions of Englishmen who do not belong to our party or any party.  Join hands with all of them who will fight that thing to the death, who will lay it out flat and beat it and knock it out.  (Cheers)These schemes are not of English origin.  They belong to countries who do not know what freedom means and who have not been able to maintain Parliamentary Government.  They are alien in their traditions, they are alien in their action.  And, for myself, I would only repeat the words of a great Englishman who lived in the seventeenth century, and of whom I am a great admirer.  In speaking of himself and his friends he said this: \u201cFor the earth of England he would rather die than see a spire of English grass trampled down by a foreign trespasser.  He thinketh there are a great many of his mind, for all plants are apt to his taste of the soil in which they grow, and we that grow here have a root that produceth in us a stalk of English juice which is not to be changed by grafting or foreign infusions.\u201d\u2019  (Loud cheers)

aVAt a meeting of this kind, it is essential for me to say a few words on the record of the present Government. I do this for this reason. Political memories are short - there is no gratitude in politics. All the same, if you are going to engage a gardener or a clerk, or even a trade union secretary, what is the first question you ask? What is his record? I am con­vinced from what I hear that the rank and file in the country do not realise the magnitude of the work that this Government has done. I beg of you, as those who, by your presence here tonight, prove your attachment to your party, your keenness for the political education of your countrymen and your country­women, to accomplish it, to polish up, if need be, the propaganda departments in all your constituencies, and to see to it that by the time the General Election comes no one who will register his or her vote shall be in ignorance of the remarkable achieve­ments during the last three years, and I hope, during the rest of our term, of this Government.First and foremost, I want to stress the subject which is close to the heart of everyone in this country, the one by which Government after Government has been, and will be, judged; that is the question of the employment of our people. Remember this - that just over three years ago, when the Government was formed, there were 9,300,000 people at work, and this August, 10,170,000 - 800,000 more people actually at work who would have been workless. In the state of the world that is an amazing achievement. But I, as you, am not yet content. I doubt, indeed, if I ever shall be content in my lifetime. But remember that our opponents have put it about that the recovery of trade in this country is of no credit to the Government because it is part of a world recovery. You have simply got to look; I do not refer you to any polemical figures, but to the official figures of the League of Nations.If you compare the industrial outlook and the figures of six years ago with the first six months of this year, in comparison with 1928 you will find the industrial outlook improved in com­parison with other countries. The industrial output is down in Germany by 15 per cent; Italy by 17 per cent; France by 19 per cent; Holland by 24 per cent; Belgium 20 per cent; United States 25 per cent; Poland 38 per cent; Czechoslovakia 32 per cent. In Great Britain it is 4 per cent up.We owe this excellent state of affairs to the tariffs granted. Those are the things for which many of us have worked so long during the dark years. And I think we may fairly say that, whatever happens now, no opponents of ours are going to abolish the existing tariffs. It would be wearisome to speak in detail of what they have accomplished, but if you take one of the greatest depressed industries, the steel production of the country has steadily reached over 700,000 tons a month against an average of 430,000 tons only three years ago. Those of you acquainted with the industries of this country will recognise that the pro­ductive and industrial efficiency of this country under the shelter of tariffs is now increasing in many of the industries of Great Britain.As I have here representatives from all parts of the country and many from the industrial areas, I will take a few minutes of your time in just alluding to one or two of the things which have been discussed for the benefit of industry, and the observa­tions heard about them. They all deal with employment. I think most of us would agree, and I ask you to give your con­sideration to these questions, that it is practically impossible to make the working of overtime in industry illegal. But I want to say that when there are so many wholly unemployed it does seem obviously unfair that others should be working longer than their normal hours except to meet special occasions. I do appeal to every firm which is regularly working overtime to think out carefully whether, by organising their hours, they can eliminate regular overtime, and thereby give employment to additional workmen during the normal hours. I suggest it is a national duty to make that effort.The Government is establishing junior instruction centres all over the country, under the new Employment Act for un­employed boys and girls, and this is the most practical way of dealing with this juvenile problem. Lord Halifax, the Minister of Education, explained why, in his opinion, it would be less successful than many believe as an aid to reducing unemployment to increase the school age. I need not go into that now, but we believe that by the creation of these centres we are going to strike a good blow in this excellent cause that we believe will be of great benefit to the young people.Now we have heard a good deal of discussion about getting rid of the older men from industry. But there again I doubt very much whether it would have a great deal of popular support. If the Government took upon itself to say to men at a certain age \u2018Out you go,\u2019 it certainly could not be done without making State provision for them. In these times that would be almost a more serious matter to face than we could do at present.There is something very hard in turning out competent men still able to work, who, perhaps, owing to the circumstances of their lives have not been able to make provision sufficient for their old age. To compel them to give up work in full possession of their powers, all their faculties, and say, whatever their circum­stances may be, \u2018Out you go\u2019 - I do not think the Government could do that.A matter that is being discussed a good deal now is the shorter working week, and on that I would like to make one or two observations. The progress of science and mechanical progress has brought the shorter working week undoubtedly within the realms of possibility in some industries, but I do not believe that in the immediate future any country, or probably any industry in any country, is in a position to introduce it fully. Everyone is in sympathy with it. We favour the prospect of shorter working hours throughout the world. We do not believe the time has come yet when the Convention which has been proposed at the International Labour Office can be introduced. We do not believe the plan would work we do not believe that the principal countries of the world would ratify it at present. Much more knowledge has to be gained, much more progress has to be made; but we do welcome every experiment - and experiments are most valuable - by individual employers and by individual industries in trying out a shorter working week. We should also welcome international agreements arrived at industry by industry if such agreements were possible, and we are anxious to see, from that point of view, one great reform that is due, if not overdue - that is, an international convention to regulate the hours of work in coal mines. We have seen that some firms in this country have adopted a system of work sharing. I think that is a sensible and healthy practice. It is not adaptable to all industries; it is not adaptable in all places. But I would like to see many more employers and men considering whether it would be a right and possible thing for them to introduce in the industries with which they are connected.Just one word about the distressed areas. I have no information to give you, but you all know that a report is being considered that was drawn up by some Members of Parliament and some non-members who visited those districts to make a report to the Government. I am satisfied that whatever we may think fit to do, and whatever we may do either on these reports or in amplification of them, we shall have your full sympathy and support. On our part, I undertake that we shall take whatever action we may find possible and appropriate at the earliest moment possible.Now I want to say a few words about the agricultural industry. The Government are resolved, as you can see by what they have done, that this great industry, which is of incalculable value to the nation, shall be once more put on its legs. All measures taken and to be taken have the one aim of stopping the influx from the country to the town and main­taining a contented community on the land. Those things cannot be done in a moment, but for the first time for years we succeeded last year in stopping the terrible decline of people employed on the land. New plans have yet to be made. Existing ones will very likely have to be revised in the light of experience, for we have not been afraid to experiment, and experiment boldly. We have set our hands to the plough and we have no intention of turning back until the furrow is ploughed. We have diffi­culties. You all know what they are. We have, as far as is practicable, to reconcile the increased production of food in this country with the prosperity of our Dominions, without damaging our export trade and without damaging our shipping. To some extent these various things run counter to each other, and it requires the most delicate steering lest we do more harm in one direction than we are doing good in another. But believe me, whatever our critics may say, the Government as a whole and the Ministry of Agriculture in particular, have all these facts and all these aspects only too vividly before them. We believe we can bring back prosperity to agriculture without doing anything that would jeopardise the chance of opening new or re-opening old markets and without unduly affecting the serious difficulties under which our great shipping industry is being conducted.There is, of course, another subject closely touching the Dominions and giving us much anxiety - the question of migra­tion. Had migration continued since the war on the same scale as before the war, our unemployment problem would be a mere bagatelle. World conditions, the fall in prices, and the economic blizzard have struck the Dominions as hard as they have struck us and Europe. At the moment there seems little prospect of emigration such as we have known in the past, but we have the subject constantly under review. That admirable Under-Secretary, Mr. Malcolm MacDonald, deservedly popular in our Party in the House, has gone to Australia to take part in the celebrations there, and the most important work he has to do is to discuss the situation as it is there today. He will also see what it is likely to be in the next few years and when the first opportunity is likely to arise when this question can be seriously re-opened - a vital question not only to this country, but also to our Dominions.I do beg of you that, when you come to discuss in your constituencies what the Government is doing, and has done, you make yourselves familiar with all that is being done and that has been done this year and that will be done under the new Bill on overcrowding and housing in this country. It is a simply amazing record, and I say that because it may be a sad thing to confess, but there are precious few members in this Government who are good advertisers. Perhaps it is not too much to ask that while we are working as we are working - and I can tell you that I have put in as much work during the past three years as I have ever put in in three years in my life - you should sound a few cheerful notes on a trumpet. I can never find it in my heart to put it to my lips. I know that you have been discussing certain aspects of the housing question in regard to compensation of condemned properties. All that I can tell you is that I shall weigh with the greatest care what you have said. I will consult my own colleagues about it, and we will see what the trouble is that is apparently causing a good deal of anxiety in many breasts.Two by-elections are imminent - those at Lambeth and Swindon - and I hope that those in contiguous constituencies will do all they can to see that National candidates are elected. Don\u2019t let us make the mistake of thinking that by-elections do not matter - that our majority is too big. It is true, as far as voting goes, we can afford to lose a seat or two, but the loss of a seat always has a moral effect. It depresses the workers in the constituency. We should not let a constituency feel that it is fighting in a corner by itself, but rather that it has your sympathy and help.I have said something to you about what we have been doing and trying to do. I want to talk quite seriously to you on some thoughts which have been passing through my mind during the last year and I think are not inapplicable to the political situation which we see in this country and in Europe. When the first Reform Bill, a little over a century ago, was passed, the bulk of the Tories, as they then called themselves, believed they would be excluded from power for ever, and that the country and the Empire would be destroyed. I am old enough to remember the Reform Bill of 1885 and the giving of the franchise to the agricultural labourer. Sixteen years ago there was universal suffrage, since when the Tory Party has been the greatest numerical party in that combination - and in my view for this reason, that the Tory Party has always been a National Party. I do not mean a class party, I mean a party that acts for all classes.Some people say I am a supporter of Liberal principles. That phrase used to annoy me, as I do not know what Liberal principles are. Similarly when some of my friends write to me and say: \u2018I wish you would give me some more Tory principles or govern in accordance with Tory principles,\u2019 I say to myself, \u2018What are Tory principles?\u2019 Before I come to what they are just let us ask ourselves whether it is always easy to know what they are, because there does not exist any gospel of Tory principles which can tell you what principles to apply to the changing principles in a changing world. In the early days of the two-party system, when Whigs and Tories first took shape, there was a National Government, and it was formed with a very excellent object - it was to fight the French, and to fight the French to prevent the French Crown having a completely predominant position in Europe. A great many Tories left that National Government because there was more interest in pro­secuting legislation against Dissenters than in beating the French.At the time of the Canada Bill, the first Bill that gave self­-government to any part of the British Empire, the Duke of Wellington said he could not support it, and that its passing would mean the absolute disruption of the Empire. Sir Robert Peel did not like it, but he said he would support it because the dangers of not passing it were greater than passing it. Is it the right policy to refuse self-government in the Dominions or not? I should like some clear answers to these questions when asked what are Tory principles.Disraeli brought in a Reform Bill in 1867, I think, and in 1874, in Mr. Disraeli\u2019s Government, we gave a charter of liberty to the Trade Unions, for which the Tory Government was thanked formally by a Labour member. Twenty years later the Tory Government refused to remodel that Bill to meet modern needs. What was the true Tory policy? Extra­ordinarily difficult to answer are these questions. They are questions which I should like to have answered, but if we want to ascertain the basic principles on which our Party rests we have to go back to the recreator of that policy after it was broken to bits in the second quarter of the nineteenth century - Mr. Disraeli.In an autobiography written by a friend who was with me at Harrow the author had quoted me as saying that Disraeli would live as the gospel of the future. So you see what a dogged little Tory I was at 17. Disraeli laid our principles down at the Crystal Palace many years ago, and you cannot go wrong if you stick to them. They were, \u2018the maintenance of our institutions and of our religion; the preservation of our Empire, and the improvement in the condition of our people.\u2019 That does not tell you how you are to adapt your policy in changed circumstances and changed ages. That is the duty of a leader. The responsibility - and it is a great responsibility - that rests with a leader is to try and adapt the policy according to the deep-laid foundations of the Party principles to meet whatever may come in this world.Equally as it is the duty and the responsibility of the leader to do that, it is the right of the Party, if they think fit, to challenge its interpretation. That is democratic. If in sufficient numbers they can challenge it so that it inevitably leads to the choice of a new leader; that is democratic, and that is the way we do things. But I want to say that I am at present leader of this party, and so long as I lead I am going to lead it. After all, I think our Party as a whole has risen marvellously to the demands that have been made upon it since the War. What experience had any of us of this age in which we live and yet how many of us, and especially our younger men, have got a true realisation of the age? And that is largely why there is so much confidence felt in us in the country. I think many people have realised what is the truth - that a great deal of this feeling of restlessness in the country is not a revolt of the \u2018have nots\u2019 against the \u2018haves.\u2019 It is something deeper and more honourable than that. It is a revolt against the subordination of the human to the mechanical, of the creative to the commercial function, and the recognition that there can be no permanent social order in any country except by the full recognition of the social needs and social ends of men and women.\u2018Improvement of the conditions of the people.\u2019 Never did those words mean more than they do now. There is going to be more leisure than there has ever been, more unemployment than there was before the War, until the world is properly adjusted. This is the social problem we have to face - to prepare the people to use their increased leisure worthily and to see to it that those who cannot get work do not lose their manhood and their woman­hood. We Tories, as part of our heritage, have a profound sense of the value of historic continuity and of our great Constitution, and it is a remarkable thing that in some of those years when all the world was rattled soon after the War there were Englishmen who said, \u2018Look at America and Italy, and even look at Russia; see what they are doing.\u2019 You do not hear so much of that now.Did you notice in the last fortnight that the French Prime Minister and the President of the United States each bade their people look across the sea to this little island?People look with wonder at this island and say, \u2018How is it that you have stability which does not seem to exist in any other country in the world?\u2019 The answer is that our Constitution has grown in that way, and the great danger of tampering with it is not the danger of changing it, but the danger of cutting out roots which go down to the very beginning of our history and to our very being.I call on you to stand when the next Election comes as you stood at the last Election - to stand for the maintenance of our institutions and the preservation of our Empire and the improvement of the conditions of the people - in the full and certain knowledge that if you do this then indeed there is no fear for the future of England. She will be preserved once more by those things which, as Disraeli said, are of more value than her accumulated capital - her cumulative experience, her traditions, her character and her people.

aVAt this critical moment you will not be surprised if I devote nearly the whole of my speech to a consideration of current events and their reactions in this country.I propose to speak about what is present in all your minds tonight, and must have been for some little time, and will, I fear, be for a little time yet.  Let us try to do a little clear thinking and clarify the issues that lie before us.There has always been a not unnatural feeling in some sections of our Party that while the ideal of a League of Nations is a great one, there are practical difficulties connected with it that render it extremely doubtful whether we can, or should, give it wholehearted support.I am not speaking of the moment.  I am speaking of the past, and I want us, for a moment, to consider why it was that the League of Nations was started and why the desire for its foundation found an echo in the hearts of so many of our fellow countrymen.It is no new thing that, after a great war, the world should feel it ought to be possible to make some arrangement to devise some mechanism that might make such experiences impossible in the future.  No such scheme, no such machinery has yet been devised.  But, I think, what we all felt, at the end of the War, was that war had taken on a new face.There was something that differentiated the last war from all previous wars, and it was this \u2013 that the march of science had placed a power of slaughter into the ranks of modern armies that no armies in the past had ever possessed.That very nearly resulted, in Europe, in throwing back our civilisation for generations, and people felt that at the rate at which science was progressing it might well be that these perils and dangers might be magnified many-fold in ten or twenty years, and that an effort to make war, if not impossible, difficult in its inception should be taken by humanity, lest its civilisation should be wiped out.There is no doubt in my mind that, had the whole world joined the League of Nations, and had the will to restrain war been there, the League could have prevented war.There are various \u2013 I am not going to specify \u2013 important nations outside the League, and the task is more difficult, but if the task be abandoned now, all chance will be gone of what may still be possible, to get the nations of the world inside it.But there is a school of thought, and it is sometimes connected with those who share very much the views that I and many others hold on Imperial questions.  It is the isolation school, who would fetch us out of the League, and who would believe that this country and the Empire would be safer outside than in.I want to say a word or two about that, because I believe that to be a fundamental and most dangerous heresy at the moment and far more dangerous in the future.  I believe it to be dangerous on National and Imperial grounds.  I believe it, in short, to be impossible.I come again to the march of science that is only beginning.  The world is infinitely closer today owing to the facilities of modern transport than it has ever been, and it will get closer.  Frontiers, which a few short years ago were simply defined and easy to guard, are now neither.  They are not simply defined and they are not easy to guard.The reduction of distance, now that flying is making the strides that it does \u2013 if that be not a mixed metaphor \u2013 the effect on this country, so far as its defence goes, is very much as though the land which was submerged in far-distant geological ages, and gave way to that stretch of water between us and the continent of Europe, were once again rising, and making a bridge over which people might pass, and on which we might well, some day, have to defend ourselves.Let us never forget this.  The centre of our Empire, and, so far as we can see, for many generations to come, lies in, and will lie in, this Island.  If this Island perish with all that it stands for, I doubt if the Empire can hold together, and in my view the maintenance of the Empire will depend on the maintenance of the position of this heart of the Empire in Europe.  And, unless that heart be secure and beat strongly and firmly, the current of life blood will cease to flow throughout the world where our children are in the Seven Seas. I should like to quote you a short passage which I employed last year in the House of Commons, which may be new to many of you, and which was written by a great student of politics, and a great supporter of ours, Mr. Frederick Oliver.  He puts in a few pregnant sentences what I have been trying to express to you in my more faulty phraseology.He was speaking of foreign policy in the second quarter of the Eighteenth Century, and how impossible it was then for this country to pursue an isolationist policy, and he says this:'The people whose home is Britain cannot escape from their practical environment.  Isolation is a bubble of a distorted imagination.  Weary with an apparently insoluble confusion, tested by endless provocation, haunted by the memory of a thousand fears, in the past British statesmen have sometimes been tempted to bid other nations of Europe to go their way and let us ourselves go in peace.'But the very essence of the matter is that no one of us can go his own way.  Individual men may go, as the Pilgrim Fathers went, but the nations cannot go, and it is not the worse that human kind should choose to stay where they are born, and since we are forced to stay, we must play our parts manfully or be borne under.If we allow our prestige to become impaired, if we shirk responsibility and let things of moment go by default \u2013 in other words, if we cease to care whether our strength is recognised or not, whether our voice is audible in the councils of Europe, we lose the chief security of our independence.We risk our own ruin, we injure the whole Continental fabric.  Confusion and disaster will follow as certainly as if one of the planets of the solar system should cease to pull its weight.These words might have been used to meet the crisis facing us at this moment.Without pursuing the subject, I would like to add one sentence.  I spoke of our Imperial responsibilities.In my view the time may come when events in Europe may have repercussions that may be felt throughout the whole British Empire, and we cannot afford, not only nationally, but as an Empire, to refuse to play our part in the continent in which the hand of God has placed us.  (Cheers)We are pledged by our signatures to the Covenant of the League; we have signed the Kellogg Pact.  It is not only, in my view, our vital interests which dictate our policy, but it is the fulfilment of our solemn international pledges.I have noticed, during the last weeks, while the present grave issue between the League of Nations and Italy has been debated in Geneva, that it has been represented in many countries abroad as an issue between this country alone and Italy.  Though amongst our own people the nature of the dispute is fully realised, I wish to remove any shadow of misunderstanding on this point, if it should still exist anywhere.We have, from the very beginning, spoken and acted on this issue solely in our capacity as a member of the League and in fulfilment of our obligations under the Covenant.  There never has been, and I hope never will be, national enmity between my country and Italy.That we should urge our fellow members of the Council to oppose Italy from selfish or mean motives of our own would not only be repugnant to our national self-respect, but an abuse of the whole spirit and intention of the Covenant, to which his Majesty\u2019s Government would lend no countenance.  (Cheers)I go still further.  This country resents, and indignantly rejects, the suspicions which have been caused by its sincerity in defending the country.  It will bode ill for the League of Nations if one of its leading members, in proclaiming its fidelity to obligations to which all are equally bound of their own free will, can be held up to suspicion and misrepresentation of these motives.I trust that we have heard the end of this (cheers), and in making it clear that we are actuated by no such motives, I wish to make it clear that the Government have not, and never have had, any intention of taking isolated action in this dispute.If the security which the nations of Europe regard as a primary need for their peaceful development can best be achieved by collective counsel and collective action, then the responsibility for any action that may be taken rests on all, and must be faced squarely by all.  The Secretary for Foreign Affairs laid full emphasis on this essential aspect of the problem now confronting all of us who are members of the League, and I wish to call attention, once more, to the words which he spoke to the whole world on the occasion of his great speech at Geneva:I have said already that we must all share the responsibilities, and so all will share the benefits, and don\u2019t let us underrate or overlook the benefit to ourselves.  I regard collective security not only of real and practical benefit to this country, but as something which affords us greater security than can be obtained by any other policy which I have yet seen advocated.But we cannot achieve our policy and our goal by mere words.  The Government have made up their mind as to the wisest course to pursue.  Our primary necessity is to see that peace is preserved in Europe.  We believe that, from collective security and the League of Nations, we have to our hands the best means of preserving peace, or of exercising some measure of control over events should peace be temporarily broken.It is certainly the hope of His Majesty\u2019s Government - and I believe I can say of all the Governments represented at Geneva - that is the desire to help and to be maintained.I should like to pay tribute to the unswerving loyal support we are receiving at Geneva from every representative of the Empire, from every quarter of the globe.  Grave reports have reached the Council of the League within the last day or so regarding the movement of troops and aircraft within the boundaries of Abyssinia.  The situation thus created will form the subject of the Council\u2019s deliberations at their meeting tomorrow morning.You will not expect me to say anything now which might prejudice, in any way, their work or the issue.  I am confident, however, that I am voicing the sentiments of the whole country in appealing to Italy in this dispute, even at this hour, to refrain from action which will render the task of the Council more arduous.Let us keep before our minds, during the difficult days ahead, the main objective of the League and its members, that any action taken must be with the approval and support and collaboration of all, and that it should work for the shortening of the conflict and the hastening of a satisfactory agreement.I would only add, on this subject, that there is no truth in the propaganda that is being assiduously put forward abroad, and which I have seen stated in this country, that we have not advised Italy of our views for many months past.  From the earliest days in this crisis there has been frequent and constant diplomatic touch maintained, and if that be challenged, the Foreign Secretary will be ready at any time in the House of Commons to meet it with more detail than would be suited to a large public meeting of this kind.But I want to say to you that recent events have confirmed my own doubts and anxieties, which have been present with me and my colleagues for some time past.  We have, as you know, since the War, done more in the way of practical disarmament and more in reducing expenditure on necessary equipment than any other country \u2013 I was going to say in the World \u2013 but I will certainly say in Europe.We cannot pursue that path longer.  The whole perspective on the Continent has been altered in the last year or two by the rearming of Germany.I have no reason to believe any hostile intentions.  I do not look on Germany, or on any other country as necessarily a hostile foe.  I hope, indeed, for a continuance of that friendship which, after the Great War, we have so often succeeded in making with those who have recently been our foes in the field.But I cannot be blind to facts; that the presence of another great nation, armed, alters the perspective in Europe.In the fulfilment of obligations under the League of Nations, I cannot conceal from myself that some day the fulfilment of those obligations may be that the nations who are fulfilling them may have to maintain by force of arms the Covenant of the League.I ask myself, with all the responsibility that falls upon me as principal adviser to his Majesty, how far I am entitled to accept fully those obligations without repairing the deficiencies which we have made, and for which all of us are responsible since the War.  It is a responsibility, but I cannot bear or shoulder a responsibility which I do not think his Majesty\u2019s Government, on examination, would be prepared to shoulder.We have one other thing to remember in connection with the League of Nations, another pregnant fact \u2013 that we have today a new factor in Europe.We have dictatorships; and we know that, historically, however pacifist the early stages of such forms of Government may be in its intentions, we know too well the tendency that has shown itself later to divert attention from domestic difficulties to external adventure.While such conditions exist, and remembering the responsibility we have for our people, I am not satisfied with the position as it is today.  It is neither the time nor the place to go into further details on this matter, but I would repeat once more, there is a risk in accepting obligations as a member of the League of Nations unless we are able to carry out these obligations to the full.I do not like the doubt and questionings which have reached me from the world at large as to our ability to fulfil our obligations.  So long as those doubts exist, our words will not carry that weight in the councils of the world that the word of Great Britain always has carried, always ought to carry and, I hope, always will carry.In no conceivable circumstances, as I have said in the House of Commons, must we feel that we are inferior in the air of anyone within striking distance of this country, and in no conceivable circumstances should it be impossible for our people, whatever may happen, to be secured in the services of their food from overseas.I have taken rather longer than I intended on this subject, but I want to say something on the resolution in regard to sanctions that was passed at another seaside town at a Labour Conference there.I do not want today \u2013 the matter is much too serious \u2013 to say much that might be said about that Conference.  I want to speak to you of the gravity of that resolution, and I want to give you one or two thoughts that have occurred to me on this subject, and may well have occurred to those who belong to our great Party \u2013 and, indeed, to others.I rejoice in the fact that that resolution was passed \u2013 (cheers) \u2013 but I do feel this \u2013 and I think clear-sighted men in the Labour Party would agree with me \u2013 that the Party as a whole will not realise all the implications of their resolution until they acquire that knowledge that is only to be got when they are in office.Of course, it was supported by the Trade Unions.  Trade Unionism, like the Friendly Societies, is a peculiarly English growth.This country is the native soil in which such institutions are indigenous.  They are integral parts of the country\u2019s life, and they are a great stabilising influence.  Perhaps some of our Party who take a less wide view than I do in having to look forward, as I do, may say, \u2018Oh, well, they did not make things easy in 1926, and some other years we can think of.\u2019  That may be true, but it does not alter the truth of the general proposition that I lay down.Let me ask you to watch carefully the continuous efforts that are being made by the Communist Party to attempt to destroy Trade Unionism.They do not want to destroy them for nothing.  The spirit of Trade Unionism is the bulwark of popular liberty.  If Trade Unionism was destroyed, you would be on the road to Communism and from Communism to Fascism.Let anyone in this island who has a knowledge of industry in industrial regions try to imagine what industry would be like today if there were no Trade Unions.  It would be chaos, absolute chaos, and chaos that would lead to disaster.I have said these few words because I have no doubt, in my own mind, and I am convinced, that while Trade Unions are wholehearted supporters of the League of Nations in this present action, they no doubt feel that the country, the case of which is now being considered by the League, is a Fascist country in which the Trade Unions have been suppressed.That would be equally true of Germany and Russia.  In my view Fascism, or any state of Government which will suppress the freedom of Trade Unionism, is a very chimera, a very bogey, a figment of the imagination. There is only one risk of a Fascist rule in Great Britain \u2013 that is if we ever get Communism first.  Fascism in Italy, as Mussolini himself would confess, was built up on the defeat of Communism, and the success of Nazism in Germany was brought about by the defeat of Communism.Until the Trade Unions in this country cease to be the constitutional bodies that they are today, and become controlled by Communists, or by people with Communist leanings, and try to form some dictatorship in this country, not till then will you see that swing to the Right that always answers it, and seeks by force to impose its will on the country, as has been tried by the extremists.  No extremists will get into that position by force in this country, because of that respect, born in all of us, of law and order.I have only said that because I do not myself believe that there is the slightest chance within any period of time that I can foresee that anything of the kind can happen.  This country has its feet too firmly planted on the path of constitutional progress that has served her people well.  I think she will be stimulated to tread in those paths by the sight of what we can see in countries not so placed as we.But, before I leave the subject of Fascism and Nazism, I want to add this.  In all movements there is good and there is bad.  I spoke earlier about the advent of dictatorship which made the outlook in Europe more uncertain, and made those anxious for the security of their own country more inclined to study the new conditions, and to advise the country to secure itself in certain directions against possibilities in the future.The good in these movements, which was so obvious in their earlier state, was the inculcation of discipline among the youth of the country, based on love of their country, and the desire to make themselves fit for the service of their country.  Up to a point that is an ideal we would all like to see in this country \u2013 our people fit for the service of their country, by which I mean their work and labours to make our country a better and happier place.Then youth will always be prepared, as men of all ages will, to defend their country if their country is attacked.  But you have got another form of patriotism, which I think is a spurious form, and that is where the danger comes.When your love of country leads you not only to make your country a better country, not only to be prepared to defend your country if she is attacked, but when you desire your country to make war against other people for purposes of her own aggrandisement.When you get that idea widely spread in a nation you have got a situation that may be dangerous to the neighbours of that country.Economic conditions today are a real danger.  I will show you how.  You all know the difficulties we have had.You all know the work, on the part of Governments and of Parliament and of social workers, to help our unemployed and to find work for them.  We know what great strides have been made in the last four years.  We know that we have not yet conquered that problem, and how for the purposes of political warfare far more stress is laid on those who have not got work than on the many who have got work.We make no complaint of that, but we see that in some of the countries of Europe, where unemployment has been rife, where the standard of work has been low, the attempt has not been made, as we have made it, to carry the unemployed, but work has been found on the manufacture of material and munitions for war.  That means that some countries are in the process to become fully equipped for war, and those who remember the last war know the part that equipment plays.Such a situation may be sometimes a situation of danger, it is not a situation that can be ignored by any Government.  We have to guard, in this country, a social life and a standard of life better than any that exists in Europe.So much for the material side.  But we have to guard certain spiritual values of infinitely more importance and value to mankind \u2013 that love of freedom and that love of justice, without which we could not survive.There are many throughout the world today who still worship silently, steadily, and alone at those shrines at which we worship so freely in this country.  You may depend they are all watching and sympathising with us, and praying that we may be strong enough to hold aloft those torches until mankind has found more wisdom, and recognises that they are the better part for mankind.  (Cheers)With those thoughts in our minds, we shall in due course, when we come to put our programmes forth, make clear both of these matters of making good equipment and material so long neglected, and what we think should be done.And I want to tell you that, at the same time, while I know these things must be done, and while I know that the expense must be faced, it is not in my mind \u2013 and I am sure it is not in the mind of the Government \u2013 that we should slacken our efforts by one little whit in continuing with that social progress which we have been able to bring about in this country in recent years.We have been examining during the Recess many schemes in connection with the depressed areas, and as the Chancellor told you and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Labour told you, I think we shall be ready when the House meets to put forward our suggestions.There are questions of vital importance such as the nutrition and physical condition of our people and maternity services with which we must go forward, and if we, in this country, can only keep from serious industrial disturbance, if we can continue on our work, if our industries can go forward and make such profits that we can get a really handsome share of income tax out of them \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 I, for one, have no fear that this country can carry all the burdens we propose to lay upon it.But, I want to remind you that the auspices are good.  This Party is united today as closely as it has ever been in nay time of its history.To come back:  this next election must come upon us \u2013 certainly before another year has expired.  (Laughter)  I think it is obvious to all of us in the present condition of external politics that it would be extremely difficult for me to say anything more definite to you this evening.I have struggled for this ever since I became its leader, because I believe that we should form the largest nucleus to which might be attracted members of other parties, who at critical times would fight for the same great causes that we fight for.  It was in a great fight of that kind that forces were joined to form the National Government four years ago, and in the next fight we have we want all hands on the ropes again.We want friends to see eye to eye with us \u2013 we want friends from the Liberal Party \u2013 we want friends from Labour.The dictators of the world are saying that peoples inside the democratic countries are inferior to them because they are always quarrelling in their politics, and they will never agree on a policy.Let us show the world when the election comes that whatever issues there may be at the election \u2013 let the people of an ancient democracy show that their  cohesion, their purpose, their will can be no whit inferior to that of nay dictatorship that ever existed in this world, or ever will.It is for us to show that a great people is united and determined in preserving the peace of the world by collective action and to fit themselves for the task, and to attain that end they will shrink from no effort and no sacrifice that may be demanded of them.  (Loud cheers)

aVIt is almost exactly a year since we last met by the seaside and I am glad to see that your high spirits have not abated nor your fighting qualities diminished. In fact you don\u2019t look a. day older than when I saw you last at Margate. As for me I have indeed assumed new responsibilities since I became Leader of the Party but the burden sits easily on my shoulders because I am supported by a harmonious and united Government, and by a Party which has no differences to hide and no division of its loyalty to its leaders. And so I have no need to warn anyone here that if he doesn\u2019t mend his was he will have to be smacked and sat in a corner. I have no need to appeal to you to close your ranks and keep the Party pure from the corrupting influence of outsiders; and I have no reason to fear that any of my colleagues is harbouring the intention of bringing dissension among us by advocating from inside a policy different from that approved by the Party itself.Bye-ElectionsIn these happy circumstances I can proceed at once to my first and most pleasant duty which is to thank you for all the work you have done in the constituencies during the past year. There can have been few occasions when, it was possible to look back on the visible results of your labours with so much satisfaction. We are now nearing the end of the sixth year of National Government and since we last met there have been a quite unusual number of opportunities for the country to express its disapproval, if it felt any, of our record. Yet out of 27 bye-elections which have taken place since last October only two have been lost to our Socialist opponents, while 25 have been retained by supporters of the National Government.I think we may all claim some share of the credit for such an unprecedented result, the Government for a policy which has kept the peace and maintained the prosper­ity of the country and you for the careful organisation and the downright hard work you have put in which has enabled us to bring our supporters to the poll. And I think itwould be ungenerous not to admit that the Socialist Party has had some share in our success. For surely no Party has ever backed the wrong horse more persistently than they nor bitten one another with greater ferocity when they discovered their mistakes.ConferenceDuring this week they and we have both been holding our Conferences. I shall have something to say later on about one item in the new \u2018short programme\u2019 which they have adopted and I will only observe now that though the programme may be short the time is likely to be long before the country returns them to power to carry out proposals which would at once destroy confidence and paralyse employment. Our Conference has been less dramatic but more businesslike. I have already studied or had reported to me the gist of the various discussions that have been taking place and I can promise you now that I will give careful and personal consideration to the views which the Conference has expressed.Foreign AffairsThis is the one occasion in the year when I can speak face to face with representatives of the Party from all parts of the country, and I want to take advantage of it to review the whole field of politics so far as I can do that without trespassing unduly on your time.I make no excuse for devoting the first part of what I have to say to foreign affairs.In these days we never seem to be able to free ourselves for more than a few days from international problems which affect our interests directly or indirectly but which arise from circumstances beyond our control. The primary responsibility for our policy and for the action we take from time to time to deal with these problems rests upon the Foreign Secretary, and no member of the Government is subjected to so continuous and exhausting a strain upon his physical and mental resources as the man who holds that office. Happily, in our present Foreign Secretary, Mr. Eden, we have a statesman who combines all the energy and vitality of youth with an un­rivalled experience of men and affairs in all parts of the world, and we all have reason to be grateful to him for the tact and skill which he has devoted to the maintenance of peace and the care with which he watches over the interests of this country.At the present moment there are some grave matters occupying his attention. Although in neither case has there been any formal declaration of war yet, there are in fact two major wars in progress, one close at hand in Spain, the other far away in China. Both of them are being characterised by the use of bombing aeroplanes and in both cases non-combatants, men, women and children, are being killed and mutilated by the action of aerial weapons, which we are told are aimed at military objectives, but which in no case can be considered as instruments of precision. It is a sickening and horrifying spectacle from which the mind revolts and it has aroused in many countries the strongest feelings of indignation at its inhumanity - and sympathy with its helpless victims. Yet it seems to me that there is some danger lest these natural human feelings should miss the real point at which they should be directed. Cruelty and barbarity, mutilation and death of non-combatants, destruction of property, starvation and misery are the inevitable accompaniments of modern warfare. The real crime against humanity goes further back than that. It lies in having resort to force at all, in contradiction of engagements solemnly entered into, without even an attempt to settle differences by peaceful discussion and negotiation.Three days ago the attention of the world was arrested by a clarion call from the other side of the Atlantic, as welcome as it was timely in its utterance. Hitherto it has been assumed that the U.S.A., the most power­ful country in the world, would remain content with a frankly isolationist policy. But President Roosevelt has seen that if what he calls the epidemic of world lawlessness is allowed to spread no country will be safe from attack. In his declaration of the necessity for a return to a belief in the pledged word and the sanctity of treaties, he has voiced the convictions of this country as well as of his own, and in his call for a concerted effort in the cause of peace this Government will be wholeheartedly with him.You will have seen that on the initiative of the League Assembly, it is proposed to hold a conference of the signatories of the Nine Power Treaty and other Powers with interests in the Fax East. I have little doubt after the President\u2019s speech that the United States Government will agree to be represented at that conference and to consult with other members as to how the conflict in China may be brought to an end. It would clearly be premature at this stage for me to commit this Government to any particular course of action. I will only say that our governing objective, now as always, is the restoration and maintenance of peace, and we will gladly co-operate in any plan which will help to secure that end.Events in the Fax East have for the moment diverted attention from the Mediterranean, but the war drags on in Spain and the situation in that country is still causing us increasing anxiety. We were sincerely rejoiced that it was found possible to come to an agreement with the Italian Government as to the patrolling of the Mediterranean by French, Italian and British warships, and we felt encouraged to hope that that agreement might be followed up by further discussions between the three Powers with a view to making the policy of non-intervention really effective. We are still awaiting the Italian reply to our invitation but I earnestly trust that it may prove to be of such a character as to bring us all into greater harmony. If we could once make real progress in the settlement of the Spanish problem the way would be opened to those conversations which formed the subject of the recent correspondence between Signor Mussolini and myself.ArmamentsIn the meantime until the world recovers some of its sanity, there can be no halt in the process of rearming this country. On that point there is practically only one opinion now, since the Chairman of the Labour Party Conference, in the sole passage of his rumbustious speech which has attracted any attention outside, declared that this country must be powerfully armed. Certainly we have not had much help in arming the country from the Labour Party, who have consistently voted against all the service estimates, but as there is more joy over one sinner that repenteth than over ninety and nine just men who support the National Government and have no need of repentance, we very heartily welcome this belated conversion to the true faith.Such was Dr. Dalton\u2019s trust in the National Government that he did not think it necessary to ask any questions about the progress of rearmament, but I do not suppose you will be so easily satisfied and I am sure you would be disappointed if I did not give you some account of how we are getting on. Well I must say frankly that progress is not yet as fast as I should like or as it soon will be. But on the other hand anyone who has any conception of the vast scale of our programme, much vaster than anything we have ever attempted before in peace time, must have realised that before we were able to start on mass production an immense amount of preparatory work had to be done. New designs had to be perfected and tried out, priorities determined, sites acquired, factories built, new tools manufactured and placed in position, and contracts placed. All this had to be done before we could even begin our new programme and upon the thoroughness with which this task is performed necessarily depends the smoothness and speed with which subsequent production will proceed.I am glad to say that this preparatory stage is now practically completed and that production has begun in earnest. All three services are sharing in the general activity. The new Secretary of State for War - you may have noticed his picture in the papers - is devoting his ingenious mind and his untiring energy to mastering every detail that concerns our army and other people\u2019s armies, too. Under his watchful eye I have every confidence that no military problem, great or small, will be overlooked and that though our army will not compare in size with the huge conscript armies of the Continent, it will, when fully equipped, be thoroughly adapted to the task it has to fulfil. As for the Territorial Army, I am glad to say that it is rapidly increasing its strength and as more equipment becomes available I anticipate that we shall have no difficulty in filling its ranks to the full numbers required.As for the Navy the Foreign Secretary recently gave some figures at Geneva which I am told profoundly impressed those who heard him. I need not repeat them here in detail but I may remind you of his statement that the aggregate tonnage actually now being built or already sanctioned by Parliament for the British Navy exceeds half-a-million tons, while the naval personnel is being extended at a rate never attempted before in time of peace. It is perhaps the condition of the Air Force which has been the subject of the greatest amount of attention, and some anxiety has been expressed about the pace at which it is expanding. Yet there is plenty of evidence apparent to everyone who moves about the country that its activities are increasing with great rapidity and, I am afraid, with a good deal of disturbance to the peace of the countryside. Powerful machines unsurpassed in design and equipment are now steadily coming forward from the manufacturers. The volume of supply will very soon be greatly augmented. You have heard of the shadow factories. Where 12 months ago was nothing but bare ground, aeroplane shops have sprung up, and today in half-a-dozen different places an army of workers as keen as they are skilful is at work operating the very latest types of machine tools. These men, moreover, are working under conditions second to none in the world in the provision that is made for their health and well-being. The result of all this and of the ready response to the call for men which shows no sign of diminishing can be seen in the fact that in the space of the last two years the strength of our home based force has been nearly trebled, an expansion at a rate and on a scale never attempted before.IndustrialIt might naturally be expected that with this rapidly growing production of armaments our ordinary commercial business would be showing signs of getting squeezed out. No doubt it must be suffering some disturbance from the pressure of munition orders, yet it continues to show an astonishing resilience and there is still no visible sign of that slump which our political opponents continue to prophesy with such obviously pleasurable anticipation. No doubt it is distressing to them that the policy of the Government which they describe as a public danger should have produced results which compare so strikingly with the conditions which prevailed when they were last in office. Let me give you one or two figures which will demonstrate the improvement.In the first six months of this year industrial production as a whole was 50% greater than in the first half of 1931. Production of pig iron was 100% more, of crude steel 120% more, of artificial silk 220%, and of motors more than 100%.  During the 5 years 1932-1936, 2,688 new factories were opened in Great Britain providing employment for a quarter of a million workpeople. Nearly 250 of these factories (many of which employ processes new to this country) were set up here by or in association with foreign concerns, attracted here by the tariff.The amount of merchant tonnage under construction in our shipyards at the and of June was 120% greater than at the end of June 1931, while the amount of British shipping laid up was only 3% of what it was six years ago.Those who pretend that our tariffs obstruct inter­national trade should note that our retained imports in the first six months of this year were 40% greater in volume than they were in the corresponding period in 1931, and those who maintain that they injure our export trade may be reminded that taking the same two periods our exports have risen by 32%. The effect of our policy on employment is shown by the fact that the number of insured persons in employment excluding agricultural workers has risen by two millions.There is a story that someone once complained to George II that General Wolfe, who afterwards took Quebec, was mad, to which the King replied, \u2018Mad, is he? Then I wish he would bite some of my other Generals.\u2019 And if the Government that has achieved the results I have quoted is a public danger, the Opposition will have to catch some of the infection before it can hope to be given employment again.Now before I leave the subject of industry there is one point on which I should like to say a few words because I notice that our opponents are trying to represent that the recent increase in the cost of living is somehow due to the Government, and their suggestion is that under a Socialist Government prices would at once fall. Well the first remark I would make is that the cost of living is still below what it was in 1929, while the average level of weekly wage rates is substantially higher than it was at that time. But of course the fact is that the present rise in prices is an inevitable accompaniment of the general improvement in conditions. One of the most marked features of the slump was the disastrous fall in the prices of primary commodities and the consequent loss of purchasing power in those countries which depend for their prosperity upon the money they can get for their exports of those commodities. Countries like Australia or the Argentine live on their exports of wool and meat and maize and wheat and when prices of these articles slump, their purchases from this country are bound to fall off. We should therefore welcome the better prices which are now ruling for these growers of food and producers of raw materials since we are reaping the benefit ourselves in the increased export trade which we are doing with them today.It would be too much to expect that the weekly earnings of the workers should keep an exact relation to the cost of living, but I am satisfied that apart from increases in wage rates, earnings have been largely increased not only by the grading up of individual workers but also by the substitution of full-time for part-time work and by the addition of overtime. And no doubt that is in fact the explanation of what has struck many people as a truly remarkable fact, viz., that this phenomenal increase in the activity of trade and employment has been unaccompanied by any serious labour disputes. That does not mean that the workers have refrained from putting forward their claims. What it does mean is that the gains which have accrued to them have been won by peaceful negotiation instead of by conflict, and I should like to pay my tribute to the wisdom and reasonableness which has characterised both employers and employed in these negotiations and which was strikingly illustrated in the agreement recently reached in the engineering trades. It is with special gratification that I observed the inclusion in that agreement of provision of a holiday period with pay for the wage-earner.AgricultureIn any survey of conditions in this country the position of industry naturally comes first because we are, and so far as we can foresee we are destined to remain, predominantly an industrial and trading nation. From our industrial and commercial activities the vast bulk of our wealth is derived and in them the overwhelming majority of our population is engaged. Nevertheless there has been in recent years a growing appreciation of the fact that in our national economy a vital position is held by agriculture. It remains our largest single industry, the annual value of its output is in the neighbourhood of £250 million and its maintenance is essential both to our social welfare and to our national safety.To the recognition of these facts we may attribute the remarkable circumstance that never before has so much time, thought and effort been devoted to the welfare of agriculture as in the half dozen years of National Government.How best to deal with its needs in a country which is predominantly industrial and commercial is no easy matter to determine. The broad object we have set before ourselves has been to ensure that maximum supplies shall be made available within the purchasing power of the consumer consistent with reasonable remuneration for the efficient producer. There is no single method by which that object can be secured. A policy adapted for products which are mostly imported is not equally suited to those which we produce chiefly at home. Conditions change from time to time and the method which is appropriate today may be out of date tomorrow. Our plans therefore must be capable of adjustment and at different times and for different purposes we have made use of tariff, subsidies and regulation of imports, together with various measures intended to lower costs of production and to increase efficiency both in production and in marketing.Under the Marketing Acts farmers have special statutory powers to organise their industry and to exercise complete control over the terms of sale of their produce, subject to the necessary public safeguards. By this means milk producers were able to save their industry from disaster in 1933, and pig producers with the assistance of regulated imports have been able to expand the pro­duction of pigs by 40% since 1931. Producers of hops and potatoes have greatly benefited by the stable conditions which their respective schemes have secured. Producers of horticultural products, on the other hand, have received substantial assistance through the imposition of customs duties. In the case of wheat, where home production is small in relation to imports the Wheat Act has given farmers security against slumps in world prices, while the Sugar Industry Act has made it possible to continue the growing of sugar beet and to secure that the industry shall be efficiently worked.Last session Parliament was engaged on important new policies to benefit the livestock industry and to build up the fertility of the land which has seriously deteriorated during the depression. A duty was imposed on foreign beef. Provision was made for a subsidy of £5,000,000 a year to help the beef producers and its distribution was so arranged as to encourage and assist the production of higher quality beef. The reorganisation of marketing, long overdue, has been tackled and experiments in central slaughtering have been put in hand with a view to reducing the gap between what the consumer pays and what the producer receives. Under the new Agriculture Act we are assisting the farmer to buy lime and basic slag for the purpose of restoring the fertility and productivity of his land and I am glad to say that the number of applica­tions we have already received shows that the farmers fully appreciate the importance of this measure. Under this same Act we are also helping land drainage schemes, we are giving some degree of insurance to growers of oats and barley and lastly we are taking steps to reduce the enormous losses, estimated at £14,000,000 a year, which are now being sustained in consequence of various animal diseases.This is a long list of measures, some of them very costly, which have been taken to maintain our agricultural industry, and they are evidence of the determination of the Government that agriculture shall not be neglected. There are, however, three branches of the industry which are causing us concern at the present time, namely, those engaged on the production of poultry, pigs and dairy products. The first you have been discussing in the course of the Conference and Mr. Morrison, our genial and very able Minister, has told you what he has in mind on that subject. In the pig and bacon industry, negotiations with the Pigs Board and the Bacon Board followed on the announcement of the Government\u2019s policy in July and they are proceeding satisfactorily. As to milk the general lines of our policy were laid down in the White Paper and put shortly they are these. The key to prosperity in the industry lies in the increase of the consumption of liquid milk. We believe that by publicity and in other ways that increase can be obtained, but it is essential that the public should have complete confidence in the cleanliness and purity of the milk supply if they are to increase their demand for what is one of the most valuable of human foods. Accordingly the Government are proposing to ask Parliament to provide additional Exchequer assistance estimated to amount to £14 millions in the first year for measures to further this object and to supplement the efforts the farmers themselves have been making to improve the quality of their milk.The difficulties that are being encountered in dealing with the milk problem illustrate both the inter­dependence of town and country and the need for mutual appreciation of one another\u2019s requirements. A fertile soil with healthy stock upon it capable of responding if need be to a call for increased production is an asset to the whole nation. A prosperous agriculture is a necessity to the towns since it provides industry with one of its best customers. But on the other hand I would ask farmers to bear in mind that in the purchasing power of the towns lies the very foundation of farming prosperity, and that in trying to help them the Government must be careful to preserve as far as possible all the sources of that purchasing power. Only by mutual understanding and mutual tolerance can we hope to preserve the stability which is essential to both town and country.PensionsWhen I had the privilege last year of addressing a similar meeting to this at Margate I was still Chancellor of the Exchequer. Since then I have handed over the responsibility for the National Finances to Sir John Simon, and it could not be in abler hands. But after nearly six years experience of that great office it would be difficult for me, even if I wished it, to banish its problems from my thoughts, and I cannot refrain tonight from saying a few words of warning to you about the future. It would be a mere hiding of our heads in the sand to imagine that when we have committed ourselves to the vast programme of expenditure on armaments that has been forced upon us, we can at the same time have just as much to spend on other things as if we lived in a peaceful world free from all anxiety and care about the intentions and ambitions of other countries. We may, and we do, deplore the stupidity, the futility of spending our money on weapons of destruction instead of things that would make us all happier and life more worth living, but \u2018needs must when the devil drives,\u2019 and the sight of what is going on in China today brings home to us that our safety from such horrors is more precious to us than anything else. But safety cannot be attained without sacrifice, and I say to you that I cannot see any prospect of our being able in the near future to introduce reforms which would add substantially to the present enormous annual expenditure of the country. I say this tonight because I notice that our Socialist opponents are making great play with a new contributory pensions scheme of £1 a week for a single person, and 35/- for a married couple at 65, provided they retire from employment, together with increased allowances to children of widows and to orphans. The full details of the scheme are contained in a report by the National Council of Labour which I hold in my hand. I do not complain of the Report, which goes very carefully into the whole question and concludes with an estimate of its cost. I have not checked the figures, but taking them as they stand, they show that the average cost of the scheme over the first ten years would be £85,000,000 a year.The authors of the Report state that it is not unreasonable or impracticable to ask for an additional 1/- a week from each insured male, and 9d. a week from each insured female employee and that if the employers also paid 1/- a week for each employee, whether male or female, in addition to what they pay now, the combined contribution of employers and employed would bring in the required £85,000,000. It is further suggested that if Budgetary conditions permitted, the State would find some portion of the £85,000,000, and to that extent the contributions could be reduced, but that the proportions to be contributed respectively by the State and the contributors must be settled when the scheme is intro­duced in the light of the conditions then prevailing.As I have said, I have not attempted to check the accuracy of these figures, nor do I want now to consider what would be the effect on industry and employment of the imposition of this new burden. What I want to call your attention to is the way this scheme is being presented to the public. It is recognised that they cannot be expected to read through the 32 pages of close print in this Report, and so the plan is dished up in a more attractive form with coloured pictures to be sold for a penny. But there is a significant omission in this broadsheet. Here we are told that \u2018Labour in power will immediately increase the present pension to £1 a week,\u2019 and that \u2018Labour\u2019s Pension Plan will mean that the vast majority of men and women in your Britain will be assured of a reasonably comfortable retirement.\u2019But about the £85 millions there is not a word. There is not a word to indicate that Labour\u2019s Pension Plan is not a free gift to the worker but is to be paid for by increased contributions which may be as much as 1/- a week additional to what he pays now. Well, I consider that dishonest politics, dishonest because it omits a vital consideration in any estimate of the value of the plan, and still more dishonest because it promises definitely benefits which, so far as I can see, this country will not for many years be able to afford.ConclusionI do not believe that tactics of this kind bring credit in the long run to the Party that adopts them, and I trust that our Party will never promise anything that we are not confident we can perform. There will still remain for us a wide field of practicable and useful reforms which will make no extravagant demands upon the national purse. Such is the new plan for improving the physical fitness of the nation which we have launched and which has aroused the greatest interest and enthusiasm, especially among the young people for whose benefit it has been devised. Let us apply our energies in the next few years to the preservation of peace, to perfecting our defence, to the pursuit of the policies which have brought our country to its present condition of general prosperity, to the introduction of such reforms as can wisely and prudently be undertaken and to the preservation of our free democratic institutions based on the principles of individual liberty and tolerance in which we have grown up. By concentration on a practical programme on these lines we shall deserve better of our country than by making promises, however brilliant, which can lead only to delusion and disappointment.

aVA year ago I was sitting, Madam Chairman, where you are. I had no idea then, nor, I suppose, had you, that within twelve months a General Election would have been fought and I should be addressing you in my present capacity.Sir Winston\u2019s brave message at that time is still fresh in all our minds, and I am sure, now that the formal Conference is over and we are at a public meeting (to which I am allowed to be admitted), I am sure that you would wish that we should send him a message of greeting, gratitude and good wishes from us all.I hope you will forgive me, but I do not propose to spend much time this afternoon talking about the political past, even the immediate political past. Of course, it would be very nice to sit down and do a little purring together - and we could. It would be gratifying for each one of us to do it. But my main purpose today is to look forward and not to look back.Therefore, about the General Election I have only a few words to say. First that, believe it or not, the decision to hold it was not an easy one. Apart from weighty national arguments I was conscious of at least two hoodoos: no Government in the history of this country, since universal franchise was in operation, had ever increased its majority; and that our Party - so I was told by everybody except Lord Woolton - did not like holding elections in the summer. As against this, I felt, and still feel that we had a message to give the country to which the electors would respond. And that was not some brave new elixir, but a message of service to our countrymen. We described to them what we had done, what the difficulties were, and what we proposed to do, and they have given us a mandate to get on with the job.That is what we mean to do, and it is about the future that I am going to speak to you now.  But I think I ought to recall this: a decisive element in our victory was unity. Never forget that. I have little doubt that the contrast we presented in this respect, shall we say, to the state of affairs elsewhere, did win us much support. We must now expect our opponents to learn their lesson and we must not forget ours while they learn theirs.Yet, despite our faith, despite the fervour of our voluntary supporters, despite the hard work of each one of you, the results of the General Election could not have been won without the loyalty and spirit of our organisation, presided over by the penetrating and avuncular genius of Lord Woolton.Lord Woolton, I am told, you know, that others are now beavering away to discover whether they can emulate what you have done. Some assert that it is mainly a matter of money and machinery. They could not be more wrong. As one who has watched you and your work closely during all these years, I would say without hesitation that your greatest gift to our organisation has been the sense of leadership and comradeship which brought a human understanding into the working of every single part of our machine.People speak of what you have done as creating some slick, Twentieth Century Party organisation. I hope you will forgive me if I say that that also is not the full explanation. It is the man much more than the method which has wrought these wonders. We thank you very much, and we thank Lady Woolton too, for her patience and for her kindness to us all and for her unfailing cheerfulness.We salute our new Chairman. Many of you know him well. He is young, energetic, and has the intelligence to grasp all the intricate problems which will fall to him as Chairman of the Party. He knows some of them already, so some of the headaches will be familiar. I am sure that he will give us brilliant service. To him and to Donald Kaberry, who has the fine qualities of that staunch county from which he hails, we wish all success and all good fortune.Our first task at home is to do battle with our economic problems. These are formidable but they have been worse. They can be solved if we take the necessary measures now. And that is precisely what we propose to do. We shall only be able to fulfil our hopes for social improvements of all kinds if we can build a stable and progressive economy. The action which our wise and experienced Chancellor took last February and again last July has had its effect. That is what we would expect, for we have the utmost confidence in him.In this connection I have just received the provisional trade figures for September. I thought you would like to have them: Imports £304,000,000; Exports £243,000,000 (These figures are approximate); Re-exports £11,000,000.The trade gap for September was therefore £50,000,000 compared with £68,000,000 in August and £108,000,000 in July. The September gap is actually about the same as the average monthly gap last year, and these exports of £243,000,000 for September bring the total figure of exports for the first nine months of this year to the formidable total of £2,123,000,000, which is nearly six per cent above the first nine months of last year.These results are encouraging. They show that the action which we have already taken has been right. But we cannot be sure that this will be enough alone. Nor is this a business where any doubt can be allowed to creep in. Therefore, we must do more in the way of corrective measures. We have been at work examining all this during the last weeks, and our plans are now ready. I cannot tell you this afternoon what additional measures we propose to take. That statement will be made as soon as Parliament meets, and we shall give priority to dealing with these matters.Now there is another consideration. In our efforts to carry through this work, many Departments of State will have a part to play. This will be a combined operation. I think it important that the same team of Ministers should handle unchanged the essential work we have to do in these coming weeks. For this reason I have asked my colleagues to remain at their posts for the present. And that\u2019s that.These measures of which I have just spoken must be largely concerned with reducing excessive home demand on our resources. But it is just as important to increase the efficiency of our production. We want not only to export enough in order to pay our way, but to have a surplus, and we want to use that surplus at home and to do all those things which you have rightly asked for at this Conference, and most important of all to get ahead with schemes for development in the Commonwealth and Empire.And yet, as you well know, the Government can only create the conditions. It is industry which must create the wealth. British industry has been doing powerful work, men and management alike deserve praise for the increase in production which has been won.  The figures I have just given show it. We ought not to forget that the greater part of industry has been running with smoothness and goodwill.As you know, I have personally had talks in the last few months with the leading employers and trade unionists, representatives of all sections of industry. Our invaluable Minister of Labour is following up this matter, and we hope that the discussions which are now going on will lead to constructive ideas and action.We also welcome the steps which have been taken in the last few months by the TUC in this field of industrial relations I am particularly anxious to see the growth of what I call \u2018partnership in industry,\u2019 and I use the word \u2018partnership,\u2019 as the Minister of Labour did yesterday, in its widest sense. I include in it joint consultation, the giving of full information to employees about the affairs of the companies in which they work, and also profit sharing in a number of forms, particularly when it offers opportunities for employees to hold shares, and so acquire a real stake in the enterprise in which they work.Now I would ask every firm in this country to consider carefully and urgently whether they cannot introduce further measures to promote the sense of partnership of which I speak.In this and in other ways I believe that we can, over the years, bring greater peace throughout industry and at the same time we shall do something more than that. We shall make work a more satisfying part of life and thereby raise the whole quality of our free society.Well now, from questions of peace in industry I must go for a moment to questions of peace in the world, and I begin by saying that I am sure we all wish the Foreign Secretary all possible success at his Conference this month. We know that he will do all that man can do.After the Foreign Secretary and I had concluded our work at the Conference of Heads of Governments at Geneva in July, I used some words at the final session which I would like to quote to you. They were these: \u2018If we can continue our work together in the spirit of this meeting, what is hopeful purpose today should become solid performance as events unfold.\u2019I see no need to change those words or to modify their emphasis in any way.Since the Conference closed, volumes have been written about it in many lands, some acclaiming with enthusiasm the Geneva spirit, others decrying the results as of little value, or even harmful. It doesn\u2019t seem to me to be necessary to take such an extreme view either way. Indeed, to do so is to misconceive both what was done at Geneva and the work we now have to do. The meeting of the four Heads of Governments didn\u2019t resolve any one of the stubborn problems which still confront the world. But it wasn\u2019t meant to do so. All that it could do was to chart a course - to prepare an agenda if you like - to make it possible for the Foreign Secretaries to meet and get to grips with problems which so far we have not been able to discuss across the table with any useful result at all.Now, I want to give you two examples of what I mean from my all too long experience of this business. In the spring and early summer of 1951 there was a conference in Paris at the Palais Rose. They had 74 formal meetings, believe it or not, and at the end of them, after four months of weary work, they had not managed to agree on an agenda. That was good going.And again, there were nearly 400 meetings with the Russians about Austria before any progress at all was made, and after our Berlin Conference last January, which I remember so well, and Soviet Russia\u2019s stubborn refusal there, nothing seemed less likely than that Austria would be free this year and all the foreign troops withdrawn. Yet that is what has happened.Well, what moral should we draw from all this? That we must not be surprised at setbacks. They are inevitable. We must not be exasperated at what sometimes seems the unintelligent repetition of old arguments till we are weary and sick of them. The processes of diplomacy are slow but behind all this repetition of public and private argument, conciliation may grow and the power of peace, prevail. No doubt the discussions later this month will be difficult. It is quite possible that after weeks of negotiation they will be adjourned without any progress made. I cannot tell, but of this at least I am certain, that the international anxieties in Europe and the Far East are less immediately acute today that they were when you and I met at Blackpool a year ago. And that let me tell you, is something to be able to say.But this does not mean that the Great Powers of the world have changed their purposes. I do not think that they have. But it could be, you know, that the knowledge of the weapons which some of them now command is helping to create a feeling of \u2018maybe we had better go along without trying to get all we want, because to try to get all we want might blow us where we don\u2019t particularly want to go.\u2019If this degree of wisdom has been learned, it is likely that any Government which today has far-reaching ambitions in an imperialist sense will say to itself \u2018better go slowly,\u2019 or, in the words of the Persian proverb: \u2018Patience is from God and haste is from the devil.\u2019 And if the world has learned only that in this year of grace 1955, it deserves a friendly mark in history.I wish I could stop there. But the Middle Eastern situation is serious and could be dangerous. Everyone knows of the tension between Israel and Egypt, and how each country tries to build up its armaments to be stronger than the other. There are grave risks in this. Not only because we are faced with the crudest form of arms race, but because there is always the danger that the one which believes that it is today the stronger may be tempted to strike first. That is how wars have often begun in the past.We have worked for a long time past by all manner of methods to try to bring about a reduction of tension in that part of the world. We have also tried to hold the balance even as regards the delivery of armaments. But now, if a Great Power from outside steps in with supplies on an infinitely larger scale, the risks are going to be intensified. That is inevitable. Here is, surely, an occasion where the Great Powers ought to agree to exercise restraint themselves and to join together to restrain others. That seems to me what the spirit of Geneva ought to mean.As I look back over recent years, certain influences have moulded our diplomacy and helped to chart our progress; I\u2019d just like to mention them.First, most important of all, the constant unity of the Commonwealth, which has become a more active influence in world affairs in recent years. You know there is no doubt that the judgment of its members played its part in South East Asia when a year ago we faced in Indo-China a crisis which endangered the peace of the world. The influence of the Commonwealth will always be felt rather than enforced in world affairs. But it is nonetheless important for that.In this connection, I am sure you will all have been happy to read of the meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers, which is to take place in London next summer.  I look forward to it with pleasure and confidence. I know, from many discussions I have had over years gone by with almost every member of the Conference, how valuable their joint advice can be to us and to the world.  There is really nothing like it.And then there is our close partnership with the United States of America. And here I must express on behalf of each one of us our deep regret at President Eisenhower\u2019s illness and our warm-hearted wishes for his speedy recovery. For it is fair to say that no foreigner in his lifetime has ever been more truly loved by the British people. We feel that he is in part ours too, and I know our American friends will understand that.It is my unshaken faith that so long as the friendship of our two nations endures, the peace of the world will not be broken.Finally, there is the unity of Western Europe, the unity which has grown and found expression in trade, in travel, in treaties.  All that is good, very good, because it is an expression of a political reality.These are the prevailing forces in world affairs. Watch them closely. So long as their influence does not wane, we are moving along the path to peace.I would have liked to discuss disarmament with you. I hope to do so - or the Foreign Secretary will - in greater detail later. This afternoon I will only say this.The first aim is to reduce tension at points of contact. It is for that purpose I submitted a plan at Geneva.  The next chapter depends on progress with German unity.  We in the West and the Russians have different views about this. In my judgment, European security can never be based on the division of Germany for an indefinite period. It was with this end in mind that we put forward at Geneva a plan for a Five Power pact to give confidence and security to all.Finally, looming over everything, there is nuclear warfare and the hydrogen bomb. The bomb which has compelled the nations to talk against a terrifying backcloth of universal destruction. Here, of course, it is the problem of supervision and control which is all-important. Many ideas have been canvassed. But I do not think that any one country has found a final solution yet. We have put forward constructive ideas on several occasions. No doubt they can be improved. We are ready at any time to discuss them and other thoughts and projects to find a solution, as we must do.Peace in the modern world is closely associated with defence. I have always held that to build up the defensive military strength of the West would improve the international situation. And so it has turned out. It was the conclusion of the Paris agreements, whether some people like it or not, it was the conclusion of those agreements that made the Geneva talks possible at all. One certain way to reverse the process of easing tension would be to slacken our defence effort and to try to negotiate from weakness. We have no intention of doing anything of the kind so long as the responsibility lies with us.Of course, that does not mean that our defence programme has got to be inflexible. The Minister of Defence and I and the Service Ministers have been examining our long-term plans for the defence forces. These, I may tell you, present some pretty baffling problems. We have got to take into account our overseas obligations. We have got to consider the cost of our programme, haven\u2019t we? And every new weapon, with its improved performance, and probably with additional gadgets as well, is sure to do one thing, it is sure to cost more than the weapon that was there before. We have to weigh the demands that defence makes on our resources of manpower and materials. And we have to be sure that our forces are fitted in size and in equipment for what they have to do.Our examination of all this vexing business has made good progress since the General Election last May. The Minister of Defence has been tireless in his efforts and I am now reviewing with him our research programme, to make quite sure that our main effort is concentrated at the right places.Last June, some of you will remember, we transferred from the Ministry of Supply certain functions connected with iron and steel and the engineering industries. That has proved, I think, a wise decision. It has meant that the Minister of Supply can now devote more attention to the provision of military equipment. It has also meant that his Ministry has become mainly a fourth Defence Department within the co-ordinating powers of the Minister of Defence. Now as you will see, all this takes us a further step towards our objective, which is to secure a closer integration of our forces and of their supply.Now the Minister of Defence, if he is to do his work effectively, must he able to direct policy over the whole of this field, and I am considering what further changes of organisation can be made to enable us to handle smoothly and effectively these vital questions of defence policy.Our detailed plans for all this readjustment of the defence forces will be explained and examined when the White Paper and the Service Estimates are put before Parliament early in the New Year. But I wanted to tell you now what it is we are trying to do.And now there is one special matter to which I must refer, and that is the manpower in the forces. We have made enough progress with our other plans to make it possible for me to say something definite on that topic today. I feel it my duty to give to the country the conclusions the Government have reached at the earliest possible opportunity.Now what is the position today? At present there are about 800,000 men and women in the forces, of whom about 280,000 are National Servicemen. Her Majesty\u2019s Government have decided that by the end of the financial year 1957-58, the strength of the Services shall be reduced to about 680,000 men and 20,000 women. This will be a reduction of about 100,000 upon the present figure. But over the five years, from March 1953 to March 1958, it will he a reduction of 170,000, or more than 20 per cent, a very substantial figure by any standard you care to apply.Well now, how to effect this reduction.  The reduction must be gradual. Nothing could be more inefficient or cause more disorganisation in the forces than sudden and violent fluctuations in manpower.  We have had this before. The decrease will be about 20,000 in the next six months and about 40,000 in each of the following financial years.We are confident that we can discharge our Treaty obligations and maintain our position as a world power despite this reduction in numbers.  Now the precise extent to which the reduction will affect National Servicemen will depend on how successful we are in encouraging regular recruitment. We want all the volunteers we can get. And with this end in view, the Government are again considering pay and conditions of service for the regular forces - it is good economy - and our decisions about these will be announced at the time of the Service Estimates at about the beginning of the year.I have been considering for some time what is the most efficient and fairest method of bringing about the reduction we propose in the burden of National Service, and it is a pretty intricate question. I do not believe that a system of selective service or of balloting would be acceptable to the people of this country.  We think that is so and I am glad you agree. The effective choice lies between reducing the period of service and reducing the number of young men called up every year. The difficulty about an immediate reduction in the period of service - and I don\u2019t conceal it from you - is that it would inevitably lead to a reduction in the numbers of the fully trained men, whom we most need. That is because the cut would fall upon the most useful period of a man\u2019s service. At this moment in the international situation, and having regard to the state of our overseas commitments, this is a reduction for which I am not prepared to be responsible. And so we have decided that for the present the reduction will be brought about by calling up fewer young men each year.The age of call-up will rise, the period of service remaining at 24 months. But we hold ourselves free to decide in the light of future developments in the international situation, whether the reduction we intend to make in the size of the forces shall continue to be brought about in this way or by reducing the period of service. The option will remain open to us. I think that was the fairest system we could possibly devise. And so this year there will he only three registrations instead of the usual four, and the age of call-up for the balance of this year will be about 18 years and five months.Plans are also being made for a reduced call-up next year. If the whole of the proposed reduction in the size of the forces were to be carried out by allowing the age of call-up to rise, the normal age of call-up would reach 19 years. But it will still remain possible for men to apply for early call-up when good reasons exist.We realise that we must make sure that those called up are used efficiently, and vigorous steps are being taken to investigate cases where it is alleged that men\u2019s time is being wasted. And we have also decided - I hope you will think rightly - to reduce the burden of part-time service for National Servicemen, because the roles of these forces have been changing. Some men are required for the Mobile Defence Corps, some are needed to man the Control and Reporting Organisation of the Royal Air Force, some to bring active formations up to war strengths - two reserve divisions are earmarked for NATO. But the conception of reserve forces waiting to take part in large-scale conventional warfare is, in our judgment, out of date. Therefore, in the event of a nuclear war the primary role of the reserve army would be to help to maintain the life of the nation and to deal with raids and sabotage.For those purposes we need a different type of training and organisation and it will be introduced. The present requirement for part-time training of National Servicemen is 60 days including three camps, spread over three and a half years.  We consider that this requirement should be reduced to a maximum of 20 days including one camp.There are, however, two or three categories to whom this will not apply. Except for these categories, National Servicemen, who have already done one period of continuous training will not be required to do further training, and that decision will apply from 31st December this year.As I have said, this decision with regard to the reserve forces links them with the work of civil defence. It is obvious with the development of nuclear weapons there are new problems to be faced, and we are at work on these, In the first place, we must think of this question as one problem of home defence, which is a better term than civil defence, a defence in which both civil and military forces have to take part.I have made certain arrangements within the Government, to co-ordinate planning and training for this purpose under the Minister of Defence. A full-time Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces, will be appointed in the near future.We shall intensify our research work to find means of reducing the damage caused by nuclear attack, and that applies particularly to what is called \u2018fall-out.\u2019All these matters, believe me, are much more important than the provision of large material resources.  Much useful work is being done by voluntary workers. I thank them for what they are doing.Finally, I would like to give you some reflections on our country\u2019s future as I see it. We are today in an exciting but difficult transition period. It is quite true that employment has never been so high, quite true that prosperity has never been so widespread. Perhaps the British people taken as a whole have never enjoyed a happier summer than this one, under those \u2018wicked Tories.\u2019  But we are looking ahead and in this highly competitive modern world, our island has always to be in the lead, or our people have no future.At the moment one of our greatest difficulties is that we are short of an essential raw material, coal, and to import coal is difficult and places a strain on our balance of payments. I do not want to blame anyone for this because, you know, the reasons for it are many of them complicated and go back quite a long way. Personally, I consider, and I am not ashamed to say it, that in present conditions of a wide demand for labour, it is remarkable that so many miners stand so loyally to their task. But still the problem is there.  If we could get 20,000,000 more tons of coal a year - the Chancellor will agree - or its equivalent in other fuels, the outlook would be transformed. Now, in time, that is going to happen.The new discoveries on which our scientists and engineers are engaged are going to change the whole pattern of the future for this country and other countries too. That prospect is continually widening, and no one can tell what the final meaning and message of all this is going to be.  But, of course, we must keep right in the front.In these last weeks I have seen more of the work which is being done in this nuclear world. I can assure you that it is immensely impressive. We have all to re-think many of our problems, domestic as well as international, and we are doing so. But meanwhile, there is one problem which has been pressed upon me from all sides: the shortage of young scientists and designers. It isn\u2019t any part of my purpose to enter into arguments about the value of one form of education as against another (As Chancellor of a University I should get into great trouble if I did).  But of this I am certain, unless we can hold our own with the other great nations - Russia and the United States in particular - in scientific research and its application in engineering design, we shall fall behind in the industrial race.  At this moment there are not enough young men in this country studying these subjects. If they will come forward, if with their help we can continue to keep abreast of every new development, we shall be ready, whether the new world bursts or creeps upon us. It is for these reasons that I have agreed with the Chancellor of the Exchequer - and I am deeply grateful for his help - that whatever the difficulties, balance of payments or others, nothing will be cut away from the necessary work in this nuclear sphere, or in the training of our scientific manpower.Now I have finished and I have spoken to you - I apologise for the length - for almost an hour, you may have noticed I have tried to give you a close account of some of the work which our Government has been doing since it received your mandate last May. If I were to tell you of the many other things you would be here for at least another hour, but I thought you would wish to have directly from me at this great Conference some account of our stewardship. You may also have noticed that I have not mentioned the words \u2018Socialism\u2019 or \u2018Nationalisation.\u2019 You know, truth to tell, I think they are just a little bit out of date.If we are as a country to rise to the heights which we can attain, and of which I have tried to give you some glimpse as I see them in the nuclear world, if we can do that we shall need certain qualities from our people. We shall need imagination; we shall need inspiration; we shall need individual effort and enterprise and a willingness to sacrifice at times our personal position or authority in the wider interests of the nation\u2019s good. We shall need all these things and more. We believe that our Party has the political mission to fulfil them, and we believe that because it has that mission we were returned at the last General Election; and because it has that we belong to this day and age.Now, what I am asking from you this afternoon is your help, when you go back to the constituencies, to enable my colleagues and myself to go on with this work so that we can - as I believe it is well in our power - lead the world in this new scientific age and discover something of the mysteries which today cloud the vision of man.

aVLet me first congratulate all of you here, and the speakers both from the body of the hall and from the platform on the outcome of this most successful Conference. Your resolutions have covered all the great issues of the day at home and abroad I am sure that the nation as a whole will have noted the wisdom and the sense of responsibility with which you have discussed them. The Party is the stronger for our meeting here together.You have discussed our economic problems against the background of present world events. In this you were wise. For it is useless to discuss our economic problems against the background of the British Isles alone. That is why the Socialist doctrine of equality makes no sense. The world has moved on since the nineteenth century when so much Socialist theory was developed.Scientific progress has become a gallop instead of a trot. Our own position \u2013 our country\u2019s position - no longer rests on its old foundations which seemed so secure. By now everyone should know that our life depends on our ability in brains and skill to do better than our competitors in world markets. There is no other way by which we can live. We cannot insulate British life from world competition, and try to build here some academic society all at one level regardless of the challenge of the world outside.It is from that world outside that we have to get much of our food and most of our raw materials. Nobody is going to give them to us. They have all to be bought and paid for, and we can pay only if we sell our goods in the face of keen and growing competition.It is only if our own people are more intelligent, more adaptable, more eager, better taught than our rivals that we can hope to maintain the present standard of life of our people. And no nation can maintain these qualities in a rigidly equal Socialist state. What we need is opportunity by means of education, incentive and reward, all three. It is a favourite phrase of the Socialist Party that \u2018Socialism is about equality.\u2019 I distrust most sweeping generalisations. But there is a sense in which we can say that \u2018modern Conservatism is about opportunity.\u2019 And please note how sharp the contrast is. The nearer one approaches to complete equality the more limited the opportunities of life must become. So it is that our aim is the very opposite of the Socialist equality state. There is nothing whatever to be gained for anybody from the old gag \u2018soak the rich.\u2019 That is not the way to move forward. To make progress there must be confidence that the harder we work the more ingenious our skill, the richer the returns, not merely in money, but in a fuller way of life for all. That also is the way in which to impress the world both with the energy and the enterprise of our people.Nobody - no Party - wants to see unemployment in this country. There is one certain way to bring it about and that is to fail to compete and sell our goods abroad.  In this country an individual who falls behind in the race can look for help to the State in many directions. That is right. But a nation which fails to keep up, that nation has to bear as best it can all the heavy penalties of failure. And that is not just a party doctrine or prejudice I am expressing. It s the harsh, inescapable fact of our island life, which no theory and no wishful thinking can alter.Most damaging to our country are the Socialist statements at their last Party conference. They amount to encouragement of Middle Eastern countries to nationalise oil and other undertakings which we - British brains and skill and capital - have done so much to develop. Any such action would, of course, be disastrous to the countries themselves. The Mossadeq experiment showed us that. But it would he disastrous to us all. There is an utter inconsistency - reckless inconsistency - between Socialist foreign and domestic policy, as they outlined it at Blackpool. How can we at one and the same time abandon our interests abroad, invite foreigners to nationalise them, and improve our social services at home? Greater nonsense has never been uttered.We have now to consider what can be done nationally to increase both opportunity and incentive. This is the aim of our Party. It is unjust to pretend that in the period of Conservative Government, we have not made efforts to create opportunity and to encourage incentives. We would have liked to do more. I admit it. We are now trying - the Chancellor labours at that constantly with a persistence for which we should be grateful - to improve our national finances and to encourage savings to make this possible. I must recall to you that in four years, you, Mr. Chairman, three times reduced direct taxation at all levels. This was all the more remarkable when we recall the crumbling inheritance left to you by the present Leader of the Opposition. Mr. Macmillan, in his first Budget this April, did something equally important. He gave new incentives to saving. I know some people scoffed at Mr. Macmillan\u2019s plans to make savings more attractive. Well, now you know that they were wrong.Lord Mackintosh, the Chairman of the National Savings Movement, has just told us that in the last six months small savings have been a record, the best for eight years. Mr. Macmillan\u2019s Budget, Lord Mackintosh says, has had a tonic effect. And, I add, the most lively - that is the most controversial of the new projects - is not due till next month.The Budget did something else. It made more possible for the self-employed and others to provide for their retirement, and that\u2019s a matter of the greatest importance to a very large number of people. Don\u2019t doubt this, we want to do more to reduce the burden of taxation. The Chancellor knows, as we all know, that this weighs heavily on those with fixed incomes and what are loosely called the middle classes. The spending power of our money affects them too.  The Chancellor of the Exchequer might have given more of his surplus away this year, as it was tempting to do, before he had built up our reserves and strengthened our balance of payments. The result in the short run would have been encouraging to you, but in the long run it would have proved no help but a further blow to those on fixed incomes most affected by the fall in the value of money.The position is now improving, thanks to the Chancellor\u2019s sternness and his efforts. Now we shall take the first opportunity to give whatever further help we can. But all action must be governed by the national interest. This has never been, and is never going to be, as long as I have anything to do with it, a class Party. We have been handicapped, it\u2019s true, in certain respects by a legacy which we have to carry, even though it is a proud one. Half the world\u2019s trade is still being carried on in sterling with a margin of reserves much below what we would wish. That is a direct consequence of the sacrifices of two world wars. It is also a condition which constantly limits our ability to do what we want to do at home because of its effect on the world exchanges.Since I last spoke to you, the Government has been fighting a grim battle against inflation, which means encouraging exports at the expense of the home market. We have had some success in this. Despite all difficulties, many of our industries are showing a splendid example. In these last months we have been winning a growing number of orders in the highly competitive dollar market, and this year our earnings of dollars have increased steadily.Of course, we knew that none of the steps we took to improve the balance of trade - none of them - could be popular. They haven\u2019t been. But they are working. Our exports, which are the real test of our nation\u2019s life, are ten per cent above last year, our imports this year are only one per cent above last year. Or, to put it another way, the gap between our exports and our imports has on the average been £22,000,000 a month less than it was last year. In other words, the credit squeeze is working as it was intended to work. It is, in fact, forcing the inflation out of the economy. The process is extremely disagreeable - I know that - but it is healthy, and it is going to have this result. We shall be more competitive with other nations, but we shall no longer enjoy - and we have to face it - easy money or increases in profits or in wages which have not been earned. That is the answer to those who have said that our measures were ineffective.  It is also the answer to those who clamour for them to be relaxed. They cannot be until the cure is carried further.This is always a difficult time of the year for our gold and dollar reserves. But we can at least note an improvement on 1955. The reserves since January have increased by £74,000,000. Last year in the same period they fell by £148,000,000. It is quite true - I must immediately add this - that in the total this year must be included the sale of the Trinidad Oil Company. This sale hit the headlines. But news which does this sometimes distorts the picture. What is less well known is what I am going to tell you now - that during this year our investment in the oil industry overseas, including the Commonwealth, will much more than offset the Trinidad sale. At the end of the year our stake in the oil industry overseas outside this country will show a very considerable increase over 1955.However unpopular the credit squeeze, it is all part of the battle against rising prices. Victory here finally depends upon the soundness of our economy. And it is the long-term results that count. That is why we have abolished some food subsidies, notably that on bread. We have done that in the interests of the soundness of our economy. It cannot be right indefinitely to subsidise one food, however important, and to allow everybody, however wealthy, to gain personally thereby. Despite the abolition of the subsidies, the cost of living has remained more stable than it did last year, and, of course, much more stable than it did in 1951, when the Socialists were last in office. In that year the rise was 12 per cent. So far this year the rise has been two per cent. And that at a time when the cost of living has begun to rise in other countries, including the United States and Canada.Indeed, some prices are falling. The farming industry has suffered from a fall in fat-stock prices. This was much sharper than we had expected when our price system was worked out. We therefore felt it right to see at once what we could do to put matters right more speedily. We have decided to work out an improved system with the farmers\u2019 representatives, as a result of which the Government will authorise a substantial supplementary payment. The Chancellor of the Exchequer has agreed to provide a sum of about £l0,000,000, with the aim of bringing the average return to the industry for the current livestock year closer to the standard price of 151/- a cwt. I am sure you will agree that it is only just that we should bring immediate help to an important section of that industry.This wretched substitute for a summer has enormously increased the difficulties of all engaged in agriculture. They have made a most gallant effort to bring in the harvest against all odds.Over the general field of the cost of living, the essential now is to keep the steadiness in prices which is being so hardly won. We can do it. But we can do it only if we put an end to the constantly rising spiral in wages and prices forcing each other up. The real test of the wage packet is what it will buy, and the only way to make it buy more is to produce more.  There isn\u2019t any other. And what is true of wages is just as true of profits.I have spoken of incentive. And now about opportunity. Here we have been creating throughout the land educational opportunities far exceeding anything that this country has ever known. Despite all the pressures upon the economy and many other claims on our resources, we have maintained high priority for education. I am sure that this is a good national investment. We are opening ten new schools every week. Most of these are secondary schools, because it is there that the need for increased accommodation will chiefly be felt in the next few years. In five years time one child out of every three over the age of 11 will be receiving his education in a new school. That\u2019s not all. Through the ingenuity of two successive Ministers of Education, we are doing this at little more than half the cost per school place under the Socialist Government.We have also multiplied the opportunities for careers for boys and girls in the many spheres of technical education. We have not been dawdling either. We published our White Paper, you may remember, on Technical Education this spring. It allowed for £80,000,000 of capital expenditure for the next five years. I can report to you that £50,000,000 worth of these building projects, which represent commitments of local authorities as far ahead as March 1959, have already been approved. This includes the help we are giving to the colleges of advanced technology, most important for the future of our industrial life, but not the additional help which we are giving to universities. We don\u2019t believe in too much central control in development of this kind. The men on the spot best know the needs of local industry. We do believe in encouraging and guiding this programme, which is so fateful for our future, and surely all this work is better than arguing the point, so dear to the Socialist heart, whether every boy, or no boy - they are not sure which - can go to a public school?It is in this same spirit of working for the future that we have approached the problem of the development of nuclear power, most exciting of all topics at the present time. We have deliberately given these projects a certain privileged position. Already we have earned a reward because the two new atomic power stations now soon to be built, will produce about twice as much power as seemed likely when the project was being discussed eighteen months ago.This is 1956. It is not 1906 and the period of Taff Vale.  Nor is it 1926 and the General Strike. It is in the consciousness of this that we have had repeated and, I think, useful discussions with representatives of the Trades Union Congress since we came into power. We think that it is right for the Government to keep in touch with the representatives of organised labour.  But I am sure that responsible trade union opinion understands as well as we do what are the realities of our respective positions in the State.  It is not for me to define the responsibilities of others. But we, as the elected Government of this country, are answerable through Parliament to the electors of this country and only to them. It is our duty to put forward the policies which we believe to be right. This we shall do. And as long as Parliament supports us, we will carry them through.I am very glad of the welcome which the Conference gave yesterday to the idea of the contract of service. This is absolutely in accordance with the principles we believe in here. We wish the Minister of Labour all success in his efforts to make this proposal a reality in British industry.There are all sorts of forecasts about the future of our Party. We are very grateful for them. I am sure they are all givers with the best intentions. People amuse themselves by taking our temperature for us several times a month. They don\u2019t often get it right. But all this is of little importance provided we hold to our principles, know where we are coming and are determined to get there. This Government has every determination to fulfil its mandate, which is for the whole life of a Parliament. When that work is done it will be the time to judge us. In the meanwhile, what matters most to us, and, if I may say so, to me as Leader of the Party, is the virility and imagination of the support we are receiving from the younger generation. I believe that to be growing, and from natural causes.  What is the good of saying to a young man: \u2018Work hard, seize your opportunities.  And at the end of 20 years of brilliant effort you may hope to gain equality, or, perhaps, if you are very fortunate your industry may be nationalised?\u2019 For those are to this day the purposes of Socialist policies. It is only in their ranks that anyone can still be found so reactionary as to want to extend nationalisation to any other industry. But make no mistake about it. They still exist, and if the Socialists were ever elected they would still carry out that policy. Their left outside - I beg pardon - their outside left wing, now centre forward, would see to that. Yet if there is one issue upon which the overwhelming majority of this country is united, it is this: no more nationalisation. In our ranks we want to create for our \u2018younger\u2019 supporters an atmosphere in which they can instinctively feel that they are at home in a national Party.A Party which believes in our nation\u2019s future can inspire our people to put its strength into what it seeks to do. If the younger generation knows this, if it knows it is going to be given better opportunities, if it is tingling with technical skill, if it knows that greater effort will win greater reward, then young people are going to join our ranks. They will understand that we, and not the embittered equalisers, are their hope.I am glad, therefore, that the Young Conservatives among you are going back from this Conference to start a new drive for membership on Monday. You are losing no time about it. And please, even in your drive for membership, look for quality rather than quantity. You are already the largest political youth organisation in the country - indeed, I believe, in the free world.  It is good, even so, to add to your members. Go out and search for new recruits. But make sure that they are the young men and women who really share your faith, your vision and your determination for your country\u2019s future. There we have the emblems of the campaign upon which you are shortly to start.  We all wish you luck in that effort.I look forward to meeting thousands of you at the Festival Hall in London next month at the end of your campaign. I take this opportunity to urge all the senior branches of our Association to do everything in their power to lend a hand in this campaign.I will now speak to you about the situation in respect of the Suez Canal dispute. Before we examine the political implications of this event I must record in plainest terms the economic impact upon our life in this country of any hostile interference in the free passage of the Canal. It is no exaggeration to say that this is a matter of survival for us as a trading nation. It concerns the employment, the standard of living and the pay packet of every man and woman in the land.Many charges have been brought against the Government by our critics in this country. The most fantastic of them is that we have not acted in accordance with the United Nations Charter. Nothing could be further from the truth, and no such accusation can be maintained by anybody who has either read the Charter or followed our course of action. To prove this I must briefly recall to you what we have done.First, we consulted with our two principal Allies. Then we called together the 24 principal users of the Canal. With two exceptions only, Egypt and Greece, they accepted the invitation to London.  The conference was brilliantly conducted with the Foreign Secretary in the Chair.  Within a week, eighteen nations agreed to a set of proposals put forward by the United States in agreement with France and ourselves. They were designed to ensure the efficient operation, maintenance and development of the Canal in co-operation with Egypt, and with due regard to her rights and interests. The eighteen nations also agreed that these proposals should be presented to Egypt as a basis for negotiation.All of this was entirely in accord with the Charter, Article 33 of which enjoins us to attempt to reach a settlement through negotiation. We did so. A mission was then selected to go to Cairo on behalf of the eighteen nations. Five countries were chosen, recall them: Australia, the United States, Persia, Ethiopia and Sweden, representing the four corners of the earth. Is anybody going to call those colonial powers? I would not. They were in fact representatives of the 18 users of the Canal, whose total traffic forms more than 90 per cent of the total. We were fortunate when Mr. Menzies, the Prime Minister of Australia, undertook the Chairmanship. We owe a great debt to him. Could any men have shown more patience than these five did in explaining the unanimous view of the 18 powers to Colonel Nasser? Was that wrong? Was that against the Charter?  Or perhaps was that colonialism? Clearly, the 18 powers did not think so.  Yet Colonel Nasser turned down the proposals and made no counter-proposal.It was then we decided to set up an Association of Users of the Canal. The terms of reference announced by the French Government and by ourselves were identical because they had been agreed in advance with the Government of the United States. Of course, this Association was at no time intended to take the place of the basis of negotiation offered by the 18 powers. It was designed to safeguard the rights and interest of the users pending a permanent settlement.All that again is in accord with both the letter and the spirit of Article 33 of the Charter. Indeed, let me tell you this, to have gone to the Security Council without any previous attempt at direct negotiation would have been contrary to the provisions of the Charter; and to have gone to the Security Council without previous consultation amongst the users of the Canal would have been to invite confusion. The Security Council would have been discussing the subject without any plan or set of principles to guide it.  When the 18 nations met in London for the second time they had before them these proposals for a Users\u2019 Association, as well as Colonel Nasser\u2019s reply delivered after Mr. Menzies had left Cairo. The 18 powers were unanimous in regarding Colonel Nasser\u2019s reply as unacceptable.It was in these circumstances that we and the French Government decided to take the issue to the Security Council, having given notice that we were likely to do so a fortnight before. How can anyone pretend that our conduct has been other than completely in accord with our obligations to UNO? The whole storm about this at home has been utterly artificial and partisan, and unworthy of any political party in this country.  There was never any question of whether we should go to UNO, only when.  And on timing the Government of the day must be the judge.  We can hand that over to nobody else. For the Government has to consider not only public opinion in its own country but the views and opinions of other nations, in particular of its Allies.I want to remind you that the Socialist Government itself pursued a precisely similar course in respect of the Berlin Airlift, the most important international issue since the war until now. The Socialist Government did not go to the Security Council in six weeks, as we did, but after three and a half months. We did not chivvy and abuse them for this. On the contrary, we supported them, because we knew that they were playing the hand, and we thought that the country\u2019s interest should come before any attempt at mere party advantage. Have you ever thought of this? Had we been in office at that time, I wonder how much support a Conservative Government would have received, had it pursued exactly the same policy in respect of that event, as did the Labour Government.  It is, indeed, extraordinary in 1956 to find the Socialist Party, of all Parties, abandoning internationalism in favour of ultra-nationalism.Through all these negotiations, difficult as they have been, peace has been our aim. But not peace at any price. And I will tell you why. Because in dealing with a dictatorship, peace at any price means to increase step by step the dangers of universal war. What is at stake here is not just the Canal, important though that is. It is the sanctity of international engagements. This is the supreme lesson of the period between the wars. I can never forget it.You know, when the United Nations Charter was negotiated, as far as this country was concerned, by an all Party delegation which I had the honour to lead, in the closing months of the war, when we were debating the ratification of the Charter in the House of Commons, Mr. Attlee, as he was then, was Prime Minister. He then rightly pointed out - and I want you to note this - he pointed to \u2018a great advance\u2019 on the original draft, due to a United Kingdom initiative. Originally the Charter had only said that international disputes should be settled by peaceful means, in its final form it declared that such disputes must also be settled \u2018in conformity with the principles of justice and international law.\u2019 Thus, I ask you to note, we have not only the right but the obligation to see that the principles of justice and international law are upheld. When Colonel Nasser seized the Canal, we thought it our duty to take certain military steps in the Eastern Mediterranean. The Government has no intention of modifying or withdrawing from this decision. In order to carry it out, Parliament gave us without a vote certain powers which we have used, but not abused.  Those precautions had to be taken to enable us to take action in defence of British life and interests, or in any other emergency that might arise in the area concerned.All that we have done since is completely in accord with what I said at the time. The movement of every unit has been either to British territory or to territories where we have Treaty rights, not one of which we save infringed in the slightest degree. In other words, we have shown the most absolute restraint.The presence of our forces in the Eastern Mediterranean, far from inflaming the situation, has greatly decreased the danger of further incidents and induced a measure of caution in some minds. In this respect, as in so many others, I agree with the Prime Minister of France, when he said that our action had already justified itself.What would anyone in this country have said if we had not taken these precautions? And if there had been a repetition of the massacre in Cairo in 1952?  Better to be safe than sorry. Some have protested that the precautions are on too large a scale. My reply is that if you are determined to defend national interests nothing is more foolish than to do so with inadequate forces.  Others ask, do we need to keep it up? Yes we do.  To relax now before a settlement is reached would be fatal. I deeply regret - and I know nobody does more so than the Minister of Defence - that in making these military movements we have had to interfere with the private life of some families, in particular the Reservists, and the Regulars of all three Services whose release has had to be deferred. They are all fulfilling a national duty, and, it is fair to add, are doing so in the overwhelming majority of cases with patience and good humour. This is all the more credit to them since they have not been encouraged to do so by some politicians and some sections of the press.I know there are some who argue that we should have acted more promptly by striking back the moment Colonel Nasser seized the Canal. I do not agree. By going through every stage which the Charter lays down, we have given an example of restraint and respect for international undertaking. But that does not alter the responsibility which rests upon us, and upon our allies, to ensure that justice is done and that international obligations are fulfilled. After all, the United Nations Charter was set up to discourage breaches of inter national agreements, not to allow them to pass with impunity. I have seen it suggested that this dispute about the Canal has something to do with colonialism. No comment could be more misleading. Colonialism has nothing to do with the matter one way or the other. We have never disputed Egyptian sovereignty. What is at stake in this dispute is whether the sanctity of contracts has to be respected or not.But if we are to discuss colonialism, is there any country in the world that has ever done so much to bring the people of its great Empire stage by stage to full nationhood? The process is going on now as we stand here.  And no one has the right to cast a stone at us. Contrast that with countries taken over by Communism, the Baltic States, for instance. There the silence of dead night descends.The Opposition\u2019s attitude in this country has, of course, completely changed since the debate on 2nd August. That is the outcome of pressure from the extreme Left. That is clear for all to see. On 2nd August the Leader of the Opposition compared Nasser\u2019s conduct with that of Hither and Mussolini. He was the first to use that simile. Whether he now would like credit for it I cannot say.  Indeed, he made a speech in which he used language more vehement than I had employed.This is not just my opinion. I will give you a Socialist authority for it. Lord Stansgate, better known in the House of Commons in former days as Mr. Wedgwood Benn, father of another Anthony, made this observation in the House of Lords that day: \u2018I can correctly and sincerely say that I found much more reason, common sense and conviction in the Prime Minister\u2019s speech than there was in the rather heady wine which was produced by my own Front Bench.\u2019So much for Lord Stansgate.It is clear that this forthright speech of the Leader of the Opposition did not please everyone. It did not please in particular the enemies of a bipartisan foreign policy. For after 2nd August, what happened? Tribune hit out, not at me, but at the Leader of the Opposition. It accused him of outdoing the Tories in suggesting ways of putting pressure on Egypt.  So the ignominious retreat began, and in due course the retreat became a rout, until we reached the point when the seconder of the Suez resolution at the Socialist Party Conference could say that if the United Nations sanctioned the use of force or economic sanctions, the British Labour movement would do everything in its power to oppose these moves. Those who speak like that are of a kidney we have learned to recognise. They are the friends of every country but their own. Those who exult that bipartisanship is dead are the same as those who criticised their own Socialist Foreign Secretary, Ernest Bevin, when he was alive. They are those who exploit every difficulty we face abroad for their own party purposes.  What a contrast to the loyal support Ernest Bevin received from Conservatives on the many occasions when the interests and prestige of our country were in the balance.Let me sum up where we stand.  From the beginning we have never changed our position. It is not changed now. It remains, as I stated it in the House of Commons on 30th July - the first statement of the Government: \u2018No arrangement for the future of this great international waterway could be acceptable to Her Majesty\u2019s Government which would leave it in the unfettered control of a single Power which could, as recent events have shown, exploit it purely for purposes of national policy.\u2019 That is our position and it has not changed. It remains our intention to seek its acceptance by negotiation if we possibly can.I am not yet in a position to tell you what the chances are of realising this. The last report I have received from the Foreign Secretary this morning - the Foreign Secretary in whom we have the utmost confidence \u2013 is that a little progress has been made but there are still wide differences of opinion. If such progress has been made it is due to the firmness and resolution we and those who think like us in other lands have been showing throughout this crisis. I must, however, warn you not to indulge in hasty or overoptimistic judgment. President Eisenhower in his Press Conference on Thursday [October 11th] was reported to have said that you must have peace with justice or it is not peace. I agree with those words. We should all take them as our text.  That is why we have always said that with us force is the last resort, but it cannot be excluded. Therefore, we have refused to say that in no circumstances would we ever use force.  No responsible Government could ever give such a pledge.This facing of the facts has been seized on by many Socialists as somehow immoral or a refusal to trust to the process of international law. That is a completely mistaken attitude.  The history of every nation shows that it is not sufficient to have good laws, if the power to enforce them is lacking. That, in turn, depends upon the strength of will and the integrity of the executive. These conditions apply equally on the international plane. To turn a blind eye to the realities of the situation would be to hazard not only the security of our own country, but to surrender our responsibilities in the world. This we are not prepared to do.I cannot close my comment on this situation without expressing the satisfaction we all feel at the unity between ourselves and our French allies throughout these anxious weeks.  Stage by stage we have been in close agreement. One happy consequence of all this has been to increase the sense of partnership between the nations of Western Europe. The truth is we all have a common interest in this, as in so many other matters. For us in Britain the Commonwealth must always come first. But, you know, increasingly our neighbours in Western Europe understand that this is true and accept it. And it could be greatly to the advantage of this country and of the Commonwealth, if in commerce, and in other matters too, we in Western Europe could draw closer together and always practise joint policies as well as observe joint treaties. It is my hope that this community of interest and loyal friendship may one day find expression in some closer form of relationship between us.So here, in conclusion, is the design I put before you. Incentive and opportunity at home; respect for engagements abroad; courage and imagination in our approach to the Commonwealth and to Europe. Here are national aims which only our Party can fulfil. (Loud and prolonged applause)

aVHAROLD MACMILLAN, 1957, Brighton   My Lord Chairman, I need not tell you how glad we are to see you among us this afternoon. This vast audience has already demonstrated the affection and esteem in which our Party holds you and will always hold you. Since the last Mass Meeting of the Conservative Conference we have lived through a difficult and tumultuous year, even judged by the standards of this modern age. It speaks much for the strength of the Conservative and Unionist Party and the basic loyalty and steadfastness of all our people that we have overcome so many troubles and are facing the future today with such resolution and confidence. Everyone in this hall will I am sure understand the somewhat mixed feelings with which I approach my task today.First, I need not hide it from you, pride at the honour which the Party has done me in electing me their leader; next, humility, when I think of the magnitude of my responsibilities; finally sorrow that the leadership should have come to me in the way it did, through the illness and retirement of my friend and colleague Anthony Eden. But to these I must frankly add a sense of inspiration at the challenge of the great issues at home and abroad.Once again, as twice in my lifetime, we shall only overcome them by unity and daring. I have naturally drawn great comfort and strength from the support of my colleagues in the Government, from our Members of Parliament, and from all of you in this hall who give the Party its direction and vigour in the constituencies throughout the country.In the course of this Conference you have heard speeches from most of the leading Ministers. I am sure you must be impressed by the grasp of the subject and the breadth of vision which they have displayed. You have heard the Foreign Secretary and shown the confidence and support you have for him amid his heavy responsibilities. You have heard the Chancellor of the Exchequer and been able to admire the courage he is displaying in facing his onerous tasks. There is one, alas, of my colleagues who has not been able to be here, the Home Secretary. We are indeed sorry that he is not with us but it is good to learn that he is heading towards full recovery, for the Party owes him more than it can ever repay.Now I come to the Party. Here again I want to thank two men particularly. Oliver Poole, who has been a wonderful help to me ever since I first became leader; who kept his head clear and his heart loyal during the first months of difficulty and who has shown a real sense of duty and team spirit in continuing to serve us in that part of our work where he can give us the greatest help. And now I come to Lord Hailsham. I do not think I need say very much about him. He speaks for himself - and very well. I would like to say this. He did not seek this post. He did not want it. Beneath a certain buoyancy which we all love in him, there lies a sincere modesty. He did not think he could do it. But when I pressed him, he finally replied, as I expected, that he would do anything that I asked him to do to the best of his ability. When I told him of Oliver Poole\u2019s generous proposal, then indeed many of the new Chairman\u2019s anxieties were removed. Together they will make a fine team Give them all your support.Now, I come to this Conference. But before I do so, I am sure you would wish me to express our gratitude to Sir Stephen Pierssené who has served us well and long. We hope he may have many happy years of activity, but perhaps in a less strenuous sphere. At the same time I would like to welcome his successor, Mr. Urton, who is no stranger to most of us.Now, for the Conference. It has been an inspiring Conference. I think I remember saying on one of these occasions that it was a happy dispensation of Providence that decreed that the Conservative Party Conference should always take place a week after the Socialist Party Conference. At least it makes it easy for the country to draw its own conclusions. There is hardly any need to underline the contrast: \u2018To point the moral or adorn the tale.\u2019This week the keynote of our Conference has been that combination of realism and idealism, so difficult to attain but without which no human organisation has the right to live, or the power to survive. No one who has been here and heard the wide-ranging and thoughtful debates, or read them in the newspapers, or listened on the radio, or looked at the television, can fail to realise that this is a modern twentieth century Party: a Party drawn from every section of the Nation; a Party with the largest youth organisation; a Party which, while resting its foundations in the past, is building for the future; a Party seeking real solutions to modern problems, seeking them with determination, with knowledge and, as is your right, with a certain amount of criticism. I am all for criticism. We cannot just live by patting each other on the back. But we have never gone in for stabbing each other in the back. I read during the recess that Mr. Gaitskell was suffering from a crick in the neck. I was very sorry, but not at all surprised. Looking over your shoulder is the occupational disease of left wing leaders. Here, at any rate, we look each other in the face.I want to speak first about the outside world - what used to be called foreign affairs. But really that phrase is out of date. In old days foreign affairs meant something remote, rather mysterious, only understood by a few experts. Now we have learnt only too well that our fortunes at home are inextricably linked with the world outside, financially, economically, materially, morally. This modern world in which we live is dominated by three great facts. The fact of Communism; the fact of the new nationalism; and the fact of nuclear power and modern technology with all their immense possibilities for good and for evil.We were brought up to divide history into times of peace, sometimes secure, sometimes less secure, but still peace; and times of war. But Communism has changed all that. It has destroyed the old distinction. It is a continual war. Cold war we call it, a never-ending struggle between two opposing forces. To most of us it is the struggle between good and evil. But when we say this, we must try to live up to our claim. The challenge to freedom does not only come from abroad. At any rate, we all know the weapons of Communism, both at home and abroad. Propaganda and intimidation to weaken the West by fear, subversion of areas where our vital interests are at stake, and the perversion and arming of nationalism to serve Communist ends. We have to resist these tactics by every means in our power.At the same time we have to seek - and we are honestly seeking - some kind of an answer by which the danger until it can be finally removed can at least be contained. Peaceful coexistence is fine so long as it is really peaceful, and each side is prepared to live together without trying to undermine the other by plot and intrigue. Yet we must not deceive ourselves as to the nature of this struggle. It is, I fear, one of those great secular divisions from which the world has suffered in the past and which now takes a new and dangerous form. We must be patient as well as prudent. For the conflict is moral as well as material. To meet it we must assess calmly the aims and methods of those who confront us. We must meet any goodwill with equal goodwill. But we must avoid wishful thinking which would accept mere words and phrases at their face value. Deeds, not words, these are the only reality. Above all, we must not lower our guard, nor underrate our own strength. We must certainly not undermine it ourselves.We have, as I see it, a triple shield. First, there is the community of purpose and moral influence of our own Commonwealth of Nations. Second, there is the growing solidarity of Western Europe. Third, there is our alliance with the United States. One of the great though quiet achievements of the past few months has been the recognition in London and Washington that we must act together. In the Far Eastern troubles of 1954, America insisted on the peril. She was then prepared to go it alone, but we were for restraint. Then a year ago America thought that we had been too hasty over Suez. To us, it seemed that they were too slow to understand what was really involved.The Communists, of course, still hope to divide us; and if they can do that, their task will be easy. Of course, there are plenty of people who are tempted to harp upon and exaggerate our occasional differences. But I must say frankly that if they do so, they are wittingly or unwittingly playing the Communist game. For on the unity of purpose and policy of the Commonwealth, Europe and the United States lies the hope and the only hope of the free world.There is one vital aspect of defence in which America and Britain are jointly determined. It is well for the world that that has been so. I mean, of course, the nuclear bomb. This is a matter which needs calmness of judgment as well as imagination; sense as well as sensibility. Nobody can deny that it has been the Western possession of the bomb which has deterred and still deters the Soviet Union from open aggression. Even the most recent developments, however startling, have not altered this strategic fact. It is our will to retaliate with nuclear strength which prevents them daring to launch their enormous forces against us. And it is for this reason that during this year I, with the full support of my colleagues, have resisted all the pressure from so many sources to abandon the manufacture and testing of our weapon without any safeguards for our own security. The pressure was very severe; some of it, of course, was not respectable - it came from Communist or Communist-inspired sources. I did not mind that, but much of it came from the most worthy and high-minded men and women - whose views I naturally respect. But events have shown how wise my colleagues and I were to stand firm, and not to send our Foreign Secretary in the words used in this hall a week ago, \u2018naked into the Conference Chamber.\u2019The story, you know, was told of Wilkes, the great 18th Century demagogue and agitator, that when in his more respectable and declining years he was speaking to the King, the Monarch was surprised at his moderation. \u2018Ah!\u2019 said Wilkes, \u2018I was never much of a Wilkite myself.\u2019I am beginning to think that Mr. Bevan was never much of a Bevanite. Of course, I must admit that the second Socialist resolution last week asking us to undertake no more nuclear tests seemed rather to undermine the first. It seemed to take us back to Mr. Gaitskell\u2019s original idea that we should make the bomb but not test it. I never thought that a very prudent plan. But no doubt this was a tactical concession to the extremists. In any case, our position is clear. We want to end the testing and production of nuclear weapons, but we want to make sure that if we make such an agreement it can and will be enforced. But getting rid of the bomb is not enough. At the same time we must have some reduction of conventional forces.We want, of course, to free the world from the shadow of the nuclear threat. But we cannot give up our deterrent if as a result we are left in a position of hopeless weakness and inequality in conventional forces.We and our allies have made one proposal after another. They take full account of Soviet security as well as of our own - that is the only way. As yet, so far we have had no real response. We have had nothing but propaganda arguments. But we do not despair. We shall go on trying. Meanwhile, so long as we have the retaliatory power I do not believe that a mass assault by the Soviet forces upon us is practicable. Sir Winston Churchill pointed out that in the stalemate may lie the hope of avoiding global war. Yet we have to accept this fact that if Communism is checked in that way, it will turn to other methods. We have to meet subversion in all its various forms. We must help our friends all over the world who are in danger.All this means a long and sustained effort. We must not overstrain ourselves. We must not exhaust our economy in Britain by attempting too much. Nothing would suit the Communist powers better or serve our allies worse. That is the purpose of our new defence plan. We believe that we can best fulfil our tasks both in the deterrent and in what we have called the police work that falls upon us from time to time all over the world by well-equipped volunteer forces. We have always said that we would dispense with National Service as soon as it became possible to do so. That is our aim. Industry will of course benefit when the call-up stops.  The whole economy will benefit and we should be able to look to our great tradition of volunteer service to match the nation\u2019s needs.For the moment the Soviet advance has been halted in Europe. The powerful organisation of NATO stands firm. In the Far East, SEATO has come into being and the situation, though precarious, is less anxious than it was a year or two ago. It is natural therefore that checked in two directions the Communist flood should have sought the weakest point - that has been and still is the Middle East.A year ago when we ascribed much of the troubles of the Middle East to Russian infiltration our analysis was questioned and even ridiculed. I do not think anyone would question it today. Recent events in Syria have shown how persistent Communist subversion can be. One of the great gains of recent months is that our American friends are now determined in close collaboration with us to do all they can to assist and aid the countries of the Middle East. For I am persuaded that it is in the interests of these countries as well as our own that the economic co-operation and friendly relations which have done so much to build up their freedom in the past should be strengthened and not weakened. For it is by this honourable partnership that the standard of the countries of the Middle East and their strength can be continually improved. Soviet infiltration and interference would in the long run prove a menace to both. We trust that the Middle Eastern peoples will see the danger to themselves, that they will discover before it is too late that the Communists who charge us with \u2018colonialism\u2019 are themselves the cruellest imperialists.Let us remind the world that the Iron Curtain has gathered behind its sinister folds no less than a hundred million people in Europe alone since the end of the war. Britain, during that time or in the same period, has helped five times that number - about five hundred million people - in Asia and Africa to achieve nationhood as full and free members of the Commonwealth. The free Commonwealth is our answer to the claims and problems of growing nationalism. What was Communism\u2019s answer? What is it today? It can be summed up in a single word - Hungary. Therefore, while the world outside is full of dangers and difficulties, let us take heart. Let us hold on together. Above all let us hold together the three groups of nations of which we are the only country to be a member of all - the Commonwealth, Europe, and the Anglo-American Alliance.Only thus can we do our duty by our own peoples and by the United Nations, whose principles we are all pledged to serve and whose authority we seek all the time to strengthen. Yet, if we are to discharge our duty in the world, our power to do so must depend above all upon our domestic economic strength. I believe we have the will, although, of course, there are faint hearts and defeatists everywhere in every country. What we must ensure is that not only that we have the ends but that we have the means. Our foreign policy must rest upon the strength of our economy.Now I come to a question with which you have dealt. One problem has troubled us both at home and abroad. It is the problem of inflation. So much has been said in this hall during this week that you will not expect me to repeat it. Our great pre-war problem was unemployment.  Our great post-war problem has been inflation.  Before the war, under Conservative and Labour Governments alike, there were many men and women unemployed. There were machines standing idle.  In those days prices were low but unemployment was high. Today we have full employment. In most years, since the war, we have had a labour shortage; that is to say, more jobs in industry than men and women to fill them. All this has brought with it the problem of rising prices. This has confronted both Parties since the war - and many other countries besides our own.Our first responsibility, therefore, is to see that inflation does not undermine our economic position or endanger the expansion of our economy. We have had our successes. In spite of all our difficulties we have achieved as a nation a good surplus in balance of payments. This year it will be some £200,000,000. We have invested heavily overseas, and of course in our capacity as bankers to the sterling area we have had to meet heavy drawings on the central reserves from the rapidly developing countries of the Commonwealth. Meanwhile, at home we have reached, so far as the mass of the people are concerned, the highest standard of living in our history.I see that Mr. Bevan called the people \u2018an embittered and frustrated industrial mass.\u2019 I do not know where he got that impression from. Has he never seen any of those six million TV aerials which have gone up since 1951? Has he never run across any of the extra two million cars or motor bicycles? Does his view not embrace any of those houses he did not build but we did?Let us be frank. The wage earner and the business man find wages and profits go far above prices. It is the pensioner, the retired man, the people on fixed or nearly fixed incomes, who have borne the burden. I said at Bedford recently, and I say again today, we have a clear duty to those sections of our people who have not shared in this general prosperity and that duty we intend to discharge.This is, of course, a many-sided problem. We are not merely an industrial country; we are the bankers to the sterling area. From this we gain great advantages. It helps us, but it brings corresponding risks and responsibilities. The fact that the greater part of the world\u2019s trade is done in our money means that our money can be vulnerable. Our policies must command confidence not only in this country but abroad. And confidence in our money is affected not only by events in this country but also by what is happening abroad. During this summer the pound suffered because people abroad feared that the British Government and people would not boldly face the problems of inflation or of extra wage claims not matched by extra production. It also suffered, and perhaps to a greater degree, because people abroad believed that the German deutschmark was undervalued and saw a hope of a quick capital profit by buying marks. Let us try to get this in perspective for a moment.In 1951 we took over this country in a state of extreme - almost desperate - crisis. The Socialist Government was so frightened of the situation that they did not even try to deal with it. They had not the courage for that - they ran away from it. It is true they summoned Parliament - but only to dissolve it. We certainly do not mean to run away from our responsibilities. After the first year, when we had to follow and intensify measures of restriction, import controls and the like, we have developed a policy of expansion through freedom, opportunity and incentive - and this coupled with a continuing reduction in the burden of taxation. Monetary policy, restriction or easing of credit, acceleration or retardation in this or that part of the investment programme over which the Government has direct control - surely these are the measures which we must intensify or relax according to the state of the economic barometer.Nor must we forget the human element. Incentive is necessary if we are to get real expansion, and that is why we have made tax reductions amounting in all to some £800,000,000 or £900,000,000 a year. Nevertheless, when the boom in investment developed in 1955, bringing a danger of renewed inflation, we brought in measures designed to get people to hold back on buying and save more. The credit squeeze helped to restrain the boom within the limits of our resources, restrictions on hire-purchase damped down a bit the spending out of borrowed money. National savings were assisted by higher interest rates, income tax concessions on small saving, and - dare I remind you of it - the launching of the premium bond.These policies took, of course, some time to work, but they did work. And the result is that we have now a decent surplus on our balance of payments. We have increased both exports and savings to record levels. But the threat today does not come from a shortage of money of the type that led to unemployment between the wars. It is really no good trying to revive the bogey of Mr. Montagu Norman. Everyone is fully employed - indeed, there is, if anything, a shortage of labour. The danger does not come from too little money in the system. It comes from too much. In other words from inflation.Of course, the Government could, but will not in principle, allow money, paper money - for that is what it is - to be created to ensure that, for the time being, the spiral of wages and prices goes merrily up.  But who gains? The wage earner won\u2019t gain in the long run, and all the rest of the community will lose. The spiral won\u2019t keep on going up - sooner or later it will blow up. Then all will lose in a common disaster, in which the trade by which we live, our savings of the past, and our hopes for the future would all be involved. This is where the real threat of unemployment lies - not in the Government\u2019s measures to deal with the problem.There is another misunderstanding I would like to clear up. It is not true to say that there is a freeze on private investment. Private investment can be financed in three ways - either by bank overdraft, by internal savings of a company, or by raising fresh capital from the public. The first certainly cannot be increased because the bank overdrafts are to be held on average to last year\u2019s figures, and these are forms of money that are in a sense creating money. The second depends upon the wise and prudent policy of those who direct industry. The third, raising money on the market, depends upon what is judged to be the capacity of the market to absorb it, which is another way of saying, upon the willingness of people to save. I am sure we must aim to match our investment by genuine saving. And if more is saved, why then, more can be invested. In the same way, if more is produced more can be earned - and should be earned. What we cannot afford is more to be paid out, unrelated to higher production.The Chairman has said something about the wicked accusation that we seek to impose unemployment. There may be some people - there must be in this audience - young enough not to have known, there may be some so remote from reality not to realise what mass unemployment involves in human suffering. Certainly anyone of my age, or who has had my experience can never put it out of his mind. We do not seek unemployment - we seek to avert it. And if it ever comes to the people of this country again, it can only come in one way - it will be a self-inflicted wound. Our aim is not to create unemployment and I think our record proves it.Our aim is not to reduce living standards in any section of our people. On the contrary, our fixed purpose is to raise them for all. Our aim is not conflict but unity. Whatever extremists may say, I would urge ordinary men and women of every section of the community to put out of their minds all appeals to prejudice. But I must say this frankly - and it is my duty to say it - that unless we can show common sense all round we may by ill-considered words and deeds throw away the substance for the shadow like the dog in the fable.I cannot believe that our people will make the tragic mistake of throwing away the solid benefits which they have gained and the still more substantial benefits which are within our grasp. Surely what we all ought to be doing now is seeing how we can produce a bit more, not seeing how we can chisel a bit more out of somebody else. I believe that, if they think it over, all those who hold great responsibility, either for the leadership and management of business, or the Trade Unions, will have this thought in mind. In any case, our duty as the Government is clear. In spite of misunderstanding and misrepresentation, we intend to see this thing through. Then our policies will be seen not only to be necessary but fruitful. Meanwhile, I feel sure that we can look to you in this hall, and to all those whom you represent and influence outside, for full and active support.We have seen a good many things through in the last six years. Cast your minds back for a moment. In a fortnight\u2019s time Britain will have had a Conservative Government for six years. Six years of Socialist restriction compared with six years of Conservative opportunity, so we can strike a balance sheet.First, our trading account with the rest of the world. In their six years the Socialists were £800,000,000 in the red. In our six years we are £800,000,000 to the good. We have been earning abroad more than we have been spending and we are doing so now. And we have been investing far more 50 per cent more - half as much again more - overseas than the Socialists did - and that, in spite of the 6,000 million dollars\u2019 worth which they have received in gifts alone. And we have been investing more at home. And even with our new measures will go on doing so. In six years the Socialists built less than a million houses. In six Conservative years nearly twice as many have been completed. For every single school place completed by the Socialists we have completed two. Take the records on taxation. In five Socialist Budgets taxes went up. In five Conservative Budgets taxes have come down. Then look at the difference in the standard of living: one doesn\u2019t need statistics to demonstrate this - the evidence is all around us. Abundance of goods and freedom of choice. It took us less than three years to get rid of food rationing which had persisted through six long Socialist years.You will remember the gibe about \u2018Red Meat.\u2019 What has happened? I will tell you. The gibe has become the joint. Mr. Bevan once said, \u2018Why look in the crystal when you can read the book?\u2019 Well, you can read in the book the comparison between the record of the Socialist and of the Conservative Governments. The facts are all there and six years is a fair period of trial. The trouble is that it is so easy to forget what things were like back in 1951. And, of course, we are such a young Party that many of us do not know.It is easy to forget how we had to take a bit of margarine with us when we went to tea with a friend, how eagerly we queued for what I think was called a bit of off-ration offal, or that strange part of bureaucratic thinking - bananas on green books only. People in those days could not buy nylons except under the counter or from the spivs; we had to dash round looking for candles every time there was a power cut. And even after six years of enlightened Socialism - six years of this Utopia - the Minister of Fuel and Power proudly made this statement. He said: \u2018Electric fires are a major cause of power cuts. We have imposed a purchase tax on them, and the Area Boards no longer display them in showrooms. I am told that in many parts of the country it is becoming really difficult to buy an electric fire.\u2019 What a boast! What a triumph of planning!That was in October 1951. It was in that same month that the Socialist Prime Minister said: \u2018If rationing is good for the people in wartime, surely it must be good for them in peacetime.\u2019 All these things are part and parcel of Socialism. But - and I must be serious - these things are not just a glimpse of the past. They are an awful warning for the future.In due course the British people will be called upon to make a great decision. When that time comes it will be their duty to put aside many of the minor incidents or temporary difficulties, or even grievances, that naturally arise in the life of any country.  It will be true next time, as it was last time and the time before that - to borrow a phrase from our old friend Anthony Eden - that the broad divide in our political life is between Socialism and freedom, between those who accept the doctrine that the State should dominate the life of the individual and those who believe in the highest degree of individual freedom compatible with an ordered community and the common good.That is still the choice today, and will be in two or three years hence. The people have the right to be informed, and a duty to inform themselves as to the real meaning of the programmes set before them. They have to decide, moreover, partly on hard practical grounds - what will best suit their material fortune and prosperity - and partly, if I may be allowed the word, on spiritual grounds, on what best suits the ideals and ambitions that they have for themselves - aye, their children and their fellow countrymen - their country.Let us take first the practical grounds. Our economy, under whatever Government, Left or Right, will have to live in a harshly competitive world. It will have to develop its own strength without the great benefit of the legacy of wealth which has been largely destroyed in two world wars. What are the proposals so far set before us by the Socialists? They pay lip service, of course, to the defence of the pound.  But how do they propose to defend it against the continual pressure to increase wages, regardless of production? First, by the purchase of some 5 million houses, now in private hands, at a cost of perhaps something like £2,500,000,000.  But to turn fixed assets into liquid money hardly seems a very good method of steadying prices or resisting inflation. Then they do it by a series of controls, presumably combined with rationing? That will only bring us back all the frustration and misery, aye, and dishonesty, from which we have recently escaped. They do it by immense increases in public expenditure and so taxation. Will that help? Will they do it by an attack upon industry upon a scale undefined and apparently practically without limits?There has been a great ideological dispute as to precisely which form of nationalisation was to be preferred, the old or the new.  I think the supporters of the new felt that the word nationalisation was not very popular. They came to Brighton not to praise it but to bury it. But really it has all amounted, as far as I can see, to a distinction without a difference. They are using the oldest trick in the world - if the goods do not sell - try them with another label. I read in a Socialist magazine the following account of this dispute: \u2018The real choice\u2019 it says, \u2018is whether the Government is to use public ownership to take a cut in the swag or to use public enterprise to cut the swag itself.\u2019 This is an elegant way of describing these two proposals which have caused such a furore in the Labour Party. All the same, it seems that a compromise was reached, and it was decided to use both methods. There is to be a short list who are to have their throats cut, and a longer list who are to be bled slowly to death.Let me turn for a moment to their foreign policies, which are even more obscure. Some support the principle of the alliances; others oppose it violently. Some are in favour of Britain being armed with atomic and nuclear deterrents; others oppose it bitterly. Some are for the American alliance; others against. Some see in Communism the deadly enemy of all free society; others believe it to be something that can be soothed or flattered or wheedled into harmlessness.We are convinced, and I firmly believe we can convince the mass of our fellow countrymen, that these Socialist theories will not work, that they have been proved not to work, and that they would bring about an early collapse of the whole structure on which we have built up in recent years so much prosperity for all. What is more - I do not believe that anyone really wants that kind of society. Where everything is rationed, where houses are municipalised, where education is uniform, where industry is nationalised, where individual effort is hobbled and derided and where taxes are sky-high. Think of all the bills piling up for the unfortunate Socialist Chancellor of the Exchequer. I see that Mr. Harold Wilson has earmarked himself for that job - well, I would not like to be in his boots.But we on our side must not be content with destructive criticism. We shall succeed if we have - and are clearly seen to have - ideas and policies both at home and abroad which match the possibilities of our time. We Conservatives have a pattern of policy: that pattern has clearly emerged throughout the last six years. Inevitably, the difficulties of recent months, the recurrence of inflation at home, and the Middle Eastern crisis abroad, have somewhat obscured this pattern in the minds of many people. In the maze of events some have lost the thread. But it has not been broken. The pattern is there. It is our special duty - every one of us in this hall - to let it clearly be seen in every constituency throughout the land.Let me try to give its general outline. Abroad we hold to the policy of peace through strength with our friends in the Commonwealth, our allies in the great regional organisations, and our American partners. At the same time we will do all that negotiation and ingenuity can contrive to turn this policy into one of real peace through adequate disarmament with proper safeguards.I believe the mass of the people broadly understand this policy and approve it. They understand, too, the modern role of the Commonwealth, changing and developing all the time. They understand the economic value of the Commonwealth as well as its moral value - they want to invest in it and help in its development. And they well know what the world would be like, with the pressures of Communism and the dangers of extreme nationalism, if this Commonwealth of ours did not exist both as a fact and as an ideal.At home, our aim ever since we took over in the crisis of 1951 has been the same - to build a strong, expanding economy, built to sustain our worldwide responsibilities, built to compete in the markets of the world, and built year by year to raise the standard of living of the people.Expansion and freedom, trade and progress, remain our main theme and objective, and it is to these that our individual policies are geared. For instance, our Free Trade Area proposals which you debated here yesterday have the aim of increasing our trade with Europe, while safeguarding the interests of our domestic agriculture and of the British Commonwealth. For Europe is the area of the world where trade is expanding the most rapidly, and it is from Europe that the duty of the Old World to meet some of the needs of the new and developing territories can best be met. Our agriculture must continue in good heart and play its part in the new conditions of freedom and abundance. The policy of long-term assurances and improvement grants embodied in our new Agriculture Act will give a sounder basis for farmers than ever before on which to plan ahead.With regard to Commonwealth trade, you will have read the brilliantly successful way in which the Chancellor of the Exchequer, with his Commonwealth colleagues, has brought to a conclusion the Conference in Canada. And we have given the warmest welcome, and, I trust, some new ideas of our own, as a most constructive contribution to the Prime Minister of Canada\u2019s determination to increase trade between Canada and the Old Country.We need more power, hence our rapidly developing nuclear power programme, which will be pressed forward on the maximum scale our economy can sustain under the able direction of the Minister in charge. We need young men and women, qualified to handle the new processes and techniques which modern science develops day by day. Hence our rapidly developing nuclear power programme, which will be pressed forward on the maximum scale our economy can sustain under the able direction of the Minister in charge.We need young men and women, qualified to handle the new processes and techniques which modern science develops day by day. Hence the £100,000,000 expansion of technical education. But, you know, for all their importance, these questions of how to earn our living are but a means to an end - living itself.Our Party stands for the combination of two principles; the rights of the individual - freedom, let us call it - and his duties. Every man comes into this world alone. He goes out of it alone. Although the life of man on earth is spent in a community, to which each man owes obligations, fundamentally he is a single, individual soul, alone before his Maker.All through human society there has been this inherent problem of how to combine the rights of each individual man and woman, their right to live their own lives, to express themselves in their own way and to make or, if you like, to mar their own fortunes, how to combine that with the duty that they have to others and the benefits that they can bring to others. A Socialist society, or a collectivist society, would not provide a high standard of material conditions for a people who have no raw materials save coal and a little iron; who brought into being an immense population in a confined compass; and who can only live by their intelligence, their brains and by the constant development of new methods - which spring after all in the long run from individual human brains.When I spoke on the occasion of my election as your leader some months ago, I said that it is only by giving opportunity to the strong and able that we can have the means to protect the weak and the old. The whole fabric of our social services - slum clearance, health services, insurance benefits, pensions, education and the rest - is nurtured and sustained by the success of individual enterprise and effort. Encourage that enterprise, and these social services will expand in increasing scope and usefulness. But damp it down, penalise it, and inevitably the social services will wilt and wither. But even if that were not so, even if Socialism could provide every material benefit, I do not believe that it offers the kind of life suited to a people of our long tradition of freedom and civilisation. Man was not made for the State, the State was made for man; and there, fundamentally, lies the difference between the approach of our two philosophies. I have no doubt at all that if we can but make these principles known and understood, which way will fall the choice of the great majority of our fellow countrymen.

aVThere is something in the bracing air of Blackpool that, apart from minor exhilarations, seems specially good for Conservative Conferences.It was here that we met twelve years ago after the landslide of 1945. Inspired by our great leader, Sir Winston Churchill, we began to re-define and re-adapt our policies to the needs of the day.Under Lord Woolton we created a new, modern and democratic organisation. It was here that, four years later, in 1950, you issued the call for 300,000 houses. And you got them.In 1954 we held one of the most lively and successful of our Conferences which set us confidently on the road to winning a second General Election. Now, here we are again, in 1958, getting ready to win a third. A mathematician will tell you that there are heavy odds against winning three General Elections running. That is, of course, true. So there are against a hat-trick; but the odds against are diminished - not increased - when the bowler has already taken two wickets in succession. And with Lord Hailsham and Lord Poole in the team we need not worry about our bowling.Autumn - \u2018season of mists and mellow fruitfulness\u2019 - is also the season of political conferences. We have recently enjoyed reading about the first two - the Liberal and the Socialist Conferences. Those, of course, were the mists. Here we have had the fruitfulness. Our political opponents seem to me to be living either in the past or in a world of make-believe. The pure doctrine of laissez-faire and absolute free trade; the nationalisation of all the means of production, distribution and exchange - these were the cries of my boyhood. What a musty period flavour they have now. How utterly out of touch all this is with the problems and opportunities of today. That is why so many of the Liberal and Labour debates have an air of lavender and old lace. But the arsenic is there too. It seems to me that the Labour Party\u2019s two main occupations today are splitting over their policy papers and papering over their policy splits. And as with economics, so with foreign affairs. Many of their resolutions are quite unrelated to the actual facts of life today, and many are contradictory. What a contrast with what you have been doing these last four days. Looking through the resolutions on our order paper here, there is one thing that sticks out a mile. We are up to date and they are not. We are realistic and they are not. We are relevant and they are not. And then there is another thing - the accent on youth at our Conference. The Young Conservatives have been seen, and they have also been heard. The emphasis in all your discussions has been on the present and on the future. On the needs and opportunities as well as the problems and dangers of this new, scientific, technological, jet propelled, nuclear powered age. I, too, want to speak today chiefly about the future. But before doing so, I will take as they do in the films a quick flashback over the past. It is just a year since I spoke to you at Brighton. Quite a lot has happened in these twelve months. Last year we had just announced our new and severe measures for combating inflation and the danger to the value of the pound. You will remember them - seven per cent Bank Rate, the credit squeeze and all the rest. Well, now you can see the results. The value of the pound on the world market strengthened dramatically and has remained strong. As a result of renewed confidence and of a most favourable trade balance, our Gold and Dollar Reserves have made gains every single month since last September. Not counting what we borrowed last autumn, we have during the last 12 months added £1,000,000 to the reserves every day. The cost of living index stands today no higher than it did last November. The Budget - Mr. Amory\u2019s first Budget, but the sixth of our Budgets to cut taxes - did all that was possible within the limits that prudence allowed. He cut taxation by over £100,000,000 a year. He cut the duty on house purchase. He cut the Purchase Tax on a great range of household goods. And if this was not enough to win a lady\u2019s heart, he cut the tax on cosmetics, jewellery, handbags and mirrors. What it is to have a bachelor as Chancellor of the Exchequer!Before I pass to the general state of our economy, I would like to say a word about our oldest and still largest industry, to which you, Mr. Chairman, referred \u2013 agriculture. Our farmers have suffered from one of the most difficult summers this century, and the earlier expectations of a bumper harvest have been dashed - literally to the ground. The harvest will now be below normal in all too many areas. I am determined that, so long as I am responsible, this shall never happen again.  The unemployment figure of 2.2 per cent covers the whole country.  But averages, as of course we know, are deceptive things, and there are certain areas where unemployment is a special problem.  Sometimes a local and once flourishing industry is on the decline owing to changes of method or perhaps of fashion. Sometimes the areas are remote from the great centres of communication or perhaps have only seasonal trade to support them. I am thinking in particular of some areas in Scotland, in Wales, and some of the coastal districts of England.We have taken powers to encourage industrial development in some of these areas. We also intend to use the industrial certificate system for the same purpose. But as well as the opportunity to work, I want to see the opportunity to earn. We want to see a steady increase in earning power to provide the means for a fuller life. We want to remove much of the drudgery and toil from manual labour and make life easier and brighter in the home. We also want to see people keeping more of the money they earn and the Exchequer taking less. That is why in Budget after Budget taxes have been cut. That is why we aim to continue this happy process.Next, the opportunity to own and to save. With more than half a million new houses built for sale in the last seven years, we have already gone some way towards providing more chance to own. The Socialists want to see a nation of Council house tenants; we want to see a nation of house owners. The Socialists want to narrow and concentrate in the State the ownership of industry; we want to spread it. And we are spreading it. Listen to this; it is a quote: \u2018In pre-war days it was the wealthy who supplied the cash to finance industry, Today it is the turn of the masses to take over a large part of this vital job by putting their savings to work. Figures show us it is the British public generally, not just a few rich chaps, who are pouring their money into Saving Certificates, Premium Bonds, Defence Bonds, Building Societies, Unit Trusts, and other forms of saving.\u2019 This is not a Tory leaflet that I am quoting; it comes from a Daily Herald feature of last Wednesday (October 8th), and it gets better as it goes on. It says: \u2018The ordinary people up and down the country are materially better off now than they have ever been. We have more money,\u2019 says this article, \u2018to spend and to save.\u2019 And yet I seem to remember I got into terrible hot water a year ago when I said they had \u2018never had it so good.\u2019 As a nation we are saving more each year than we saved in the whole six years of Socialism. And, by the way, I was glad to see that nice little tribute to the Premium Bond. This increase in saving is twice blessed. It not only helps the individual and the family, it also provides the funds needed for economic expansion. New roads and factories, new plant and equipment, research and development - all this can only come from saving.To sum up: the right to earn, the right to own, the right to save, and the opportunity and encouragement to exercise these rights. That is what we stand for. That is what, whether they intend it or not, Socialism must in the end destroy. But there is another large field of conflict between the Parties - the place of the individual in modern society. When we took office in 1951, we set about the task of removing from off the back of the trader, the farmer, the businessman and the private citizen the whole Socialist paraphernalia of burdensome and complex controls. We cut back State trading, we reopened the commodity markets, we abolished rationing, we did away with identity cards, we got rid of a thing, a horrible thing, hardly remembered now, called the development charge, and many other irritating controls over personal liberty and freedom.The disciplinary powers of the Agricultural Executive Committees have been abolished, and a Council is being set up to watch over the working of administrative tribunals and enquiries, and to see that the ordinary citizen gets a fair deal. Since the Lord Chancellor is in charge of this, I think we can trust to his robust good sense.Then there are the various Emergency Regulations. Powers readily and properly granted to the Executive in the urgency of war must not be allowed to live on unchallenged.We have been steadily hewing them down. There were 215 in operation when we took office in 1951. Over 200 of them have gone. And we intend to finish the job during this Parliament. Those that for some reason have to be retained and cannot be abolished will be made part of the normal fabric of Parliamentary law. Of course, we in the Conservative and Unionist Party do not want to return to the laissez-faire doctrinaire Liberalism. Too often that meant the defence not of freedom but of privilege.There are, of course, many cases where the interests of the nation must override those of the individual. That must happen in slum clearance, for instance, or with the new road construction on which the Minister of Transport is so active.You have been rightly insisting that where these cases happen the individual citizen must get fair play. Mr, Brooke, the Minister of Housing, is an ingenious as well as a cautious man. That is why he has been so singularly successful in dealing with the terribly difficult problem of rent control. I think that, when our proposals in this matter to which I have referred are presented to Parliament, you will not be disappointed. This role of providing the balance between the State and the individual is, I believe, the historic role of the Tory Party.Once it was necessary to proclaim the rights of the State against those of powerful individuals or associations. It may become necessary to do so again. But now the need is rather to proclaim the right of the individual against the State and other large-scale concentrations of power.I now want to look further afield. Dependent on world trade as we are, what happens at home - what we can do to affect things at home - is only part of the problem. What happens in the world - what can be done to encourage international trade can be every bit as important. There are many things which cannot be done by one country alone, but only by co-operation between many countries - by the practice of economic interdependence. Britain, which is at once a Commonwealth - head of the Commonwealth - a European and an Atlantic power, has here a unique opportunity. The recent Commonwealth Economic Conference in Montreal has been a resounding success. It has been welcomed as such throughout the Commonwealth. The United Kingdom Ministers - Lord Home, Sir David Eccles and of course the Chancellor of the Exchequer - were able to point the way to a freer system of trade and payments; to encourage and stimulate exports; to develop and stimulate trade; and to encourage investment throughout the Commonwealth. An economically strong Commonwealth needs an economically strong Europe. This is certainly our conviction here in Britain and all our Commonwealth partners share this view. That is why we propose that the Common Market of six European powers should be allied with a broad free trade area. Mr. Maudling, who was at Montreal, is now carrying on these negotiations in Paris with skill and perseverance. All the industrial countries of the world must share in the task of supplying capital to enable the poorer countries to develop their resources. We can be proud of what we are doing. British investments overseas now reach something like £200,000,000 a year. This is a greater proportion of our national income than any other country\u2019s. We must keep it up.Finally, one of the problems of world trade, on which I am glad such progress has been made in Delhi, is that of creating a sufficient volume of credit to support the expansion of world trade. I first discussed this with President Eisenhower this summer and he has already shown the response which America intends to make. All this is vital to our trade and our employment. But it is not merely economic self-interest which should prompt us. The inequalities of living standards in the world are a source of weakness. They are easy targets for Communist propaganda. Indeed, one of the most powerful threats of Communism today is economic, and it is in the economic field that it must primarily be met.Now I turn to the political aspects of these problems. The Foreign Secretary has dealt so fully in his speech with some of the most urgent questions that you already have a clear and detailed picture of the responsibilities we carry - and they are global. You have already shown how you value the courage, skill and patience which the Foreign Secretary has brought to his task. He, with the Commonwealth Secretary and the Colonial Secretary, have done fine work for the prestige and authority of Britain overseas. In foreign, as in home affairs, we must accept the facts of the age in which we live. We cannot deal with them by words and resolutions, but only by practical policies and actions.I read the latest document on Socialist foreign policy, and the speeches made about it, by Mr. Gaitskell and Mr. Bevan. The most remarkable thing that came out of the debate was the Socialist vote in favour of the Conservative Government\u2019s policy, that we should not unilaterally renounce the nuclear deterrent.It was indeed curious to find Mr. Gaitskell adopting precisely our own argument, that to deny ourselves possession of the bomb and rely on America to use it if necessary in our defence would be both morally indefensible and politically disastrous.  I am bound to say that during the last two years I have found the Socialist position on this controversy very confusing. Some were against the bomb and still are. Others, including apparently, Mr. Gaitskell, were and are for the bomb, but they were against the tests. But had I yielded to the heavy pressure brought upon me during the last two years and prematurely abandoned the tests, then there could have been no bomb. If now, the majority of the Labour Party are in favour of Britain having the bomb, that policy has only been made practicable by our refusal to yield to their agitation. At the same time we have not rested there. We now have, through our close friendship with the United States, the amendment to the McMahon Act. This allows us to pool our information, and to speak on equal terms with the Americans. In all this we owe a lot to our Minister of Defence. I would remind you that it was the British Government\u2019s initiative which brought about the conference of nuclear scientists at Geneva which has agreed that control is scientifically possible. We have now joined with the Americans in proposing a one year suspension from the end of this month, subject to the Soviet agreeing to work out with us a proper system of control. If, as I hope those talks succeed, we have a chance of making a beginning with real disarmament - for that is what we want: real agreements in which conventional and nuclear disarmament go hand in hand.The principles of our external policy are threefold - strength, unity and under standing. We must maintain the defensive strength of the Alliances - NATO, SEATO, and the Baghdad Pact. I am of course ready to go to a Summit meeting inside or outside the United Nations, and indeed I thought for a moment that we had reached that objective when Mr. Khrushchev accepted our proposal for a Summit Conference on the Middle East within the Security Council. Then after (or perhaps because of) a visit to Peking he suddenly turned round and withdrew.This was a great disappointment to me, but I have not given up my hope of a Summit meeting. But there is one thing I must make clear. I pray that we may be able to reduce armaments, but we will not reduce them unilaterally. Let the level of both sides fall simultaneously. Any other course will not bring peace, but either war or surrender.What is the next thing? Unity. Among the Western powers who are members of NATO, there are from time to time dangerous divisions. We have one now between Greece, Turkey and ourselves on the question of Cyprus.Here I know you would wish me to express again what was so well expressed yesterday - the sympathy we have with our forces in Cyprus, both military and civil. We have the greatest admiration for them and the fullest confidence in them and in their discipline and courage. I must repeat that the problem of Cyprus is not a Colonial but an international one. I have certainly done my best to bring all sides together, and I am not without hope that agreement will be reached. Discussions are still proceeding in NATO and I hope they may be fruitful. Meanwhile I am not ashamed to have put forward the idea that such a problem could best be solved by mutual co-operation. For remember, the old world is not the whole world; Europe is not the whole world - it is but a small peninsula of the great Asiatic plain jutting out into the ocean.The powers of Europe should not think backwards to their old quarrels, but forward to a new understanding. I know, of course, of the long, bitter fights between Turkey and Greece going back 500 years. But if we were to look backwards over the centuries, we should still be at enmity with France. If France and Germany were not able to look forward they would still be bitter rivals, instead of having, under the leadership of great men, decided to shake hands and be friends. It does not serve the cause for which we are all joined together, nor do we match the level of world events, if in any of the western countries we allow our minds to be obsessed by the quarrels of the past, instead of looking to the dangers of the present and the hopes of the future.In the same way, there are many in this country, we may as well confess it, who want us to quarrel with the United States.For instance, we are invited to abandon our independent nuclear power (which I think is the Liberal policy), pool our arms with America, and then publicly quarrel with our American allies. On the extreme left, some are willing to play the Communist game, an obvious feature of which is to try at all costs to drive a wedge between the Atlantic powers.Happily, American and British policy on the Middle East is today agreed and I am convinced that the rescue operation which we did in concert in Lebanon and Jordan has given the necessary opportunities for the United Nations to play their role. As the Foreign Secretary rightly stressed, so long as the veto in the Security Council remains, there must always be occasions when the great powers cannot evade their duty. They must prevent aggression while there is still time. Then having completed their immediate task they must hand it to the nations of the world for collective action. That we have done and the responsibility now firmly rests upon the United Nations to see that our work has not been in vain. Meanwhile, I cannot believe that the Opposition can look back with any pride on the role they played when this crisis arose in the summer. It was perhaps no accident that, seeing Anglo-American unity in the Middle East, the Communist pressure changed and they started to hot up the Far East in the hope, of course, of splitting us over that. Do not let us fall into that trap. On the strength of the United States and their continued interest in the world as a whole, freedom largely depends. We can best serve British interests if, on the basis of our friendship, we give our honest advice in private consultation, rather than yield to the temptation of public recrimination, or (what I think they really like) governessy nagging. In this spirit, from the opening days of the renewed troubles in the Far East, centring on Quemoy, I made clear the position of the British Government and people. I am convinced that the mass of the people support the line which we have taken. Recent events have confirmed the wisdom of our course. Strength, then, first; next unity. What is the third need? I called it, for want of a better word, understanding or imagination. We have got to recognise the changing character of the world abroad just as we have to recognise the tremendous changes at home.We know the rise of nationalism, the sense of independence and freedom which come to peoples who have either never had it since the world began, because they have never risen from barbarism, or who formerly had great civilisations and empires that have declined and fallen. Some of these countries, in Asia or Africa, are rising like a giant from a long dream, and are determined to revive the fabled glories of the past. Others, coming for the first time out of the darkness to the light, are determined to force their way into this new exciting world even sometimes at the cost of disunity or aggression. In this turmoil, all this would be less dangerous than it is if so many of these peoples did not lie, as it were, in the uncommitted territory between the great structure of communist strength upon the one side and that of the free peoples upon the other. In this no man\u2019s land position, they can either try to play off one side against the other, gaining benefits from both, or they may be the easy prey to the subversion of Communist propaganda that preaches freedom and practises slavery.What then is our role in all this? Just as the United States has the larger part to play in military strength and in economic development, for they have the greater resources, so I think the Commonwealth has a unique opportunity in the political field.Since we met last year, I undertook a tour of the Commonwealth, which, although it was very short, was the most exciting experience of my life. A month or two before, I had been to Canada where I have been since. But in this tour I went to Pakistan, India, Ceylon, Singapore, Australia, and New Zealand, and all through I was thrilled to feel that some great instrument had come into being - half consciously, no doubt - perhaps under Providence, which can and must largely influence the solution of this struggle in Africa, Asia and Europe.For the Commonwealth represents, by its very nature, a declaration of partnership and interdependence between all men and women of different races, regions, creeds, religions, traditions and philosophies. And how has it come about? In the old Commonwealth countries it has come through the people of British stock who have gone out as pioneers and kept there loyal feelings for the old country and especially for the Crown. But in the new Commonwealth countries it is the product of something of which, perhaps, now we think too little; partly the great pro-consuls who governed these territories, still more perhaps the magistrates, the ordinary administrators, the doctors and the missionaries. To them, therefore, we have handed on the traditions of individual rights, the equality of man with man, the independence of the Judiciary from the Government, the right of free speech, and of free Press, to think, to say, and within limits to do what you like - all the things which in the long course of experience spread over hundreds of years we have learned in our own country. And it is because of this link in the Commonwealth that, although some of the new countries in it have different points of view on questions of defence, or the organisation of military strength, they have a complete unity of view about the things that are really worthwhile in life. It is perhaps worth noticing that it is these new, emerging countries which have come from and are still members of the Commonwealth where these traditions are being maintained and respected. They will have difficulties of course. But they will cling, I believe, to the principles of liberty and respect for the law which are our common tradition. And this is what I feel so deeply: they will have a decisive effect upon some of their neighbours, who, as they reach their independence, may be tempted to fall victims either to Communism or to other forms of dictatorship. I repeat, therefore, our external policy - strength, unity and understanding. Each set of problems, whether in Europe, the Middle East or the Far East, must be dealt with so far as possible in the light of these principles. But our difficulties, as I have said, cannot be resolved by words and speeches and resolutions. They will only become manageable if we apply these principles with patience and determination. Above all, you cannot contract out of this task; you cannot \u2018disengage\u2019 from the common cause of freedom.So ends once more our Tory Conference. Once again, it is a beginning and not an end. This is a time for action not a time for rest. One warning I must give you before I close. Set your faces against apathy and complacency as you would against Socialism itself. Do not be beguiled by the sweet music of public opinion polls; there is work to be done. Yet we have good grounds for hope - yes, and for confidence too. We are building a Britain strong and free as we promised in 1951. Let us then go forward together - with driving enthusiasm and with a living faith.

aVLast year, if I remember right, we did not have a Party Conference. We had a General Election instead and that really went quite well, considering. So far as we are concerned, our mood can be described quite simply. We are grateful but not complacent. Grateful because three successive victories with increasing majorities is something we have received for which we ought to be duly thankful. At the same time, in face of many problems at home, in the Common wealth and in the world, we need to brace ourselves for renewed efforts. Yet if neither the Government nor the Party can afford to relax, we can at least say \u2018thank you.\u2019 As Leader of the Party, I have already had many opportunities to express my personal gratitude to individuals or groups. But I want just once more to thank you all, and through you the massive body of our loyal supporters throughout the length and breadth of the land.Nor should we forget the great men of the past, who made possible this spectacular revival of our Party and presided over its continuous growth - Churchill, Eden, Woolton. These were the architects of victory. After them came Hailsham and Poole, whose confidence never faltered in good times or bad. It would be impossible to mention all my colleagues who have served so well, but there are one or two to whom I must refer. First the Home Secretary: you would think his own Department was enough to keep him occupied - drink, betting and all the rest. But in addition he leads the House of Commons, he is Chairman both of our Party Organisation and its Research Department. We owe him a great debt. We owe much to Heathcoat Amory, whose wisdom, charm and modesty made him both loved and trusted. His successor, whose qualities have been proved in five arduous years at the Foreign Office, brings to his new task a firm character and a flexible mind. I have seen enough already of the new Foreign Secretary\u2019s work, especially at the United Nations, to confirm my confidence that the choice was right, and now you have heard him for yourselves. And then we have to welcome back one or two who have recently returned to us - wandering souls, but happily not lost. We have a young Party and, with some exceptions, a young Government. At any rate we can claim this: although we do not normally address one another as \u2018comrade,\u2019 we are in fact a comradeship of loyal friends.For the last twelve months all sorts of experts have been making surveys and writing articles seeking out the reasons for our victory. There has been a lot of talk about the images of the political parties but what has really emerged is the image of the British people in 1960. What is it that the people of Britain - especially the young people - want in the 1960s? They want to see their country economically sound and prosperous and they want opportunities to get on in their jobs and to use intelligence and imagination and initiative. That is Conservative policy. They want to earn more and to keep more of what they earn. That is Conservative policy. They want more new hospitals, houses, roads and schools. That is Conservative policy. They want their houses to belong increasingly to themselves, not to a local council. That is Conservative policy. They want to see the State coming to the aid of the old, the sick and the unfortunate, with a wide variety of services. That is Conservative policy. They do not want nationalisation or rigid State control of industry. They prefer the Conservative policy of encouraging industry to get on with its own job, with the Government helping and not hindering - a partnership, not a gigantic takeover bid. They want to see their country playing its full part in developing the resources of the Commonwealth and aiding the less fortunate nations of the world. For they know - young and old alike - that materialism is not enough. That material prosperity, to be hallowed, must be shared. That is the policy of the good neighbour; and if it means risks or sacrifices to achieve it, these must be accepted. That, too, is Conservative policy. They see the securing of peace and justice as the most important problem abroad, and they want our country to be united and strong enough to give a lead. They are not despondent or cast down by difficulties. They are eager to face the exciting problems of prosperity and development in a rapidly changing and often dangerous world. That is the Conservative faith.So we need not be surprised when the pollsters tell us that more and more Conservative support is coming from the young people. We must keep it that way. Our Party needs all the time new blood and new ideas. My first duty today is formally to launch the new national campaign of our Young Conservatives. In this campaign we have two aims - to increase their political activity, and to increase their membership. Mere numbers are not enough. That is why I am so glad to learn that there are now well over two hundred Young Conservative policy groups in the constituencies. This work will be of real value in our Government. It will give us first hand information about the way the younger generation is thinking and feeling. And, by the way, our Young Conservatives cover a very wide range of responsibility and age. At one end they are at school; at the other they may well be married people with children of their own at school. Their voice deserves to be heard in the Party, and in recent years it has been heard with increasing effectiveness. Everybody who has attended your discussions this week will have heard that for themselves. Next February they are going to have a go at a conference of their own. The Young Conservatives are already the largest political youth movement in the free world. They have played a great part in the historic victories of our Party. I ask everyone to help in this campaign. I hope that it will result in a big boost in the numbers and the enthusiasm of Young Conservatives throughout the country. If it does - as I am sure it will - then we can say with all confidence: \u2018The Future is Ours.\u2019At the last General Election we called our Manifesto \u2018The Next Five Years.\u2019 The first of these years is over; and you have heard a progress report from Ministers of how they have been using it. Let us start with our social laws - many of them notoriously out-of-date. We have dealt with betting in the first Session of Parliament; licensing comes next. In all this our aim is to keep a right balance between freedom and excess.The problem of crime, as in most other countries, is a cause of concern. It will certainly help if the police are not expected to enforce laws which no longer command general respect. It will also help them to be relieved of some of their routine traffic duties. Of course, the new system has its growing pains, but I think it is beginning to work. Anyway, I heard all about it from my wife. On the broader aspects of crime and prison reform the Home Secretary is manfully at work on new legislation.I turn next to education. We have a proud record of achievement, and the Minister, Sir David Eccles, has ambitious plans for the future. Since 1951 we have provided nearly 2,500,000 new school places and - even more important - there are 57,000 extra teachers in the schools. We have big development programmes under way covering both schools and colleges. Next, housing. At our Conference ten years ago you told us to raise our sights and asked for the 300,000 target. The Socialists said we could never build them, or alternatively, as the lawyers put it, that we could only do it at the expense of school building. They have been proved wrong on both counts. We have built the houses and we have built the schools, too. More than 2,500,000 houses have gone up since 1951, giving one family in every six in this island a new home. And for many of them not just a home, but a home of their own. Meanwhile the local authorities, with Government help and encouragement, are making good progress with special needs such as houses for the elderly and slum clearance. We need to do better still for the elderly, and we will. We are getting ahead with slum clearance; we are re-housing people from the slums at the rate of 200,000 a year.Housing, with all its related issues - rents, the use of land, town planning - involves some pretty intricate and knotty problems. In you, Mr. Chairman, we have the right man to tackle them. Better homes make for better health. Yet whatever strides we make in the prevention of disease, we shall always need the health service to cure illness. There are now nearly two hundred major hospital building schemes in various stages of building and planning covering the whole country. Apart from maintaining a high standard in the Health Service, we have given special attention to the needs of the mentally sick under the new Act which was put on the Statute Book last year. On Thursday you debated the needs of the elderly; their human needs as well as their financial needs.At the last election both Parties put forward their schemes. I observe that the Labour Party\u2019s has now been scrapped. It was found, it was said, to be too complicated to attract the electors. In other words, they did not trust it - or its authors. In contrast, our plan has been put on the Statute Book and comes into operation next April. It is designed to get the right balance between State help and self help. While it strengthens the State scheme, it does not exclude private and occupational provision. These arrangements are for the future. For those who have already retired I made our policy clear at the Election and I repeat it now.We intend that they should continue to share in the expansion of national wealth. And I think you will find that in the future, as in the past, our actions match our words. That, then, is the story. The facts are clear. We have the biggest social programme in our history and we are spending on it a bigger proportion of our national wealth than ever before. We are carrying out scrupulously the pledges given at the last Election. We are doing things that people want done and that we believe need doing.I know there are some people who never like to dwell upon anything that goes right. They seem to think that to travel despondently is better than to arrive. But we must face the fact that in many fields, particularly in education, expenditure is bound to rise.We must also recognise that taken together with necessary expenditure on defence, it places a big burden on the economy. There is thus a limit to what the Government can spend, and a limit to the speed with which we can carry out our declared policy of seeking to reduce taxation. Of course, if you are right, and you are right, to want to see more money spent in all kinds of worthwhile directions, then we must accept the consequences. If you go into a restaurant and order a meal, you must be prepared to pay the bill when it is presented.Experience over the last nine years, however, shows that we need not be discouraged. For we have been able both to expand our national services and at the same time to reduce taxation.The social services today are costing hundreds of millions more than when we came to office. But we are taking £1,300,000,000 a year less from the taxpayer than we should be if we had maintained the Socialist rates of direct taxation. How has that come about? We have spent more and yet drawn out less in taxation.One explanation of that is in prudent management and an attempt to concentrate spending at the points where it will do most good. That has meant - you must have forgotten them now but I have not - doing some unpopular things as well as popular things. That\u2019s what Governments are for.The other explanation is the expansion of our national wealth. We must make sure that this healthy growth continues upon sound foundations. We want this growth, and the prosperity that goes with it, to be spread as evenly as possible throughout the country.In the past year total unemployment has fallen by 100,000. With a national unemployment figure of only 1.4 per cent we have today by any definition full employment. But at the time of the Election we were disturbed by the existence of local patches of unemployment in particular areas. We promised - to deal with it - a Local Employment Act. This has now been passed into law. Under this Act, you will have read of great schemes of development in those parts of the country, where they are specially needed, steel, motor-cars and other projects. But even before these schemes have reached fruition, which are only now beginning, I am happy to say the figures in these areas are improving all the time.In Scotland unemployment has fallen from 3.9 per cent to 3 per cent; in Wales from 3.2 per cent to 2.4 per cent; in the Northern Region of England from 3 per cent to 1.4 per cent; in Lancashire from 2.4 per cent to 1.7 per cent. There is, alas, one area that still causes us great anxiety and for which we will do our best - the loyal people of Northern Ireland.In our Manifesto we said that our policy was to double the British standard of living in this generation. This was an ambitious aim - some thought too ambitious. But as Mr. Butler told you yesterday, the figures prove that we are well up to schedule.Now, a word about Agriculture. With an increased production of 68 per cent above pre-war, Agriculture is playing its full part in the national wealth. It is still our greatest industry and it plays a double role. On purely economic grounds a high and efficient agricultural production helps our balance of payments. From a wider point of view a prosperous and contented countryside is part of our way of life, and essential to the wellbeing of the towns. As we all know only too well, agriculture must always be to some extent at the mercy of the weather. Last year the problem was the drought. This year we are all extending our sympathy to those areas which are suffering grievously from flood. Of course the officials in the Ministry even it all up. They produce annual figures adjusted to what they optimistically call \u2018normal weather conditions.\u2019 Personally I share the view of the old farmer who said that he hadn\u2019t seen one average summer in the last sixty years.However, our agricultural progress has continued - come drought or flood. Happily today, even in difficult areas, the great spread of agricultural machinery has lightened the task of the farmer, and it is worth recalling that our agriculture is the most highly mechanised in the whole world. Progress has continued not only on the large farms, but on the small ones too. It has been aided by our various schemes for improvement grants, of which growing use is being made.I said just now that the prosperity of town and countryside were interlinked. Ultimately they both depend - we all depend - on the expansion of world trade. To achieve that expansion - and I read the most interesting debate you had here - we are working on different schemes to increase economic co-operation between the countries of Europe.Two groups, as you know have been formed - the Six and the Seven, we call them. It is our aim to bring them into better harmony to the mutual advantage of all. It will not be easy but we shall not be discouraged. And you can be sure - as you have already heard it from the Ministers concerned - that we shall not overlook in any of these plans the vital interests both of Commonwealth trade and British agriculture. There are, I am told, some signs that expansion in world trade has slackened recently, after its great surge forward in the last year or two, but it seems likely that any pause will only be temporary. Be that as it may, what is certain is that world trade is becoming more and more competitive.It has been said before, but we must always remind ourselves of it - the world does not owe us a living. We have to earn it. That means that we have to compete, and to compete with some very efficient countries equipped with the most modern machinery. Anything, therefore, which pushes up our production costs, whether it be excessive wage demands, or inefficient management, or restrictive practices on either side of industry, can only damage our export trade and the foundations of our present prosperity and full employment. And this is the background in which I appeal to all concerned in industry - employers and employed and especially the very responsible Trade Union leaders who play such an important role - that all work together to ensure that our industrial costs do not rise beyond what our customers overseas will pay. Of course, in his conference speech the Chancellor of the Exchequer covered all this ground; (and, by the way, I hope the Foreign Secretary is not depressed at seeing how much better the Chancellor of the Exchequer looks now that he has left the Foreign Office; but I think the Foreign Secretary has the strength. If he looks as well in five years\u2019 time as the Chancellor of the Exchequer does now I will be very pleased.) He dealt with all these subjects on which I would only touch by saying this: an economy as delicately balanced as ours is, where exports are so vital and where excessive imports may be so damaging, such an economy cannot be steered with absolute precision. We have all the time to keep upon the narrow edge between undue inflation or undue deflation - both of them in their different ways equally disastrous - and between too much expansion and too little. And if the balance is to be kept, economic adjustments are necessary from time to time; nevertheless, I can assure you that the broad purpose of the Government is to encourage the development of investment and production at the greatest pace which prudence will allow.I have tried to summarise the work of one year to give you a broad picture of how our social and economic policies have been progressing. Perhaps you would now allow me just to say a few words about the principles which lie behind these policies.Our starting point, I think, is the supreme value of each individual human being and his right to develop his personality in freedom. That may sound just a vague truism. Yet it is one that no politician should ever forget, because it at once sets the limit to political action and to what governments can do or ought to do. But individuals live in society and they have duties as well as rights; and the State must maintain the framework of an ordered society. An important part of this framework lies in our institutions. Through them our national character is expressed and continuity maintained. Through them our forefathers have endeavoured over the ages to work out a balance between order and freedom, and so we continue today. In all this, the Crown, Parliament, our legal system, our local government institutions, to mention but a few, play a vital part. A good deal of history (and some of it pretty rough history) has gone into the fashioning of these institutions to give us the right balance between order and freedom, and the maintenance of this balance needs constant vigilance.Last century when Liberalism was in the ascendancy, Conservatives felt the need to counteract the excess of individualism and laissez faire. When we came into office in 1951 we found that the balance had been upset in the other direction - too much power concentrated in the State. We have done a good deal to restore it since, that is the first principle. The second, with which I hope you will equally agree, is that the family is, and must continue to be, the keystone of our national life. Divinely ordered, the family it is at once the most natural and the most intimate of our institutions. It has the most decisive influence in moulding our early years, and the effectiveness of the services the State provides - for example, education - largely depends upon the foundations laid in the home. So does respect for law and decent behaviour.The strengthening of family life must be one of our central themes, and that as much as anything has inspired our housing drive.What do these guiding principles - the dignity of man and the consequent necessary limits to political power, the value of our institutions as the cement of society - mean in terms of policy?One thing they mean is surely this: moderation should be the keynote of policy. Extremes always threaten the family or the individual in one way or another. Too much State control endangers freedom and initiative; but a free-for-all exalts rights over duties and means that the weak go to the wall. Extremes undermine the national unity which it is our Conservative tradition to foster. We want the maximum of consent to acts of government and the minimum of coercion. Our aim is to harmonise different and conflicting interests, not to set them against each other with the strident accents of the class war. We aim to balance them so that all can contribute as one nation to the common good.In politics we need faith. We need hope too. These are great virtues. But don\u2019t let us forget the words, \u2018the greatest of these is charity.\u2019All that preoccupies us here at home must be set in a wider context. All our achievements and all our hopes depend on peace and prosperity in the world. It is just over a week since my return from New York to which you referred. I was not at all sure whether I could do any good by going there. I certainly did not wish to be tempted into playing Mr. Krushchev\u2019s game. However, after the Foreign Secretary had attended the opening of the United Nations General Assembly he sent me a message urging me to come. He felt that it was only right that with so many Heads of State and Heads of Government, including many of the Commonwealth countries, collecting in New York, the British Prime Minister should be present. And I am glad that I went. It was a remarkable gathering - the leaders of nearly 100 nations from North, South, East and West; comprising, with some important omissions, almost all the countries of the world. It was a dramatic and unforgettable experience. And with all its weaknesses and faults, the ludicrous aspects as well as the solemn, no one who has any imagination can fall to look on this spectacle without a certain awe. Here were the representatives of this strange human race that in a tiny period of geological time has conquered all its terrestrial rivals and made itself master of the material world. Is it doomed now to self-destruction? Or can it conquer its own passions and so, under Providence, master its own destiny?Today the world is full of divisions, and there are various ways of looking at them. There is the East-West, or Communist versus the free countries; then there is the division between developed and undeveloped countries; and there is the division between the democratic countries and non-democratic countries. And then there is the new Soviet view that the world is divided into Communist, Capitalist, and Uncommitted. Of course, in reality it is not so simple. It is true that the two great power groups, that is the groups armed with the most formidable weapons and the power of producing them, are on the one side, the Communists, and on the other the Western Democracies. There is no question where Britain stands here. Britain stands with the West. Nor let the world be deceived by the chance clash of personalities and argument in our strange political disputes here at home. There are of course earnest and sincere pacifists, a body of opinion which has always been respected and, may I add, generously treated in this country. There are, of course, a few Communists and fellow travellers. There are a few traitors too, I have no doubt. Then there is a large class of worthy but rather woolly-minded people who are more easily moved by emotion than thought and argument. But there is nothing new in all this. We understand it here at home. But sometimes in the past our enemies and even our friends have been deceived by a chance vote given here or there. They are wrong. The British people do not change. And at heart they are determined to stand firm in the defence of freedom. There has been great talk recently of a neutral bloc. It is true that there are countries which are not members of one or other of the great military alliances. All the same, even those members of the Commonwealth who follow a policy of non-alignment are opposed to Communism. They are not spiritually uncommitted, even when they are so militarily. And what is true of these Commonwealth countries is true of many others who are in no military grouping. There is in this sense no real neutral bloc. A certain grouping of this character forms itself from time to time in the Assembly meetings for special purposes. But it has no great underlying unity of political doctrine or constitutional method. These countries are neutral in the sense of not wishing to be involved in the clash between the great Powers. They have an important part to play in the world, and we have an important duty towards them. And yet, of course, by a strange paradox, this neutrality would be gravely threatened if it were not for the power of the West. I ask myself - how far would it be possible to sustain a neutral position if it were not for NATO, SEATO, CENTO, and above all, the Western determination and authority. Had NATO, which I was glad to have the chance of defending in the Assembly, had it not come into being, or were it now to be deserted, abandoned by America, Canada, Britain or France, what would be left of freedom and national independence?There is, however, another and a much more real division between the nations of the world. It is the division between the developed and the undeveloped countries. All developed countries have a moral obligation towards their less fortunate neighbours. Britain has a special duty which she is manfully performing. It is the duty to the Commonwealth countries which, although now independent, still require investment of money and men on a massive scale. Indeed, one of our main concerns in the management of our own economy is to guide it so as to be able to carry out these duties. Nor have we limited our responsibilities to Commonwealth countries. There are many other areas which we have aided and will continue to aid. As I said just now nobody can be in any doubt that we stand loyal to our Alliances and a stalwart member of the coalition of free nations. That is clear. But it does not in my view mean that we should all the time indulge in a running propaganda battle with the Soviet Union by means of violent polemics. It may suit them but I do not really think it suits us. What we ought to do is this. We should be absolutely firm in our attitude towards the Soviet bloc. We should not give in. We should not surrender. But we should try to damp down controversy and we should try to encourage in every way we can a general amelioration of relations, or in the current cliché - I do not like it but it is the one which has become current - the reduction of tensions.I believe that is not only in the interest of Great Britain, and in the interest of the West, but in the interest of the whole world. For after all, however far away it may be - I shall not live to see it, but however far away - we must look to the end. And how will the struggle end? It can end in only one of two ways. The first, force: that is no direct solution in the modern nuclear world. It doesn\u2019t end the argument, except in the sense that it ends the people who are arguing. It ends in mutual destruction. The second way is by negotiation, leading perhaps to a slow but gradual transformation of the situation. Given peace, and given time, we must believe in our ultimate success. For we believe that our way of life is better materially, morally, and spiritually, and that, with peace and growing contacts between the two concepts, the faith we hold must triumph. If we do not believe that, then we have no right to call ourselves either democrats or Christians. Mr. Krushchev, for his part, no doubt thinks his way of life is better, and that, given peaceful co-existence, perhaps of his own definition but still that it will be without war, is bound to succeed. Mao-Tse-Tung and Chou-En-Lai do not agree with this view. They think (which is the orthodox Marxist view) that it can only be resolved by armed conflict. Hence the dispute of which you read. Now, if I may venture, without impertinence, to join in this controversy, I am bound to say I lean myself to the Russian as opposed to the Chinese view. But if we think negotiation, peaceful co-existence, of whatever form, the lowering of tension, feasible and right, how can we make progress? I must confess to you that the collapse of the May Summit was a grievous disappointment to me. I had worked hard enough for it, and it was a tragedy to see this dream melt away in an afternoon. However, it is no good crying over spilt Summits, and I felt that we must nerve ourselves to face what would happen and look forward to some later improvement.Of course, the situation has substantially worsened since May. It would be quite foolish to deny it. It has been worsened by a new outburst of controversy and by the use of the United Nations Assembly for purely propaganda purposes. It has worsened because negotiations have in fact been broken off. Nevertheless our purpose must be to try to get back to the mood of last spring. Negotiations on Germany and Berlin will have to be resumed. I have had one or two conversations the - Foreign Secretary with me - with Mr. Krushchev, and he has given his accounts of what I said to him at some Press Club or public meetings in New York. And when I refer to the careful record which has been kept, I am sometimes a little surprised. But allowing for the embroidery of his natural exuberance, I do not think that he has misrepresented the spirit of our private talks. Our public meetings were rather different. I told him that the problem of Berlin and Germany must be handled in a way that does justice to the reasonable desires of the German people through negotiation and not by force. It is a potentially dangerous problem from the point of view of East and West alike. And, if we can have a Summit for this - and other purposes - and if my two partners, the Presidents of the United States and of France agree, I am all for it. I have said so, both privately and publicly. Indeed, all the three Western powers said it in their joint statement last May, after the collapse of that Summit meeting.Then there is the question of disarmament. Here, too, progress has been disappointingly slow. The trouble is that the discussions never seem to get to grips. Plan succeeds plan, committee follows committee, but these conferences never seem able to cut the cackle and come to the rockets; and whenever a committee starts to go fairly well, so far the Russians have walked out of it. There are thus manoeuvrings and recriminations. Our position is clear and simple. We don\u2019t want just to argue about disarmament. We want the nations to disarm. The broad problem of disarmament is discussed year by year by the Assembly in committee. And that is right, for the whole body of the United Nations has a continuing interest in this problem which affects them all. But this discussion by nearly a hundred Nations can only be in the most general terms. What is the next stage? Here I think we ought to distinguish between principles and the practical details. The principles can and ought to be discussed and agreed in a group representing the diverse interests of the world. For example the Ten Power Committee which the Russians so unexpectedly left earlier this year. That is the principles. But when it comes to the practical methods of inspection, control and the like, they must be examined by people who know something about the arms in question and how and what are the technical problems of controlling them. Such a group must be small, efficient, experienced. And we have an example as I said at the Assembly, in the scientists who met preliminary to the discussions on the abolition of nuclear tests who produced a practical report, upon which a political treaty may still, we hope, be based. For that negotiation, happily, is still proceeding. The Soviet Government appeared, however, either to reject or not to understand my proposal, but I will continue to do my best to make it clear to them. At any rate I feel sure that if we are to make progress on disarmament practical discussions of the technical details must go hand in hand with broad discussions of principle. The Russians say they want a general agreement on disarmament, but that only after that agreement has been reached will they discuss control. They accuse us of saying that we want control without disarmament. Of course, that is not our position. We want simultaneous disarmament and control, and the two must go together at all stages. I do not despair, for here is one of the cases where, as the Foreign Secretary said, our interests ought to be the same.Disarmament, if it can be achieved, must be of equal interest to the Russian people as to our own. They too must grudge the large expenditure of human effort and skill which goes into these more and more complicated weapons. If the will is there - and it certainly is on our side - I believe a way can be found. As the Foreign Secretary told you on Thursday, we will continue our most strenuous efforts to clear away the misunderstanding, reveal the real points of difference, and try to resolve them. In spite of the disappointments we have had and the failure up to now to persuade the Soviet Government to accept our sincere proposals, we shall persevere.I have spoken of these recent events. Perhaps you will allow me, before I finish, to say a few words about what I would call our role in this tumultuous world. What can we in Britain contribute, and for what can our country stand? First, let me say that we can contribute little unless we work together with a reasonable degree of internal unity and with an attitude of reason and calm. Ranting or exhibitionism, whether clerical or lay, of the intellectual or the hooligan, will not increase our standing in the world. It is true that, relative to other countries, or some other countries, we have not the great wealth, vast territorial possessions, the might and strength or armed forces that we had in the last century. I do not think that we need to be too depressed about that, because what is true of us now was true of our position in the 16th and 17th and a large part of the 18th centuries. Yet our influence in the days of the first Elizabeth may perhaps inspire us to what our influence could and, please God, will be in the reign of the second Elizabeth. We have experience, and that counts. We have perhaps a certain amount of self-control; and people get very excited all round us. We have worldwide interests: Europe, the Atlantic Alliance, and above all the Commonwealth. Our economic and financial interests are not limited to these islands or even to the groups that I have mentioned. We are linked with the whole Sterling Area, and thus closely with the under-developed countries.Naturally the Second War knocked us about a good bit and it has taken us a little time to recover. But in recent years our reputation in the world and our influence is stronger. No one doubts our firm resolution. No one can doubt our earnest and honest desire for peace. But by peace we do not mean surrender to force: we mean peace with justice.Moreover, we have shown a remarkable power to adapt our institutions to new circumstances and new needs both here at home and overseas. The older ones among us have seen in our lifetime startling changes. These changes are continuing at a tremendous pace. We have seen the Empire being transformed into the Commonwealth of free and independent nations.I cannot tell you how moving it was to me and how helpful to find in the United Nations so many leaders of the Commonwealth countries and to profit by their experience and friendship. Representing the older members of the Commonwealth were great and stalwart figures, Menzies, Diefenbaker, Nash. I was able, also, to have long and intimate discussions with Mr. Nehru, almost the senior of our Commonwealth Prime Ministers, who has an unrivalled position both in his own country and throughout Asia - indeed throughout the world. There came too, the youngest of our team, Dr. Nkrumah of Ghana and Prime Minister Abubakar of Nigeria.Of course there are differences of emphasis and approach, but I do not think any great difference of purpose and underlying faith. The very presence at the United Nations Assembly of these men was a living rebuttal of the attacks on what is called imperialism and colonialism. But of course we still have difficult problems ahead and we must try to bring to them both imagination and decision. In Africa British initiative has brought with it all the civilising influences. In addition to establishing peace and order it has developed industry, agriculture, transport and power. In certain areas, notably Kenya and the Rhodesias, many Brush people have settled.  They have made these countries their permanent home. And they have done so with the encouragement of successive British Governments.We have, therefore, obligations not only of interest but of honour. But the very success of the pioneers has brought with it corresponding problems. With education and development there has grown a new ambition and a new political consciousness among the African people. We have, therefore, in the words of the Resolution you carried on Wednesday, to see that in the march to self-government legitimate rights are protected as well as legitimate aspirations fulfilled.Of course it is not easy to do this, not at all. It is a tremendous test for all concerned. Our main duty here at home it seems to me, where we live remote from these pressures is to unite in showing understanding, sympathy and restraint.We are indeed fortunate in having to help us the Commonwealth and Colonial Secretaries, Mr. Sandys and Mr. Macleod. Together they make a good team. This is not the time for me to speak about the details of the Monckton Commission. We have already expressed our gratitude to Lord Monckton and his colleagues for their work. It will, of course, be for the Federal Review Conference to discuss and decide these great matters. I would only say this: the purpose of the Monckton Commission was to help us not to destroy, but to confirm and develop the federal association between the three territories of Central Africa; and the remarkable and outstanding feature of the Commission\u2019s Report is the nearly unanimous acceptance of the need for such a federation, and the tragedy that would be involved in its collapse. Not enough attention, I think, has been given to that which is the main feature of the Monckton Commission\u2019s Report. The Government, therefore, will approach the Review with the earnest hope that the Conference will find an agreed basis for the continuance of a federal structure, and with the determination to carry out to the full our responsibilities and our pledges towards all men of all races.I have said this is a world of change, but in change we must not despair; we must keep cool heads and stout hearts. Of course a lot of people do not like this change. The Pax Britannica had certainly great advantages. Guaranteed by the British Navy, there was maintained for a hundred years a broad peace between the great powers, in the course of which the world made the greatest jump forward in its history in technical and material progress. Nor should we forget what was done on the moral and spiritual side. If the trader developed the Empire initially, the doctor, the missionary and the administrator were close behind. Many people may think that the world was better in the old days - they always have thought so. Countries, like individuals, can give themselves up to an agreeable old age in cherishing these nostalgic memories. They have the melancholy charm of autumn. But spring is the time for a strong and virile people. This is no time for vain regrets; and the excitements, the opportunities, the thrills of what can be done in the second half of this century are, to my mind, as great as those seized by our forefathers.Much of what is happening now is good, very good. Sometimes there is retrogression, confusion, almost chaos. There is a lesson to be drawn from the Congo situation. But it is just as much a warning against going too slow as against going too fast. At any rate, we have given our new emergent territories a good training and a good chance. They will make mistakes. Their Governments, like all Governments, will commit follies. Their countries, like all countries, will be misled by demagogues. But that happens even among quite experienced people.I said in the beginning of my speech that I believed our people, and especially our young people - in spite of all the dangers and problems of the day - were ready to join confidently in the march forward. I believe that they would wish a British Government in the critical years that lie ahead to make its own positive contribution to these vast and often baffling problems. History and geography have combined to place our country at this time in a position of special responsibility and special opportunity.It falls to the Conservative Party now - and perhaps for many years to come - to ensure that the responsibilities are faced and the opportunities seized. Let us remember the past both to read its lessons and to draw from it inspiration; but let our minds and energies be directed to the tasks of the future. In the closing minutes of this Conference - this great Conference - let us cast away party pride or sense of party triumph. Instead let us all humbly resolve to be equal to our duty and worthy of our trust.

aVThis month marks the tenth anniversary of our Conservative Government. But I do not intend this afternoon to look back. I would rather look forward. I will only say this. Our opponents affect to dismiss this whole period as \u2018wasted years.\u2019 If the country at large shared that view, they would hardly have renewed our mandate with bigger majorities at two General Elections.I would like first to pay tribute to all my colleagues in the Government, whether in the Cabinet or outside, and to the Members of our Party in Parliament for their loyal support. It would also be right at this meeting to refer to the change in the Chairmanship of the Party. Mr. Butler, at my special request, took on this work after the last Election. He has given the Party great and distinguished service. He is now going to help me in a wider field of public duties. In particular he is going to lead the Ministerial group in London charged with the general over sight of the Common Market negotiations which are to be carried on by Mr. Heath on the Continent. I am deeply grateful to him.I commend to you Mr. Macleod as Mr. Butler\u2019s successor. He has proved a most successful Minister. He has had long experience of how the Party works; he has zest and great organising ability. I am sure that he can count on the support which has been accorded to all his predecessors and will be fortified by the invaluable help of Sir Toby Low. That is all I have to say on Party matters today. Well, not quite all. I will allow myself just one excursion into the fascinating realms of Labour Party policy, partly for its own intrinsic importance, and partly because it is typical of the indecision which is characteristic of the Socialists today. I will choose a subject of which I have had some experience \u2013 Housing. At the last General Election the Socialists had a plan to purchase, for I don\u2019t know how many hundreds of millions of pounds, and hand over to the Local Authorities all rented homes - about five million of them. This was one of the major planks in their platform. But in \u2018Signposts for the Sixties\u2019 this takeover bid has been quietly withdrawn, gone, vanished, faded away, kaput. At their recent Conference, somebody from the floor moved to put the plan back again. The platform was of course indignant, and saw to it that the proposal was voted down. It was explained that the Executive no longer believed the scheme would work. Perhaps it is as well for us all that they discovered that in opposition and not in office.I will not follow this afternoon what has become the traditional pattern for these occasions, and give you a detailed progress report on almost every aspect of policy. In the last few days you have had full debates on all the vital issues. You have heard the responsible Ministers describe their problems and their plans in a series of brilliant speeches. In that field they have left me very little to say. What I should like to do is to take a look at where we all stand today, and see whether any answer can be found to some of the questions which are in the minds of everyone, especially the younger generation.What is Britain\u2019s place and purpose in the modern world? What are our goals at home and abroad? What must we do to get there? What are the dangers? What are the prizes and what are the stakes? Nobody viewing the international scene today can fail to be concerned and saddened by the deterioration which has taken place during the past eighteen months.Faced with so many problems, there are some people \u2013 not, I am happy to think, in our Party - who would like Britain to retire into isolation and cease to play a major part in the world. We might perhaps make some minor contribution to some Regional Pact, or preferably contract out altogether - become \u2018sitters,\u2019 not \u2018doers.\u2019 We should then, it is true, be less involved in the day to day struggle. Whether we should be any safer is another matter. All experience shows that you only stay neutral and safe if there are others who are prepared to defend you.The world today is torn by one of its great doctrinal struggles, greater perhaps than any in the past. Nothing in our recent experience has ever approached the gulf between Communist ideology and our own. And not only between Communism and our own Christian philosophy but between Communism and any idealist philosophy based on a belief in God. Nothing can bridge that gap. What we can hope to do - and what we should continue to aim at doing - is so to contain the issue without abandoning our own positions that time is given a chance to do its healing work. In the fullness of time, if we believe our own faith, we must surely hope that what we regard as wicked and cynical doctrines will gradually change and lose their fervency and strength. Then Communist countries may begin to develop into more normal civilisations recovering a moral basis for their life.But we are confronted with more than a struggle of ideologies. It is also a struggle for power. For Communist Russia by a strange quirk, is the greatest colonialist and imperialist country in the world and it is using all the old arts and ambitions of Tsarist Russia, strengthened by the techniques and devices of the modern world, and a strange if perverted creed that has a queer attraction both for the most primitive and for the most sophisticated societies. Sometimes they have come with offers of money (not in fact very much money, nothing on a scale approaching the aid the Western countries have given). Sometimes they have come with a revolutionary creed which at first at any rate is often attractive to peoples whose political evolution has been slow. Sometimes they offer armaments in order to set this country against that. Naturally by all these moves they have some success. All the same, experience of the Russian clutch makes people a little suspicious of it. Sometimes they are able to wrench themselves free. Sometimes, alas, the process has gone too far. Once the Bear\u2019s hug has got you, it\u2019s apt to be for keeps. But except in the countries actually neighbouring to Russia, the Communists have not been able to operate by their own armed force. Even in these countries nobody can doubt what is the real feeling of the people, whether it be Poland, East Germany, or Hungary. Nor can any honest man deny what would be the result of any straightforward plebiscite.It is Soviet Russia that has frustrated all our efforts at Geneva to reach agreement on the abolition of nuclear tests. In addition, she has blown off a score or more explosions in the atmosphere amounting to many megatons. I cannot help contrasting the rather modest reaction all over the world, including our left-wingers, to this wanton addition to the fallout risks, with what would have been said had the offender been one of the Western Powers. All the same, I still hope that the Russians may in their own interests be willing to accept something in the nature of a detente; that they may wish for a pause in this particular turn of the struggle. Berlin may provide the first real test of that. The Foreign Secretary has put before you very clearly the present state of the Berlin problem and our hopes of finding by patient examination a basis for negotiation. I have nothing to add to what he has said except perhaps to observe how brilliantly in the last year he has justified an appointment which did not go uncriticised when it was made.If Communism could bring itself to carry out with sincerity what their leaders declare to be their purpose, if they would allow a straightforward competition between our two systems, we should gladly accept the challenge.Meanwhile we must accept the fact that this bleak ideological struggle may last for another generation, perhaps even longer. In this struggle we must have faith and a sense of purpose. In every civilised society there has been a conflict between the materialist and the idealist concept of life. Some of the noblest figures have devoted themselves entirely to the latter. These are the great lights that have shone through history. There have been many, too, who with pure cynicism and selfishness have followed only what they believe to be their immediate material interests. All the same, the great mass of us have been brought up to believe that practical day-to-day ambitions should be leavened by idealist inspiration. Now we are faced with vast communities and widespread doctrines which wholly reject any idea of this view of life. Materialism is all they think about. If this mood were to spread, either in the form of a positive acceptance of Marxist atheism or in the perhaps more dangerous form, the indolence of agnosticism, then I believe that Western society would be doomed.Britain cannot retire from this contest, but we cannot wage it alone. We must bring to the help of our friends and allies such moral and material strength as we can create at home. And we must do more. We must look outside our island, wherever we have authority and influence. That is one of the purposes of our policy. We can bring our influence in the Commonwealth. We can play our part in Europe. We must bring a continual effort to strengthen the organisations and groupings of the Free World, for the Free World is not strong enough to hold out unless it works as a team - together.It has been with this in mind that we have approached the question of Europe and the Common Market. In recent years, the countries of Western Europe have drawn closer together in matters of common defence. But in economic affairs there is still a potentially dangerous rift - the Six and the Seven, both of them in themselves sincere attempts at cooperation and greater unity. But if the gulf cannot be bridged, or if it seems to be permanent and unbridgeable, then I greatly fear the consequences will be grave. It will be, as I said in the United States six months ago, \u2018a canker gnawing at the very heart of the Western Alliance.\u2019 The Lord Privy Seal, Mr. Heath, and the Commonwealth Secretary have dealt in detail with our position in these negotiations and with the safeguards that we require for the Commonwealth, our home agriculture and our EFTA partners. I need not go into it here. I am convinced that a more united Europe could be and will be of the utmost benefit to our Commonwealth family.This issue, which you have been discussing largely on economic aspects, does not concern only the economic aspects. We must keep in mind the picture of the Commonwealth as a whole and what it has come to mean. It should be idle to claim that the recent developments which are turning the Empire into the Commonwealth have met with universal approbation at home. It is quite natural that there should be nostalgic memories of past glories. Of course, to the little Englander or the philosophic Radical this means nothing, for they always rather disapprove of the great story of British expansion overseas. Yet nobody today can go to any of those distant parts of the world - and I have visited, as Prime Minister, almost every Commonwealth country - without a thrill and a tightening of the throat as old memories stir. Nearer home, we cannot pass a museum or depot of almost any regiment without remembering with pride how much valour has been spent in the creation of this immense heritage. In the next stage, when conquest changed to administration we remember not only the great pro-consuls but the simple, humble men and women who gave so much to the advancement of the peoples entrusted to them. Now we have reached the third stage. It has been our constant purpose to hold these responsibilities as trustees until, with the ward grown up and able to arrange his own affairs, the guardians can take their honourable discharge. Nor should we perhaps forget, as it is forgotten sometimes, that in the early days it was not a choice between independence or British rule. It was often either British rule or chaos.As I say, the third stage has now been reached. Of course it is fraught with great problems and great dangers. All the same, I think the best judges may perhaps be those who have had to deal with this changing scene. The reactionaries, if there are some, have not been the governors nor the members of the colonial service; not at all, it is they who have been the leaders even in this evolution. If there are disappointments and setbacks, as there are and must be, on the way - and what great human aspirations have not suffered disappointments and setbacks - my faith, and your faith, I believe, in the destiny of the Commonwealth is still undimmed.I believe that this is the dawn and not the dusk. What we have done and are still trying to do is something which has never before been attempted in history. Our purpose is to create by evolution a new Commonwealth structure which will avoid the decline and fall which till now has been the fate of every Empire. Freedom of the individual under the law, the right to think what you like, say what you like, and within the law take what action you like, and, above all, to believe that the machinery of the State exists to be the servant not the master of its people - to open up a wider and fuller life for the individual - these are what the Commonwealth should stand for. We do not all always live up to our ideals; growing countries have their growing pains. We in this island had quite a rough time of it for many centuries, with many bitter internal struggles until the Victorian age, when we settled down to the orderly form of politics we now enjoy. So let us hope that others may be able to learn from our mistakes.To return to the Common Market. The prizes of success would be great, but they are long-term and not short-term prizes. Nor must we delude ourselves. Even if we succeed in negotiating our entry on acceptable terms, that will not be any short cut to an effortless prosperity. It will not absolve us from the stark necessity of earning our way in the world in the teeth of fierce competition. It will be no less necessary than now to keep a close eye on costs and prices. Indeed, we must expect competition to intensify. It is a bracing cold shower we shall enter, not a relaxing Turkish bath.But that must be our experience whether we join or not. In or out of the Common Market, Britain in this decade must be prepared to face changes in her industrial life and organisation, some of them novel, many of them painful, but all of them in the long run salutary. We in the Government felt that there is now a chance of giving a new meaning to the future relations of Britain, Europe and the Commonwealth and that in the state of the world today this may make a difference. We cannot guarantee that we shall succeed in our purpose. But I am sure we should have been wrong, after full reflection and earnest weighing of all these things, not to have made the attempt. If, through indecision, timidity, or sheer political expediency, we had allowed this opportunity to slip from us, we should have failed to rise to the level of events. Your vote on Thursday showed that our Party is ready to face the reality of the world today. Of course, the Socialists once again are undecided. They, as a party, belong to the class which the Gallup Poll calls \u2018don\u2019t knows.\u2019 Mr. Gaitskell is still hesitating. Let him beware lest, if I may recall a famous phrase, he sits so long on the fence that the iron enters into his soul.In any event - in this Common Market or out of it - our economic policy must be dynamic not static. It must change with changing conditions. Naturally, after the restraints of six years of war and six years of Socialism, our first instinct in 1951 was to set ourselves free - free from the restrictions and controls inevitable to a siege economy and inseparable from Socialism. We have only to look round the country to see the beneficial results of that broad policy. But freedom must not be made the excuse for licence. It must not mean waste, inefficiency or unwillingness to develop any of our resources to the maximum in an orderly and constructive way.Yesterday you heard the Chancellor of the Exchequer and gave him every assurance of support in his testing and supremely important office. He emphasised the pressing need to increase our exports. Since we launched the special export drive last year and since the Government introduced the new means of assisting exports, we have made substantial progress. In the last ten years exports have gone up by 20 per cent (a fifth) in real terms - far more of course in money terms, as we well know. But we have got to do better still. For the great help we used to get from our invisible exports, £300 million or more, and which we had up to a year or eighteen months ago, has suddenly dwindled. This may be for temporary reasons lower prices of oil and lower shipping rates \u2013 but I do not think this amount can be rapidly rebuilt. Therefore, we have all the more need to increase our visible exports - that is, of actual products. When you add to this our need to invest and give aid overseas, you will see how vital today is the export drive. And from this new angle, I am sure it is right that we should now make further efforts to develop, by a combination of Government, management and Trade Unions, a purposeful attempt to see our industrial future as a whole, though leaving it to each industry to make its individual assessment of its own future, to find where the weaknesses are, and to remove all those obstacles which from whatever cause may stand in the way of efficient production. We all know in our hearts that if every industry in this country were anywhere near the level of the best, our problem would be solved. There is also need for co-operative effort to make sure that each industry knows what the other is doing and makes the right preparations for joint development.Of course, if we were to hand ourselves over to a completely controlled economic system, like the communist one, some of the difficulties of those at the top would doubtless be much reduced. Anyway, their mistakes would be concealed. But it is not so pleasant for those who aren\u2019t so near the top. A completely planned socialist economy means the Government taking into their hands full power over human lives and human destinies.But while it is and has always been opposed to State domination, the Tory Party has never stood for the sacrifice of human values to the doctrines of a completely free economy. Between Socialism and the old laissez-faire Liberalism there is indeed a Middle Way. That is our way. It is in this spirit that the Chancellor of the Exchequer has formulated his proposals for planning in a free society, purposeful but free.I must add just this warning. In any economic society, planned or unplanned, profits, salaries and wages must march in step with increased production. It is because we have gone rather too fast and this has affected the level of costs and therefore the balance of payments that the Government have had to propose the wages pause. As the Chancellor of the Exchequer has explained to you, it is intended to be temporary. Its purpose is to fill the gap until productivity as a whole justifies further increases. It is obvious that without an increase in national productivity, mere increases in money rewards cannot add to income in real terms. In addition, they threaten the stability of the whole economy. With the close co-operation of all concerned I believe we can find the right answer. The Government have thought it right to give a lead, even at the cost of some highly distasteful decisions in the sector under their control. We believe that the country as a whole sees the reason for our action, and I am hopeful that the proposed National Economic Development Council will help to improve competitiveness of the whole economy.I reminded you in my first words that it was ten years since the task of government was entrusted to the Conservative Party. What I have tried to do today is not to look back over the past but to look a little into the future. What are the tasks we must seek to tackle in the next ten years? For I have no doubt at all that if you all play your part, the responsibility for those years will lie with our Party. I cannot promise to be at the helm all that time. For, like one of Shakespeare\u2019s characters I do not intend \u2018To live after my flame lacks oil. To be the snuff of younger spirits.\u2019 Obviously in our ranks there is no lack of younger spirits.\u2019Our first task is to maintain the safety of our country and to do our duty in the world, to play our full part in the collective defence of freedom. That must take precedence over every other consideration. It will involve effort. It will involve patience and some sacrifice. But it is well within our power. Having made that clear at the outset, let me turn to our affairs at home - social progress.First, slum clearance. I put that first of all our social problems. We must remove these blots that are a threat to health and the decencies of life. We have not been idle. Indeed, we are the only party that has made not without difficulty a sustained attack upon the problem. If we can maintain the same rate of progress as we have had in the last three years, we shall have broken the back of the problem outside the larger cities. We shall then be free to concentrate on these.Second, the old. I take an increasing interest in this. Their numbers are growing. They are living longer and more active lives. Pensions, of course, are a basic need. We Conservatives have always been cautious about the promises we make to the pensioner. Of course, in this field we are always outbid by our opponents. But the four increases we have made give pensions a higher purchasing power than they have ever had and our new graduated scheme will prove a notable forward step by relating pensions to earnings. So we need not fear any comparison between our deeds and our opponent\u2019s words. As for the future, I will repeat what I said at the election, and have since carried out. We intend in the coming years, as in the past, to see that the old share in rising national prosperity. Then there are the housing needs of the old. Special housing for them was only just beginning ten years ago. But now it is an accepted feature in local authority programmes. It in fact accounts for more than a quarter of the total of their house building. Help in the home, health services, and so on: we have made great progress here, but more needs to be done. There is also the need to prepare for the more worthwhile use of retirement, whether in occupation or in leisure. But, in addition to the help that the State or the local authority can give, we must not neglect the part that neighbourliness and voluntary effort have to play. It is good to see some of our younger Conservatives heading a concerted attack on that worst feature of old age - loneliness.Third, the young. If we are to keep abreast in the modern world we must devote ourselves to vast educational expansion. When we came in ten years ago, the university population was 83,000. By the end of this decade, we hope - if all goes well - it will be 170,000. You have only to look around the country to see what has been and is being done in the building of new primary and secondary schools. And there is a lot of improvement going on in all the schools that you cannot see from the outside. We must complete the programme and get rid of the oversize classes. At the same time we shall continue to expand our technical education and develop the youth service. We shall aim to widen education and training opportunities in industry. In a single phrase, the next ten years in education must set the seal on the work of the last ten years.Fourth, the nation\u2019s health. Here again the Government have already told the hospital authorities to make their plans for ten years head. This is a massive undertaking. To see the job through may well cost £500,000,000.Fifth, our standard of living In the last ten years, wages have gone up by one third in real value, not just nominal, and if we can keep the general rate of increase the same - level with, and not ahead of our productivity - we should be able to see the average wage packet rising from the present figure of £15 a week to something like £20. That means the average industrial wage earner should be a £l,000-a-year man at current prices. That would have seemed an impossible dream not only in my youth, but even only a few years ago.Of course there will be the impact - there is already - of a high standard of living on various sectors of the economy. And we must also devote new thought to the social consequences of this more widely distributed wealth. Will the structure of the social services, which after all was designed against a vastly different background, be altogether suitable to the new conditions? How can it be remodelled or adjusted to ensure that public resources are concentrated on those to whom they do most good, and that the benefits are not dissipated by being dispersed too widely? How best can we adapt our present policies to take account of a growing ability - and, I think, a growing desire of the individual to make more provision for himself and his family?I am confident that, given the will, we can make great forward strides in the next ten years. Of course, it is no easy road that lies ahead. To ensure success we shall need to draw to the full on those traditional qualities of work and thrift, which have stood us in such good stead in the past. Work to produce wealth; thrift to ensure that we put by more of today\u2019s wealth to meet tomorrow\u2019s needs. Science today is, as you know, my Lord Chairman, placing exciting new devices at the disposal of industry and commerce. All of them are costly. That calls for investment on a massive scale. We dare not neglect that investment; but unless it comes from genuine saving, it will inevitably be met by inflation, with all its injustices and dangers. If the Government are to preach thrift, they must also try to practise it. We intend to see that Government expenditure, both current and prospective, is kept in line with our national resources. For this purpose, the Chancellor of the Exchequer asked for the help of a second Cabinet Minister of authority and experience at the Treasury. I am indeed grateful to Mr. Brooke for so readily accepting this task. The Government have, of course, a great part to play in all this; but success or failure will rest in the end with the nation.We need better organisation of industry, a more conscious application of resources to needs, better industrial relations with all concerned facing the realities of our situation. For what, after all, would be the use of arguing about a tea break if we could not afford to import the tea? We have got to get rid of restrictive practices, both by management and labour. If all that we have to do both at home and overseas is to be accomplished, we must be imaginative, but practical - eyes on the horizon but both feet on the ground. It is fashionable, I know, today to throw doubts on the value of material progress. But it was a Great Tory statesman, Disraeli, who made the improvement of the condition of the people one of his cardinal aims. But it does not and cannot stand alone. Prosperity, however widespread, will not solve our problems.In this Conference, you have been deeply stirred by the prevalence of crime, and especially violent crime, despite all our social advances. In the course of a notable debate, the Home Secretary set out the policy which he has been following in recent years with the full support of the whole Government. On Thursday last at this Conference you gave him an overwhelming vote of confidence. I know that this will cheer him greatly in his difficult and unenviable task, and fortify him in carrying forward his plans, for he needs the help of every one of us. But no Home Secretary, no police, no laws, no prisons or reform institutions, can solve this problem alone. What we need is a rekindling at all levels of our society of the old faith that makes a clear distinction between right and wrong. If I may be allowed to say so, we need humility as well as faith. So much for home.What of the next ten years work overseas? I have spoken of the Commonwealth, with all its difficulties and opportunities as the self-governing communities multiply. The next ten years will be the test of the new Commonwealth. Helping the new Commonwealth should be as inspiring as founding and governing the old Empire. I have spoken of Europe and of our hope that Britain may become more closely associated with Europe, economically and politically. We must think of Europe and the Commonwealth, not as rivals but as joint pilgrims on the road to peace and freedom.I have spoken too of the world outside. Here, as the Foreign Secretary rightly told us, we must be calm and steady, but firmness does not mean obstinacy. We must not oscillate wildly from one extreme to the other - unilateralists one year, multilateralists the next; sometimes isolationists, sometimes internationalists, and sometimes a bit of both. We must pursue, as we are doing, a steady and consistent policy. We must not miss the opportunity for relaxations of pressure, so long as we never forget that the fundamental struggle will be long and testing. We could lose very quickly by a false step; but to win will mean a long drawn out effort waiting for the time when Communism itself falls a victim to the spiritual forces which it despises.To sum up - here at home, we seek a balanced society, in which our prosperity as individuals is reflected in the standard of the things we do together, and in which public effort is conjoined with private purpose in a common endeavour to increase our wealth and to use it well. In our Colonial territories we seek to place new nations on the true course. In Europe and the Commonwealth, we seek to add a new relationship to old ties and to find a greater common strength in the face of the greatest common challenge. In all the world, we seek to help poorer nations, to preserve freedom and to promote peace. These are exciting opportunities for us all in the next ten years; tasks which will put to worthy use the vitality of a great people. We in the Conservative Party are ready.

aVThis is the fifth time I have had the privilege, as Leader of the Party, to address the full Conference at the end of their work. I am bound to tell you that I always find this, although an agreeable occasion, a difficult task; for in the course of your debates all the great subjects of the day have been fully discussed, both from the floor and from the platform.I have had full reports of your discussions and followed them day by day, almost hour by hour.You have debated the future of Britain, Europe and the Commonwealth, in their broadest aspects. One outstanding theme in your debates has been what role Britain can and should play in the changing conditions of the modern world. What opportunities and what difficulties lie before us. A second major theme, whether you have been discussing financial, economic, industrial or social questions, has been how do we face the problems of change and innovation in a rapidly changing society? These two subjects are closely related, for on how we live our lives at home depends on how we stand in the world outside.Momentous decisions such as these inevitably arouse doubts and misgivings, and differences of opinion inside as well as between political parties. The historic debate you had on Thursday naturally reflected something of this. Of course when a party is in Opposition, it can allow itself to be lured by the pursuit of power without any inhibiting sense of responsibility. To this end the leaders can - if they wish - sit on the fence without fear, if not without reproach. Perhaps you saw in the news the other evening that a Monsieur Henri Tochatain in central France gave up after standing and sitting on a tightrope for 174 hours, just over a week. Poor deluded man. He thought he had set up a world record. The alternative to sitting on a fence seems to be to hop from perch to perch, waiting to see how things develop and where, and how the maximum of party advantage can be extracted. A party in office cannot afford such luxuries. It must face the facts of the world and shape its policies to meet them. You have made it clear this week that that is what you expect us to do, and that is what we are doing.The European Economic Community is one of the facts of the modern world. It is there, and its very existence must cause profound changes, and that is just as true whether we go in or whether we stay out.We in the Cabinet have given long and anxious thought to every aspect of this problem. It has been our duty to weigh up the balance between all the dangers and all the opportunities of alternative courses of action. Throughout we have applied one single test - what will be in the best long-term interests of our country and of those beyond our shores with whom we have such special ties and for whose welfare we have such special responsibilities.To have gone full speed ahead and hustled into Europe without counting the cost, as the Liberals would have had us do - would have been wrong - utterly wrong. It would have been equally wrong to drag our feet and adopt the dilatory, hesitant advice of Mr. Gaitskell. He says in effect that a few more years will not matter. But, time does not stand still, Europe is not standing still. The Six are developing their arrangements both economic and political. To wait indefinitely would be to forfeit the chance of influencing events.The European Community is not a static but a growing and dynamic body. In many respects its policies and future have still to be worked out. If we wait too long it will be too late. Now is the opportunity and we must seize it.That is why we decided in July last year to open formal negotiations for our entry into the European system. We put down a formal motion asking Parliament to approve our actions. What did the Socialists do? They would not actually disapprove what we were doing. That might subject their pliant leader to pressure from one side. They would not approve, for that would make him the victim of pressure from the other side. So what did they do? They solemnly asked Parliament not to approve or disapprove, but to take note of our decision. Perhaps some of the older ones among you may remember that popular song, I think recently revived: \u2018She didn\u2019t say \u201cyes,\u201d she didn\u2019t say \u201cno,\u201d She didn\u2019t say \u201cstay,\u201d she didn\u2019t say \u201cgo.\u201d She wanted to climb but she dreaded to fall, so she bided her time and clung to the wall.\u2019Still, we got the approval of Parliament and accordingly negotiations actually began in October last year. Much progress has been made since then - progress which I reported at the recent Commonwealth Prime Ministers\u2019 Conference. The negotiations are now being resumed to deal with the many points still outstanding, and you will, I know, wish all success in this assignment to Mr. Heath and those who work with him. We intend to continue our efforts to secure satisfactory arrangements for the interests of the Commonwealth, our own agriculture and our EFTA partners. The massive vote you gave on Thursday shows that the party is solidly behind us in these efforts. When the negotiations are concluded it will be the duty of the Government to make their considered recommendations to Parliament. I cannot tell you today what will be the final outcome. All I can say is this. It is our sincere hope - which I know you overwhelmingly share - that these negotiations may be successful. In spite of carefully chosen phrases inserted here and there into his Brighton speech, I cannot help wondering whether success would be as gratifying to Mr. Gaitskell as failure. At any rate, as you know, Mr. Khrushchev is against the whole thing.Inside Western Europe a complete transformation has taken place since 1945, both politically and economically. At that time Europe, devastated by the most destructive war in history and by the breakdown of the internal regime in almost every country, appeared almost finished as a force in the world. But Western Europe has achieved a remarkable recovery. It is on its way to forming an economic and - in one form or another - a political unity which could, in terms of population, skill and resources, rival the United States or the Soviet Union. It is fifteen years since Sir Winston Churchill in two remarkable speeches, one at Zurich and the other at Fulton, with characteristic vision saw the possibilities of a new Europe arising from the ashes of the old. Thus was born the Council of Europe, from which stemmed the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation, the European Payments Union, Western European Union and many other constructive developments. Thanks to the statesmanship of Ernest Bevin, the Labour Government and most of the Labour Party overcame their reluctance to these ideas and, indeed, played a considerable part in furthering them. That has remained firm British policy ever since, with the broad assent of the British people outside the ranks of the Communists, semi-Communists and fellow travellers.But the urge for unity in Europe has not been satisfied by the establishment of these institutions. The European movement has caught the imagination of the young; it has transcended party politics and national barriers. Its impact has not been limited to economic affairs. With the development of the European idea there has come a resurgence and a new vigour in all aspects of European life, in sport, in the arts, in science and in industry. There is something here of that release of the spirit which lifted Europe out of the mediaeval twilight into the brilliance of the Renaissance and the modern world. Europe is once more on the move.We in Britain cannot stand aside from all this. Although in the latter part of the nineteenth century and the first half of this century, we have sometimes tried to ignore the Continent, we have never really been able to insulate ourselves from what happens only twenty miles away.What, after all, is the story of this island since the end of the Middle Ages and the rise of nation states? Successive British Monarchs and Governments have been concerned to preserve in changing conditions the liberty and independence of our country. This has involved using all our efforts to prevent the domination of Europe, then co-terminus with the civilised world, by a single power. This was our story in the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Sometimes war was our instrument, sometimes diplomacy. What we could never rely on was our sheer size. In point of numbers we are and always have been a relatively weak country, not to be matched with the giants of Europe in the old days or with the giants of the world now. How presumptuous it must have seemed to the great conquerors and rulers in Europe - Philip II, Louis XIV, Napoleon - yes, and even Hitler. This tiny island defying their embattled might. And in a sense they were right. Alone we should have had but little chance and that is why all through history we have sought allies and sought them well. Our great leader, who cheered us on when we had to stand alone, devoted his energies to getting us allies - bringing in the Americans, helping to revive France, encouraging the Italians when they freed themselves from the dictator\u2019s grip, welcoming the Soviet alliance when Russia was attacked. This was Sir Winston\u2019s method and well he justified it. We were perhaps never so proud as when we stood alone in 1940. But in the end it was the enemy who stood alone and that is how we won.The instrument of coalition, of alliance, is one which we have always used in war. In peace perhaps we have used it less; but anyone who looks honestly at the history of the first half of this century cannot help feeling that the prospects of peace might have been better if we had played in peacetime as large a part in the affairs of Europe as we - and our Commonwealth partners too - have in war. For this hesitation we have paid a heavy price. Is not that, perhaps the lesson learned from the battlefields we remember, and the comrades we mourn?In considering what are the interests not only of this country but of our Commonwealth partners, let us never forget that for all of us far the greatest interest is the preservation of world peace and freedom.Therefore we must welcome the determination of our neighbours in Europe to seek to bury for good their age-old conflicts. A new bond of common purpose has united our old ally, France, with our former enemy, Germany. This in itself has greatly strengthened the prospects for peace. Britain and France have long forgotten the centuries of conflict which divided us; we have stood together so often in adversity that the old rivalry has been replaced by a lasting friendship and a deep consciousness of common purpose. We have a great opportunity to renew and strengthen these bonds with France and to link them with a closer relationship with Germany.There is also our longstanding friendship with Italy - now happily restored - and with our ancient allies in the Low Countries and Scandinavia. If we can build on these foundations a united Europe, then together we can face the future with confidence and strength. Already the European Economic Community is beginning to pursue common economic policies towards the outside world, and soon it may begin to do so in foreign affairs. It will do that whether we join it or whether we do not. But it is of the greatest importance to all of us in Britain and the Commonwealth that the policies which it pursues should take full account of the wider needs of the rest of the world. In isolation from the European scene we cannot expect to have any steady influence on the formulation of policy. I believe that in the long run the isolation of Britain from the centres of European power would be damaging for us all, as well as for Europe itself. Inside the Community, British influence would be important and could be decisive.There has been a wide and perhaps natural concern with what is called the question of sovereignty and this has been reflected in your Conference. Going in must involve some pooling of national freedom of action. Nobody denies that. Of course, within the sphere covered by the Treaty of Rome, which is essentially an economic Treaty, we agree to the rules of the club. That is true of all the clubs to which we belong: to GATT on the economic side, and far more formidable and far-reaching NATO on the defence side. Remember that under the terms of the NATO Treaty, we are pledged to go to the aid of any one of fourteen other countries if they are attacked. In terms of the totality of modern war, this is indeed a tremendous pledge. It may not involve our formal sovereignty, but it does involve our physical survival.It is true that the Governments of the Six are anxious to move forward from an economic to some form of political union, and we want to play our part in devising these new arrangements. But so far there is no agreement as to the form which they should take. Mr. Gaitskell now prattles about our being reduced to the status of Texas or California. What nonsense. But in any case, if he really believes that then, he should surely be against the whole thing, root and branch, not just wondering whether we are getting sufficiently profitable terms. Certainly if I believed that I would not touch it on any terms. The approach of the six existing members of the Community is gradual and pragmatic as our own has been on constitutional developments. In any case, any agreements reached in his field must be by unanimous consent. There can be no question therefore of Britain being outvoted into some arrangement which we found incompatible with our own needs and responsibilities and traditions. That is the position today. But if we delay indefinitely, as Mr. Gaitskell seems to want us to do, we might eventually be confronted with a different and a much less formative situation. By then a European structure might have taken more definite shape and we would have had no part in shaping it.Meanwhile, the Treaty of Rome is an economic treaty with its own rules and its own system of voting unanimously on some things, by majorities on others. It has its political implications; but while close co-operation is involved there is no question of our being asked or expected to accept any system of a federal character involving the sovereignty, in the true sense of the word, of the Crown and Government and people of these islands.While the political development of Europe lies in the future, the economic consequences can already plainly be seen. What do they mean to us at home and to the Commonwealth?If we go in, we shall have wider economic opportunities. We shall be part of, and have free access to, a home market of 250 million people instead of 50 million people - five times the size. This will transform our industrial situation. It will make possible specialisation and mass production and the introduction of techniques like automation which can be developed only on the basis of a large home market.The whole trend of modern industry is towards a larger, unified market. In fact, modern technology is making these large economic units essential in the newest industries, and it is in developing these new industries that Britain\u2019s future lies. British industry will have to concentrate more and more on the complicated, sophisticated, specialised goods. Not just the things which are relatively simple to make, but the difficult things which need great precision and great skill. If we can obtain proper terms and go into Europe to seize these new opportunities, I am convinced that it will be in the best interests of the Commonwealth as well as ourselves. Both as buyers of their goods and as suppliers of the capital they need for their development, our value to the Commonwealth depends not just on sentiment or on goodwill, important as they are; it depends on the economic strength and prosperity of Britain. So much for that.But beyond that, Britain\u2019s entry into the Community would almost certainly be only the first step in a fundamental re-shaping of the framework of world trade. The possibilities of moving at last towards worldwide agreements on foodstuffs and raw materials would be greatly improved. We believe that our entry into the Community would decisively strengthen the outward-looking forces already at work in Europe. The Community, in co-operation with the United States, would then be able to carry further the processes of freeing world trade. President Kennedy\u2019s bold and sweeping proposals for further tariff negotiations have now been passed through Congress. We can therefore expect the opening of these negotiations to follow quickly after our entry into the Community. Both the United States and the Six have made it clear that they are willing to consider constructively the negotiation of worldwide agreements on trade in agricultural products. These could be of decisive importance in themselves, and at the same time, economic growth coming from reduced trade barriers should also facilitate the proposals now being canvassed, which would promote the disposal of food surpluses through aid programmes to developing and, let us not forget it, sometimes to hungry countries.All these, of course, are complicated problems. Yet even the prospect of our joining the Community has been a powerful stimulus to new ideas. The Commonwealth is not and does not expect to be an economic unit. Nor is it any longer the close-knit military and political alliance between countries of similar origins and all owing allegiance to the Crown, which we knew so well during two World Wars. The Commonwealth today is remarkable for its diversity, which is widespread. Indeed its diversity is its greatest strength. This unique and free association, embracing every creed and race, stretched over five continents and comprising a quarter of the globe\u2019s population, is at once an influence and an example of the possibilities of co-operation throughout the world. Its value to peace is incalculable, but I am persuaded that it is complementary and not alternative to the consolidation of Europe.Now for my other question: how do all these changes affect us here at home?Well, one thing is clear. In or out of Europe, we shall have to live in a world of increasing competition. We have never been afraid of that in the past, and we need not be afraid of it in the future, either in industry or in agriculture. Our farming is efficient and well placed to meet the challenge and opportunities of the enlarged European market. Of course there will have to be changes in the methods of sustaining a healthy agriculture. But, in or out of Europe, in the years ahead changes are inescapable. Broadly speaking, if we enter Europe, we shall move towards a managed market rather than a system financed largely by the Exchequer. I am confident that these new conditions can provide a firm basis for the future development of our great agricultural industry.If there is one thing more than anything else that has struck me in your debates, it is the way you all recognise that, inside or outside Europe, this country has got to be prepared for change. It is a job for us all over the next decade - for Government, employers, trade unions and the general public - it is our job to see that change is brought about not only with efficiency but with humanity as well. We are all more or less planners today. I was a planner thirty years ago when it was not quite so fashionable. The real difficulty about planning is not the concept but the execution. In a totalitarian State planning is simple but not necessarily effective. In a free democracy it certainly can only be effective if it is backed by the general assent of the people. During the last year, the Government have taken two important forward steps in planning \u2013 \u2018Nicky,\u2019 the National Incomes Commission, to ensure that rates of reward are both fair and an step with what we produce; and \u2018Neddy,\u2019 the National Economic Development Council, to help us produce more, and produce more efficiently, by keeping our plans in line with our resources and by removing obstacles to growth. We talk a great deal, and quite rightly about growth, but, of course, everything cannot grow at the same time or at the same rate. In reality, a growing economy means a changing economy, in which some industries will be expanding and others contracting in the light of changing demand both at home and abroad.Efficient industries require a network of roads and railways to serve them. That is why we are concentrating so much money and effort into our railway modernisation and road-building plans: hundreds of millions of pounds over the next few years on the railways and more than thirty times as much on new roads as when we returned to power, and this road programme is steadily growing. Our essential strength today lies in our ability to stay in the front rank of scientific and technical invention. We need not be over-modest. After all, we already have many outstanding achievements to our credit - our nuclear power stations, our new types of automatic machinery and electronic devices, pre-eminence in aero engines and many aerial components, and the lead which we are giving in revolutionary new forms of transport. We have done a lot in these years since the war; but we cannot and must not relax. We have heard a lot lately about \u2018a thousand years of history.\u2019 Let us make sure we learn the right lessons from them. Surely the lesson is that in all our great periods we have been ready to accept change - nay more, to be the leaders of change.If we are to go ahead in these fields we must make the best use of our brains and of the traditional skill of our people. That is why we are greatly expanding the opportunity for technical education. Since 1956 over £100 million worth of new building for technical education has been put in hand, and there are over 9,000 more full time teachers in this field alone than there were then. Students taking advanced courses have more than trebled in the last seven years, and the number taking courses on day releases continues to grow. Alongside this development there must be a parallel advance in training within industry in apprenticeship and the like. Many of our training schemes must be remodelled to meet the needs of today. I am glad to see that, with the help and encouragement of the Minister of Labour, there are signs of new thinking in industry about all this. No, it is not really in this field that I see our danger.Where we are in danger of falling behind is not in the discovery of new methods but sometimes in their application. This is partly due to being a nation too set in our ways, too apt to cling to old privileges, too apt to fear new methods, often too unwilling to abandon old practices that have outlived their usefulness. This is as true, if I may say so, of the professions as of the trade unions and of management. There are too many demarcation lines, social and industrial - one might almost say a sort of caste system. Whether we are in the Common Market or not, all this has got to be changed. Of course it isn\u2019t easy. It isn\u2019t a technical problem so much as a psychological problem. As a matter of fact, it is much easier to change machines than it is to change people.I said that change must be brought about with humanity. We have got to ensure that natural fears and anxieties are removed, and that people\u2019s material problems are recognised and met.It is in this spirit that we intend to introduce legislation in this coming Session providing for written contracts of service and minimum notice related to length of service. We hope this will provide a foundation for a voluntary move forward in pension, sickness and other schemes to ensure security and status among all employed. But, of course, the changing pattern of industry must necessarily entail movements of labour from one job to another. That involves the problems of re-training, re-housing, and the location of industry - steering expanding industries into areas where existing industries are contracting and workers and facilities are therefore available.Let me take one practical example - the railways. I think that the country as a whole accepts the necessity for reorganising and modernising the railways. It indeed would be remarkable if a railway network developed in the days of the stagecoach was still ideally suited to the needs of a country in which one family in three owns a motor car. But all of us equally recognise the very real difficulties which this causes men who have given their working lives to the railways.We all sincerely hope that these matters will be solved sensibly and amicably with the co-operation of all concerned. But solved and settled they must be. The first industrial revolution was on the whole efficient. It was certainly dynamic. It placed Britain in the forefront of the world for a century. Its faults lay in its inhumanity. Even today we are still faced, as you emphasised in your debates, with its physical legacy of slums and its psychological legacy of poisoned industrial and social relations. As a party and as a Government we are determined to see that our new industrial revolution, far from being marred in any of these ways, makes its own contribution to human betterment. In the last decade we have made - and no fair-minded person can deny it - immense improvements in all our social services, in pensions for the old and education for the young. In hospitals and health services. In slum clearance, housing, and home ownership. I am glad you are going on about home ownership. Today two houses in every five are owner-occupied. That was not so, if I remember rightly, some years ago. Yes, and they have done this before they knew what we were going to do about Schedule A. In the course of this Conference you have heard from active and enthusiastic Ministers about their further plans in all these fields. You have certainly not tried to keep them back. You have spurred them on, and rightly, for you know how much more there is to do. But let us never forget that the foundation for what we have done and what we are going to do rests upon our economic strength and competence as a nation. If we fail there we fail everywhere. Just as we are boldly stepping into the international future, determined to play our part to the full, so at home we recognise the same need for a modern, progressive and practical approach. We cannot cling to the methods of the past if we want to win the prizes of the future. We are indeed well based for this new leap forward. Thanks to the work of the last eleven years there has been an increase in the general standard of living, greater than in the whole of the first half of this century. Everyone knows that the life of the people is better, much of the old class division has gone. Everyone knows that there is a greater sense of opportunity in every field. Upon that foundation, then, let us build and build still better.Throughout this Conference, two great subjects have occupied your minds. First, the place of Britain in the modern world, with its new balance of power and the new groupings that have come into being. Secondly, the decision not merely to accept in our minds the need for great changes as a new industrial system develops, but positively in our hearts to welcome the opportunity which change presents. Our task is to overcome the obstacles in the way and to guide this great flood of invention through well-planned channels so that it may make the land fertile and fruitful. If, as I trust, we are able as the result of further negotiations to make the great decision to enter Europe, Britain in Europe will be economically stronger. Britain in Europe will have a double influence, both as a European country and one of worldwide interests. Britain\u2019s power and value to the other Commonwealth countries, old and new, will be greatly enhanced. And we can hope that our European associates will share with us that outward looking view by which alone the prosperity and so the peace of the world can be secured.At the same time, we must begin to build the new Britain, on the sound foundations of the progress we have made in the last decade, accepting and applying change and innovation at every point. That means not only materially in our plants and techniques; but humanly in the better training of our youth, better apprentice systems, better technological education, and accepting and applying change and innovation individually and nationally. If, at the same time, while respecting financial integrity, we can devote ever increasing resources to the education of youth and the comfort of old age, if we can thus in a new industrial revolution carry forward all that is good and remedy all that was bad - why then, on these two great issues, separate yet intertwined, we can surely move confidently to the future.This is a great moment of history. The decisions we have to take in both these fields will be dramatic and perhaps decisive. In our appeal today, as so often before, we can look not merely to the support of our own Party but to the great mass of people, especially I think, young people, who are determined that our country shall not rest upon its achievements, great as they have been. We can look to all those who are determined to read aright the lessons of the past and who are inspired by the daring as well as by the prudence of our forebears to move forward and seize the opportunities that lie ahead.So from this historic Conference and this great meeting let this message go out. We are determined as a Party, and I believe as a people, to rise to the challenge of the hour.

aVWe must all have a feeling of the deepest regret that this rally is being held in the absence of the Prime. Minister and Leader of our Party in whose honour such rallies are usually organised. All his colleagues, and I am sure everyone in this hall, must also be deeply moved by the circumstances which have caused him to indicate to the Conference through you, Lord Home, as President of the Conference, that he will be unable indefinitely to continue as Prime Minister of this country. This is a wrench of which we have only just become fully aware. And it comes as a particular blow to those of us who have worked with him so closely for seven years. These seven years under his leadership have seen a great advance in the position both of our country and our Party. He has proved himself to be a great Party leader and a great Prime Minister. We must all rejoice now at the news of the progress he is making after his severe operation, and wish him, as Lord Home has done, in those well-chosen words, a most immediate and joyful recovery.I feel sure that you will understand the responsibility that I bear. My colleagues who are sitting here with us on the platform \u2013 upon whose help I have leant so much \u2013 and I know that we can count on your support in pledging ourselves that our unsparing efforts will be devoted, regardless of any consideration whatsoever, in furthering the best interests of the country and of the Party. We have had a heavy blow, but we intend to carry on the government of the country according to the same high standard which the Prime Minister himself has maintained.Now, there is no doubt that this Conference has already confounded our critics and given us, as Blackpool has before, the impetus and determination to win. It has served as a beacon of hope to Conservatives throughout the country and it has served as a gesture of contemptuous defiance to the Opposition who, not for the first time, have been celebrating a victory before the battle has even started. Let them take it from me, and from the tone of our debates here this week, that the Conservative Party today is confident, vigorous and resilient. We are absolutely determined when the opportunity comes to knock the overweening confidence out of Socialists and Liberals alike and to come through to victory in our own time. Now, this determination comes from three causes: First, our legitimate pride in a Government which has brought nearer the goals of lasting peace and prosperity. Second, our burning enthusiasm to maintain the position of Britain in an age of change as a first-class country, politically, economically and socially. Third, our clear conviction that anything in the shape of victory for our opponents would defeat these aims and would be an unmitigated national disaster. I will now speak about these springs of electoral effort and determination.Between 1945 and 1951 we restored ourselves by service, responsibility and moral integrity. These are the principles which we must spell out again in simple words and with conviction; that is; in the time before the election, and in doing so, let me say we are helped and not hindered by the publication of the Denning Report. \u2018Lord Denning has performed an important service... With convincing evidence he has demonstrated that the scabrous rumours about Ministers are false\u2026 The whole nation will be glad that the fogs of scandal which for eight months have befouled political life at home and Britain\u2019s reputation abroad have at last been dispelled.\u2019 These, my Lord Chairman, are my sentiments; but they are not my words. I quote them, with acknowledgment and grateful thanks, from the Socialist weekly, the New Statesman.I am delighted at the way this Conference has discussed our principles. When I was Chairman of the Party it was always my ambition to have a debate on future policy and principles in the course of our Conference, and I must say how much we owe to Mr. lain Macleod for the manner in which he led this debate on Thursday morning. I think it was a thoroughly inspiring morning. At any rate, it brought back those old days of struggle when he and I and so many on this platform worked together to restore the Tory position and to restate the Tory faith. Based on these principles we can stride forward through any difficulties and problems which may lie ahead.Now, the main problem that we of the Conservative Party are up against at the present time is a vague but nevertheless powerful feeling that \u2018it\u2019s time for a change\u2019, and I thought we might have a little discussion about that before we launched into the other parts of my speech. The idea is that democracy will not work if one party is in power for a long time; and I think it would be foolish of us to shut our eyes to this. It would indeed be arrogant of us to consider that we Conservatives had some divine right to rule for ever. Yet we should analyse this sentiment a bit more deeply because it is based on a misunderstanding of the true process of democracy. What the theory of democracy does say is that the electorate should be able to make at each election a sensible choice between alternative policies. Those who believe in democracy, as we do, believe that, whatever the aberrations of individual judgement, the general collective wisdom of the community can thus get closest to the best form of government.We accept this as the reason for democracy. What nonsense it is then to accept as inevitable and right the so called swing of the pendulum. If we accept uncritically the theory of \u2018it\u2019s time for a change\u2019 \u2013 still more, if we regard government as a sort of cricket match when each side must have its innings in turn \u2013 then we may be condemned forever to an alternation between sensible and silly policies. After all, if we accept that doctrine, if the sillies can always be sure of re-election if they wait long enough, then there is no compulsion upon them to make themselves sensible.When we drove the Socialists from office they said they were going back to me classroom. Well, in the 11-plus years, if I may so phrase it, that they have been there they do not seem to have learnt much. Judging by their speeches, they have not even got as far as Lower Six Science B. Let us, then, complete their education. Let us teach them a lesson. Let us beat them once again. For a fourth Conservative victory would mean the end for all time of the immature nonsense of Socialism.Some of you may remember that I said here in Blackpool in 1954, when I was Chancellor of the Exchequer, that by wise and prudent policies we could double the standard of living in 25 years. Today I re-affirm nine years later, that promise, and prophecy, with emphasis and conviction. We are actually ahead of the schedule I laid down nine years ago. In twelve years of Conservative Government the living standards of our people have risen more than in the whole of the previous half-century. The evidence can be seen all around us: in the great rise in personal incomes, the gratifying multiplication of savings, the increased comforts of the home and the improvements that have been made in education, health and welfare. Weekly earnings have increased considerably more than personal expenditure. Many more people are saving more of what they earn. Savings have, in fact, been multiplied by seventeen times. Surely this shows that our so-called affluent society is responsible and puts thought for the future and indeed thought for others before expenditure on self. When you add to that that our expenditure overseas on developing countries has increased by three times, while at home we have increased the wealth without which we cannot help others, that gives the lie to the recurrent theme of the Socialist Conference that we think only of ourselves.I know it is the fashion now to deplore the increase in the standard of living, the increase which has been taking place with such notable acceleration in the last decade, but this is surely a strange attitude for the Labour Party. For years they have been denouncing poverty in the most vigorous terms. Now that we are winning the battle against poverty they have performed the most remarkable somersault and now spend most of their time deploring the moral dangers involved in these better conditions. The truth is that our opponents want to have it both ways. They remind me of that American political party called the \u2018Mugwumps\u2019, because they sit with their \u2018mugs\u2019 on one side of the fence and their \u2018wumps\u2019 on the other. Mr. Wilson accuses us of taking a purely materialistic point of view. What is in fact the logic of that argument? Are people to be unemployed, hungry and poor in order that they should have the moral elevation that comes from deprivation? That is not what statesmen are for, and that is not the Tory tradition. It is our job to give people opportunity in a free society and to trust them how best to use it. \u2018Trust the people\u2019 is an old and sound Tory doctrine. How can we have been wrong in carrying out Disraeli\u2019s doctrine that we must elevate the condition of the people?There is a passage in the reminiscences of the well-known actor Sir Cedric Hardwicke. He was a son of a general practitioner in the Black country, and his father, to discourage his theatrical ambitions, took him round with him to get an insight into the real life that then existed at the turn of the century. This is what he remembers: \u2018In my father\u2019s company I saw hell or perhaps the closest approximation that existed in those days. In slums and noisome alleys where the sun never seemed to shine, I saw families of twelve and fourteen souls living in a single room that was kitchen, bedroom and factory combined. Ragged children toiled alongside their gaunt parents, hammering chains together link by link. I sat by the hour in our one-horse trap, waiting for my father \u2013 in my memory it is always dusk, with rain falling \u2013 while he delivered another baby into a world of hunger and ignorance\u2019. So he wrote. Surely we must all be thankful that these days are past in Britain. Let us see to it that they never come back in any form, and let us make it part of our ambition and duty to mitigate and ultimately to remove similar sufferings in any part of the world.You have heard at this Conference speeches from Ministers on our definite progress and precise plans for the future. You would not want me to go over that in detail this afternoon, for they have covered the ground. But let me stress that all the progress we have made and the plans they have outlined depend on our keeping right at the centre of our national purpose the maintenance of an expanding, excelling and even an exciting economy. If you look at the landmarks of the Government\u2019s policy you cannot but observe how they fit into the geography of the future: tax allowances for investment, introduced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, which are the best in the world; Mr. Brown talks about seed corn, but we are already ensuring that it is stored up in plenty for the future, and it will be for us to use it and not them; what is more, a scientific research and development programme bigger than that of any free country except the United States; a revolution on the railways, geared to fast freight traffic, and the first thousand miles of motorway by the early 1970s; great new plans for the north and for Scotland, coupled with training and financial help to those moving from contracting to expanding industries; a further assurance to our farmers and farm workers that we intend to carry forward the benefits of the 1947 and 1957 Acts and to try to establish fair quantities of production for the major products, and to take measures to regulate those imports which have been dislocating and distorting the market. All my parliamentary life I have tried to serve the interests of agriculture and I know that with our present Minister and in the future the Conservative Party will never let British farming down.Both on the land and in the towns Britain is thriving, changing and going ahead, and it is high time we answered, good, loud and clear, the Wily Wilson and the Poor Old Joes who spend so much of their time cracking up other countries and running down their own. Don\u2019t they know, or don\u2019t they want to know, the successes Britain has achieved in the economic and technological fields? Mr. Wilson is always giving us league tables showing Britain at the bottom. Doesn\u2019t he know or doesn\u2019t he want to know that in the past eighteen months alone Britain has operated the world\u2019s first commercial Hovercraft service, inaugurated the world\u2019s most powerful computing system, brought into commission the world\u2019s two biggest civil nuclear power stations, and opened Europe\u2019s largest scientific lending library? These are some of the proud achievements of a first-class country determined to keep in the lead.Mr. Wilson at Scarborough proclaimed that this age of automation needs the accompaniment of Socialism. Of the importance of his speech and of the age of automation we should be in no doubt, but what a terrible amalgamation, automation and Socialism, one machine running another machine. What they say in fact \u2013 and I think this needs answering \u2013 is \u2018up with the robot automatic state and down with the individual\u2019. The Wilsonian dream turns out to be the Wellsian nightmare come true. The individual in Britain is to have ample leisure and carefully controlled environment \u2013 the exact circumstances of the battery hen.Let the country take note, as we know, that there are deep divisions of principle between ourselves and our opponents. They have told us that their proposed Ministry of Planning is intended \u2013 and I quote \u2013 for \u2018purposive physical intervention in industry\u2019. If that is not a threat \u2013 \u2018physical intervention\u2019 \u2013 I do not know what is. They try to blur their policies, but they are clearly determined to bludgeon and bypass private enterprise, whereas we feel intensely that individual enterprise and responsibility must be given full scope to balance the mechanising effect of automation. Every intelligent person has long realised that material progress in society, as well as the spiritual and intellectual benefits of greater leisure, must depend on replacing human by mechanical effort. It needs no spirit to come from the heights of Scarborough to tell us that. Increasingly this process of mechanisation must extend to the control systems which link and co-ordinate the machines themselves. This is a process which we welcome and have taken measures to encourage, but I think it self-evident that the more we become dependent on machines, however sophisticated, the more important it is that we should be governed by people who believe in the supreme value of the individual.It is for these reasons that our Conservative philosophy and practice has been to encourage industrial modernisation by means of incentives for both the industrialist and the employee, and to deal with the human problems, such as redundancy, by special schemes of compensation and re-training. Of course, as I have often said to the Party before, the Conservatives have always been ready to use the power of the state to direct and encourage new trends in our economic life, to deal with monopoly and abuse and to assure incentive, that is, encourage it. We have used the power of the State since Bolingbroke in the time of Queen Anne, long before the Socialists were ever thought of but we have always used it to foster and preserve individual freedom. Many of you may remember these lines:These things shall be: a loftier raceThan e\u2019er the world hath known shall rise, With flame of freedom in their souls,And light of knowledge in their eyes.Well, the light of knowledge was certainly refracted at Scarborough, but there was no sign of the flame of freedom, just the white heat of revolution. Freedom is what we care about. Without it, as all history shows, knowledge serves only the more firmly to enslave a society.Now I want to say a few words to you about the kind of society inspired by those thoughts that we Conservatives are developing. This kind of society must derive its motive power not from the commands of the planners but from the character of the people. We shall therefore march forward to victory and beyond with an imaginative and far-reaching Programme for People; not a programme that is concerned solely to line their pockets and satisfy their material needs but a programme that inspires their sense of service and dedication, develops their intellectual potential and raises their economic status. Such is our aim and such is our programme.A first feature of this programme is a new and exciting breakthrough on the educational front, for on the future of education not only the efficiency of our society but the fulfilment of our ideals depends. In the nineteenth century a Conservative Government completed the process of making primary education free and compulsory for all. In 1944 I played my part in opening the doors of secondary education to all. Now a fresh challenge and opportunity await us. Already seven new universities are being created and plans are in hand to increase substantially the capacity of existing universities, colleges of advanced technology and teacher training colleges. These programmes will be developed in the light of the Robbins Committee Report which will shortly be published. Our aim is higher education for every boy and girl in the land who can benefit from it.We believe that these policies can succeed only if parents and children are assured that the extra talent and skill that they gain from education or training will bring them extra reward. In a Socialist society they could never have that assurance. Under Socialism the fruits of individual effort; enterprise and sacrifice would be plucked and harvested not by the people but by the tax gatherers. Under Socialism the room at the top would be reserved for the gentlemen in Whitehall who is always supposed to know best. In a Conservative society, by contrast, we mean to see that incentives are maintained and improved, that initiative and skill are rewarded, that there are a variety of ladders to the top and that positions of responsibility are not reserved for one coterie or class or brand of education. I have lived all my public life in the hope that we could achieve that ideal, following upon what we did nearly twenty years ago in the Education Act.This Programme for People must also be extended in the spirit of our Conservative industrial charter to the factory and workshop floor. Our future economic opportunities will yield barren fruit unless human relations in industry develop alongside scientific and technological advance. We must give up thinking of sharply defined spheres of responsibility, let alone of conflicting interests or separate sides. In a modern industrial Britain, increasing its wealth as we wish it to do by at least 4 per cent each and every year, there can only be one side and all of us are on it. In concrete terms, this means that we must look for a marked reduction in the 4 million days lost on average each year through industrial disputes and strikes. We are intent on making a new approach to the abandonment of outdated, irrelevant and unnecessary restrictive practices, whether indulged in by management or by labour, and we are working out wider social and financial measures to re-house, re-settle and re-train workers and tide them over the period when they are changing jobs.In each of these areas of policy, then, the Government and our Party are staking out new frontiers, but, unlike the Socialists, we do not regard a progranune for people as an indiscriminate distribution of expensive presents by a profligate Santa Crossman. We believe that social benefits and social subsidies should go, first and foremost, to those who really require them, and that those who are able to stand on their own feet and make provision for themselves should be allowed and encouraged to do so.As you have heard, our housing programme will now be expanded to 350,000 new homes a year as fast as possible, and to the level of 400,000 thereafter. But within these totals we wish and we mean to put home ownership within reach of all who want to own their own houses and could do so if the cost is reasonably spread, and also to cater for many who prefer to rent a modern home from a housing society without subsidy.Our health and welfare plans will bring to every part of the country the standard of service which in the past was found only in certain large cities and towns, and will transform the patch-work of local services into a fine nation-wide system. But within the ambit of these plans great scope will be left and great emphasis will be laid on the voluntary service and human touch which matter so greatly and can make all the difference when a. person is sick or handicapped or lonely. Above all, never let us get into the frame of mind where we can believe that we have fulfilled our social responsibilities when we have finished paying our rates and taxes. We still owe our service, our compassion and our Christian duty.Our Programme for People, therefore, rests on the belief in the infinite capacity of the individual to rise and meet these challenges. It carries with it the urge to ambition, to success and also to responsibility, and it is not an incitement to envy, malice or uncharitableness. It is a creed for the young and for the young in heart and it is not a repository for the disgruntled in spirit.So much for Britain at home, the record good, the prospects excellent so long as the Socialists are not permitted to spoil them. What about Britain overseas? We live at a time of incalculable change in the world around us. Literacy and technology have, if anything, added to the problems of national and ideological rivalry. New nations are on the move, new alignments are appearing, the conflict between east and west is changing its character. The old formulae that were adopted to meet the challenges of yesterday are not enough to keep the peace today. The enormous nation of China has awakened from centuries of slumber and every few years is adding to its teeming millions a population equal to that of the United Kingdom. The United Nations now has more than a hundred members, many of them small and weak but all young and proud. We have pride in the United Nations and its agencies and we are dedicated to making our full contribution to the part it should play in world affairs. We welcome its many successes, but I must say this: it is a matter for regret when the United Nations attempts to take on responsibilities which are not properly its own and thereby reduces its standing and influence for good.We have always done our duty in the world. It is the policy of this Conservative Government that Britain should remain not on the sidelines as it would under Socialism but at the centre of international affairs. We can do this because of the strength and experience of our people and because we are partners with the rest of the free world. The greatest of these partnerships is with the Commonwealth, and let me say here that when the history of our times comes to be written there will be no more remarkable story than that of the peaceful transformation of a colonial empire into a fellowship of free and independent peoples. I know that it is fashionable on the political left to abuse the period of British colonialism, but, having been born in India when my father was a servant of the British Raj, I say that we can look back not with anger but with pride at the generations of our fellow countrymen who have laboured good-humouredly in outposts the world over to bring order where there was no order, law where there was no law, and the boon of rising standards to a quarter of the human race.I know also that there is much anxiety in our Party today lest the speed of independence may weaken valuable ties. In the first stages of self-Government in some of these new countries it may be that parliamentary systems give way to single party or dictatorial rule. There may be flirtations with dangerous powers and impediments to their own way of traditional development. Yet I am convinced that broadly speaking what the historians will view with amazement is not the difficulties or the disappointments but the astonishing success with which so vast an undertaking has been carried out. I feel this very deeply myself, for I played some part thirty-years ago in the granting of self-government to India, and more recently in the complex negotiations to bring the peoples of Central Africa to nationhood within the Commonwealth. The path has proved long and hard for all the races there, and we should not imagine that when a good agreement is reached, as reached it will be, our responsibilities will come to a full stop. For our duties to the Commonwealth are not at an end; they are at a new beginning. We are providing today three times as much aid to the Commonwealth as we did twelve years ago when I started being Chancellor of the Exchequer \u2013 that is not to my credit, it is to the credit of my successors \u2013 more than £200 million a year. But trade is even more important and the Government has welcomed the emphasis and the interest which this Conference has shown in promoting both commerce and investment in the Commonwealth.Our role in the Commonwealth is complemented by our role in the Atlantic Alliance. We have the closest possible ties with our American friends \u2013 and we intend to keep them. We are also resolved to maintain and extend our links with Europe by all methods and institutions open to us. In this we are being helped by the growing strength of E.F.T.A. as well as by the active goodwill of the great majority of the members of the European Community.How I wish the Prime Minister could have been here to tell you himself of his own untiring efforts in the long story of the complex negotiations that led up to the Test Ban Treaty. He played a magnificent role and many a time have I been with him late at night or early in the morning when, like the Foreign Secretary, I have watched and admired his patience and doggedness; and, as Lord Home said, the President of the United States has paid him a special testimony. I should like to emphasise that this Treaty was not achieved by agitators sitting down in the public highway but by statesmen sitting round the conference table. Let those who are pondering the supreme issues of political life remember that our views and influence at that conference table derived from the policy of nuclear strength which the Conservative Party alone in this country has consistently and unitedly maintained.At their Conference the Socialists avoided any discussion of these great issues. For the sake of a superficial, spurious and, no doubt, short-lived unity they avoided the subjects of foreign policy and the defence of our country. One of the few things they made clear is that they would renounce our nuclear deterrent and accept that Britain should become, as it were, a camp follower in world affairs. To that I would quote the words of the greatest living Englishman, \u2018What kind of people do they think we are?\u2019 Now, our own nuclear deterrent has strengthened not only the defence but also the diplomacy of our country. And I would like to add this, that until such time as a comprehensive agreement on disarmament can be reached \u2013 and we shall never give up working for such an agreement \u2013 the Government does not intend to disarm Britain unilaterally. British nuclear strength is too powerful an influence for peace frivolously to be thrown away. Now, the signing of the Test Ban Treaty was, of course, only a beginning. The next step is to extend it and build upon it; and this we are trying to do. There is rising hope of success, and here, Sir, I must pay a tribute to you as our Foreign Secretary for the efforts you have made. (Applause).THE CHAIRMAN: Order.MR. BUTLER: I am sorry your duties as Chairman conflict with the emotions we all feel about you, not only as our Foreign Secretary, but as our friend. The Government, I say with all authority, will not miss the opportunity given us by the Test Ban Treaty. We must not rush forward in a moment of thoughtless euphoria. But neither should we dawdle in a fog of defeatism and cynicism. We must urge our allies in Europe and outside Europe to press on boldly, to keep the momentum of negotiation and discussion going. I repeat, if we stay strong \u2013 and I stress that \u2013 there is every hope that we shall be able to register some new advances. These may be brought about in private negotiation, as was the case with the Test Ban Treaty, at various levels, or by the machinery of a Summit Conference. The prize matters more than the process. And so it may come to pass that our children and grandchildren will look back upon these years as the point in time when the nightmare of war between civilised peoples began to fade away and the peace began to dawn.Now, my Lord Chairman, we have had an inspiring Conference and I will now endeavour, before I resume my seat, to sum up. A Programme for Peace is above all a Programme for People, for peace is what people care about most. I have said that a Socialist victory would be an unmitigated disaster. Abroad, they would weaken our voice and our strength by throwing away our independent deterrent. At home they have no contribution to make to our economic affairs which was not tried and found wanting years ago. Their intention seems to be to transform our country into what the old-fashioned Whigs used to call Little England \u2013 the modern prescription being, it appears, an American dependency a la Wilson, with a Swedish wealth tax a la Callaghan, and a Yugoslavian social system a la Crossman. We reject and repudiate these absurd aberrations of the left-wing mind. We stand, not for Little England, but for Great Britain \u2013 a Britain that is great in its tireless service to peace; a Britain that is great in economic justice and respect for the individual; above all, a Britain that is great by virtue of compassion for its fellow men wherever they may be. These have always been the deep convictions of our Party. We are, in Sir Robert Peel\u2019s words, \u2018a great national Party, deriving its strength from the popular will\u2019.Conservatives have always believed in the British people. In the last three elections the British people have shown that they believe in us. Now let us believe in ourselves. Let us tell the people we are determined to tend and care for \u2018the flame of freedom in our souls\u2019. Because we alone can keep this alight. (Applause).

aVLady Davidson, I want first to say how absolutely wonderful it is for all of us here to have you presiding over this final session of the Conference. Your typical approach and stimulating introduction have reflected the high spirits of this Conference which are obvious to us all. We thank you for the start you have given to us for our final session. We would like to say \u2018Thank You\u2019 for the splendid record of service which you and your husband have given so unstintingly to our Party. It is nearly half a century of service. I have to confess to you, Lady Davidson, that my early recollections of your entry into politics are slightly hazy. All I can say is that they are very much clearer than those of the present Chairman of the Party, who was not even born at that time!It is a great pleasure to have Lord Davidson with us today, because he is part of our Party\u2019s history. Ill though he is, we are glad that he has been able to come and give us that sense of continuity of our Party in all its activities during these past decades. So together we express to you our intense gratitude. Thank you for the welcome you have just given to me. We miss you from the House of Commons, because you were always our guide and friend. There was no need for us to adopt the present method of the Labour Party and have a lady in the Whips\u2019 Office; there you always were, to look after us. I hope it will not be misunderstood if I say that to all of us - and especially my generation - you were indeed our mother.Many happy things have happened to me this week, for which I want to thank you all. There have been many kindnesses, which I have greatly appreciated, and other things as well. I found in my Daily Mirror yesterday - I read it avidly, as no doubt you always do - that the barbers of West Bromwich had banded together and come to the conclusion that, seen from the back, my haircut was the best in the country. I can only apologise to you all that this splendid panorama has been reserved for the members of the National Executive Committee.We have got to know each other well, and this is all-important in our political life. To come and be here at the Conference throughout has been of immense help to me, and perhaps, Madam President, Sir Max and Sir Clyde, who have done so much to make this Conference a success, I may express the hope that the invitation to the leader to be present may become part of the permanent pattern of our Party Conference. I think it will mean a new relationship between the Party as a whole and the Party at this Conference, lacking, I hope, nothing of the past but also being in tune with the times today. It has been a good Conference. Just think of all those fellows in Transport House with their eyes glued to the television screen, just to see that everybody was being fair to us and fair to them.It has been a good Conference, and at Bexley, my own constituency, a fortnight ago - I had to get a plug in somewhere - I asked that this Conference should face facts realistically, frankly and courageously. Madam President, that is what we have done. We have done it to an even greater degree than I ever dared to hope.Just look back over those splendid speeches from the hall: frank, honest, sometimes critical. Gone are the days of praise and platitudes - well, almost gone! A little praise is very agreeable sometimes, and the speeches from the platform show that I am right to be proud of the splendid team we have heard during the whole of this Conference. They are men of great experience: Mr. Maudling, the Deputy Leader of our Party, always at my right hand and by my side; Sir Alec Douglas-Home, a man of great experience with a wealth of negotiating experience; Iain Macleod; Enoch Powell; Peter Thorneycroft; Sir Keith Joseph; Tony Barber; and the other members of the Front Bench who have spoken; and Sir Edward Boyle, who not only spoke here during the Conference but addressed a great gathering of 2,000 people at CPC. It was a great intellectual gathering which had come to listen to what, I am told, was a very detailed, sustained argument about forecasting, or indicative planning, as it is technically known. This interested me greatly. I somehow feel that indicative planning is not really endemic in the British character. The forecast for the night of the CPC meeting - broadcast far and wide in every hotel - was heavy rain. Yet 2,000 people came to this hall without a single umbrella between them. It only shows that weather forecasts themselves are not enough. Somebody has got to do something about it. Then there were the younger members of the Front Bench: Margaret Thatcher, Peter Walker, David Price. They also made admirable speeches.Did I really hear it said at Blackpool that Mr. Wilson, looking at the Government, said that man for man they could more than match us, more than match this team? Look again, Mr. Wilson, look again.He had better look at some of the others as well. I will not mention their names; it would not mean anything to you. I will mention their Departments. What about the Minister of Transport in the present Labour Government? He has done absolutely nothing to alleviate our traffic problems, but he is the only Minister who produces jam today as well as promising jam tomorrow.Then there is the President of the Board of Trade. Poor Mr. Jay - reduced to carrying George Brown\u2019s bags to international conferences. When there is good news, that is; when there is bad news he has to open the bag and read it himself.And Mr. Willey, the Minister landed without any natural resources. And the Postmaster General, Wedgwood Benn, that would-be whiz kid who always gets the wrong number - even when adding up his election expenses.But there is one matter which is beyond a joke, and that is the Minister of Technology. In Londonderry a fortnight ago I challenged him to stand up and be counted, separate from the block vote, straightaway. I said, \u2018Resign as General Secretary of your Union or resign as Minister because you cannot do both with honour.\u2019 But he has not stood up to be counted. So I ask Mr. Wilson when he is going to restore the collective responsibility of his own Cabinet. Unless he does so, and until he does so, the whole country knows that despite the fine words, he is too weak himself even to deal with Mr. Cousins.Now to return to our own Conference. On Wednesday I called for a change of mood, that we should put the emphasis on individual effort and enterprise, on the importance of choice for us all, on the need for freedom and independence to stand on our own feet. The outstanding thing about this Conference in Brighton this week has been that the mood is already changing. It is clear here in this Conference. It is a mood, too, of realism. Let me affirm that to the eyes of the world which are upon us.Our task is to change the mood of the country as a whole. We know our line of advance. Let us see that other people do. Let us heed the wise, stimulating words of our young Chairman, who has just been speaking to you. We have presented and discussed our policies. We know them. Let us see that everyone else does. Let that be our resolve as we leave this Conference.Realism, I said. We are realistic. What a contrast with Blackpool. Did you notice that George Brown in one of his happier moods said, \u2018This has been a great year for Britain.\u2019 A great year for Britain? Do we really read it aright? Where has he been living all this time? Has it been a great year for industry? The longest period of 7 per cent bank rate since 1921. The toughest credit squeeze since the twenties. Investment and modernisation programmes curtailed. Costs rising and production static. A great year for agriculture? The farmers, whom I am getting to know better and better, thought the weather was the biggest hazard they had ever had until they met this Government. Was it a great year for education, with the building programmes: universities, the technical colleges, colleges of education - the CATS - all severely cut? A great year for motorists, with the road programme slowed down? For the taxpayers, with taxes going up more than at any time since the last Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer? For the householders, with rates higher than ever before? For the \u2018young marrieds\u2019 with many home loan schemes closed down and with mortgage rates higher than for twenty years? Was it a great year for all of them?Oh yes, I remember well that Mr. Wilson came to London and made a great speech, and said: \u2018We shall provide specially favourable interest rates\u2019 for those who are going to buy their own homes. He referred to a 4 per cent rate. Nothing specific - nothing in small print even, but just the implication - 4 per cent. This was enough to bring George Brown rushing down from the North to my own constituency, and what did he say? He implied that what he had in mind was 3 per cent. At any moment I expected to be overwhelmed by Jim Callaghan coming down and saying \u20182 per cent.\u2019We have the highest mortgage rates since 1945, and prices rising faster than for years - and what did George Brown say here? \u2018We will tackle the problem of rising prices at the roots.\u2019 Well - he did; he manured the roots.Was it a good year for sterling - under threat for eleven months and supported by £1,100 million of additional debt? They sat there waiting for something to turn up, and in August, when another £1,000 million standby turned up, they preened themselves on having found the solution to our problems. A great year, indeed!Yes, it has been a great year for the public relations men, stimulated by keen competition from the Prime Minister. It is the only competition in which he is really interested. He has his army of \u2018admen\u2019 in the basement - they must be getting pretty close to the bottom of the barrel now, looking for the glowing terms with which Mr. Wilson can pat himself on the back \u2013 \u2018a dynamic Government,\u2019 \u2018a purposive Government,\u2019 \u2018an honest Government,\u2019 \u2018a frank Government,\u2019 \u2018a Government imbued with the Dunkirk spirit,\u2019 and \u2018a Government with guts.\u2019 What self-adulation - and the latest word is \u2018gritty.\u2019 It goes back to David Lloyd George - sand in the works.What is their defence for all these broken promises, for the blunders, for the incompetence and for the very high debts? The so-called £800 million deficit. Let us deal with this once and for all. It is time the people of this country recognised the truth, and it is very relevant to the judgment of last year, 1964, and it is very relevant to those of you who from the hall in our debates on policy and economic affairs asked us questions about the management of the economy next time.Mr Wilson\u2019s favourite trick is bitterly to attack those whom he accuses of selling sterling short. I will tell you the name of the man who in the past year has done far more than any other to sell sterling short: that is Harold Wilson himself. He did it by his politically-motivated exaggeration of the £800 million so-called deficit. We have suffered enough from this lie, and we must suffer no more. Let us look at it.Of the £750 million overall deficit, £350 million was British investment overseas - solid assets like the Shell share in the Italian petrochemical industry. Those are assets of which Mr. Wilson is proud to boast when he travels abroad. Of the remainder, another £100 million was due to aid for the developing countries - and we in the Conservative Party are not ashamed of that, and we were always pressed to do more by the Labour Opposition.But there was a gap, and I will tell you why. It was because during 1963 and 1964 the Conservative Government, under Mr. Maudling\u2019s guidance, was deliberately trying to break out of the cycle of recession and expansion which we had experienced since the war: a stable expansion, more modernisation, greater competition, intensive regional redevelopment - all these together formed a coherent policy. And, as part of this expansion, we forecast a high level of imports in 1964. They were needed for our expansion, but they were higher because of stockpiling from fear of the restrictions which a new Labour Government might impose on our manufacturers. And by our policies we were encouraging exports to rise to catch up with our imports.And, of course, the myth about this has been exploded by the Labour Government themselves. It has been exploded in their own National Plan - page 69, chapter 7, subsection 4. Go and read it, Mr. Brown, go and read it, and you will find there a fairer balance set out of the situation. It acknowledges and accepts all these facts, and demolishes the myth of the White Paper of 26th October of last year.Let me remind you that Mr. Wilson himself supported this policy. Indeed, Labour, pressed us to expand faster. And on this policy of a steady expansion depended many of our hopes for the future, But what have the Government always done? They have always accused Mr. Maudling and our Government of refusing to take necessary action last year because of electoral considerations, refusing to take advice to deal with the economy. In fact, Mr. Maudling put up Bank Rate in January. He put another £100 million on the Budget in April. There is not one word of truth in the accusation that advice from any quarter to act was refused or rejected, and certainly never for electoral considerations.But Mr. Wilson put political interest before the national interest. He broke the confidence on which our expansion depended. What mock horror he shows now at the state of affairs he says he found when he took office. What he forgets is that five weeks before the Election he accurately predicted the trade position. What he forgets is that two weeks after the Election he himself officially stated there was no need for measures of restriction. At the same time, he knew that the deficit this year was going to be halved - he was told so, and he said so in his own White Paper. Plus is no new discovery as a result of the Government\u2019s policies of the past year. There were seven weeks when they knew the position, seven weeks when they said it was manageable. The crisis only came after their exaggeration and their muddle. The mess was created by Messrs. Wilson, Brown and Callaghan - messers indeed.This Conference will be remembered for our policy document, Putting Britain Right Ahead. What we have done here is to work together on our action plans for the next Conservative Government. These plans you can put to the people. There are five of them which I wish to put before you to sum up our discussions.First, our action plans to give all those who have already retired individual care and attention.Second, our plans to give all those who retire in the future the real security for themselves and their families of a pension which can really be called their own.Third, our plans for helping the young marrieds to find a home of their own, and a home at a reasonable price.Fourth, our plans to ensure that the earner enjoys the prosperity that he himself, and only he himself, will be creating.Fifth, our plans for giving the customer, whether the motorist or the commuter, the hospital patient or the housewife, better service and, above all, steadier prices.All of these plans derive their strength from the two great driving forces of modern Conservatism. First, our belief in the virtue of a property-owning democracy, which Iain Macleod elaborated in his speech here. What does it mean? For us, it means three things: a home owning democracy, a share-owning democracy, and a pension-owning democracy. The other force, which has been emphasised time and again at this Conference, is our belief in the individual, the man and the woman, the individual as taxpayer and as a member of a trade union, the individual in the school and in old age, the individual at work and at play. Here, all around us, as well as in the rest of our country, we see the immense richness of diversity of individual character and personality and, let it be said, often eccentricity, which is the great source of our strength as a nation. It is this which we must nourish.This Conference will be remembered, too, as you, Sir Max, recalled, for the debate on Rhodesia, in which passionate feelings were expressed with reason and in which the Conference reached a firm and clear decision. There were two young men yesterday who, I think this Conference will agree, showed great courage in the speeches which they made. One of them was Jonathan Aitken, son of a dear friend of many of us here, Bill Aitken, who, alas, died so recently - but with whose great uncle, I am afraid, I sometimes disagreed. His was a remarkable speech.I wish to say a few words about Rhodesia. Last Saturday I saw Mr. Smith. I did so only after the negotiations between the two Governments had broken down. My main object was to find some means of re-starting the dialogue between the two Governments, of seeing that the negotiations continued. We could not leave the British Government to sit in Whitehall and Mr. Smith to go off to Salisbury, possibly to take the drastic step of a unilateral declaration of independence. I did not believe that this could possibly be allowed to remain where it was.Later that night, we saw Mr. Wilson. As a result of the points we raised, there was a further meeting between Mr. Wilson and Mr. Smith on Monday, and I was glad of it. Later that evening, I issued a statement, after the meeting of the Shadow Cabinet, urging further negotiations. On the Tuesday, Mr. Wilson made the proposal for a Commonwealth Mission. It may seem strange to some that, if such a proposal were going to be made, it was not discussed with Mr. Smith when he was in London. But at least it means that another method of keeping negotiations open is being examined.The position the last British Government took up, which has been followed by the present Opposition, was clearly stated yesterday by Sir Alec Douglas-Home. A unilateral declaration of independence would be invalid. Its impact would have the gravest consequences. The whole Commonwealth, the old members of the Commonwealth as well as the new, have made that abundantly plain. In these two respects the present Government\u2019s policy has followed ours, but the handling of the negotiations is the Government\u2019s responsibility alone. They have not, and cannot have, a blank cheque from us on that. We are free to criticise the conduct of the negotiations, and, if I may say so, the Government themselves need to look again at the psychology of their handling of these negotiations and their relations with Rhodesia.To all our citizens in this country, in these very difficult moments, I would say how greatly I deplore the use by anyone of the emotive words, words like \u2018treason\u2019 and \u2018traitors,\u2019 which can do nothing whatever to help to bring a solution to this problem. As an Opposition we shall concentrate all our efforts on securing a solution by negotiation.This Conference made it abundantly clear yesterday that the overwhelming majority present wish to do nothing to prejudice that. This is why it overwhelmingly supported the Resolution. As your Leader, I bear an immense responsibility in this matter. With my colleagues I shall continue to discharge it, knowing that you have given us your confidence. Today, at the end of this eventful week everyone here prays that there will be no unilateral declaration of independence by Rhodesia. We pray that with all our hearts. Our views are known to the British Government, and, on behalf of us all, I should like to send this solemn message to Mr. Smith and his colleagues: \u2018We believe that a middle way must be found. If there are still thoughts of unilateral action, then turn back from the brink.\u2019In that debate yesterday, and throughout the week, many of you spoke of the consequences, for good or ill, of change. We are just twenty years since the end of the Second World War. There is no particular magic in that figure, but a whole generation has now come to manhood who knew nothing of it, and those of us who did now realise how far off it all is. To my generation, who had just reached manhood before the last war, how different the situation is. Some of us were born along this coast, looking across the Channel always towards Europe, loving our country and outward-looking. Then we used to take our chance without any money to get across to Europe and to wander round and see it. Why? Because Europe still then, and only twenty-five or thirty years ago, was the hub of power in the world as a whole; it was the centre of affairs still as it had been for centuries. Then it all changed. Now today this is a time, twenty years after that cataclysm, when men\u2019s minds are again beginning to question so many of the things they have since taken for granted; to question the things in their daily lives, in their jobs, in their families and in their country. This is happening all over the world where people are trying now to find a fresh equilibrium. Even in the year since the last election this process has moved apace. The first practical steps have been taken towards nuclear weapons in China. We have seen the polarisation of the Sino-Soviet conflict. For us in some ways the most important of all, we see the changing balance between the two sides of the Atlantic. Whether it is in trade, in industrial goods or in farm produce, whether it is in the international financial arrangements, whether it is in the defence of the west as a whole, the old arrangements are being questioned and new ones have to be worked out.How different the situation was when these arrangements were first made. Europe was weak then, and across the Atlantic they were powerful. They gave generously of their strength, and as a result Europe today is rebuilt, prosperous and flourishing in trade and finance. The more clearly the changing balance between the two sides of the Atlantic is understood, then the greater are our chances of redressing the balance without friction between friends. It is in this position today that I want Britain to be able to exert her influence.I want again to have a British policy. I do not want this in any nasty nationalistic sense; I want it in order to be able to perform our duty internationally as we do here, with the traditions of centuries and she experiences of ages, to do our duty as we see it. I want us to do our duty in the Western Alliance, in Europe, in the Commonwealth and the developing countries as a whole. Alas, today this Government has neither the power nor the will to pursue such a policy; overburdened with debt it is inhibited from pursuing effective action. Therefore, it is we who must pursue a British policy.What we have to do now is to carve out a new place for Britain in the world, carve it out without nostalgia, without bitterness and without regret, but with imagination, skill and with determination. That is what our discussions this week have been about. Change has been constantly on our lips. Change in attitudes, change in skills, change in policies, and in people. But the change most necessary is a change in Government.In this world where the constant need is to understand change, the Labour Party today, as we see them, have all the wrong attributes. Why? Because they consist of one part revolutionaries and three parts stand-patters. They are revolutionary optimists wishing to march back into the 19th century to the time of the birth of their doctrine. They are evolutionary pessimists finding every conceivable argument why day-to-day change should not take place. They are rooted in vested interest. They are avid for the status quo. It is no paradox, strange though it may seem, that in a period of rapid change like this, what the nation needs is leadership from a progressive and modern Conservative Party, for it is only we Conservatives who will get moving and seize the opportunities which exist for us as a country. It is only we Conservatives who will act, and it is only we Conservatives who will remember and care, as change goes on, for the individuals - and there are always many who find it difficult and uncomfortable. Above all, it is only the Conservatives who will have the foresight and the sense of history to keep and protect those elements which are fundamental and valuable in our society, to keep the things which make this country the place where we want to live.The moral of this is plain. We must regain power, but power has to be won. We must work to bring it back. There is no easy way. I did not disguise this when I became your leader. It must be clear to every one of us here at this Conference. Once again, it is the efforts of the individual men and women which count. Let us face this fact realistically. The Government today is still on trial by the people of this country. But we also know that the day of reckoning will soon come. It will come when the people of this country find that words are no substitute for deeds; that publicity is no substitute for policies; and that gimmicks are no substitute for government. We here, every one of us, and those whom we represent in our constituencies can bring that day nearer. We do so as we capture the hearts and the minds of our fellow citizens by our own personal influence one upon another. You, Madam Chairman, with all your long experience of politics, will know that that is in fact the only way. But great is the prize. It is to guide the destinies of Britain in this ever-changing world. It is that upon which we set our hearts here at this Conference today. It is that prize and nothing less which together we will win.

aVMr President, I must first say to you what an enormous pleasure it is for all of us at the last session of this great Conference to have you presiding over our gathering. I am giving away no secrets when I say that you have always been a Conference favourite, and you have been so because all of us have admired immensely both your capacity for carrying out the most arduous and difficult tasks in Government and the courage with which you always saw them through. All of us here want to thank you for the many years of hard work you have carried out for our Party and for everything which you are still doing for us in the House of Commons and also here - which is so important - in the North-West. We are deeply grateful to you.This has been a very heartening Conference for us all, and I, as leader of the Party, may, perhaps, take this opportunity to thank the whole of the National Union for organising the Conference here in Blackpool. Also, I thank - I do so personally, but I know you will want to join with me - all of my colleagues in the Shadow Cabinet, and some from outside, who have made such admirable, splendid, vigorous, informative, stimulating speeches at the end of each debate. I have listened now to a good many Conference speeches over the last 15 years, and I cannot recall a Conference at which so many of the winding-ups have been of such a high standard as we have had during the past week.In those words of thanks, inadequate as they are, I join my own for the work which all my colleagues are doing throughout the year in the Shadow Cabinet and in our Party in the House of Commons, as well as tramping up and down the country carrying our flag and speaking for our cause. My thanks are sincere and very grateful.Mr. President, you have summed up for us the atmosphere of this Conference. It seems to me it has been serious-minded, that it has been determined, that it has been taking the long view, and above all that we have shown ourselves to be confident. In fact, I would sum up by saying we leave Blackpool today buoyant and united. That is my report to our Party up and down the country on this Conference.However, last year on 18th October the leader of the Labour Party also gave a progress report to his Conference on the first year of Labour Government, and he went on to say, \u2018A year from today I confidently look forward to submitting to the Labour movement an even more encouraging progress report.\u2019That report, Mr. President, is due in three days\u2019 time, but as so often happens there seems to have been a leak. As the Speaker of the House of Commons would say, \u2018For the sake of greater accuracy, I have obtained a copy.\u2019It starts off with this heading: \u2018Members of the Labour Party, Comrades.\u2019 Well, you will see in present circumstances it therefore has a somewhat limited distribution. It begins: \u2018We have maintained full employment - in the Cabinet.\u2019 It goes on: \u2018George Brown announced that he was declaring himself redundant but we devised a scheme of work sharing; we spread the work, Comrades, but we all keep the top pay. Comrades, we are raising our productivity - in the Cabinet: a budget in March, a budget in May, a budget in July. It is true, Comrades, that at this last election we produced only half as many promises as in 1964, but, Comrades, we have broken them in a third of the time. Comrades, we have introduced a proper Socialist discrimination against unproductive services. We have achieved this by a large, continuing, purposive expansion of the Civil Service. Comrades, we are nationalising steel and land and the trade unions. Comrades, we have put prices up; you will hold wages down. Comrades, we have rejected the defeatist doctrine of stop-go: go has gone, gone for good.\u2019 It ends, \u2018Farewell, Comrades.\u2019Enough of that, because although this has been a grim year for our country, yet having listened to this Conference what you would really like is for me this morning to look forward rather than back. I want to take as my theme the great divide which separates the parties today in so many ways, and I want to take with it as well the theme of the greater unity for which we all ought to work in this country as a whole.We have reached this year what I first called in the House of Commons the Great Divide, and at this Conference the differences have become clearer, they have been sharpened. But this is not for the sake of creating differences. It is because these differences represent the different characteristics, the different approach of Toryism and Socialism in the modern world. The Great Divide between freedom and compulsion represents perhaps the widest, the most dramatic gulf between Conservatism and Socialism today, but that is not the only example of the Great Divide. There is the next one, over how we can rescue this country from its economic difficulties. There is the divide over the determination, the very will to tackle the nation\u2019s economic and industrial problems; the divide how to give real security to those who are in need; the divide on how to advance the hopes and aspirations of those who want better education for their children, better homes for their families, better jobs for themselves. There is now, alas, a dear divide between the parties as to how to bring to an end the Rhodesian tragedy. Even since we debated it in this hall and we heard Reggie Maudling\u2019s moving and magnificent speech, the Government has sent to Salisbury an emissary with what they describe as \u2018final terms.\u2019 Mr. President, you know this better than anybody, with all your great experience of negotiations: how could any Government really desiring a settlement be so foolish as to send a man with what they define as \u2018final terms\u2019? There remains the Great Divide that separates us from the leaders of the Labour Party, the divide over the genuine desire to go into Europe. These, then, are the issues which are raised between us today, and let no one say that these differences between the parties do not matter.This has been a serious Conference because we have been wrestling, as we often had to wrestle in Government, with solutions or the real problems of ordinary men and women, and we know and share their fears and anxieties because many of them are the fears and anxieties of us in this hail today, those who are still trying to find homes, those who are worried about their children\u2019s education, those who are worried about their Health Service and the service they are getting, those who are worried about the future when they retire, those who are worried about their country when they see it slipping in the world, when they see it in debt, when they see its influence disappearing. These are our fellow citizens and they are worried, but above all they are worried by the nagging fear of redundancy, of short time working of smaller pay packets, hire purchase commitments, and above all worried about losing their jobs.This, Mr. President, is going to be a cruel, hard winter for many people whom I met in Scotland, whom I met in Wales and whom I met in South West England and whom I met here in Blackpool and the many like them in the seaside resorts of this country - a cruel hard winter because of the Selective Employment Tax. We always said that if we were going to recover our prosperity and our stability, then some deflation was necessary and change to new industries would involve short-term unemployment. We said it boldly and courageously at the last Election. We still stand by it. \u2018Change\u2019 has suddenly become a very fashionable word. Over ten years ago Angus Maude and others of the group to which I once belonged in One Nation, wrote a book called Change is our Ally. Enoch, who spoke yesterday afternoon, was one of the main contributors. Change is our Ally we said, but for Mr. Wilson, who now produces the word \u2018change\u2019 on every possible occasion, change is not an ally but an alibi. An alibi for the errors and failures of the last two years.As Iain Macleod said yesterday in his brilliant speech, anyone who has been Minister of Labour, who knows these problems and has to handle these problems, hates unemployment. It is unavoidable sometimes, as I have described, but what I hate more than anything now is the unemployment which is being caused because the Government failed to act in time. More may he caused now because they have to take action which is much harder and harsher than it would have been before.This is the thesis I want to put to you. This is the argument which I want to put before this serious Conference. The whole basis of the Labour Party\u2019s policies and doctrines and their actions in the last two Election campaigns were that they had the answer to the problem of how to increase our national wealth rapidly. They said that they could get away from Stop Go. On this depended their economic policy and their social policies. On it they won two Elections. What is now absolutely clear is that with even the most optimistic forecast for the next three years, what the Labour Government achieves, if it survives for five years, will certainly be less than what we achieved in our last five years of Conservative Government. These facts are beyond dispute and at once they destroy the myth that the Labour Party could do better than we have done, that there was some quick, easy shortcut to prosperity without anybody having to trouble himself. Well, they cannot do better than we have done. They have failed. There are some people who draw the conclusion that what we have seen is the failure of the free enterprise system. There are many in important positions and many who comment on our affairs who either consciously or unconsciously have come to that conclusion and are writing it and saying so. They, therefore, say that the Government\u2019s move to controls and compulsion is inevitable. Then they go on to say: therefore, it is justifiable.Mr. President, I repudiate absolutely the conclusion that this is the failure of the free enterprise system. I repudiate absolutely that it is inevitable and I repudiate completely that it is in any way justifiable. This has been the failure of Socialist economic policy. There was inflation through mounting Government expenditure. They thought that they could control it by voluntary means, which could not possibly succeed in those circumstances, and, of course, some of them sought it to help to win the Election. It has been their failure to manage the free enterprise system, but then how could they? They do not understand its psychology or its motivation, they do not know what makes it tick and, above all, they do not believe in the free enterprise system. That is the real failure, and those who say that because the Labour Government has not been able to manage a free enterprise economy, then abolish the free enterprise system, how foolish they are. Surely the answer is not to abolish the free enterprise system, but to do away with a Labour Government?The nation as a whole, many of our fellow citizens feeling bewildered, is desperately seeking a way out of its present difficulties. Some of our fellow citizens are still looking for a simple trick such as Mr. Wilson offered them in 1964. Mr. President, I must say again that there is no easy way out. There is no simple solution. There is no short cut to a solution of our nation\u2019s problems. Therefore, and I say this to the country as a whole, it having been shown conclusively that the other major Party in the state has no simple easy solution, let us all, as one people, in national unity at least agree about this, namely, that there is no short cut. The answer will only be found by a combination of measures based on the energy, the hard work, the skill and the enterprise of every single man and woman in this country.So contrast our approach. Our approach is to say, \u2018How can we enable the free enterprise system to work better?\u2019 \u2018How can we enable it to be more fruitful?\u2019 \u2018How can we enable it to achieve those things which we all want to see?\u2019 The Conservative Party is the Party of free enterprise and let us be proud of it. We accept the obligations which this places upon us, an obligation to understand the nature of modern capitalism and what is required of it. Of course, the changes in technology, about which Ernest Marples talked with such wit and humour, the growing size of our factories and our plants, the cost of these great projects - all of this has changed capitalism today compared with what it was even ten years ago. Therefore, there will be changes in the structure of our industries and firms, differences in size, in manning, in the number of men and women required, in their skills, their education and their training in new techniques as larger markets will mean short-term problems of transition. It is, I believe, the job of the Government to help industry to overcome these problems and to help modern capitalism to work. I sum it up in this way: our task is to remove the obstructions which exist, wherever they may be, to enterprise and competition in our business world. That, then, is our approach - enable it to work better by tackling the fundamental obstructions and obstacles.However, today everything is frozen - not just wages, production, productivity, investment, even redeployment. In fact, almost all progress is frozen; and the Government turn to us and ask what should they do. They have no answers themselves. I shall briefly tell them some of the things which they ought to do.I have said that they have almost entirely frozen the redeployment which they say is the purpose of the whole of their measures. Very well; men who want to move cannot change houses because they cannot deal with the mortgage for buying the new house because no one can come into their house because they cannot get a mortgage. This is the practical problem of dealing with policies of this kind; they have made no preparations. Very well, then, let them take special and, if necessary, discriminatory action in order to deal with this problem.There are quite insufficient training facilities in this country to enable men to be trained for fresh skills and change their jobs. Very well then, do not let the Government sit there supine; let them produce a crash training programme; use the resources which are available in our firms; make extra use of the resources available in our educational institutions. Let them make a special call on the abilities of our firms and our teachers in order to meet what is a national requirement; and let them make it speedily.And, then, genuine productivity agreements which help the men and help our country - let them exempt these from the present arrangements; they ought to have done so long ago. As soon as possible, let them get back to men and employers carrying out their legal obligations, and let them make agreements enforceable on both sides and not only on the employer\u2019s.Now, those were three proposals which I put to the Trades Union Congress when they were in conference. How foolish of people to say this was an incitement to the Trades Union Congress to defy the Government or break the law; there was no law to be broken - it was a voluntary agreement; and the Trades Union Congress is just as entitled to try to influence the Government as anyone else. And we as a Party are perfectly entitled to put forward our proposals which we believe are sensible for the industry and the trade unions of this country. Indeed, if the Government had adopted these policies, then the economy (if it had been run properly as well) would not have been facing its present troubles, and the voluntary system would not have broken down.I shall give you a programme. There are now left nine months under which the Government\u2019s first order in the wage freeze runs. I shall give you a programme for nine months to start to get our basic economic affairs right. It is based, firstly, on confidence; it is based, secondly, on competition; and it is based, thirdly, on constructive trade unions.There is one thing which would restore confidence not in nine months, but in nine seconds - for the Prime Minister to announce tonight that he is abandoning the nationalisation of steel. Instead of seeing that dreary measure dragging its way through the House of Commons, I give you a programme to replace that.Let them run the economy, as Iain Macleod said yesterday, on the basis that you have the number of vacancies only equalling the number of men available to fill them. Let us pass a Bill to do a genuine reform of company law and not the half-baked proposals which we have had so far from the Government. Let us have a Bill to stop up the holes in the Restrictive Practices Act, and create greater competition. Let us have a Bill to help the shoppers, both in the hours in which they can shop and with better information to help the housewife buy wisely and well, not turning her into a snooper for Mr. Stewart when he requires. Let us set up a new machinery to help the small firm to grow and to prosper into one of the great firms which will be the foundation of our future prosperity. Let us have a really vigorous policy of regional development, not a facade to cover up the fact that the Selective Employment Tax is damaging every region in the country, as is also their new investment allowances. Let us have the creation of more growth points in these areas where the resources are available. Above all, let us have a budget - a budget next April based not on penalties again but on incentives to every man and woman in the country.We can tell them what ought to go into it. First of all, abolish the Selective Employment Tax; that is the first thing they have got to do. Let them make the tax system comprehensible; that would be helpful. Let them restore to our businessmen the sort of encouragement in investment allowances which we gave them. But it is no use giving men greater and greater investment allowances if they cannot get the money for the investment itself. This is one fundamental problem with which they have got to deal. Then, let us undo the damage which was caused to small companies by the Corporation Tax and the Capital Gains Tax, which we fought in 1965. A budget which once again makes our company taxation reward the fittest and not the fattest.Let us give new encouragement to people to save. But, most important of all, a budget which will start the job of making it once again worthwhile for men and women to work harder and to earn more.I come to my third, and I believe most important, theme \u2013 constructive trade unions. Some people - even some members of our Party - have welcomed the fact (and even appear pleased) that what has been ore of the main problems in the last twenty years (the pressure on wages of trade unions and the inflation which followed) should have been dealt with by what I might term \u2018the Government just knocking the trade unions over the head,\u2019 dealing with it through fines and imprisonment. I take no pleasure from this; indeed, it saddens me deeply.I have already warned that this is not only a question of the trade unions. This leads on to the controlled economy and to the control of the businessman \u2013 one or two of whom may perhaps be pleased - it leads to the control of investment and controls right through the economy. That means that we shall then find the citizen sinking to subterfuge, the black market rackets, the petty crime, and everything that we know from experience which goes along with controls and regulations and the controlled economy.I therefore say to you here today that this way of dealing with the problem is not the Conservative way, and let those who may be pleased with it not call themselves \u2018Conservatives.\u2019What I do want to put forward is the choice which now faces the trade unions because this is a matter which is going to be debated up and down the land in these coming months. They can continue to go along the way they are going. If I am frank, I say that I see very little chance of going any other way with the present Labour Government, or they can choose our way. We have put it forward in Putting Britain Right Ahead. We put it forward at the last election. Our approach is this: what we need is a new framework based on law which will be suitable for trade unionism in the modern world, and within that framework the trade unions themselves shall be able to carry on all their proper activities in freedom. That is our approach.What we have seen in these last few years is that the whole balance of our economic activities has been upset. When that occurs in any form of human life, in any of our activities, there are two courses open. Of course, the natural one for the Socialists is to say, \u2018We must control it.\u2019 For us the natural answer is to say, \u2018We must right the balance and then men and women can continue in freedom.\u2019Ours is not the easy way out. In some ways it is much easier to have done what the Government has done. In fact, they were not prepared to reform trade union law. They set up a Royal Commission which is still waiting for the evidence from the TUC. Ours is not the easy way out. It demands courage. But our proposals do show a respect for the place which the trade union movement holds in our national life today. Indeed, I believe it is a compliment to the trade union movement, it is a mark of our respect for them, a recognition of the importance of their place in our national life, that we should believe in giving the highest priority to creating a new, modern framework in which they can carry on all their activities for the benefit of the country as a whole.Of course, so much of this is based on human relations, but it is also based on law; and just as Parliament never hesitates to legislate for the corporate life of the company, and to safeguard the individual rights of its shareholders, so in the same way, in my view, Parliament should never hesitate to legislate for the corporate life of the trade unions and to safeguard the individual rights of all their members.But of course this, too, would involve change, and the unions in this arrangement must be prepared to deal with the problems of the restrictions on the shop floor, the demarcation disputes, the rules restricting output, the rules restricting entry. There is room for all who can acquire new skills. We need it. We need it desperately. So I hope that we shall find the trade unions choosing the way of moving into modern times, with a modern legislative framework rather than taking the other way out of becoming more and more out of touch with modern life and finding that the Government is taking over more and more of their rightful functions.So, Mr. President, I believe that what I have said puts forward a programme, not in detail - that is not our task - but of the main lines which this Government ought to follow today.But there is one major vital matter on which finally I want to speak: Europe. We have heard the announcement. I must confess it did not disrupt our conference that Mr. Wilson is to have another Chequers weekend on Europe. I must say my heart fell at the very mention of another Chequers weekend. There on TV we shall see innumerable pictures of the long, sleek limousines pouring into Chequers, the long lines of black, sleek policemen all guarding them outside, and from it will come what unforeseeable disaster?Mr. President, the time has come when this Government must declare itself clearly and firmly on Europe. We have done so. We fought the last election on it. Sir Alec, in his speech yesterday so highly praised by everyone here and in the Press today, dealt clearly and forcibly and persuasively with the position of the European policy. Europe today is restless; Europe wants to know where the British Government stands. Our friends in the Community are restless and want to know. Our trading partners and allies, some of them in the European Free Trade Association, feel the strain of being in their present position with Great Britain. They have the strain of the surcharges. They have the strain of the vacillation of the British Government. The Government must make its position clear. The Community is moving apace to its final state. It will be in that final state by the time that any British Government will be able to negotiate with it.Certain fundamental facts follow from this which the British Government today must recognise and they are these, that they or any other member who wishes to join will have to accept the European Economic Community as it is for itself. The time has long passed, to my regret, when any member could expect to influence the Community from its outside in its basic beliefs and its basic organisation. So the British Government must recognise that there are some things on which there can be negotiations and others which have got to be accepted; and that includes the Treaty of Rome, the Common Tariff, the agricultural policy, and the institutions. We negotiated arrangements for the Commonwealth. Of course we hope that all of those special arrangements will remain. We believe that they should. There will have to be transitional arrangements negotiated for the change over of a great country like ourselves to a member of the Community. But it is no use any longer Mr. Brown and his friends asking for special privileges in the European Economic Community. It is true that the Six members gave them to themselves, but they were the founder members and, rightly or wrongly, their view now is that that period is over and the privileges are no longer to be extended.Then it is no use either members of the Government travelling Europe and travelling the world saying that the will to go into the European Community exists. It is no use them saying that unless they are prepared to take the decisions I have outlined. Only when they show that they will accept that as a basis of European membership for Britain can they say that they have the will to carry this policy through.The Labour Government must weigh up the balance on this issue. They cannot defer it any longer. In fairness to our friends in Europe wherever they may be, in the Community or in EFTA itself, and in fairness to the Commonwealth, they must make up their minds and tell the world. While the period of waiting for negotiation goes on there is an immense amount to be done to change our own internal policies, in order to be able to adapt ourselves more easily and to give us longer time and to work out the problems of the sterling area and to deal with the indebtedness of this country to the International Monetary Fund, and to discuss with those who wish in Europe the question of defence and political developments.All of these are immense and difficult problems which would face any Government, and I say so quite frankly to all of you here today and to the country as a whole. But Europe will not wait for ever, and unless a decision is taken in principle for this country, unless a solemn declaration of intent is made, then finally, when the Community reaches its full stage of development, it may be too late for any British Government to take that step. So I believe that this is a solemn time for the British Government on Europe.In that very distinguished speech of Angus Maude\u2019s he said we must show our people that these things are worthwhile, that these immense efforts for which we are calling in pursuing our policies, for which we are asking our Party members up and down the country, are worthwhile. I believe that they are. To people who are worried, as I have said, about jobs and homes and schools, the future of their children, who are worried about the country, then surely we can show them that, in order to produce that fuller life which they want, in order to see our country holding its head high again in the world, these immense efforts are worthwhile. But I have so often felt in the travels I have had to make in these last few years that perhaps we in Britain do not yet fully realise how much life today can hold for our people; how much is possible with all the modern techniques; how much can be achieved by our own efforts when we are given the opportunity. The life of so many people in the Commonwealth, in Canada or New Zealand, in Scandinavia or America; to see so many of the chores of life removed; to see the working conditions they want; to see the educational facilities for their children; to see the opportunities of recreation in every form - this is a life which in many ways is so much fuller than we have yet been able to achieve here in Britain.Surely it is this vision which we can hold out to them when we demand these vast efforts. This is not just a materialistic society. This is a society in which you have a material basis to enable you to have a richer and fuller life than any generation has ever had before.There are some who say: \u2018But how can you talk about these things during a crisis? Surely this is misleading people.\u2019 Exactly the reverse. I believe that the only way we can move the British people out of this crisis is to show them what is worthwhile; to show them how to make the effort to get out of the crisis and to achieve what we all want to do. It is what we must do as a Party - to show our people what is possible, to show them the way which we ourselves have been charting at this Conference, and to try to achieve a greater national unity upon the means of getting there - a greater national unity than we have had in the past. I believe that our Party must give the lead. In the House of Commons you can rely on my colleagues and myself; and in the country we depend, as you know so well, so much on you - every one of you - and your friends and neighbours who are working with us.So go out from this great Conference at Blackpool. There is not a moment to spare. Make sure of your objective: go to it to achieve the result we want. Go to it, with that long haul to get rid of this Government. We can do so now in good heart. We know, the country will know, that Labour Government does not work. We can show that our ideals are right, our philosophy is right, our policies are right. We can show them the great divide between the parties, that freedom is at stake. We can show them that, with far greater national unity on our principles and ideals, we have so much to offer. This year will hold a great deal for us. As you have said, Mr. President, we are set for a long haul in national affairs. But in our local affairs the opportunity will already be there.In Birmingham this year we achieved success, London and Lancashire next year! That is what we want. As we march forward on this path, then let these three - Birmingham, London and Lancashire - be the stepping stones to victory.
p220
aVThroughout our history, Mr, President, the abiding inspiration of the Conservative Party has been a deep love of our country and a wholehearted respect and affection for our fellow countrymen; the love of our country, the sea, the cliffs and the sand, of the hills and the beautiful countryside; the respect and pride in its great achievements and in those who have served it so well in the days of Empire and Commonwealth.Above all, we are mindful of our country\u2019s good name. We have a respect for our fellow countrymen, for their rights in the community, for their individual liberty, for their spirit of freedom and independence. These are shared by others in this country today who, perhaps, are not members of our Party and who do not call themselves Conservatives. These are the people whom we welcome to our ranks and we invite them to join us at this time, because never in our country\u2019s history were these two qualities, love for our country and respect for our fellow countrymen, more necessary than they are in the state of Britain today.It can give us no comfort and no pleasure that in the councils of the world Britain\u2019s influence today is so low; it can give us no satisfaction that her word counts for so little in the councils of the nations. Sir Alec yesterday, in a far-reaching and far-seeing speech, told us why this was so. It is due, he said, to the fact that the present Government has abdicated its responsibility to the people of this country. We see the trouble spots - difficulty in Gibraltar, chaos in Aden, trouble in Hong Kong, withdrawal from Malaysia and from Singapore. But these are not isolated incidents spread across the world. They all together reflect one thing. They reflect the fundamental weakness at home of the British Government, its loss of nerve and its failure of will.We recognise that we have clear and specific commitments in the Middle East and in the Far East, and we will carry them out. We do not complain about this Government because Britain today is no longer a super-power. We do not criticise the Government because it has not got the resources of the United States or of the Soviet Union. But we condemn the Government because it fails to maintain British interests abroad. Those interests can be sustained at a cost which this country can bear. No one has given greater study to the make-up of the forces today than Enoch Powell, to whom we listened with such joy at this Conference. He knows - we know - that when this country\u2019s economy is strong, as it would be under a Conservative Government, then it is not only that we would sustain British interests, but that we would then have the resources with which to do it. That is what a Conservative Government will do in overseas affairs.How sad it is at home today to see this country torn by industrial strife in a way which I cannot remember in my time, which is damaging our trade, which is harming the individual livelihood of our people and which is bruising its very spirit. We see the spread of violence and crime; we see lethargy permeating too much of our industrial life; we see cynicism and disillusionment through large sections of our people. That is the situation here at home today. But, above all, it is characterised by a declining respect for law and order in our community. That can be no wonder with a Government which shows such scant respect for constitutional processes in Parliament and in Government today. From the very first this has been so: the imposition of building licensing without any authority from Parliament; the creation of the Ombudsman without the necessary resolution of the House of Commons; the imposition of \u2018D\u2019 Notices when they were proved to be unjustifiable; the attempt to evade the courts by arrogant, high-handed action by the Secretary of State for Education in the Enfield case; the attempt to impose comprehensive education right across this country not through Parliamentary powers, but merely by the use of the financial weapon; the use of that weapon without Parliamentary authority, to achieve the dogmatic purposes of a Socialist Government. All of these are instances of where the Government itself has paid scant attention to the constitutional processes and the law of this country. Until we have a Government which is prepared to observe the law and order and constitution of our country, then we shall not restore respect for it by the people of this country themselves.Let us look for one moment at the dangers which may confront us. We have already seen that this Government, to achieve its purposes, has postponed the elections in the London boroughs. What more are they prepared to do to achieve their own ends? Delay the implementation of the Boundary Commission for this country in order to save themselves seats?Let us beware lest they attempt to tamper with the very processes of Parliament itself. The Land Commission Bill, in its original form, would have enabled a man\u2019s house, a man\u2019s property to be seized without any right of appeal - just a buff envelope dropped through the letterbox, that is all there would have been to it. We fought it bitterly in the House of Commons so ably led by Geoffrey Rippon. We fought it night and day, but we failed to alter it. It then went to the House of Lords. It was there that the right of appeal was inserted into that Bill and maintained in the House of Commons later. That is the part which the House of Lords plays in safeguarding the very liberties of the people of this country. Let us, then, beware of what this Government may have in mind to do to our Parliamentary institutions in order the better to achieve their Socialist purposes.But this situation can only be dealt with by a Government which is sure of its purpose; which is prepared to take clear and difficult decisions in the interests of the people of this country; which will take action without the weakening effects of continuous compromise; a Government which is going to dominate events and not be pushed around by them; above all, a Government which will stand up for British interests abroad and the liberty and interest of British people at home. That can only be done by a Conservative Government.Since we last met we have had immense successes in the local government elections, in which every one of you here must have taken part. Never at any time in British history has so much of the local government of this country been under the control of Conservative administrations and so little under Socialist councils. What an opportunity that is for our local councillors - many of them after years and years of tireless effort to achieve control in the local council chamber. As I have gone round the country on my tours I have seen how quickly they are seizing those opportunities, how rapidly they are putting into effect the Conservative policies on which they fought the elections, how carefully they are serving the interests of the electors.But what responsibilities rest upon them as well. They know that they will be judged by the electorate in their own local elections. But there is much more at stake than that. It is not only the local councillors who will he judged by what they do in these three years; when the election comes - when the General Election comes - then we, the Conservative Party, are going to be judged also on what our local councillors have done, what they have shown themselves to be in the years meantime.To what are our successes due? They are due to the efforts which have been made in Parliament by my colleagues in the Shadow Cabinet and on the Front Bench and by all the back benchers who support us, all of us working together as a team, fighting ceaselessly, tirelessly. If any of you ever have any doubts - just ask a member of the Government or one of their back benchers what it is like to be in the House of Commons fighting against a formidable Opposition like this. Many of them thought that they were going to a House which would be something nice from 10 to 5, and for the rest they could put up their feet by the fire at home. It has been the most formidable Opposition of modern times, and to the Party here I want to express my very sincere gratitude for the immense amount of work that my colleagues both on the Front Bench and on the back benches have put into this Opposition.But our success is also due to you, the Party workers. It is you who have worked tirelessly on the doorsteps, who have raised and are raising the funds, who are carrying on the daily job of persuading other people to change their minds and to support us in our cause. So it is to you, the Party workers and to all those whom you represent, that I wish to give the thanks of the Party in Parliament for the work you have done, and for your achievements; because they have been achievements not only in local government but in the by-elections as well. The great victory of Pollok in Scotland, and then Cambridge and West Walthamstow - these are tremendous triumphs in the first eighteen months of a Government.But, above all, these triumphs are due to one thing. This has been the most difficult period in the Party\u2019s history. After the defeat of 1906 - and in centenary year one might perhaps be forgiven for glancing back for a moment or two - the Party tore itself apart over tariff reform. In 1929, after a great defeat, the Party was then tearing itself apart over India. In 1959, the Labour Party tore itself apart over Clause IV and nationalisation. On this occasion we, the Conservative Party, despite our problems and our difficulties, have maintained our unity, and this is due above everything to the fact that you, our loyal Party workers, kept your heads. It is for that above all that we have to thank you.But let us be perfectly frank - we have also been helped by the Government. I do not wish to mention names here, but I cannot help mentioning George - we have been helped by George. And we have been helped because all of their policies have failed: those first policies of inflation which won them the 1966 Election failed, and the policies of savage deflation after failed to solve the country\u2019s problems as well. That is clear beyond a peradventure.And, of course, the confession of failure came when Mr. Wilson reshuffled his Government on August Bank Holiday Monday. When something like that happens on a Bank Holiday Monday I cannot help asking why. It must be done to hide something or other. It was an attempt to hide the failure of three years of Socialist rule - and those failures were so brilliantly exposed by Iain Macleod in his speech to the conference.It was not only a confession of failure by the Government, but a confession of no confidence by Mr. Wilson in every one of his colleagues. He appointed himself the supreme economic overlord. I must confess to you that this appointment did not give some of us quite all the encouragement which it was meant to do. We remembered that he had appointed himself supreme overlord of the Rhodesian crisis which still, alas, drags on; that he himself made the tour of the European capitals - alas, that situation still drags on; that he himself took supreme command of the Middle East crisis which has been damaging and expensive to this country; and, above all perhaps, it was he who took supreme command of the economic crisis of July 20th 1966 - those panic-stricken, ill judged measures which have led to so much of the trouble in this country today.We were not, therefore, greatly encouraged, but we were prepared to be fair and to watch events. What did we see? He announced his appointment on the Bank Holiday Monday. On the Tuesday, he sent his telephone number to the Trades Union Congress and the CBI and announced to the world that he was \u2018in touch.\u2019 On the Wednesday he rested. On Thursday he announced that all hire-purchase restrictions were to be eased and this would put £100 million into the pockets of the people, to enable expansion to begin. That was on the Thursday. On Friday he announced that all electricity charges throughout the country were to be put up, and this would take rather more than £100 million out of people\u2019s pockets and effectively continue deflation. On the Saturday and Sunday he went to Chequers, there, no doubt, to reflect that he was the first economic overlord ever to make it cheaper to buy a fridge and more expensive to run it at one and the same time.The by-elections of Cambridge and West Walthamstow showed that the people of this country have rejected the policies of the Labour Government, whether they were the policies of inflation or whether they be the policies of savage deflation. They have rejected compulsory prices and incomes. They want to reject the squeeze and the freeze. In addition, those by-elections showed a disillusionment - disillusionment with the Labour Party and the Labour Government. And who can blame them, after all the promises they were given at the two elections and all the promises which were so speedily broken?It is sometimes said that perhaps there is not much difference between the two parties. We have had the Labour Government for three years. During those three years they have put up taxation. Let us look at our last three years. We lowered taxation by £450 millions. In three years the Labour Government has raised taxation by £1,000 millions. In our last three years, the deficit on our trade was only £42 millions. In their three years, the deficit is £342 millions. In our last three years, production went up 14 per cent. In their three years, we have had stagnation.But then it is said, \u2018But the Labour Government is spending a great deal on the social services for the people of this country; for every £100 it was spending when it came into power it is now spending £145.\u2019 But what about our last three years? For every £100 we spent £143, a difference of £2. And what is it made up of? The great increase in the unemployment benefit which this country has to pay to the people who are out of work.People are leaving this country. In 1966, under this Government, more people left in the brain drain than in the last three years of the Conservative Administration put together.Let no one say that there are no differences in action, in what has happened, under three years of Labour compared with three years of Conservative administration.They say that they were always blown off course, blown off by the shipping strike, blown off by the Middle East, or blown off by some other strike. But, they tell us, they are always rounding the corner - not, if I may say so, a very nautical way of putting it. In fact, of course, they have only their own policies to blame for their own failures.Now the time has come when the people of this country are prepared to listen to the policies which we put forward. Our policies are there. They have been debated at this conference, admirably debated, with, if I may say so, replies of a very high standard from those who have answered our debates this week. These policies flow, as I have said, from the abiding inspiration of the Conservative Party, its belief in freedom, its belief in order, its belief in individual responsibility. This is the theme which we put before our country today, out of love for our country and respect for our fellow countrymen. It is because we believe in freedom that we also support private enterprise, as Mr, Maudling, our Deputy Leader, to whom we owe so much, said in his reply to the debate on the Motion this week.We are the party of private enterprise. Never let us stop saying so. We believe that it should be free, that it should be enterprising, that it should be competitive, and that the Government should support it in all those activities, not subsidise it. Support it, give its backing, enabling it to be free and enterprising and competitive.It is because we believe in freedom that we want to see the changes in taxation which have been described to you so often. We want to see people having greater freedom of choice with their own resources. We want them, therefore, to have the incentive to use their potential to the utmost.It is because we believe in freedom that we want to see trade union reform. We want to see the man at the bench able to make the most of his abilities, without being held back by restrictive practices. We want him to be able to look after his family better, without being damaged by the strike activities of a small minority of his colleagues.We want to see the agricultural system changed, because this will give freedom to the British farmer to expand, and it will at the same time give to any Chancellor of the Exchequer some more resources with which he can help to reduce taxation or improve social service benefits.We want to see the future resources in the social services used for those who have the greatest need - to give freedom of choice to others, and to give a better service to the poorer sections of the community. It is because we want the citizen to be free to use his own resources to the greatest extent that we want Government expenditure to be controlled and the interference from central Government or local government reduced. Let us leave the citizen free to make his own decisions and to accept his own responsibility.That, then, is our theme. It is the theme of freedom for our people, order and responsibility. Unless order is restored, then we cannot have our trade unionists working in freedom. This, perhaps, is the most immediate and crucial problem which faces us in this country today. The events which we are now witnessing do not arise from the fact that the trade union movement and its leaders are too strong but, as Robert Carr pointed out yesterday in his brilliant speech and analysis, it arises from the fact that they are too weak, that they do not have influence and control over their members in order to prevent many of the industrial difficulties which so often confront us.It is because we have a conception of the trade union movement in a modern industrial society which corresponds to the importance of the position it holds, because we want to see the trade union leaders able to influence their members and because we want to see them playing a full part in improving the effectiveness and the efficiency of our industries that we want to bring about the reforms which we have put before you. Let no one say that we do not have detailed policies. The details have been worked out. They have been placed before you. They are there to be discussed. We are willing and anxious to discuss these with every part and sector of industry, trade unionists or employers. However, what I say to the Government is this: you can dally no longer over this matter which is so vital to our national life. It is not enough to have set up a Royal Commission. It is not enough to have emergency powers. The Government must set about the problem of trade union reform without any further delay. Let them go to it.These policies, flowing from this central theme, form together one cohesive whole. There is no point in our trying to put one into effect on its own; they must be put into effect together.Sometimes people say to me, \u2018What would you advise the Government to do today or tomorrow? You must know.\u2019 However, there is no point in telling the Government what to do. First of all, they ignore all advice. Secondly, this assumes that we would have got into this position ourselves, and nothing can he further from the truth than that. Even more, it assumes that this Government would be able to put into effect the policies which we have put before you at this Conference. That assumes that a Labour Government can have the confidence, either in this country or abroad, which a Conservative Government would inspire.I am not going to say to you today whether this Government ought to consider the parity of the £. I do not believe it should, but I am not going to discuss it in detail. Nor am I going to say whether there ought to be import controls, surcharges or whether there ought to be a little more reflation or deflation. Those are matters which the Government of the day must decide on their own responsibility. However, in this country so many have become so obsessed with the daily problems of the management of the economy that they are entirely failing to pay attention to the fundamental reforms which have got to be brought about in our economic life if we are, once again, to have a strong, stable and prosperous economy. It is our task constantly to put before the people of this country the measures which have to be taken by a Conservative Government directly we get back into power. That is what we shall continuously do.It can only be done by all of us together, by you, our loyal, hardworking Party supporters, by us in the House of Commons, by the National Union and by the Shadow Cabinet. I know how much is involved. I know full well the chores which go with political life. Having always fought a marginal seat, I know what is demanded of our Party workers up and down the country, and how generously they give of their time, their energy and their thought. Our only desire is to serve you and to serve the people of our country.However, you must sometimes ask yourselves, \u2018What is the purpose?\u2019 We are sometimes still accused of materialism. I do not believe that to improve the conditions of life for the people of this country, which Disraeli, nearly 100 years ago, told us was one of the three main principles of the Conservative Party, is something which is to be condemned.However, there is much more to it than that. Our purpose is to give a strong, secure and material base on which our fellow countrymen can enjoy the culture, the recreation and the spiritual activity which they want and which they deserve. I always feel that when we think of our purpose like that, then it makes all those chores worthwhile. I do not believe the people of this country yet recognise what modern life can hold for every one of us. I do not believe in telling people that they should work harder. What I do believe is that they should work more effectively and that we should use all the resources at our command - our savings for capital, our plant and industry and the new techniques which Ernest Marples is exploring for us. We should use all these things to enable each of our fellow countrymen and women to have more time, more leisure, which they can use for their own interests. I believe they should have the freedom to decide for themselves how they are going to build their own lives, the lives of their family and their children.Sometimes it is thought that progress interferes with much of this. It is true that technical advance very often carries grave disadvantages, but these are accepted for the overall benefit which it brings. However, what surely is important is that we should look to our land, our countryside, the cliffs and the sea, to make sure that for all of our people there are those recreational facilities which will enable them not only to escape from their daily tasks, but to avoid many of the disadvantages of technical advance, and there find that refreshment of body and soul which is more and more essential for us as modern life becomes more and more complex.Therefore that is our purpose. I believe it is a great one, worthy of all that our Party has been able to achieve in the past and worthy of giving us that inspiration for the future.It is worthy of our great traditional inspiration, love of our country and respect for our fellow countrymen and women. This, I believe, is what they want. They want to show the traditional character of the British people.Therefore, when you ask me what I want to achieve as Leader of the Party, I would say this: I want to restore confidence to the British people, and I want the whole of the Conservative Party now to devote all of its energies to doing just that.It was Lord Randolph Churchill who said, \u2018Trust the people.\u2019 We trust the people to take their own decisions on their own responsibilities. The British people can trust us. They have no cause to be disillusioned with the Conservative Party. We have told them the truth, and we have been proved right. We shall go on trusting the people. But now we have one task as you go back to your constituencies, and that, more and more in the interests of our country, is to rouse the people. Let us go forth and rouse them to the situation which exists today, to the policies which are needed to put it right, and, above all, to the Party which alone is able to do it.So often I think of those words at the end of King John which I give you here today: \u2018Nought shall make us rue, As long as England to herself do rest but true.\u2019

aVMr. President - how strange that seems talking to you like that - this has been a wonderful Conference. Even the most hard-boiled observer, glued perhaps to his television set far away from the Winter Gardens, must agree that Blackpool, 1968, has, as a Party Conference, been outstanding. Constantly thoughtful, occasionally controversial, always vital: that has been the tone of our debates. Mature, sensible, practical, and responsible: that has been your own mood. This great Conference I think has lifted our spirits as never before. It has done our party a power of good in the country. But, above all, this Conference has been decisive for the course of modern Conservatism.And we are delighted, Reggie, that you should be presiding at this meeting today. You have played such a large part in so many different spheres in our party over the last 20 years, as well held great offices of state with immense success in the life of the nation. You have served us all, and you have served me, with immense loyalty and understanding, and here we thank you warmly for it.At such a time, and at such a conference, I have indeed been proud to be your Leader. I have been proud, too, of the generous loyalty which you have shown to my colleagues and to myself as you have affirmed the policies which you and I together are going to put before this country at the next general election.What you have done is this. In these three days, you have proclaimed in modern style the old-fashioned virtues of self-reliance and hard work, of thrift and individual independence. And for the less fortunate members of our community you have shown the humanity and the compassion which are in the long and great tradition of our party. That is what we stand for. It is this which has made our party great. It is this which has carried us to electoral success in the past. It is this which is going to win us a great victory when the next general election comes.As you have said, Mr. President, this Conference has made it quite clear to our fellow citizens that we are preparing to be the next Government. We have the ideas; we have the capacity. But, above all we have what this country must always have: we have the will. If we continue to pursue our goal with the same enthusiasm and determination, with the same bounce and vigour that you have shown in these past few days, nothing - nothing - can stop the election of another Conservative Government.I have mentioned bounce and vigour. Of course, I was thinking of Miss Joan Hall in that splendid speech on the first morning. I can let you into a secret. Miss Hall and I have met before. We met in Keighley when she made a speech very similar - full of charm and energy; and at the end she was very kind to me. I hope that I will not embarrass her. She made me a presentation of a travelling bag and a pair of beautiful carpet slippers; and she said, \u2018Ted, you work too hard, Put these on and get your feet up.\u2019 Mr. President, the slippers are untouched, and the travelling bag is almost worn out.But what a contrast in these three days with what was happening in this hall only ten days ago. We were told then that the party of protest had become the party of government; and what happened? On every major issue the Labour Party repudiated its own Government\u2019s policies. And then we heard tell of the politics of participation. Participation indeed! Not participation by the citizen, but the imposition of its policies by an unrepresentative Government; the imposition of universal comprehensive education against the wishes of democratically elected councillors.Participation indeed! Overriding the wishes of the democratically elected local authorities and slamming the door against the citizen who wants to buy his own council house. Thus in this hall ten days ago was truth stood on its head by the manipulator of the broken word.Almost to the day it is four years since the Labour Government took office. As their mini-manifesto said - you will agree, Reggie, that you could hardly call it a progress report - it said, \u2018Four short and difficult years.\u2019 Difficult, yes; short, no. After four long years, on every major issue, the situation today is worse than it was during the years of Conservative Government. I do not know why they call it a mini-manifesto. At least the mini has charms - not this manifesto.Some people are asking still, \u2018What is the difference between the parties?\u2019 Well, look at the newspaper headlines on that document. The Labour Party Manifesto - \u2018A new tax on wealth.\u2019 Make Life Better, our document, the headlines read: \u2018A new plan for savings.\u2019 That is the difference between the Parties. Socialists at home have but one objective - they simply want to tax wealth. We will have none of that - away with it. Let me warn the Government now, do not let them waste time and money building up a massive bureaucracy for this purpose, for the imposition of the wealth tax. For on our return to power we shall destroy whatever they have built up. We work for the creation of wealth - wealth in which everyone in our country and every part of our country can share. Let this be clear: we are not prepared to abolish all development assistance in the hard-pressed areas and abandon Scotland, Wales, the north of England and the southwest country to slow decline and decay.Last week here the Socialists were all obsessed - Ministers and delegates alike - with the fear that the next Conservative Government should inherit some fine fruit from the trees which they have planted. Just what happened in 1951. How quaint. This is how the situation was described in the spring of 1951, \u2018Today British industry stands disorganised and threatened by partial paralysis.\u2019 Who said that? Not a frustrated tycoon denigrating his country; not an Opposition spokesman in the heat of Parliamentary debate. No. Those were the words of the President of the Board of Trade in his resignation speech on the 24th April 1951 - the words of none other than Mr. Wilson himself. This will be our inheritance from a Labour Government: a devalued currency just as in 1951; rising prices going up as fast as in 1951; £3,000 million worth of new foreign debts to be repaid in gold and foreign currency - even more than in 1951; and a world strewn with broken pledges and abandoned treaties. That is what we shall inherit. To adapt a famous phrase - some trees, some fruit!In the last four years political life in this country has been devalued because this Government has openly flouted and repudiated so many of the promises which it made. Our task is to restore integrity to politics, honesty to Government and respect to Britain. That is why I repeat again to you today my pledge: we shall make no promises which we cannot be absolutely certain we shall be able to fulfil. Make Life Better is the theme of this Conference. Our document is the work of the Party in Parliament and in the constituencies. It is the achievement of the whole Party, of CPC, the Three-Way Contact Programme, the trade unionists, the YCs, the universities, businessmen, finance, expert advisers, the Advisory Committee on Policy and the Shadow Cabinet. All have contributed. It is the work of a team.Never before has there been so much open discussion within a Party on matters of policy in which everyone could express their views. Of course, not all receive agreement, but when it has been argued out, then let us accept the view of our Party. At the end of the day it is upon me personally, as your elected Leader, that the responsibility for policy rests. I accept that responsibility to the full.I am confident that these are the policies which are best for Britain. I shall see that they are carried through. The next stage has already started. What is now required is to do more work in detail. We have many special projects under way. Since our proposals for industrial relations were published, a team of lawyers under Sir Peter Rawlinson has been hard at work turning them into legislative form. I have now given instructions that we should do the same with our immigration policy. We hope, as Quintin Hogg said on Thursday in his speech, that the Government will speedily implement our proposals on immigration. We shall be able to press them in the House of Commons Select Committee on which we have agreed to serve. But if the Government refuses to take further action, then we will be ready immediately on taking office to put our own plans into effect. Quintin is unable to be with us this morning but I want to say to you behind his back what I have said to him so often in private: How much we value the quality of intellect and of humanity which he has given to this immensely difficult and delicate task of handling home affairs for our party in the House of Commons.Iain Macleod has already given you details of the work we have been doing preparing for the reform of the tax system. Here in this conference hall we are persuaded and dazzled by his wit and oratory which gave us all such enjoyment earlier this week. But I hope that nobody here will allow that to disguise the immense amount of hard work which he is leading behind the scenes on technical economic matters, but to which he can bring political judgment from his own experience which is of the utmost value.What we are planning is no patchwork of minor adjustments. We are planning root and branch reforms. Our aim is to simplify the tax system and to encourage efficiency in the use of all our resources. But reform of the tax system makes better sense when combined with reform of our social security system, about which Robin Balniel spoke so persuasively. There are many who pay little or no income tax at all - pensioners and low wage-earners with families. If we attempt to help them by increases in benefits right across the board, as this Government has done, we would simply undo all our efforts to get tax rates down. We would do nothing to improve the incentives to people to stand on their own feet, and so we are studying new methods of giving help to those who need it. But this I would say to you, because it has not emerged yet from this Conference: let nobody underestimate the radical nature of the changes which we propose in Make Life Better for handling family allowances. This is a radical change of policy, which I hope the Party will fully appreciate. You have adopted our plans to provide decent homes for everyone. We will widen the opportunity for home ownership and, at the same time, make better provision, through local authority accommodation, for the retired folk, for the disabled and for the poorer families. Again, let me emphasise the radical nature of the change of policy proposed in Make Life Better for the renegotiation of all local authority housing subsidies. But it is for renegotiation, not for wiping them our altogether, because we believe, as our Party has always done, that local authority housing has got a vital part to play in helping with the housing of the unfortunate members of our community.On education you supported the local education authorities against dictation from Whitehall. But our approach is based on the needs of the children and not on political dogma. Where parents and local authorities want it, of course, we shall support grammar schools, support them to the hilt. I went to a grammar school myself. I have, perhaps a personal interest in seeing a healthy future for the grammar schools. But I believe that it is also in the interests of our children, because what we ought to glory in - to glory in - is the infinite variety of our educational system in this country.On incomes policy you have spoken for the whole nation in rejecting control of wages by law. But again with responsibility you have recognised that the Government cannot stand aside entirely from these matters.On immigration you have endorsed the proposals which I put forward at York for the strict control of entry, together with policies to promote racial harmony. Of course, the Home Secretary is wrong; this policy will severely curtail the number of immigrants coming into this country. But, at the same time, we shall pursue policies to help racial harmony. Again we will help those who wish to return to their own country. But let us not deceive ourselves into thinking that this is going to remove the problem - it will not, but we will help in this way. But if there are any who believe that immigrants to this country, most of whom have already become British citizens, could be forcibly deported because they are coloured people, in an attempt to solve this problem, then that I must repudiate, absolutely and completely.Surely, when we are saying, for the reasons we have given, that the number of people coming from the developing countries and from the countries of the Commonwealth into this country must be drastically curtailed, then there is a responsibility even greater than in the past, a moral responsibility as well as a responsibility in their interests and our interests, to help them in other ways, economic ways, in their own country. On east of Suez, in the debate in which you took part yesterday, Mr. President, you have spoken for Britain in our determination to honour our obligations and to defend our interest.On one further matter you have given the lead. You have reaffirmed support for our industrial relations policy. With every day that passes the need to carry out this policy becomes more urgent. In less than ten days\u2019 time this country faces an engineering strike which would aim a direct blow at half the exports of our country. It will affect the jobs, not of thousands of workers, but of millions, most of whom clearly want no part in this strike. It could damage the interests of every man, woman and child in Britain. Two days of such a strike could mean more working days lost than were lost from all the strikes in all the industries in any one of the last five years.In one of the papers yesterday I saw the headline, \u2018Engineering Unions confirm strike Government act.\u2019 Act? What it should have said was, \u2018Government talk.\u2019 For talk is the only thing they can do under our present system of industrial relations. But words are no longer enough. I am convinced that where the interests of the whole nation are exposed to such a threat the Government should have the power to order a cooling off period.If there was no settlement within the sixty or ninety days, then a secret ballot should be held. Such a policy would not weaken the ultimate right to strike, but it would strengthen the cause of responsibility and moderation. It is fair to the unions, it is fair to their members and it is fair to the nation. It is part of our Fair Deal at Work. That is what the next Conservative Government will introduce.Mr, President, these policies which you have endorsed this week at this Conference are the Conservative policies to make life better. But they are also policies to make Britain stronger. We want to build a stronger Britain because we believe our country still has got a role to play in the world outside. No man in office or in opposition has done more to bring this home to the people of Britain or to maintain Britain\u2019s interest than Sir Alec Douglas-Home.As long ago as the Brighton Conference of 1961, this Conference and this Party committed itself to the European policy. Throughout those negotiations of two years the great majority of the Party here and in Parliament gave me wholehearted support. We wanted to bring about that unity, for political as well as for economic reasons. We were working for an ideal, an ideal which was important to my generation and to many here, but it was also vital for the youth of the whole of Europe.And how strongly events since then have shown this to be true, and nowhere more so than in the defeated countries like Germany, where they sought a unity greater than that of the nation State which had failed them both in peace and in war.We were unable to accomplish our task. When the present Government, eating their bitter words, changing their Party policy, suddenly themselves embarked on this venture, we supported them. But how often we had emphasised that before another negotiation should be embarked upon or could be successful, they must ensure that all the members of the Community wished to bring about British membership. It is now evident that this the Government completely failed to do. Their exploration of the European capitals was superficial. Their repeated argument that there was no sterling problem was soon to be disproved by devaluation. They did not succeed in resolving differences between Britain and France. In those circumstances, their application was bound to fail. Britain suffered another rebuff.But your commitment and my commitment remains unchanged. There is no doubt where we stand. We no longer need to prove that we are Europeans. That stage is long past. Britain does not need to knock at any man\u2019s door. We are an applicant, but we are not, and we never have been, a supplicant. Our European credentials cannot be challenged by anyone. So we say to the six Governments of the European Community, \u2018We are ready when you are ready.\u2019 Having said that, we must now give our time and our energy to building our own strength and advancing our own interests.In this island of ours it is always easy to take our security for granted.Ancient, effortless, ordered, cycle on cycle set,Life so long untroubled, that ye who inherit forget,It was not made with the mountains, it is not one with the deep,Men, not gods, devised it. Men, not gods, must keep.That is our security.In these last months we have had a tragic warning. We have seen a small and peace- loving people abruptly invaded and forced step by step back down the path into slavery. Of course Czechoslovakia was within the Soviet orbit. Her geography and her history together made her helpless. But have we in Britain, have we in the Western world, learned the lesson? Last week I went to the NATO Headquarters at Brussels to see for myself. I returned convinced that the Conservative Party, now as before, has a solemn duty to make that lesson clear. It is not enough to rely on optimistic assessments of Soviet intentions. These intentions are now seen to be at best obscure, at worst brutal and threatening. We must concentrate with our Allies on providing an adequate defence against what we know to be Soviet capability. We must halt the run-down of our forces and the destruction by the Socialist Government of our system of Reserves.Now, as in the past, we must be strong if we hope to be safe. In an uncertain world, that is the surest guarantee of peace. We must look beyond the confines of Europe. In the Gulf, in Singapore, in Australia, so far from wanting us to go, our friends are imploring us to stay. They are sure that it is in our interests as well as theirs that we should do so.We do not say that Britain should be the world\u2019s policeman. We say that, since there is no world policeman, we cannot assume that our own interests across the world will be safe unless we make some effort ourselves to protect them. We are not trying to cling nostalgically to a few last footholds of Empire. Outside the Communist world the age of colonial empires is virtually over. It is precisely because of this that Britain is now welcome in Asia - not as a master, but as a partner and as an ally.Of course we are not proposing some massive system of overseas establishments which will beggar the British economy. What I have proposed is co-operation between five Commonwealth countries and between ourselves and the States in the Gulf which would share with us the facilities, the effort and the expense. Just as our friends have helped us in the past, so are we determined that we shall never let them down in the future.Today the voice of Britain is querulous and faint. We used to be known for our far-sightedness and good sense. We used to have a reputation for keeping our word. Our friends across the world are asking if those days are gone for good. From this Conference let us give them the answer for which they hope. Let us proclaim to them clearly and unhesitatingly: The years of retreat are over. Britain is ready with them to make the effort which is needed to build for the future a safe and prosperous world.If we are to back this pledge, then we must, each one of us, go to our task. Our task is to secure the return of our Party in Government at the next Election. Together we will make sure that when the people of Britain are given the choice they will choose a Conservative Government.Helping us in that, with immense persuasiveness, skill and power of organisation, combined with an immense capacity for a sheer hard grind, is the Chairman of the Party, Tony Barber. This Party Conference is the place where it gives me most pleasure to thank him and all those who work with him for what they are doing for our Party.When we come to Government it will be a Government winch will have to tackle many of the same old problems of politics which have confronted every Government of every generation - the relationship between the Government and the governed; how to ensure that the freedom which is essential to human development is within the framework of order that is so vital for man\u2019s security; how to reconcile opportunity for man and his family with provision for the needs of the community of which he is a member.It is in the nature of Conservatism always to strive to keep a balance in society, to ensure that the community serves the individual and that the individual can carry out his responsibilities to the community. Through much of the 19th century, Conservatism was fighting to save the individual from the fate of soulless laissez-faire. Lord Shaftesbury worked to get through the Factory Acts, and Disraeli railed against the callousness of Liberal principles. For much of the 20th century, the Party has been fighting against the insidious encroachment of collectivism under Socialism, fighting to restore their rights to men and women and their families, fighting against the all-pervading presence of Government, fighting against the power of bureaucracy, against the strength of monopoly capitalism, against the unchecked might of uninhibited trade unionism, in order to restore and protect the undoubted rights of the individual.Every generation sees this struggle in its own way. Every generation must redress the balance to meet its own needs. Today it is both the morality and the competence of Government which is being challenged - the morality of the Government\u2019s actions towards the individual, the encroachment upon his liberty; the demands upon his income and property; the need to ensure fair dealing between the citizen and the State - a need even extending to a demand for the introduction of constitutional guarantees for the individual to protect him against Socialist authoritarianism; to protect him against legislation being steamrollered through a Parliament of placemen.And the challenge is to the competence of government - a government which is outmoded in its structure, outdated in its techniques, presumptuous in its demands and totalitarian in making its decisions. A government which has proved unable to maintain the value of the currency, incapable of defending British interests overseas, and which so inadequately meets the genuine needs in commerce and industry and the citizen.Nor is there any lack of connection between morality and competence. The State - ever grasping for more power over the individual - steadily undermines its own effectiveness and brutally increases the opposition to its own sway and thus it sows the seeds of its own curtailment. Nor is the morality of the Government unconnected with the morality of the governed. Respect for law and order, regard for financial probity, endeavours towards enterprise and efficiency - these cannot flourish where the State itself overrides the right of the citizen, shows little concern for its financial prudence, and whose ideas of organisation, administration and decision making are so antiquated as to be unrecognisable by modern minds.We must restore respect for government, its morality and its competence. In its morality it must set the example; in its competence it must deliver the goods. No one in this Conference is in any doubt today when the balance needs to be redressed.We will remove the shackles of government from industry.We will banish the regulation and control of business activities.We will withdraw the Government from holdings in private firms.We will begin to reintroduce private ownership into nationalised industries.We will prevent the family businesses and the young innovators from being penalised by taxation.We will enforce that care over the use of public money which the private citizen exercises over his own.We will puncture the swollen corpus of bureaucracy, cut free the octopus-like grip of over-centralisation.We will purge the body politic of the toxins of waste, extravagance and procrastination.It is to this end that I shall establish a smaller Cabinet as a decision-making body, create federal Departments to reduce interdepartmental friction and streamline administration, prune drastically the number of civil servants, and inject the modern techniques of business management and technology into Whitehall.Nor shall we rest there. Research and development will be devolved more about business and the universities, and many self-contained branches of Government will be organised and run as special projects under men seconded from industry and finance, and trained for the purpose. Our work on this is already advancing. The men and women will be ready when the time comes.For I want to offer the people of Britain a real alternative, a Government that is as different in men and methods as it is in thought and action from what they have endured in these past four years.Then let the people choose - between bad Government and good, between men who break their promises and breed cynicism and men who honour their pledges and keep faith, between an administration that is out of date and inefficient and has brought Government into contempt and a Party whose record in Government is one of proven competence, whose vision of the future is realistic, and which can and will restore confidence to the people of this country. Let the people choose between a Government whose remoteness from them breeds indifference and one which will involve our people in the making of decisions that affect their lives and those of their families.That is the choice - the choice between a discredited Socialist Government and a new Conservative Administration.But there is much more at stake than that. There is more at stake than the result of the next General Election. It is my sombre conviction, watching events here in Europe and across the Atlantic, that what is at issue when the people of Britain come to make their solemn choice is nothing less than the survival in anything like its present form of democratic Government itself.I do not believe that even here in Britain, in the very birthplace of Parliamentary democracy, the process of democratic Government could survive another battering of the kind it has received at the hands of Labour over these past four years. I do not say this lightly. I believe it is something that transcends the normal give and take of political debate. It is something that goes far beyond the shores of this our island, for when it comes to democratic institutions and the great freedoms attached to them the whole world still looks to Britain.We have welcomed at this Conference more than 250 observers from nearly 40 countries. They come from a world in turmoil. In Asia and in Africa, in Eastern Europe and in America, the struggle for freedom and for rights is bringing about immense upheavals. With each upheaval the chasms that divide man from man seem to become wider and deeper. The only thing that can bridge them is faith in the eventual outcome.It is in such a world of shifting currents and contrasting tides that Britain stands out as a rock, a rock of political stability throughout our history, and on that rock is a lighthouse that proclaims fairness and tolerance, democracy and freedom. Sometimes it has been shrouded in mist; sometimes its light has grown dim; but never yet has it been extinguished.It falls to us here in the Conservative Party to keep that light ablaze, so that in all the turmoils and upheavals through which the world is passing, men will still be able to point to Britain and say, \u2018There - there stands the rock to give us faith. There stands the light to guide us.\u2019This is Britain\u2019s heritage. It is this for which we fight. It is this which we will defend and maintain.

aVMadam President, you are presiding today, and we are delighted to see your return to our Party in this high position, over a Conference which has done more in three days to restore life and vitality to the political scene than three years of Labour and Liberal Conferences put together. You have shown not only life and soul by night as well as by day, but you have also shown heart and head as well; and I congratulate you most sincerely upon it.Look at the breadth of the debates which we have had in these last three days. Our economic debate, in which Iain Macleod put forward so succinctly the plans we are considering for the reform and reduction of taxation. That immensely important debate on industrial relations in which Robert Carr carried further the farsighted and well-thought out plans we have for the reform of our industrial relations. The debate on trade and industry in which Keith Joseph set out again detailed policies for regional development, so important to so many of you here. The debate on housing, showing our policies for helping the homeless in Britain today. And then that very remarkable debate on education, with which this Conference becomes more and more deeply concerned, showing our united opposition to having Socialist dogma and doctrine in education forced upon the organisation of our schools up and down the country. And the debate yesterday afternoon answered by Margaret Thatcher, showing our determination to see that women have a just and equal place in our society today.In this Conference you have given massive support to these policies which have been put before you by my colleagues and on which they and members of our Party in the policy groups and in the Advisory Committee on Policy under Mr. Reginald Maudling have done so much work.But there are three debates on which I wish to say something a little more specific to you today. First of all, the debate on the question of dealing with law and order, and in particular capital punishment.I know full well how deep individual personal feelings are in this matter, and it was right that they should be reflected openly and frankly in that debate. Of course, for many the question is decided as a matter of principle, and it is important to recognise that it is a matter of principle. There are some who wish to see the restoration of capital punishment as a matter of principle and others who wish to see its continued abolition as a matter of principle. I hope that we may all respect these points of view.At the same time, there are many worried and anxious about the present position who wish to decide the question as to whether capital punishment is a deterrent to murder, and for them an amendment was introduced by your husband, Madam President, in the House of Commons, setting down a five-year period which is due to end in 1970. I believe that for them the Government should ensure that all the statistics are provided on which they can come to a judgment, not just bare statistics but that every case should be examined by a small group of three - a judge, a former Home Secretary, and a criminologist - so that they can, without making recommendations as to what action should be taken, nevertheless clarify what has happened during these past five years. Then in the House of Commons it will be left in our Party to a free vote. Because, as you already recognise, this is a matter of principle.The other matter to which I would like to turn is the question of immigration into Britain. I can claim without fear of contradiction that since I have been Leader of this Party I have seen more of every area in this country, of Scotland and of Wales, than any other political leader. And I have seen the problems which are caused by immigration in the great cities of our country, the problems of housing, of schools, of the Health Service, and of hospitals; and also the difficulties of ensuring good race relations in many congested areas.Our purpose, my purpose, is to do everything possible to ensure harmonious relations between the races in this country. I have set out the Party\u2019s policy. It is very different from that of the present administration. It is a policy which, when we come into power, will ensure the strictest control of all new immigration into this country. It will be achieved by bringing the legislation governing the entry of Commonwealth citizens into line with that governing the entry of non-Commonwealth citizens. This will then ensure that the Home Secretary of the day has complete control, subject to any machinery for appeal which is introduced, over the entry of individuals into Britain. If there is justification in the British interest for a citizen to come to this country, then that person will be given a work permit issued for a specific period, in the first instance, say, 12 months. It will be limited to a specific job; it will be limited to a specific employer in a specific place. The result of this will be to prevent any further overcrowding and burden on our already heavily burdened social services. We shall take measures in the country of origin as well as here to prevent evasion of the law passed by Parliament. We shall make funds available to assist immigrants who wish to return to their own country of origin. But we are not going to press them; we are not going to hurry them; we are going to do everything to prevent a climate being created which will make them wish to leave against their own free willWe shall help those local authorities who have got particular problems. This above all is important for the social harmony of all of us: that immigrants who are now living here should be treated in all respects as equal citizens without discrimination. This Conference showed without any shadow of doubt last Wednesday afternoon how determinedly it is opposed to discrimination, whether it be by race or religion or of any other kind, and this we will ensure for immigrants in this country.As far as dependants are concerned, I believe that it is inhumane, morally wrong and open to social objections that a wife should be kept away from an immigrant who is already here, and the same applies to the young children of school age. Others can fend for themselves in their own countries, but it is right that the wife and young children should be allowed to join those who are already here.This, then, in my view, is a just, firm and fair policy which will conduce to better relations in this country between the races. It is the policy I have put forward. When we are in government it is the policy which we shall implement.From this Conference we go out into battle. It has been made perfectly plain that the battle is not far away. We go out to fight for higher living standards for our people, to fight for a better deal for those in need, to fight for a strong Britain, to fight not for a narrow sectional or class interest but to fight for the interests of all the people in this country.Let us be under no illusions. I have never been under any illusions since the moment I first spoke to you when you elected me Leader of this Party. It will be a hard battle to fight, and I hope that everybody realises that. Victory will not come easily. But if I judge the temper of this Conference aright, the message we send out to our party in the country and to the whole nation is this: We are ready; we are confident; we know that we are in the right; and when the challenge comes, victory will be won.How very different it was in this same hall last week. Their debate footled and fudged and smudged every single issue which is of importance to the people of this country. It may be that by playing it cool like that they avoided the possibility of melting, which faces every one of us in this hall today. But what they got was froth and frivolity to take their minds off the real issues. Here you have faced the issues, not dodged them.They have challenged us to fight the next Election on their record. What can suit us better than to fight on their record - the record of five years of Labour Government? A record rise in the cost of living - nearly twice as fast as under us. A record rise in taxation. Looking back over history, you will appreciate that it took 2,000 years from the time Julius Caesar set foot on these shores to the moment when taxation reached the level of £7,000 million a year - 2,000 years. It has taken just five years of Labour Government to double that figure into £14,000 million. A record level of unemployment - more than half a million people out of work, their skill, their energies, their character wasted, for 24 out of the past 25 months. And a record level of overseas debt. I know that they do not like us discussing this, but it is their record - £13,000 million of gold and foreign currencies borrowed since 1964. And still they encourage the borrowing. They pay for American aircraft by borrowing. They encourage British firms to borrow abroad, and take the currency themselves and let them have it in sterlingThere is a record level of interest rates - the highest rate for the longest period since the foundation of the Bank of England in 1694. This is no academic matter, just something for financiers and the City. Why are local council rates pushed up so quickly? Because of what they have to pay in interest. Why is it that the young couple buying their own home find the burden of mortgages so great? Because of the level of interest rates. Perhaps a million people in this country with mortgages would privately tell us, \u2018It is really more than we can afford.\u2019 That is the result of interest rates under a Labour Government.It is sometimes a good thing to look back on what Mr. Wilson said in election addresses. It is rather a saddening experience, but there you are. In 1964 it was 100 per cent mortgages and lower interest rates. How hollow it all sounds now! But even more than that, in 1964 it was, \u2018Labour will abolish poverty in Britain.\u2019 And today there are 125,000 men and women over the age of 80 eking out their declining years as best they can, and still with no pension whatever.There are still 250,000 children in families living below the poverty line. Those are but two of the social problems facing us today. I do not blame them for the existence of those problems. We know that they have grown up with our country, and that every Party has made a contribution to dealing with them. But I do blame them for false promises that they would wipe out the problems, and for their incompetence in dealing with them in office.Contrast that with our record. A record rise in the living standards of the British people under a Conservative Administration. A record increase in social spending - and here is the point - combined with massive and continuing reductions in taxation while we were in office. A proud record of promises made and promises kept.But what is the Labour Party now claiming? What has its leader claimed for it? Let us take each one of these claims apart - and you have to do it in detail. They claim that they are spending 70 per cent more this year on the social services than we did, and so they say it is a better record. Let us look at it in detail. How do they get this figure?First of all, they include some months in 1964 when they were not even in Government, and then they include some months in 1969-70 which have not yet occurred, and the money has not been spent. That is cheating.There has been the great rise in prices, so of course it means that more money must be spent.What does this figure include? It includes £100 million of selective employment tax. They take £100 million from you in selective employment tax, pay it to the social services, and promptly take it away from them again in selective employment tax - and then say that they have helped the social services. That is cheating.And there is £83 million in family allowances, which now they claw back to the full, that they include in their figures for spending. That is cheating. £50 million more paid in extra unemployment pay, because of the high level of unemployment and the large number of men out of work. The Party of soul? Madam President, the Party of the dole!But let us look again at this claim, overall. If we look at it and compare what has really been done in the social services, allowing for the inflation of this Government, in their first four years and our last four years, we get a very different picture. Allowing for all the price rises, the increase in social service spending in our last four years was actually faster than it has been in the last four years under Labour - a 27 per cent increase under us and a 25 per cent increase under them. That is the real position. Do not let them get away with it! Tell every citizen of this country what the real comparison is, and how good our record in those years was.But last week in this hall the Leader of the Labour Party said, \u2018We are changing Britain for the better.\u2019 \u2018Hope,\u2019 he said, \u2018in the changing North.\u2019 Hope for the people of the North, where there are 66,000 fewer jobs under a Labour Government? Hope in Yorkshire and Humberside, where there are 106,000 fewer jobs? Hope in his own area - the North-West - with 111,000 fewer jobs? Wales? 38,000 fewer jobs; Scotland? 65,000 fewer jobs. What hope is there there - despite all the money which they have been pouring out and of which they boast so much on regional development. That is not the way to change the face of this country and make Britain better.We all know how boring it is to catalogue the list of broken promises of Mr. Wilson. We have all experienced the tedium of reading the innumerable footnotes in small print at the bottom of every declaration and statement. I have been looking for some all-embracing, omnibus statement of his philosophy, promises and programme, and I have found it by disinterring that speech of his at Scarborough in 1963. Do you remember it? We were treated to the vision of a Britain forged in the white heat of a technological revolution.I would like to tell you about it. We were told then what a vote for Labour would mean. I do not want in any way to detract from the importance of those words. I will read them to you. He said, \u2018A vote for Labour would mean this - the conscious, planned, purposive use of scientific progress to provide undreamed of living standards and the possibility of leisure everywhere on an unbelievable scale.\u2019He promised us that new industries would be created. He promised more and more young scientists and that more and more of them would stay in this country. Then we were told, as the great summary of this technological revolution - and I will read his words because otherwise you will not believe me \u2013 \u2018We ought to be giving more thought to developing research in this country for producing little, simple one- or two-horsepower steam engines.\u2019 \u2018Because,\u2019 he went on, \u2018that is what the world really needs.\u2019Here we are, six years later. What has happened to those undreamed of living standards? What about the new industries? Where are all these young scientists, with more and more staying in this country? What are the figures for the brain drain? What about the unbelievable leisure? What, finally, whatever has happened to all those little, simple - (Laughter)We did not hear about them here last week. But we did hear a claim of very remarkable achievements for the industrial developments of a Labour Government in five years. Again, I will read the words to you. I have a script, for the sake of the greatest accuracy, of what the Leader of the Labour Party said. He said, \u2018It is the result of the Government\u2019s industrial policy over the past five years - a policy which is now delivering the goods.\u2019He went on with a very considerable list, covering about two pages of script, which I understand was read very quickly. Nevertheless, the list is there. We might have a look at it. First, in five years of Socialist Government, the steam naphtha reforming process. I have had a look at this. This was started under Winston Churchill in the early 1950s. The first plant was opened in 1954. It is cheating a bit to stick that in the list. Then we have the Rolls Royce RB 211. A statement from the firm says that the idea started 25 years ago, in 1944, before the end of the war. But, what is important, the design work started under Mr. Macmillan\u2019s Government in 1961. I think that that is cheating. The hovercraft, taken on by the National Research Development Corporation in 1958. Another little cheat. The satellite communication station at Goonhilly Down, started in 1959 under us. Another cheat. The electron probe analyser, first produced in Britain in 1960. Another little cheat. What a claim to make!But I will be fair; there is one of which be is entitled to claim parentage - and that is the project for the aluminium smelters, which at the moment do not exist. And when it comes to tourism, all I can say is that it was not to look at the sites of the non-existent aluminium smelters that BOAC thought up their package deal for young men in New York.Their most expensive policy of all was their promise not to increase taxation. Under them, taxation rates have run up £3,000 million. Under us they went down £2,000 million. Your pound in his pocket! For every pound you were paying in tax under us five years ago you are paying £2 today. £2 in his pocket. That is not quite what we were promised. He told us, you will remember, that over the period of a Parliament the policies would all be achieved without any general increase in taxation. Again, his own words: \u2018One thing I will say,\u2019 he told the nation, \u2018The Labour Government has promised nothing we cannot fulfil.\u2019I want to be fair to them over this - there is no need to attack this Government: you need only to be fair to it - they have still got one more budget in which they can carry out their undertaking. It is up to the Chancellor. All he has to do next April is to take 6d off the income tax, 1s ld off cigarettes, is 9d off petrol, 13s 11d off a bottle of whisky, £10 off the car licence, £11 millions off estate duty, £352 millions off purchase tax and £615 millions off SET, and he will be home on his promise.But perhaps all this is going to be put right by the recent Government changes and by the developments in the structure of Government. Well, we are not going to see much result from that for the next year or eighteen months. Whitehall, already demoralised, will be thrown into a turmoil. It always strikes me how little practical thought there is behind this. Is there any sign that this is going to cut out waste or reduce Government expenditure? None at all. Is there any sign that they are going to introduce proper business management for individual projects in Whitehall, to which we have devoted so much attention and have made so much progress since I last spoke to you at this Conference a year ago? No sign at all. What a lack of thought - Mr. George Thomson at the end of July given the job, despite the fact that he is a Scot, of working out the new proposals for local government in England and Wales. We English are used to this. He does two months\u2019 consultation and what happens, he is whipped away and put into the job of looking after Europe. Better than that, you have a chap put into the job last Sunday and he is out again by Thursday.But as Iain Macleod and Nigel Lawson so lovingly said, what has emerged from the whole of this, to the great benefit of the nation, is the death - no that would be wrong - the constitutional abolition of the Department of Economic Affairs. It has been dead for a long time; it has only just now been abolished. You will remember the origin of the Department of Economic Affairs - it was conceived in a taxi in a three minute journey to the House of Commons in order to give a job to George Brown. It seems to me that that must be pretty well the most unproductive thing ever to come out of the back of a taxi - so far.Their third claim is that the balance of payments is coming right. Let there be no mistake about this. Everybody in this Party welcomes any improvement in the balance of payments and we know and are prepared to give credit to industry for the skill and the drive, the craftsmanship and the effort they have made to get that improvement in the balance of payments. Let there also be no misunderstanding about the price which the people of this country have had to pay over five years in order to get that improvement. Why should I, personally, want the improvement? I will tell you - because I do not want to have to do the same thing as Mr. Churchill did in 1951: take over a country which is saddled with an enormous burden of debt which has been put round the country\u2019s neck by a Labour administration. But a good balance of payments is the only way of beginning to pay off that debt. We shall continue to tell the people of this country the price that they are paying for this improvement in unemployment, in high prices, in high interest rates and in so many other ways.Strangely enough Mr. Wilson seems to think that any criticism of Socialism is unpatriotic. It is time that he ceased to imagine that Socialism and himself and Britain are the same things. Like millions of others, I fought for my country for six years. I served in the Territorial Army. I was proud to command its oldest regiment for four years. And I am not going to take lessons in patriotism from anybody at a Labour Conference.But let us just look at another one of these claims. At the end of the Conference Mr. Wilson said, \u2018We must not overlook the fact that of the £3,000 million of debt, $1,000 million of overseas debt have been repaid.\u2019Well, I would welcome that if it were genuinely true. Why did he say 1,000 million dollars? Well, of course, it sounds so much better than just over £400 million. Where did that £400 million come from? After all, there has only been a surplus on the balance of payments of just over £100 million? I will tell you. It came from some of the sterling area countries putting deposits in this country of which they are entitled to repayment, and it came from borrowing from the International Monetary Fund. So to repay debt they have to go out and get other deposits and borrow again in order to repay the original loan. That is what is happening under this present Labour Government. Let everybody know it. It is just another little cheat.So much for their record - high unemployment, record taxation, enormous overseas debts. Fight on that record? You bet we will. We will wrap that record round them time and again, night after night, day after day, and they will sink like a stone.But I want to tell you about our own Party and our approach and our philosophy, our programme and our policies. We want to build a country in which men and women and every family can find the scope for creating a better life for themselves - a responsible society which is ready to take on its obligations as well as to enjoy its rights, a country in which men and women can earn more, can keep more and can save more; higher earnings, lower direct taxes and greater savings. Earn more because with better education, better training and better retraining people will be able to make their effort more effectively. In education let us develop children\u2019s talents to the utmost. Of course, it is right to broaden the opportunity for the less able, but let us also not deprive the very able of the opportunities they ought to have. Let the children live better than our generation\u2019s have been able to, earn more without being held up or held back by lack of skill, by lack of up-to-date machinery or by trade union restrictions.We want an industrial society in which the trade unions, a potential force for great good, are subject to the same rule of law as the rest of us in the community. This is why, as a first priority in office, we shall introduce the major reform of industrial relations to free our nation from the frustrating conflicts of a century and a half of industrial strife. Have no fear: we have given our pledge. We do not withdraw, no matter where the pressure comes from or what it is. We shall carry through our reform of industrial relations.I mentioned just now Iain Macleod\u2019s speech on the details of taxation. I find people today, in the current mood of disillusionment and pessimism, who say, \u2018Surely we have just got to accept that taxes will always go up and up.\u2019 To those pessimists, then, I repeat the very simple fact that in the 13 years of Conservative prosperity, taxes came down in budget after budget. In five budgets out of those when we were in power we brought down income tax. What we have done before we can do again. We are determined that everybody shall keep more of what they earn, and we shall show the young people that they themselves can help to build a better country by their own efforts; and to save more, because we want people to build up their own possessions, because as part of our philosophy we know that ownership gives security and independence.We do not want a wealth tax. We want every family to have more wealth. We shall encourage home ownership, occupational pension schemes, wider share ownership and wider ownership of British industry. That is why we are looking at different ways of enabling people to take a share in the so-called publicly-owned industries. That is why we shall also maintain the rights of individuals to make their own private provision for health and education.I wonder if you noticed that extraordinary statement in the Labour Party\u2019s recent document about all this. Again, it is unbelievable unless I quote it: \u2018The danger of a growth in private health and welfare which is now gathering momentum.\u2019How foolish can you get to believe that a growth in people making more provision for their own health, their children\u2019s education and their own welfare is apparently a danger to the nation which must be stepped on by a Socialist Government? So I give this warning to them: they had better keep their hands off the occupational pension schemes, keep their hands off individual rights, keep their hands off private initiative, and keep their hands off free enterprise.The nation we want to build depends on free enterprise, on a prosperity that is based on earnings, the savings and the efforts of a free people; and a free people who are strong but who are determined that our nation shall be judged by what it can do for the weak as much as by the opportunities it can give to the vigorous. We as a nation must be judged by our treatment of the elderly, by our attitude to the disabled, by the conditions in our hospitals, and particularly the mental hospitals, and by the shelter we can afford to the homeless and to the badly housed. It is this provision to which we have devoted so much time at our party conference this week.Provision for old age involves more than pensions. It means providing the sort of life which they - the retired, the old folk - wish to live. To add a personal note, my father was 81 yesterday. I advised him to stick to ITN, but I am told that it may also still be possible to get it on BBC.The old are the most vulnerable section of the community. They are the least able to cope with the changes of modern society. For them there can be no substitute for a policy of care as well as cash - and how difficult many of them are finding it today.Then, again, we must help the disabled. I have in mind particularly the need of the disabled wife. We appreciate how much the extra costs can be to the disabled because of their disabilities: the extra heat, the special food, the need for special transport - all those things for which they have to rely on others to provide.Then, again, the homeless. We did so much in our time in Government to help the homeless - and yet so much still remains to be done. But our policy is very clear. It is compassionate and sensible. Today there are all too many who receive subsidies in council houses who, by any standards, do not really need them, and there are still too many who want council houses and cannot get into them.There are many in need living in privately rented accommodation who are actually subsidising those much better off than themselves. How can it be sensible to allow that situation to go on? There are millions of houses still decaying - sometimes in squalid surroundings - very far short of modern standards. There are two million in the slums and four million in poor repair in one way or another. Perhaps a quarter of the people in this country today live in conditions like that.Madam President, it is time to take the heartbreak out of housing. We have got to have a new start. We will encourage all those who want to buy their homes to do so. Whether it is a new house, an old house, or a council house, we will encourage them to buy them. We will make sure that the subsidies go only to those who need them to stop the decline and decay in our housing stock, give an incentive to the builders to get on and build the houses, and make the land available for them to do so.Of course, the State itself, the Government itself, cannot make life better on its own. It is up to us as individuals to do so. That is why I want to encourage both more self-reliance and, at the same time, more voluntary effort. It is voluntary public service working alongside governmental and local governmental effort that provides the humanising element in the welfare state. So many Conservatives already take part in this work. I thank them for it. But at the same time I want to see many more doing it as well - in particular, the Young Conservatives amongst our young people today.But all this depends on the ability of us, as a country, to pay for what we want. The greater our prosperity, the more houses we can build. The greater our prosperity, the more schools we can put up and the more teachers we can afford in the classroom. The more we can improve our health service and relieve poverty, the more we can build a country of which we can be proud and of which future generations can be proud.We want a nation which is rich enough to create a new mood of confidence and a new mood which is outward looking. It is as part of this that I want to mention the third debate, that contentious debate of such importance, that on the European policy.I think here, where so many of you have heard the debates over the years on Europe, you will agree that from my personal position I have, I think, a close knowledge of what is happening in Europe, of the advantages and disadvantages of this policy, of the possibilities and of the difficulties. I have never hesitated to put them frankly before you and I have urged there should always be the fullest debate.For that reason I was delighted that we had such an excellent debate here in this Conference. It was quite right that you should take a decision. I welcome that decision, but the effect of it on me is to place an even greater responsibility on my colleagues and myself to ensure that the facts are placed always before you, that we tell you the difficulties as well as the opportunities, and that when we are in government, if the opportunity arises that we can negotiate, then we ensure that we make proper arrangements to deal with the anxieties which are expressed, not only in this Conference, but in the country outside.Before I go on to one point, I just want to deal with another little cheat. You may recall that it was said in this hall last week by the Leader of the Labour Party - The situation vis-à-vis negotiation in Europe is quite different now from what it was when Mr. Heath was doing it in 1962. Now we are in a strong position. Then he was in a weak position.Let us examine this. The negotiations went on all through 1962. We had a favourable balance of payments - on current account, £112 million; overall, small, but a balance - £12 million. What we did was not to borrow a penny during 1962 and we repaid over £300 million to the International Monetary Fund, which was the end of the money which had been borrowed from them. In 1967, when the Labour Government decided to go into Europe they had an overall deficit on their balance of payments of £417 million and outstanding debt of £3,000 million which they were unable to repay. That is the difference. When we went into Europe with our negotiations, we went from a position which they recognised as being healthy. When the Labour Government tried in 1967, it was with a large deficit on their balance of payments and an enormous outside debt. Just let us get that record straight as well.What was the phrase from Mr. Wilson, that we had gone cap in hand? Cap in hand? With a favourable balance of payments and wiping out the existing debt! Then what were they doing? Madam President, let us say it quite frankly. By the time they took over the European policy in 1967 they had worn out their knees crawling round the treasuries of the world with a begging bowl to get loans of any kind they could.I only just want to say this in conclusion about the European policy. When we talk about political influence, we are not talking about something which is purely a matter for ambassadors and politicians. We are talking about something which affects all our lives as well as the lives of generations to come. The influence of Britain in Europe is an influence for peace and stability in a world always liable to conflict.When we talk about the advantages for industry, then we are not talking about something remote. What we are talking about is the jobs of the men and women and those at our schools and universities today, the sorts of jobs and the number of jobs they are going to have in the future.There is no magic solution in Europe, nothing which is going to solve our problems at the stroke of a pen and nothing which will destroy British institutions or imprison us in an alien pattern of life.What the policy can offer us if we are successful is opportunity, opportunity in Europe and in the world outside.So much is at stake in this election when it comes, I would say to you who are going to play such a vital part in it that you must put a choice to people. You do it individually, not only the leaders of the Party, the Shadow Cabinet and myself, not only our members in the House of Commons, but you, the leaders, in the constituencies and every Party worker. Put this choice to them:Do they want a Labour Government pledged and committed to more and more taxation? Because what we want is a Conservative Government which will reduce it.Do they want a Labour Government pledged to ever increasing interference in industry? We want a Conservative Government which will give new opportunity to industry and to commerce.Do you want a Labour Government which cannot stand up to the trade unions? We want a Conservative Government which will bring all sections of the community under a fair rule of law.Do you want a Labour Government to tax wealth and level everybody down? We want a Conservative Government which will encourage wider ownership for all.A Labour Government which talks of compassion but tolerates poverty? Or a Conservative Government which uses prosperity to reduce hardship wherever it occurs.A Labour Government determined to force its dogmatic pattern on all the schools, or a Conservative Government concerned only to provide the best sort of education for every child.A Labour Government which gloats as it weakens Britain\u2019s defence forces? We want a Conservative Government proud to preserve Britain\u2019s honour and securityDo you want more Labour incompetence, dishonesty, now trying to cheat at the next election just as it cheated at the last? We want a Conservative Government determined to restore integrity to Parliament and to our political life.That, then, is the choice. You put it to them. Labour equality, or Conservative opportunity. Labour increasing the growing power of the State, or Conservatives seeking still larger freedom for the individual. Labour retreating from responsibility abroad, or Conservatives taking pride in what our nation can do for the world.That, Madam President, is a clear-cut choice, and I call on you at this Conference to present it to the British people at your work, in your homes, over the garden fence, in the pub, on holiday, whenever you meet your friends. Tell the people. Tell them the truth which I have given to you today and present to them the choice that lies before this country of ours when the election comes.Over the years, slowly and without always recognising it, our country grew to greatness and with that growth a change came over our people. They began to think more widely, to broaden their vision of the world outside, to value the qualities which go with true greatness: tolerance, patience, generosity of mind. Now the physical dimensions of our greatness are diminished. As this happens, so we contemplate a danger far greater than the loss of military power and of material possessions. It is the danger of losing the habit of thinking and behaving as a great people, the danger of looking inwards, the danger of being consumed with our own fears and grudges and petty grievances. It is the danger of always fearing the worst and letting pessimism sap our energy. It is the danger of sourness and envy towards our fellow citizens; the danger of suspicion towards those beyond our shores. It is this sad meanness of our spirit which I see growing at the heart of our present discontentsSo when I am asked what is the task of the Conservative Party, I would say that it is simply this: to give back to the British people that habit of thinking and acting as a great people, to give them not merely the power but the vision. As Wordsworth said, \u2018the glory and the dream.\u2019For we are a Party fitted by our traditions to draw strength from the past and by our roots in the life of our country to take advantage with courage of the opportunities of the future. The Conservative Party cannot prosper as a sectional Party, pitting one part of the community against another. It cannot thrive as an insular party, ignoring those wider interests on which our prosperity and our security depend. As a new generation comes forward we are bound firmly to reject the sectional and reject the insular. We must commit ourselves to those standards of greatness which have developed in our people over the centuries and which are our true heritage.And we - our Party - together with the people of Britain must restore once again that confidence in our own abilities and that vision of a better life which we as a Party have and which we wish to share and enjoy with them.Let us then, after this splendid Conference, all of us together set out from this hall today confident in our faith, proud of our cause.The moment for which we have so long waited we know cannot be long delayed. Let us set out knowing that when it comes to fight the battle victory will be ours - victory to serve our people and our fellow citizens once again.Then shall we be able to restore to Britain, the Britain that we love, both the glory and the dream.

aVWe are met here together today to celebrate a famous victory. None can deny us that - well, hardly anyone. At the end of such a successful Conference as you have just had, there is all the more reason for us to rejoice together. \u2018Ah, just an automatic ritual,\u2019 some say. After five years hard slog in Opposition, let me tell them that there is nothing automatic or ritualistic about it. These celebrations are the real thing.I find today that the world is divided into two groups - those who are proudly boasting that their opinion poll was at any rate within six points of where we got to, even though they said we were going to lose, and those who are still busy writing and publishing books proving in fact that we lost. So to the satisfaction of winning, which we all feel, must be added the additional satisfaction of proving so many people wrong - outside our own Party, of course.Historians will long acclaim this, not only as a famous victory, but as a triumph for the common sense of the British people. It was that which always sustained me, and it is for that reason that I was always confident of victory. To you, Chancellor of the Exchequer, for three years Chairman of the Party, I accord the thanks of the whole Party as the organiser of victory. To all my colleagues who laboured with us throughout those long years of opposition, and in particular to that most loyal, devoted and selfless Deputy Leader of the Party, Reggie Maudling - I express the deepest thanks of the Party.There is only one note of sadness which dims the lustre of this occasion. Today, Chancellor of the Exchequer, you sit in the chair where Iain Macleod as President of the National Union would have sat but for his sudden and untimely death. Nowhere in our Party, and least of all in a Party Conference, will we ever underestimate or allow to be forgotten the contribution which Iain Macleod made to the affairs of our Party and of the nation. Our sadness today is lightened by the memory of what he achieved through his life and work.All too many kind things have been said during this week about myself - not that they are any less agreeable at this stage for that - and you have added to them today. This makes me very happy. But, members of the Conservative Party, the victory was yours. It is your victory and it is one on which I congratulate you from the bottom of my heart. Throughout the years of opposition, despite the stresses and strains, inside as well as without, the Party kept its balance. It maintained its direction; it held to its purpose. It regained the confidence of the nation; and today it provides the Government of the country. And it is as head of that Government that I speak to the nation here today.We have been summoned to the service of the nation - a nation seeking fresh outlets for its energies, a nation looking for new opportunities for its people: more encouragement, greater reward for its activities, happier conditions for the community at large. In sum, a nation wanting to embark on a new course towards that better tomorrow which we all seek. We pointed the way in the election campaign, although some saw it only dimly and others refused to look at all. We were returned to office to change the course of history of this nation - nothing less. It is this course, the new course, which the Government - your Government - is now shaping.We have found in government, as I warned the country we would, that at every turn we fine limitations - limitations imposed on the nation in part by past events and in part by the failures of our predecessors: limitations of the economy, of heavy international indebtedness, of enormous and increasing public expenditure, of a high and damaging level of taxation: limitations of outmoded industrial relations and increasing losses through strikes: limitations of wildly excessive wage demands encouraged deliberately by the last Administration for its own political purposes: limitations of a stagnant economy and roaring inflation. And overseas we face the limitations of the broken pledges of the last six years and, above all, of defeatist attitudes after continuing retreat.We have found, as we expected, that our room for manoeuvre is limited. But what that means is this: that we must create that room to manoeuvre for ourselves. That is what the Government is now doing. It means in every sphere taking fully considered decisions, making in each case a deliberate choice. My concern as head of the Government is that we should have available the best means of reaching those decisions and that the country should understand clearly the reasons for the choices which we make.Already overseas we have made a start - a start in gaining freedom of manoeuvre for British diplomacy and a start in showing how effective it can still be. In the Far East, Lord Carrington, the Secretary of State for Defence, working ably and quietly, has reached agreement with the other four Commonwealth countries - Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia and Singapore - on the five Power arrangement which we proposed in Opposition, an arrangement to help maintain peace, stability and prosperity in that all-important area. Our contribution will be limited - far smaller than at present and at modest cost. Many will be surprised how successful we have been. The critics will be routed, and full tribute should go to the Secretary of State for Defence for his work. When this arrangement is completed, I believe it will be overwhelmingly accepted both in this country and in South-East Asia. It will become a major part of our diplomatic influence in the Far East.We are now engaged in working out how best to contribute to the stability of the Gulf. In Europe we have begun negotiations for entry into the European Economic Community. I doubt whether many people realise how great a burden it imposed on the Government in its first few days of existence to review the negotiating position and to send you, Mr. Chairman, to Brussels to begin those negotiations. But we were determined that there should be no delay whatever in the timetable arranged by our predecessors with the Community for the start of those negotiations. We were determined and we succeeded in carrying through the start of them. For it remains our conviction that if we can negotiate the right terms it will be in the long term interests of Britain and of the British people to join the European Economic Community - and not only in the interests of Britain, but in the interests of Europe also; not only in the interests of Europe, but I believe in the long term interests of the Commonwealth.As so many of you know, I have always upheld the value of the Commonwealth as an influence for good in world affairs. We have shown that we gladly listen to the views of its members and take account of them. But the Commonwealth can only thrive - and of this I am absolutely convinced - if all its members realise that Britain, like themselves, enjoys full independence of action. Whatever arguments we in Britain may have here amongst ourselves, British policy is, and is going to remain, a matter for decision by the British Government.As our freedom of manoeuvre as a country increases, we shall be able more and more to play a major part in seizing the opportunities which events open up for us. It may well be that in four great areas of the world we are at the beginning of a period where these opportunities will prove to be greater than they have been for many years. In South-East Asia, as the policies of the United States to withdraw from Vietnam develop - and the President\u2019s initiative is welcome and ought to be fully supported - there may be a chance to establish a new pattern of stability and cooperation in that area. Both our interests as a country and our experience in that part of the world will fit us to go on playing a role there. In the Middle East, Britain now has an opportunity, as the violent emotions of the past are stilled, to put our relations with the Arab world on to a new and more realistic basis - an opportunity to contribute to peace and security for all the States in that area.In Africa it is our duty as well as our interest to work, as Conservative Governments have done before, to avoid physical conflicts between peoples of different races. Other solutions, requiring no doubt long and patient negotiation, must be found to the differences which exist between the races. The outcome of strife can only be suffering for all. There again, we, the British, are well equipped to help to find a solution to these differences and to resolve them peaceably.In our Continent the agreements so far reached between Western Germany and the Soviet Union may present the opportunity now of resolving other differences between East and West. So long as the Soviet Union recognises the need for Western security, we, this Government, will be active and indeed enthusiastic in working with our allies towards a settlement of the long outstanding European problems.This Government is now moving into a new era of British diplomacy. How effective our leadership can be has already been shown in the way we handled the affairs of the hostages and the Jordan war. We have so much to contribute from our experience in diplomacy and, above all, in being so fortunate and indeed proud as to have a Foreign Secretary so greatly experienced and widely respected as Sir Alec Douglas-Home. We are leaving behind the years of retreat. We are determined to establish the reputation of Britain once again, a reputation as the firm defender of her own interests and the skilful and persistent partner of all those who are working for a lasting peace.We are shaping a new course in our affairs at home. We have created what we promised, a new style of government. For the first time you have had the opportunity at this Conference - a very successful Conference - to see something of how the new style is being carried out. If I sense aright, you rather like the new style as you see it here in Blackpool and you have liked the Ministers who have exemplified the new style. Let me make one reservation, it is not going to continue exactly as it has been here. I do not propose that the Scottish President of the Board of Trade should always answer English local government debates! But you have welcomed the Ministers, and I am grateful to you for that, grateful for the support which you have given my colleagues and for the way in which you have endorsed what they have had to say to you.Of course, it is not just a matter of style, it is a matter of doing the right things at the right time. I know that here, too, I can count on you to endorse what has already been achieved, because already in the first six weeks of our Government we implemented the pledges we had given to you and to the country. We restored freedom to local authorities to decide their own form of educational arrangements - no more compulsory comprehensives. We restored freedom to local councils to sell council houses and to tenants freedom to buy them. We are abolishing the Land Commission and have taken the necessary steps. We have introduced the Bill to give pensions to persons over 80 who, through no fault of their own, so far have none. In addition, Robert Carr, quietly and firmly, handled the dock dispute and received full praise for it.The Home Secretary backed the reforms of the Northern Ireland Government, and in the very first days we met the need for more troops to help control the situation there. Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom and will remain so for as long as its people wish. That constitutional position must be maintained. Every support will be given to those who are carrying through the present programme of reforms. In these circumstances, there can be no justification for the differences which exist in society in Northern Ireland today being allowed to break out into open conflict, demanding the presence there of many thousands of British troops, many more than there could be such justification in Lancashire or Yorkshire, Scotland or Wales. We believe that we stand for moderation and toleration. It is these virtues which must now re-assert themselves in Northern Ireland. It is these qualities which must speedily bring to an end this ugly chapter in the history of Northern Ireland.While the Government were handling successfully as heavy a load as any in recent history we put in hand in rest of the preparations necessary for us to pursue. Then we went on holiday, to be back on 1st September. A holiday - what an extraordinary idea! People\u2019s hands were lifted in horror and some of those who had already been away were loudest in their shrill shrieks. Of course, if I had gone and sat on an island somewhere, out of the way, and just watched the boats pass by, that would have been unexceptional, perhaps even commendable; but because I got on a boat and sailed past the islands\u2026 (Laughter and applause)Now the nation is seeing, and will see more and more in the next few weeks, the fruits of our labours. Last Monday, details were published in full of our industrial reforms - a brilliant piece of work by Robert Carr and those who have been working with him. \u2018Will they ever do it?\u2019 the sceptics asked. Now they know. It is \u2018Fair Deal at Work\u2019 and more - consultations, the Bill before Christmas and the Act on the Statute Book this Session.Last Tuesday, provision was taken to expand our agricultural production and save on our imports. That you received here well, if I may say so. Indeed, it is becoming a dangerous situation when, for the first time in living memory, a Minister of Agriculture receives a standing ovation at a Party Conference.I shall shortly be announcing the reconstruction of the Whitehall Departments. This will be of major importance and wide-ranging. My object is to produce as far as possible a rational structure of Government which will enable us to streamline the Departments and reduce the demands which are made on money and manpower. My objective is also to produce a better way of taking decisions and to provide the Cabinet with the means for doing so. I hope that this reconstruction when it is achieved will provide Whitehall with a period of stability which it badly needs. I hope it will provide a structure which will be effective and which will last for many years to come.After the House resumes, as you know, the Chancellor of the Exchequer will announce his proposals for dealing with Government expenditure. These are the consequence of the first review of functions being carried out by the Government. I would like to make this point to you: what we have been doing is something entirely different from the previous exercise in making sudden and arbitrary cuts in Government expenditure. This is the redirection of Government expenditure, the withdrawal of some Government functions and a change of priority in others, leading in all to a better and more justifiable use of public money.The Chancellor of the Exchequer has made plain that whatever cuts are made in Government expenditure, however unpleasant they may be, are the full collective responsibility of all his colleagues in the Government and he has indicated to you that should there at any future date be any reductions in taxation they should be accredited fully to the benefit of the Chancellor himself.On top of this will come the announcement of the details of our policy in connection with this redistribution of public expenditure - our policy on housing, on education, on social security and on the relief of poverty. We shall announce our proposals on defence.These, then will be the first fruits of our first few months in office. They are of major consequence, but I repeat that this is but the first stage to create room for us to manoeuvre as we move on to our new course. To follow this, I have now asked each Minister to organise an examination of every function carried out in his department, to examine personally the consequences, and then to recommend whether it is essential for each of these functions to continue. The purpose of my request is to ensure that Government withdraws from all those activities no longer necessary either because of the passage of time or because they are better done outside government, or because they should rightly he carried on, if wanted at all, by individual or by voluntary effort.You will see that our strategy is clear. It is to reorganise the functions of Government, to leave more to individual or to corporate effort, to make savings in Government expenditure, to provide room for greater incentives to men and women and to firms and businesses. Our strategy is to encourage them more and more to take their own decisions, to stand on their own feet, to accept responsibility for themselves and for their families.Our purpose is to bring our fellow citizens to recognise that they must be responsible for the consequences of their own actions and to learn that no one will stand between them and the results of their own free choice. Until this is made clear up and down the country, not only will men and women themselves, but their fellow citizens in the community as well, suffer from the feckless behaviour of irresponsible groups within our community.This strategy I have outlined will lead to an expanding economy which will enable the standard of living of all our people to rise. It will lead to the improvement - a genuine improvement - in the social services for the community as a whole. It will provide a sound economic basis for our defence abroad and it will enable us to maintain our aid to the developing world. This strategy is necessary to be able to defeat inflation, the menace of rising prices at home, so damaging to exports overseas and to our position in the world outside. No one can deny that today the major cause of the inflation from which we are suffering is the excessive wage demands, not only those which have been made but those which have been met. We have said that in the public sector we have a particular responsibility. It is the responsibility of an employer, direct or indirect. But it is also a responsibility to you, the taxpayer and the ratepayer, because when the Government are called upon to provide resources necessary, then they can only provide them from what is taken from you in rates and taxes.We do not expect any discrimination between the public and the private sectors. We shall act as responsible employers and we expect others, the private employers, to do the same. But this we have also made clear: if they go their own way and accede to irresponsible wage demands which damage their own firms and create a loss of jobs for those who work in them, then the Government are certainly not going to step in and rescue them from the consequences of their own actions.Now I call the Party to a fresh task. We are setting out on this new course. It is your task and it is this I ask of you at the end of this Conference - to help to move the country along that course with us. No longer is it the task of the Party just to criticise our opponents. This Conference has been notably free of such criticisms - not because there is not ample room for it but because all that our opponents are saying is so obviously irrelevant to the problems with which we are dealing now in the 1970s.The task of the Party is no longer that of just explaining the policies we would follow if we were returned to power, however well you have done that in the years of opposition.The task of the Party is no longer just that of keeping us, the leaders, up to the mark.Now is the time for the positive and constructive work which goes with office and responsibility. As we, the Government, swing into action, so the Party in the country must become the spearhead of the movement to change the attitude of the people of Britain, to explain the choices before us, to back the Government\u2019s decisions.Let the people see for themselves up and down the land what Conservatives stand for, what Conservatives are like, what they do when they are given responsibility. I look to you to do that now, from this day on, when you go back to your constituencies. And when you do wholeheartedly, then we shall achieve as a Party what we failed to do in 13 years of power. We shall have won the hearts and the minds of our people, and we shall permanently change the outlook of the British nation.When I arrived at No. 10 four months ago I said - and I said what I meant \u2013 \u2018To govern is to serve.\u2019 And the single most important service that I believe this Government can perform for the British people is to restore to them more and more freedom.But to do this the Government must first free itself. I talked earlier of room to manoeuvre, and I have spoken of the kind of government we mean to have. The question now that we are in office is not what kind of government, but how much government. The answer, with which I know you agree, is that there must be less government, and of a better quality.It will not happen overnight. Maybe there will be no day that you can mark on the calendar and say, \u2018That was Freedom Day.\u2019 It is a continuing process which will happen by degrees. But it is going to happen in every aspect of our daily life. It will not always be obvious; gradually it will become apparent.And I ask you and the nation to get used to this idea of change, because it is going to be the pattern of this Government, and I urge you and the nation not to fear the danger but to recognise the opportunity, the opportunity to meet the challenge that change represents.We in the Government have already accepted the challenge, and I warn the nation that there is no alternative. To stand still today is to go backwards. To cling desperately to the present will be to find ourselves embracing only the past.Change will give us freedom, and with freedom most go responsibility. The free society which we aim to create must also be the responsible society - free from intervention, free from interference, but responsible: free to make your own decisions, but responsible also for your mistakes; free to enjoy the rewards of enterprise, but responsible for making sure that those rewards are justly and fairly earned; free to create for yourselves and your families that better tomorrow which we all want, but responsible for those who, through no fault of their own, cannot create it for themselves; free to lead a life of your own, but responsible to the community as a whole.This then is the task to which your Government is dedicated: to give to all our people both freedom and responsibility. That is the challenge and from it will come opportunity. Opportunity to take our destiny, the destiny of the nation, once again in our own hands. If we are to achieve this task we will have to embark on a change so radical, a revolution so quiet and yet so total, that it will go far beyond the programme for a Parliament to which we are committed and on which we have already embarked; far beyond this decade and way into the 1980s. For it is the task of building something of style, of substance, and worth; something so important to the life and the future of this country of ours. We can only hope to begin now what future Conservative Governments will continue and complete. We are laying the foundations, but they are the foundations for a generation.That is our aim, and that is the context in which we are working. It is a task that will take all our efforts and all of yours, every member of our party up and down the country; the efforts of every citizen of the nation. But it is a task worthy of all of us. It will require open minds, it will require great courage; but it will provide opportunities for this generation that few generations have ever seen. It is a task that calls for all of us to do all that lies in our power. It is a cause that this Government - your Government, the Government of the nation - is proud to serve.

aVA year ago, Mr. Chairman, I spoke about a quiet revolution. I said that it would change the way we lived. It would change the way we looked at ourselves and the way the world looked at us. I did not use those words lightly. I felt then, as I had long felt, that an era in our history and the world\u2019s history was coming to an end. The post-war years were over and with them went all that they meant in terms of trying to make ends meet, holding on, managing today and letting tomorrow take care of itself.We were now living in a new world. If we wanted to take a place in that new world we must understand that new world, and before we could hope to understand it we must understand ourselves. It was a time to take stock - and taking stock is not always easy. Sometimes history marks the turning points for us. In our recent history two world wars have done just that. After each of them we knew that nothing could ever be the same again. But this turning point was nothing like so well defined. It was a turning point not so much of events as of attitudes. Wars force change upon us. For good or ill, they create their own social revolutions. What faced us was the historic need for change without the impetus to change. This time, the shaping of the future, the decision, was in our own hands.But did we know, as a nation, what we wanted our future to be? Were we not dangerously content to let things take their course, avoiding a decision, confident that everything in the end would turn out for the best? Were we not in great danger of losing our way in a changing world - a world that would go on changing whatever we did? These were the questions that concerned us more and more while we were in opposition. This was the task we felt we had been given in June of last year - to find for this country a new way in this new world.The prospect was daunting but it was not depressing. The task we were given was the most challenging any peace-time government in this country has faced. What kind of a country did we want to be, not just tomorrow but a generation from now, two generations from now? No question demands a clearer answer. No question should command a higher priority from any government. We believe that we are finding that answer. The people of this country have a right to expect their elected government to do so, but equally that government has the right to ask the people to help in putting that answer into practice. A government must have the vision to look ahead, the intuition to point a path, the courage to lead the way. It must fulfil all those needs.But the people of that country must care enough about their country to play their own part, to share in those tasks, to realise that a country - this country - stands for nothing unless every one of us individually stands for something in which we firmly believe - to work and to care, to prosper and to share, and to do it all as one nation. That has always been our goal and it always will be our goal.It was a year ago that we started out together on a journey into the future. We have made good speed. We have come a long way - a lot further than many people dared to hope just 12 short months ago. But there is a long way still ahead of us. We have so far to catch up.Twenty five years ago much of Western Europe lay literally in ruins. Economic and industrial life had come to a standstill. For us here in Britain it was different. We were bruised, we were exhausted, but our economy and our industry remained intact. In Europe they were able again to start from scratch but we had to make do and mend. So it was not surprising when those countries, starting from scratch, first matched and then, in unity, overtook Britain in economic performance and industrial effort. A new world was already emerging; and it is to the credit of our Party that from an early stage we recognised that fact. Later we tried to join the united and prospering efforts of the major countries of Western Europe, but then Britain was foiled in the attempt by the veto of President de Gaulle. We tried to build the firm foundations for a modern, industrial society based on faster expansion and higher real wages and better living standards.But after 13 years of very considerable achievement Britain was foiled again, this time by the sheer unmitigated disaster of six years of Socialist government. I do not propose to dwell at any length on the follies and mismanagement for which they were responsible. Indeed, I must be careful not to accuse the last Labour Government of actually knowing what was going on while they were in office. I might be called\u2026, and then they would ask for time to formulate their defence and to find out what really was going on while they were there. I shall not deal at any length with the present sorry state of the Labour Party, nor do I propose to reply in kind to the shrill attacks against my colleagues and myself. I would simply make one comment on the events which occurred last week in this hall. In my political lifetime I do not recall any party conference in which a party making claim to govern this country showed so conclusively that that claim was false. Day by day the lessons learned in office were abandoned as inconvenient memories. Day by day the Labour Party set off in hot pursuit of the irresponsible and the unreal. The impression left in the minds of sensible people was deep and will, I believe, endure. At the end of their period of office they left such a record of rising prices, high unemployment and slow growth that it is taking all the energies of this Government, indeed of the whole nation, to reverse that process. These are energies diverted from the great purpose of creating a lasting and enduring base for national prosperity.Everyone agrees, of course, that the level of unemployment is too high - far too high. No responsible person in public life today can fail to be moved by the sight of people out of work week after week, the waste of energy and talent, the hardship and the dismay. In the situation of rising prices and rising unemployment with which we were faced on coming into office we continue to do everything we can to help. In the past few months alone we have made available nearly £500 million for new projects intended especially for the areas which are hardest hit. Others may seek to exploit the national concern about those without work to make party slogans. But this Government demonstrates its concern by positive action. This Government has already done more than any before to get the economy moving again and to reduce unemployment. This Government is committed completely and absolutely to expanding the economy and to bringing unemployment down. Industry has shown that it, too, will make its contribution by restraining price increases. The Government and the nationalised industries are doing the same. Now it only needs moderation and responsibility on the part of the unions when presenting their next round of claims for us together to complete a victory over inflation and unemployment. It is a unique opportunity. I say this to the unions and to their members: higher real wages are there for the asking - higher real wages. It is for you in the unions to decide. If you continue to demand increases in money wages far in excess of anything that can be earned from production, you will continue to price yourselves and others out of the market.We stand now on the threshold of a period of growth and prosperity unparalleled since the war. We have the chance to beat the rest of the world at their own game - high production, low prices and high wages. Now it is up to all of us - management, men and Government together - to seize this opportunity. We must deal, of course, with the immediate economic problems and particularly that of unemployment. But we must do so in the context of the future. We are not going to be accused of neglecting the future in order only to remedy the present; for that way, we know, lies frustration, and we have had enough frustration over the past generation or more.Of course, people come to terms with it. For the past 25 years we have learned to live with our tax system. Socialist Governments have put on more taxes, and Conservative Governments have taken them off - a law of nature which I do not propose to alter.But for too long we have all known that, whatever the level of taxation, the system itself had come to mean discouragement and frustration. You do not have to be an expert in taxation - just an amateur in paying it - to realise that the whole system needed root and branch reform. Now, thanks to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, this has been introduced, and he deserves full credit for it. When 18 months are past we shall have a simple system of personal tax, a fairer system of company tax, and a single form of tax on spending. That is an achievement of which to be proud.But while the British people have been frustrated, so has British industry; and we have learned to live with this, too. We have gone on for too long in the same old way: too much of the same techniques of management, too much of the old skills, and, above all, an outmoded system of industrial relations. Well, thanks to the admirable work of Robert Carr and his colleagues, that field, too, has been put right.Today we are seeing the cost of going on too long with the old ways in the present loss of jobs, high cost inflation, high unemployment. But you do not solve these problems by refusing to face them, by taking the easy way of subsidy, and still more subsidy, of Government intervention, and still more Government intervention. The way to solve them is to do our utmost to create a better structure of industry, a better living environment, which will then bring real jobs for our people - lasting jobs - which is what they want.The way to overcome the frustration of old is to show a better way. What we are doing is, once again, to give people a choice and a chance.Of course, it is always hard to be a Government of change in this way. But change there must be, because postponing change, still more postponing it at this late hour, means facing far greater changes at a time which will not be of our choosing. Now is the time to give our people the chance to become strong in world markets, the chance to find and keep jobs which are based on expanding markets. So let us make use of the action we are taking - the urgent action which we have taken - to tackle prices and jobs as the springboard for greater responsibility in management and unions in order to produce still greater economic strength.In the field of the social services, schools, housing, social benefits, we also face a massive need for change. Once again there is the legacy with which we have to deal - the legacy of the housing programme which we found going down instead of up; the legacy of welfare policies which were not even maintaining the advances of the past, let alone moving forward to meet the needs of the future; the legacy of education policies which were simply not giving a fair start to many children; and health policies which were denying decent care to so many of the old and the mentally sick.But, once again, we have to look not just to the immediate needs, but beyond them to the whole framework of policy and the whole pattern of social and economic change.We look back to the mid-forties - to the Butler Education Act, to the Beveridge Report on Social Security, and to the work of successive Governments during and after the war which led to the creation of the Health Service and the present national insurance scheme. We look back that far. But in housing the roots of today\u2019s policies lie still deeper in the twenties and thirties. The Britain of today is separated from the Britain in which these frameworks were laid down not just by a quarter of a century or more; it is separated by the growth of mass prosperity on a scale which few in those days would have believed possible. It is separated by the unprecedented enlargement of home ownership, of educational attainment of economic opportunity and of social mobility. It is separated now by a revolution of attitudes and of expectations.As our policies generate more rapid economic progress, so further change will come and new demands will arise. All this on its own would dictate the need for radical review. And there is another reason perhaps more compelling. It is simply this: that, in the general advance, there are many who have got left behind, many problems which the old policies have failed to meet in the past, and which they are manifestly incapable of solving now. Too many of the retired, the chronically sick, the disabled, and the very low paid stand out against the background of increased prosperity; too many of the old and the mentally ill stand out against a general background of better provision for health; too many slums, too much homelessness, stand out against the background of modern housing and wider home ownership.These are things which cannot be tolerated in the Britain of the l970s. This Conservative Government are determined to bring them to an end. We have been determined, first, as a matter of urgency, to see that those who have been neglected get the extra help they need. We have made a record increase in national insurance pensions and major improvements in the position of public service and armed forces pensioners. The over-80s now have the State pension which the last Administration so persistently denied them. We are making new help available to many younger widows, as well as to the long term sick and disabled. We are tackling the problem of family poverty with wider exemptions from charges, with bigger tax allowances for children, and with the new Family Income Supplement.Secondly, we have been determined to get the priorities right. We have changed the priorities of education policy, because we believe it is more important to see that every child goes to a decent primary school than to provide subsidies regardless of whether they are needed or not. We have asked people to pay more for prescriptions, because it has helped us to spend more in clearing up old hospitals and bringing better standards of care to the old and the mentally ill. We are determined, thirdly, to shape for the future social policies which fit the long term needs of an increasingly prosperous and responsible society.This is the setting for our proposals for reform in the administration of the Health Service. This is why we attach so much importance to our new policy for pensions - a policy which over the years will see that every one can enjoy a pension related to his earnings, on top of the basic State provision.This is the reason for the legislation we shall soon be bringing forward to reform the housing subsidies, so that for the first time the system will put its full weight behind helping those who need help, clearing the backlog of slums and decay.Just as in our economic and industrial affairs we seek not only new policies but new attitudes, so also we need new attitudes to our social problems. Above all, we recognise that, unless we are prepared to take on more of the responsibilities for the things we can do for ourselves, then the State itself will never be able to do properly the jobs which genuinely demand community action - community action in building and improving our schools and hospitals and universities, community action on behalf of us all to help those who are in real need. This is the only way in which we can carry our social concern into effective action.I am sure that it was right that the National Union found time for an emergency debate on Northern Ireland. It was right that you in the Conference should have the opportunity of expressing your views and that the Home Secretary, who has the immense burden of handling these matters, should have the chance to explain our policies. It is a subject on which in recent months we have spent many anxious, indeed many anguished, hours.There have been moments, I must admit to you, when it seemed that violence and the rhetoric of violence filled the whole scene, when the clamour seemed so great that there was small hope that the voice of reason would find a hearing. But we have persevered. On Thursday the Home Secretary set out our aims and the means by which we are determined to achieve them.Let me again make it quite clear, as the Home Secretary did, that there is an essential link between the political initiatives which we are taking and our measures to improve security and to smash the gunmen.The truth is that neither one of these policies can succeed without the other. We cannot achieve a prosperous, harmonious and contented society in Northern Ireland until the minority as well as the majority feel that they have a permanent and guaranteed share in public affairs. But we cannot achieve a political settlement so long as the gunmen are still there, because the gunmen are interested in no solution except one imposed by murder and achieved through chaos.It is right for me to warn the nation that the effort required of all of us in Northern Ireland is going to be strenuous and determined. There are no quick and easy answers. Those who claim that there are show that they do not understand the real nature of the problem. But neither do I agree with those whose only reaction to present events in Ireland is one of despair. Working on this problem since June of last year, I have come to realise the strength of the underlying forces which favour those who are working for peace.We are fortunate in that the Prime Ministers of both Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic are men of proved resource, of moderation and of goodwill. We are fortunate in the patience of the long-suffering people of both communities in Northern Ireland, whose steadfastness we have all learned to admire, who have refused to be provoked by the gunmen into communal strife.We are fortunate in that this country has at its disposal in the services of the Crown armed forces and police forces of a quality unmatched in the rest of the world. No one can have failed to be moved by the restraint and the sheer courage which they have shown. As Prime Minister of this country I thank them today for what they are doing. And to my thanks I add an assurance which is perhaps the best thanks of all. I assure them and the people of Northern Ireland that we are going to see this through. We are going to see it through because to do otherwise would be an abdication of everything for which we stand.On this side of the Irish Sea, I believe that people now see more clearly the underlying reasons for the effort which we are called upon to make. They understand that we are making it because Northern Ireland is, by the wish of the majority of its inhabitants, part of the United Kingdom.They realise that if our troops were withdrawn and our efforts were relaxed, we would be condemning not only Northern Ireland but the whole of Ireland to civil war and slaughter on a scale far beyond anything we have seen elsewhere in recent years.I and the Home Secretary have urged all those in Northern Ireland who wish for a peaceful answer to come forward and join with us in discussing how that answer can be achieved. I repeat that appeal today. Progress cannot be held up. There are many who are already carrying on these discussions and who wish to work out the answer.I add also a warning to those who are interested only in violence, to the bombers and the gunmen. The history of Ireland contains the record of many mistakes and many miscalculations by both English and Irish alike. But if the gunmen believe that they can bully this Government or this people into abandoning the effort which we have undertaken, then that is the greatest miscalculation of all.This Conference will long be remembered for one decisive vote. You have decided overwhelmingly to accept the Government\u2019s recommendation, now that the terms are known, that Britain should become a member of the European Community.Just ten years ago I came straight from making the opening statement in Paris at the beginning of the first negotiations, to this Conference where I received your endorsement. I came, of course, as Lord Privy Seal, not as Edward Heath as I now am.You can imagine with what admiration I have followed Geoffrey Rippon in the skill and determination with which he has handled the negotiations. And with what happiness I greeted the result last Wednesday.But our energies in this last year have been by no means confined to Europe.Since we last met your Conservative Government have consistently followed policies which Sir Alec Douglas-Home outlined to you last year - policies of steadily protecting and advancing the interests of this country across the world.We protected our interests during the Commonwealth Conference at Singapore last January. We protected our interests in the joint arrangements which Lord Carrington negotiated for co-operation with our friends in the defence of Singapore and Malaysia. We protected our interests in Geoffrey Rippon\u2019s negotiations with the Governments of the Six. And we have protected our interests in the measures which we have recently taken against those who have sought to undermine the security of our country by acts of espionage.As a result, we can now record with quiet satisfaction that there has been a real change in the standing of Britain among the nations of the world. We are now once again regarded as a country whose judgment can be trusted and whose promises can be relied on.But let us be clear about the principles which have guided us in these policies. We have no desire to lecture others or to assert ourselves in the world for selfish reasons. We have no desire to make a crude and empty clamour on the stage of world affairs. Our policies are based on a sober, modern and realistic assessment of Britain\u2019s place in the world today.It is in that spirit that I want to speak this morning of the changes which, even as we sit here, are altering the shape of the world as it has been familiar to us for the last 25 years. If we look at that history, one salient fact immediately confronts us. Throughout that period, we and other countries of Western Europe have survived and prospered to a large extent thanks to the help and protection of the United States. Never in modern times has a great Power used its energy and its generosity with such effect to protect the interests of its friends. Everyone in this hall and in our Party would pay tribute to the statesmanship which successive American Administrations have shown.Some of us, however, have for many years foreseen that this was not a state of affairs which could for ever be expected to endure. We have urged the countries of Europe to bestir themselves so as to secure their own defence and their own prosperity, because the time would come when this burden would not be carried in the same way by others on their behalf.I must tell you today that the change which I and others foresaw is now coming upon us. The United States, faced with deep-seated problems at home and abroad, is working - while in contact with its allies - towards direct arrangements with the Soviet Union and with Communist China.Even more important, the United States is acting drastically to protect its own balance of payments and its own trading position against the erosions which they have suffered. Everyone concerned with trade and finance knows that rough winds are beginning to blow across the world. It is in the interests of this country that trade should be as free and unrestricted as possible. We must do our utmost to prevent the development of a protectionist trade war. That is our interest, and that is the aim which every British Government should pursue.With this aim in mind, we must consider today how British interests in this field can best be protected and advanced. I must tell you plainly that if in this changed world we were going to be forced to stand alone, then the prospects for the jobs and the livelihood of our people would be bleak indeed. We all know that decisions on world trade and world finance are not academic for the people of this country. These decisions vitally affect the well-being and the prosperity, the jobs and livelihood, of everyone in these islands.If we were to condemn ourselves to isolation, then we would find that these decisions in world trade and monetary affairs, affecting us so closely, were taken not by ourselves but by others in the world wielding greater economic power - by the United States, by the European Community and by Japan. But fortunately we are not so condemned. Fortunately, this change in world affairs has come upon us at exactly the time when we have the opportunity to associate ourselves with the other countries of the European Community in full membership, and by associating ourselves now we can work together to protect effectively our own interests and theirs in a way which would not be possible were we to remain alone.It is not by luck that this opportunity has come about. It has been created through the foresight and the statesmanship of those who have preceded me as Leaders of this Party and of this country. It was Mr. Churchill who, 25 years ago, proclaimed in Zurich the need for a Europe growing together in unity. It was Mr. Macmillan who put in hand our first application to join the Community. And it is your Government, elected in June last year, which has finally carried these negotiations through to decisive success.The day of need which Sir Winston Churchill and Harold Macmillan so clearly perceived is now upon us. No longer are the problems which they foresaw lodged safely in some distant future. They are upon us now, urgent but not insoluble. They can be tackled and solved precisely because of the courage and loyalty of our Party in supporting our European policy with such consistency over the last ten years. Now that the need is upon us, we are prepared for it. We can join with others in Europe and exert ourselves to work out the Common European policies which will assure the future of every one of us: policies governing our dealings with the rest of the world, our trade, our finance and eventually our defence. That is what statesmanship means, not shifting from one belief to another as a result of some dubious calculation of brief political advantage, not looking simply to the headlines of next week or next month.Our duty as a Conservative Government is to look to the future and to the lives of future generations. This is the habit which your Government has inherited from its Conservative predecessors, this is the task which we are wholly determined to carry through.I have been speaking to you of a new world. That is no vision of the future, it is happening out there for all to see, it is there in the new patterns of power; in the sight of China, the awakened giant, taking up its role in the world; in the sight of America and the Soviet Union looking for a new place to stand. It is there in the sound of the new voices of new nations, some of them voices of violence, all of them questioning the practices of the past. This new world is a place of contrasts, dynamic and dangerous, a place of great risks but of even greater rewards - an exciting world to be part of. In such a world, history has reserved a place for us. At times of greatest stress, when the balance of history was shifting, there has always been a special place for us because we have a special kind of strength. Our strength is not just figures on a balance sheet, although we have those too; our strength is not just courage in adversity, although we have shown that time and time again. Our special strength lies in our sense of history, of knowing the right time to do the right thing.Our special strength is our stamina, in going on with what needs doing until it is done, in running a race as long as that race has to be run. We never know when we are beaten and that way we never are beaten. We know no other way than to win. This new world needs wisdom, judgment and above all stamina. These qualities have always been ours, they have been needed many times in the past. I doubt if the world has ever needed them more than it needs them today. They are qualities that can be given but cannot be bought and no country has more of them to give than our own. Do you suppose it is just a coincidence that today - for the first time in a long time - Britain\u2019s voice is being heard in the world again, not as a plaintive whisper in the corridors of power but as a voice that speaks what it knows and knows what is has learned from history? That is why Europe needs us. We speak our mind. We have something to say, and once more when we give our word the world believes us. Today that new world looks at us with new eyes. And there are plenty of new things for it to see and envy. It sees a country that is doing more to protect its weak and sick, doing more to reward effort with incentive, more to safeguard its environment and therefore its future.In the quiet revolution these things mark the first silent steps. They need to be big strides to keep pace with the way the world is moving. In this same year our revolution has been paralleled by a global evolution - much of it predictable and all of it, many would say, inevitable. Despite all this change, perhaps because of it, this new world needs us as never before. It believes in us, but the important question is this: do we believe sufficiently in ourselves? Are we confident enough in what we can achieve?There can be only one answer to us here in this Conference, to our party and, I believe, to the country - we can be, we must be. For too long we have walked in the shadows. It is time for us now to walk out into the light to find a new place, a new Britain in this new world. That is the choice that history offers us today. It is the kind of chance that only comes, if it ever comes, once in a lifetime. Let history record that when we were shown the way we took the way and walked out to meet our destiny. (Prolonged applause)

aVIt is just 25 years, Dame Peggy, since I attended my first Party Conference, and I have been at every one since. There may well be some in this hall today with a longer record than that. But no one else, as I understand it at any rate, has been present for the last eight years as Leader of the Party, or for the last three as Conservative Prime Minister.Every Conference has its own character stamped upon it; and so it has been with this one. This Conference has been a triumph for moderation, for decency and for good sense; and we all recognise how great a part the younger members of our Party have played in it. It has been a triumph not confined to this hall. It has been achieved with the whole world watching. The media, with their microphones and cameras \u2013 not forgetting their pencils and notebooks - have seen to it that the world outside this hall has watched a Party that knows its own mind is prepared to speak its own mind. What you have said has clearly matched the national mood.You are here representing every part of the country and every aspect of our national life. In your debates and by your votes you have decisively shown that moderation, clearly expounded and firmly pursued, meets the need of the nation.We have shown this week that we reject the equivocations so prevalent in this hall last week - the equivocations of those trying to make us believe that any problem can be solved just by facing both ways. Equally we reject those who react to one extreme by rushing to another, seeking to persuade us that in this way quick and easy answers can be found to hard and complicated problems. We are not a nation of extremists. We are a nation that believes in firmness and fairness; and this week we in this hall have shown that this is where we as a party also stand.The people of this country want a fair society. The Conservative Government is in process of creating just that. We are seeking to create it in the talks that we started with the employers and trade unions about curbing inflation \u2013 talks that will continue next Monday at Chequers. Throughout this Parliament we have been continuously engaged in the battle against inflation. Let no one say that we have not fought, and fought hard. When we have had setbacks, as we have, they have not been for the lack of will in trying to overcome them. We have not always been helped by those who in the past year have constantly made our small majority in Parliament still smaller and led others outside to believe, wrongly, that we could be toppled. But I would like to express my gratitude to all my colleagues in the Cabinet and in the Government for the firm support which they have given in the fight against inflation. It is to all our regrets that Reggie Maudling should not be on this platform with us this morning.At all times we have sought co-operation with those concerned in the country\u2019s economic organisation. It was through no fault of ours that sometimes events led to confrontation. We were returned to office with a clear mandate from the electorate - a mandate to reform the law on industrial relations, to reform the system of housing finance, to reform the social services, to reform the tax system and to reduce taxation. That was a clear mandate to enable the weak to be protected, the poor to be helped and others to be encouraged to expand the wealth of the nation. All of this mandate has been carried out. Yes \u2013 and we were given a mandate to reduce inflation. That we knew had to include bringing down inflationary wage settlements throughout the economy to something much more in line with production. We have been given all too little credit for the success we achieved.Over a wide area of the economy there was co-operation. But in parts there was alsoconfrontation. And so it was that Government, management and unions first met to discuss conciliation. As a result new machinery has been created by the employers and the unions. But that is not enough. We have now, therefore, jointly embarked for the first time in Britain, on the path of working out together how to create and share the nation\u2019s wealth for the benefit of all the people. It is an offer to em­ployers and unions to share fully with the Government the benefits and the obligations involved in running the national economy.I have always emphasised my belief in more open Government. For the parties to these talks to be able to work together better, they must tell each other all the facts. It may well be that employers and unions will recognise the need for more skilled and experienced staffs to carry through their part of the opera­tion. For what we are involved in is not just another argy bargy. It is a real attempt, a rational attempt and a sensible attempt to create greater prosperity and to make it more secure. What is more, this should be a continuing process, flexible enough to adapt itself to economic circumstances as they change. For the three parties cannot be expected to solve all the problems at once. But neither can the country wait until we have agreed on all the solutions before we act in order to contain inflation. We must act now and we ought to act together speedily, knowing that the machinery we have created at different levels can meet regularly and frequently to deal with the problems that remain, to deal with the new problems as they arise. Knowing that, we can look ahead year by year to consider the means of creating further expansion and look ahead to agree upon the priorities to which the nation wishes to devote its increasing wealth. This, then is our offer as a Government. No one should underestimate its importance. There are two reasons why I believe there is a better chance now of achieving our objectives.First, everyone has learnt that the cost of confrontation is high for all concerned, whatever the settlement \u2013 in empty pay packets, in lost production, in damage, often permanent, to a firm to an industry. There is another reason why I believe responsible union leaders are now readier to join with the Government and the employers in a co-operative effort to fight inflation. It is that for the first time they are being asked to do so against a background of expansion. For years under Labour the unions were being asked to make sacrifices as part of a policy of restriction and deflation. This time they are being asked to make their contribution to a rate of expansion that has not been achieved for more than a decade. As we sat around the table we soon came to realise that we had much more in common than the differences which divided us. In other words, we found a common desire to pursue economic policies for all people - not for one sectional interest, but for all. It is for the social partners, as I would call them, to acknowledge publicly and unequivocally that sometimes wider and common interests will conflict with their own sectional demands. It will be for them to have the courage to override their sectional interests. But in this the Government also has a part to play. It is for the Government to help them towards what we ought to recognise will be for them an act of imagination requiring very great courage.All the evidence shows that this approach of the Government has the support of the vast majority of the people in Britain, and to have that it must have included the support of millions of rank-and-file trade unionists, who also see that the offer we have made is fair. They also realise that it contains for every one of them a safeguard for their standard of living if the expectations jointly expressed, of the Government, the employers and the unions, should not materialise.On Monday at Chequers we can discuss and assess the statistics. No one partner can dictate to the others, nor insist that only their views can carry the day. But all will have a responsi­bility to ensure that agreements freely negoti­ated and entered into through the procedure we are adopting are fully supported and carried out. But the British people now expect us jointly to move to a settlement which will honestly deal with inflation, which will provide them with that improvement in their real standard of living which we have shown to be possible in an expanding economy.There will always be some who do not want to achieve a strong economy. There are those who do not want a strong Britain at all. There are those who cannot bear to see Britain strong under a Conservative Government.But for the most part I believe that people in this country want to have a fair and reasonable prospect of beating inflation. They have enough in common to override the vested interests; they are sufficiently at one to turn their backs on false sectional loyalty. The people of Britain want to unite in a common purpose.When I was given the Queen\u2019s commission to form this Government two and a half years ago, I declared on the steps of 10 Downing Street: \u2018Our purpose is not to divide but to unite, and where there are differences to bring about reconciliation.\u2019 It is precisely because we are setting out to do this, precisely because your Government represents all the people, that we have arranged the talks and put forward our plan. We repre­sent all the people, but especially those who have no powerful organisation to speak for them, especially those who are most vulnerable to rising prices, especially those, the weakest in the community, who have most to gain from a strong economy. This is the purpose of the specific proposals which we have put. This, I am convinced, is what the nation needs. It is what the nation expects - nothing less.It takes a united country to make a nation strong socially and economically. But to achieve this it is not enough to be united in our economic objectives. We need also to renew and strengthen the bonds within our society \u2013 the bonds which, over the years, have given this country a strength and stability that has been the envy of the world: the bonds of family, the bonds between employers and employees, between Parliament and people, between Government and governed.We hear a good deal these days of how these bonds have become weakened. It is easy to exaggerate this and talk ourselves into a crisis of self-confidence. Young people insist on having a greater say in the decisions that affect their lives today and tomorrow - and so they should.Employees insist on having a greater say in the decisions that affect their jobs and the prosperity of their families - and so they should. And the good employer will increasingly adapt himself to this desire and seek to carry his employees with him in taking management decisions.People everywhere want to be more and more involved in the decisions that affect them, and one of our aims in carrying through the reform of local government is to make this participation more real and more meaningful. And yet I know what disturbs so many of you here, so many watching or listening in your own homes. It is the fear that freedom and democracy are being abused by those who seek only to suppress free speech and free action. It is wrong that employers should be tyrannised, wrong that fellow workers should be terrorised by industrial action that erupts into violence. You know it is our determination, and I believe the determination of responsible trade union leaders, to stamp out lawless picketing; and it is wrong that those who themselves claim to be in positions of authority should deliberately set out to defy the law of the land. Hence our decision to warn those local authorities - few in number - in England and Wales who are bent on refusing to imple­ment the fair rents law carried through by a democratically elected Parliament.Robert Carr has told you how this Govern­ment will intensify the fight against law­breaking within the principles of law and free­dom of which this country is proud. But the fight against lawlessness is not one for the Government alone; it is one in which every single one of us has a role to play. And it is one where those who lead or aspire to lead must themselves be ready to give a lead. In the past year we have had too much breaking of the law in the name of the law, too many attempts to disrupt the democratic process in the name of democracy. I believe that the people of Britain are tired of this double-talk and fed up to the teeth with this humbug. For you cannot pick and choose which law you want to obey and which to defy. Let those who value the law stand up and repudiate those who defy the law. Let them repudiate those who refuse to accept the verdict of the courts. Let them repudiate the lawless pickets. Let those who value democracy repudiate the fair rent rebels. Let been repudiate those who want to tear down what Parliament has built up.A strong Britain. Strong in its economic foundations. Strong in its social fabric. Strong in the bonds that bind us together as a nation and have over the centuries made us the most cohesive and most powerful national force in Europe, if not in the world.A strong Britain is a confident Britain, confident in its ability to take on the duties and the obligations which are imposed by history on any nation with a claim to greatness. We have shown ourselves ready to face our responsibility in Northern Ireland, to defeat the forces of terror and violence, to give the people of Northern Ireland \u2013 all the people \u2013 a chance to choose a system of government that will secure the political and social rights of all the people, irrespective of their religion or their political alliance.This is, in terms of human misery, the most terrible problem that we as a Government and as a country have to face. It haunts us every day. It requires patience, imagination and indeed humility to resolve. I promise you in this Conference that they will be forthcoming. How fortunate we are in having Willie Whitelaw as Secretary of State!We have shown ourselves ready to face our responsibility over the plight of the Ugandan Asians, to accept this survival of our imperial heritage, to prove that the promise of a British Government is not to be broken, to show that it means what it says, to bring order out of chaos, to confront cruelty with sympathy and with humility.In the immediate future we must be confident enough to look ahead. For our future is now about to take on a new dimension. Over years you as a party have always encouraged and supported us in our European policy. You have always by substantial majorities urged us whenever and wherever possible to move towards partnership with the other members of our Continent. We are no longer talking of possibilities; we are talking now of a great achievement. Within a few years how incredibly short-sighted will appear our opponents who urge us to throw our achievement away, particularly when they do so simply because the credit for that achievement belongs to your Conservative Government and not to them.At the Summit Meeting next week my aim will be to join with our partners, the other Heads of Government, in settling the lines on which our new Europe will grow and work together in the next few years.In this new partnership we have a chance as a great people, as a formidable nation, as a shaper and moulder of the modern world, to get back into action, to take up a part which I believe we have a unique capacity to fill. This contemporary world of ours is, after all, the world which Britain in the last four hundred years has profoundly influenced. When the cockleshell boats set off with a Drake or a Cabot their new commerce united the whole world. Their settlements sprang up in every continent. The new markets stimulated our science and technology to launch a whole new industrial way of life. The institutions we adopted - of enterprise and personal freedom and social responsibility - broke open the ancient world of absolute government.For an offshore island of a few million people, it was and remains a staggering achievement. We did not secure it by staying at home. In fact, there is hardly a great movement of post-renaissance man, be it national statehood, scientific endeavour, economic expansion or worldwide discovery that has not been profoundly marked at every stage by British energy and endeavour and backed by the hard slogging dedication of the British people.If we realise today how large is the part we have played in moulding the modern world, it is above all because that same world now cries out to us for even more drastic and constructive change. For every one of the colossal achievements of the last four centuries, there are now shadows of danger across us on an equal scale - the problem of keeping the peace and how to break down distrust between East and West without taking risks with our own defences. The economic problems \u2013 in Europe, how to transform the grim cities and impoverished countryside which years of uneven development have left behind; in the world, how to bring hope and betterment to the two-thirds of humanity who live in poverty.The problems of the environment - and, here again, let us remember that these problems respect no frontiers. This week\u2019s territorial waters in the Baltic are next week\u2019s waters off Aberdeen. The pesticides carried up the Rhine can be washed off down the Thames. The sulphurs and particles in Britain\u2019s air fall in dirty rain on the Continent of Europe.This today is the contemporary world of economic imbalance, of environmental insecurity, of national rivalry, and yet at the same time global involvement. It is the world which we have helped to create and which we now inherit. We have all been, as it were, part of these problems. Now we can be part of the solution.This is the context of our entry into Europe. This alone makes sense of what we have to do. For these problems do not respect frontiers, and neither should frontiers restrict our efforts to solve them.I see in these immense problems, not a block to British action and ambition, but a deep and satisfying challenge to carry on the work of world building in which Britain in the past has played so great a part. As we reach the last quarter of the twentieth century, we are beginning to see so clearly where the paths of renewal lie. They lead us towards a new community with our European neighbours and, through this community, to a new epoch of British service and influence on the whole society of man.It is to make a start upon that work that with your support and encouragement I go to Paris as your Prime Minister next week.I have spoken of the challenge of change, because that is how we see it. And as with so many things in life it is a question of how you look at it. What some people seem to see as an intolerable burden seems to me an incredible opportunity, an opportunity for every one of us. I suppose when you come down to it most things are a question of attitude. You are either on the side of doing things or you are on the side of believing that they just cannot be done. I think we are getting to a point where each of us in this country of ours has got to decide where he stands. I ask our fellow citizens - do you want to say \u2018No\u2019 all the time; \u2018No, it cannot be done\u2019; \u2018No, we never did it this way before\u2019; \u2018No, leave it alone and it might just go away\u2019; \u2018No, we are scared\u2019? Or are we going to have the courage to say \u2018Yes\u2019 \u2013 \u2018Yes, this is how it should be; yes, this is what I believe in; yes, this is for the good of us all; yes, we are going to have a try\u2019? It is a decision a lot of people still have to make. They are unsure, they are undecided.So I say this to all of you as members of our Party. The balance of any future general election lies not with you but with those who are yet undecided. If we cannot give them a lead, then we shall have failed, and we shall have deserved to fail. So let us tell them where we stand, where this Government stands. We are going to build on the past, but we are not going to be strangled by it. We are going forward to take the place which history has reserved for us, and we are going to speak with a voice that has been silent for too long. We are out in the world again. It will take courage. There may be mistakes. But they will not stop is from doing the things that must be done, the things that are going to be done.But most of all we are going to stand up and be counted. And when our voice is heard its message will be clear. We shall say \u2018Yes\u2019 \u2013 \u2018Yes\u2019 to decisions that may be hard - so long as they are fair; \u2018Yes\u2019 to this country of ours that is finally on the move again; \u2018Yes\u2019 to a future brighter than anything in the past. And if \u2018Yes\u2019 seems a harder word to say than \u2018No,\u2019 well, it could just be be­cause when we know that \u2018Yes\u2019 is the right word it is the only word worth saying.

aVThe duties of President of the National Union are not, as I understand it, onerous, Chancellor of the Exchequer, but the office does confer its holder a mark of signal distinction, in fact, the greatest distinction which the Party can bestow. The fact that you are presiding over our meeting here today at the end of this Conference is a personal tribute to you for the immense services you have given to the Party over more than 20 years - in particular as Chairman of the Party when we won the last Election and as Chancellor of the Exchequer with all the burdens that means for more than 3¼ years. I believe that history will record that in this office you have proved to be the greatest reforming Chancellor of modern times.You have carried through the complete reform of our tax system. You have prepared and proposed the Tax Credit Scheme. You have brought about the massive reduction of taxation which we have seen in the lifetime of this Government. We congratulate you on your tremendous achievements and the fruits of your labours.For me, and I think for most of you in this Conference, this has proved to be a fascinating week. Many of you, I know, came here more than a little anxious - I do not mean anxious about whether the Conference train would arrive on time. It did not. I do not mean anxious whether the boiler at the headquarters hotel would function properly. It did. Nor did you need to worry about how our Conference would compare with those that preceded it. For when the Liberals at Southport were sensible they were not original, and when they were original they were not really very sensible. While the Labour Party here in this hall last week were neither sensible nor original.It was not exactly sensible to give absolutely first priority to more than half a dozen different proposals - food subsidies, prescription charges, pensions, schools, teachers, housing, land nationalisation - not to mention Mr. Wedgwood Benn\u2019s proposals to take over an unspecified number of public companies. All have absolute top priority.It was Aneurin Bevan who said that \u2018priorities are the language of socialism.\u2019 I see what he meant. And it was not exactly original to make jokes about mothers-in-law doing the backseat driving - even though it was Roy Jenkins to whom the Leader of the Opposition was referring. I see what he meant, too.No - you were far more anxious - and genuinely anxious - about prices, about mortgage rates; about the effect of inflation on yourselves, your family and your neighbours; about the possibility of our success in the struggle against inflation and the impact of all this on our Party and on the country.I understand that. My colleagues and I understand it full well, but as a result of this Conference I am convinced that you, for your part - and I hope the country as a whole - have a better understanding of the causes of these anxieties and what we are doing to remove them.But more than that, I think by the end of this Conference it was clear to everyone that the problems of this Government had to be seen in the wider context of our achievements. And when you saw that, and you could see that there was much to be proud of, then the achievements do in fact outweigh the problems. If we use the same energy and same determination with which we have accomplished our achievements we can and we will overcome our problems.That I am quite sure is the explanation for the growing confidence I have found as I have watched and listened to this Conference day by day and talked to so many of you both inside and outside this hall.You have shown this confidence in the reception you have given to the speeches by my colleagues in the Cabinet and in the Government, the way in which you have shown your appreciation of the work they are doing. The moral surely is clear. Those of us here on the platform must continue to put before you the whole picture of what the Government have done and what they are doing today. You, for your part, must be unremitting in telling your fellow citizens the whole truth about this Government\u2019s achievements. They are considerable achievements, of which we can all be proud. Do not forget them, do not let our opponents forget them - above all do not let the country forget them. When you tell them, you speak not only about the achievements of the Conservative Party, not only about the achievements of this Government, but you are speaking of the achievements of the whole British people.We are an island race. That is an accident of geography. But it is a fact that has shaped our history. It has also shaped our thinking. And that perhaps is less helpful than it once was. A poet wrote, \u2018No man is an island unto himself.\u2019 Today no island is an island. That applies as much to the price of bread as it does to political influence.The world is shrinking fast and forming new configurations. The hard truth is that we are not owed a say in the world today on what we have been. We have to earn our say for what we can be. That is not to declare that history and tradition go for nothing. Far from it.But if that history appears dry with dust, and if that tradition is all behind you, then today\u2019s world is not going to wait. There are those who act as though our past entitles us to our future. It does not. Nobody owes us anything. But what our history, what our living traditions do hand down to us are the wit and the wisdom to compete successfully in the modern world. To compete to win at home and in the world elsewhere.As a Party we have always known that it is the job of a British Government to build up British influence in the world. And who better can guide us in doing that than the present Foreign Secretary, Sir Alec Douglas-Home?We can use our influence to protect our own interests, most certainly, but we can also use it to work towards a sane and decent world order. You showed in your debate yesterday, how strongly this theme still runs through your of thinking. But real influence is not built up by striking attitudes or by throwing insults. We do it by patient, steady work, done at many levels - always trying to reduce the areas of difficulty, always trying to increase and broaden the areas of agreement. That is what we have been about in the last three years.Two months ago I went to the Commonwealth Conference of Heads of Government in Ottawa. What a different occasion that was, as the Foreign Secretary will agree, from the stormy and sometimes painful Conference two years before at Singapore. I found in Ottawa this year that everyone had a much clearer idea of Britain\u2019s role in the Commonwealth: appreciating that we, too, have views we wish to express, that we, too, should have the right to follow our own policies as we judge best. No longer are many Commonwealth countries attempting to dissuade us from entering the EEC. All that is past. What they now recognise is that Britain, as a Member, can help them to establish the relationships they desire with the European Community as a whole.I believe myself that the Commonwealth is now established on a much more realistic basis than before, and because of this the Commonwealth and the links between Commonwealth countries have a great deal more vitality and deeper powers of endurance than at one time to many seemed likely. This is something, surely, which everyone in our Party and in this Conference will warmly welcome.It is a cliché that we live in an age of superpowers, but day by day we can see that this is not the whole truth. The tragic outbreak of war in the Middle East proves yet again that the superpowers do not and cannot control what happens in the world. There will always be a role for the middle powers - particularly, perhaps, for countries like our own which have a long experience of adventure and diplomacy in every corner of the globe.In the present Middle East situation Britain has one, and only one, interest. It is to work for a genuine settlement under Resolution 242 of the United Nations. It is urgent, for the longer the war drags on the greater the danger of other Arab countries being sucked into it, the greater the risk of the superpowers themselves becoming involved, the greater the possibility of damage to the interests of the whole Western World.In the first week of next year I shall be visiting China. Britain was among the first countries to recognise the People\u2019s Republic of China and to have sensible dealings with it. In the last three years contacts have dramatically increased. I believe that we are only at the beginning of what can be done in this relationship. And the same is true of our relationship with Japan. I know that there are many people in this country, perhaps some in this hall, who still have a vivid memory of what they, or their families, suffered at Japanese hands in the last war. But now there is a new generation in Japan, a generation which has rebuilt their country in a most remarkable way as a leading industrial power, the third in the world, and as a major trading partner of Britain. I am sure that we are right to bury the past and to press ahead in creating a new friendship with the Japanese Government and the Japanese people. Indeed, as I have so often said, if the industrialised countries of the West are to develop their true potential and increase their real prosperity, it can only be achieved through a satisfactory working arrangement between the European Community, the United States and Japan.With that the West can prosper: without it we shall cut each other\u2019s throats.The dialogue between Britain and the Soviet Union has been resumed. It was through no wish of ours that it was interrupted. But our relations with the Soviet Union are always bound to be of major importance in British foreign policy and we are glad that these exchanges are now once again taking place.And so right across the world your Government is building up strong friendships with the Commonwealth and our Allies, firm relations with the major countries of both East and West.What has been happening in the Middle East in these past ten days has shown us again how dangerous and unpredictable is the world in which we live. But there is one immense change which has come over the world in recent years.It is not so long ago since Europe was the most dangerous and the most unpredictable of all the continents. Think of what was happening in Europe thirty years ago. Thirty years is a long time in the life of an individual: it is not very long in the history of our continent. Thirty years ago the lands and cities of Europe were attacked or bombarded - not by forces from outside but by tanks and planes coming from inside Europe itself.The situation today is so different that we take it too much for granted. The danger of war between the countries of Europe has disappeared. The legacy of fear and hatred has almost vanished. Our countries are coming steadily closer together year by year.Only a few years ago who would have thought that Britain, France, Germany, Italy and our other partners would have been able to agree on a common European identity; and as a result of this to work out a common European policy towards our principal ally, the United States?Yet that is exactly what was achieved last month at the meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the European Community in Copenhagen. They agreed on a British proposal as a result of a British initiative. That can form the basis of the future relationship between the European Community and other countries across the Atlantic. We have at last started to build the twin pillars on which our friendship can rest.Are we not becoming just a trifle blasé if we take political agreement of this kind for granted? To have all our countries with their different histories, their traditional rivalries, sitting round the same table agreeing on a common purpose - that in itself in Copenhagen was a piece of history. But let there be no doubt about one thing.This success, this latest coming together of the nations of Europe, would not have been possible if Britain had not been a member of the European Community. This is what your Government have achieved, with your repeated encouragement and support.That is what the Labour Party would throw away - just like a child discarding a borrowed toy. They knew the truth well enough when they were in Government. They saw clearly enough where the interests of Britain lay. Now they are jealous that we have succeeded where they failed. And because of their jealousy they are willing to put at risk the prosperity of our people. They are willing to plunge Europe back again into uncertainty and endless debate.Of course we are not satisfied with the European Community as it stands today. I do not know anyone in the Community who believes that it has reached its final form, or indeed its perfect form. The whole nature of the Community is that it should constantly change and develop according to the changing needs of its peoples. It is not a Community of the Governments for the bureaucrats - it is the Community of the peoples and for the peoples of Europe.Should there be changes in the Common agricultural policy? Certainly. And it is precisely because we are now members of the Community that it has been agreed that plans for change should be set in hand, and we owe a great deal to our Minister of Agriculture, Joe Godber, for the part that he played in those matters.Should there be changes in the way the Community spends its money and in its control over it? Most certainly. And it is precisely because we are now members of the Community that we have already reached agreement on the setting up of the Regional Development Fund from which Scotland, Wales and the regions of England will benefit. We can pay tribute to John Davies and Christopher Chataway for the part they have played in the negotiations over the Regional Development Fund.Should there he changes in the democratic working of the Community? Most certainly. This is precisely why Peter Kirk and his colleagues, with my full agreement and that of my colleagues, have set in hand various proposals in the European Parliament. Their very presence in Strasbourg has revitalised that institution, because they have brought to it characteristics from the Westminster Parliament itself.Should there be changes in the way our Governments work together for greater unity? At the Summit Conference of Heads of Government in Paris a year ago, we laid down the general lines of policy for the Community for the rest of this decade until 1980. We visualised another meeting in 1976 to review what had been achieved. Progress this year is already considerable. By the end of the year major decisions will have to be taken over a very wide field including economic and monetary union, and social and regional policy. But the total programme of work in the Community which has to be handled by the Council of Ministers, on which the Foreign Secretary sits, is immense.I believe that already some of my colleagues as Heads of Government feel the need for us to get together regularly without large staffs so that we can jointly guide the Community along the path we have already set. I would like to see the Heads of Government of the member countries of the Community meeting together, perhaps twice a year, as I have said, alone and without large staffs, with the President of the Commission being present, as he was at the Summit, on matters which concern the Commission. I would hope that my partners would respond to an initiative of this kind.Our purpose in meeting together would be to lay down the broad direction of European policy, to keep up the momentum towards greater unity in foreign policy, to help forward the working out of common internal policies within the Community; and so to agree upon the strategic issues facing the Community as to avoid the damaging controversies which so often appear to the public to dog the deliberations in Brussels.Of course, you cannot bring about the changes that we want by sulking at a distance, as the Labour Party does. We shall not bring about the changes we want by feeble blustering of the kind we heard from Blackpool last week. We shall achieve these changes by persuading our partners that they are necessary if we are to achieve our common purpose.That is the meaning of the Community. That is what our European Community is all about. The Community is on the move, and Britain as a new member is providing a great deal of the impetus.Wherever we have begun to make our contribution the reaction from our European partners is the same: \u2018Thank goodness you are here,\u2019 they say. \u2018This is what we have waited for. We have been watching you do business for years. We have admired your institutions. We know you have problems, just as we had at the beginning of the Community. Maybe we can help to solve them. Now that we are together at last we can get something done.\u2019That is the prize which together we have all won. How damaging it would be, how absurd Britain would look, if at this point of success we allowed this prize to be thrown away.It is our job as a Government, once again with your support, to build upon what has already been achieved. We can do this because the will to succeed is there in our partners also.Given this will to succeed there is nothing now that can hold the Community back.One of our new partners in the Community is the Republic of Ireland. I hope, and I have long hoped, that this fact will help us to find the right answer to the gravest of all the problems which your Government have had to face. Yesterday you heard Willie Whitelaw give us a progress account of the last year in Northern Ireland. I think you will agree that the progress that has been made despite all the difficulties has been remarkable indeed. I want to add my tribute to him and to his fellow Ministers for their extraordinary patience and tenacity in immensely trying circumstances. We still have a long way to go. There is no easy and quick solution. There is going to be no speedy end.I always remember how, on the eve of my meeting at Chequers with the Prime Ministers of North and South, the first meeting of all three Prime Ministers which had taken place for fifty years, I received a charming letter from Quintin Hailsham, the Lord Chancellor. It was very brief, and all it said was, \u2018Prime Minister, if you do not solve the problems of Ireland in the next forty-eight hours, pray do not be disappointed. They have remained unsolved for the last four hundred years.\u2019Last month, as you know, I also visited Dublin to talk once again with the Prime Minister of the Irish Republic.For years now British Prime Ministers have flown around the world. They go by jet to Washington or to Moscow, without even anyone batting an eyelid. Now, as I have said, I have been invited to visit Peking soon. In the bustle of diplomatic activity one meets statesmen with whose policies one is not in agreement, or to whose policies one may even be bitterly opposed. One does it in the pursuit of the diplomacy of peace. Yet here we are in this little group of islands, lived in by barely sixty million people, and my visit to Ireland last month was the first official visit by a British Prime Minister, and the first talks the Prime Minister has had in the Irish Republic in Dublin since the Free State was set up more than fifty years ago. In my view, it was high time a British Prime Minister made such a visit.And I did so because I was prepared to take the risks which were involved - political or otherwise - in the hope of reconciliation between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, reconciliation between Protestants and Catholics, reconciliation between the various political parties in Northern Ireland itself.People have learned, and learned painfully, all over the world, that their best chance of survival is in finding a way of living together. It is no less vital that in our own islands we learn the same lesson. I understand full well how much the people of Northern Ireland have suffered from the violence of the last few years. I know what a traumatic experience they have gone through politically during this time.It is true, as Brian Faulkner said yesterday, that the Westminster Parliament is asking much of them through the Constitution Act - which is now the law of the land - by requiring what is in effect a form of coalition government, though we have tried to make it more possible by keeping in the control of Westminster those aspects of Government which have always divided people and parties in Northern Ireland in the past. But I would hope that those who have held power there for more than 50 years will recognise the need to accept others who are prepared to work the Act, and to do so in a spirit of compromise. I would also hope that those who now find themselves for the first time in a position to share power, will themselves accept the need, however deep their feelings about the past, to take part in the give and take of the daily business of Government and the running of Northern Ireland affairs. That, I am convinced from my visit there, is what the great majority of people in Northern Ireland want today and that way I am sure progress can be made in bringing peace to this strife-torn province.The centre-piece of our Conference, Mr. President, has been the debate on the Economy and in particular on inflation in which you, Geoffrey Howe and Joseph Godber also took part. Last Monday I announced the next stage of the Government\u2019s programme for controlling inflation. I understand that the Leader of the Opposition is complaining that one minute and twenty-two seconds of broadcasting time was not sufficient for his reply. It is true that when he and his Party announced in this hall last week their plans for dealing with inflation they took most of the week. Surely he could have done that in less. Increase public spending by £5,000 million to £6,000 million a year. Increase taxes of all kinds - VAT, Pay As You Earn - hitting virtually every family in the land. A programme of nationalisation which would cost another £10,000 million - presumably extra borrowing requirement. The ending of the fair rents scheme which would make hundreds of thousands of families lose their rent rebates. That is Labour\u2019s programme for countering inflation. It is bogus, it is humbug, but it is dangerous humbug. It did not even take one minute twenty-two seconds to spell that out.The essence of our proposals lies in stricter control over prices, but in a way that will allow investment to continue and increased efficiency to be rewarded. And the greater scope for wage bargaining, wage negotiation we propose is important, but it will be done in a way which will not stimulate inflation as it did in the free-for-all just before the freeze last year.At this Conference you have constantly, and quite rightly, told us of the worry which rising prices cause to individuals and families throughout the land. I ask you to accept that this knowledge is at the front of our minds as we wrestle day by day with the problems of inflation, and no Government has wrestled harder and with greater ingenuity than we have done over these last three years.We receive and publish the figures which show that, on average, earnings in this country have kept well ahead of prices. We know these figures to be accurate, but we also know that average figures, however accurate, can conceal a great deal of individual anxiety.In dealing with inflation some of you touched in your speeches in the Conference on this. We have not been thinking just of the TUC and the CBI, or the other groups whom we have been consulting. We have also been thinking of those not represented by a big organisation. They do not have anyone to argue for them at No. 10. They look to us, the Government, and they have a right to look to us, the Government, to protect them from the anxiety which they feel.It is the old people in our society perhaps who feel this anxiety most acutely. After a life of hard work they rely on their savings and on the old age pension to see them through the years of retirement. The Chancellor of the Exchequer has already acted to relieve the tax burden on their savings, but more often than not it is the level of the old age pension itself which makes all the difference to their weekly budget.You can look at pensions in two ways. You can take the cautious line. You can say that pensions will be increased to keep pace with the cost of living. That is the line which we took in our election manifesto, and those who, quite rightly, in the course of the debates here, have drawn attention to the promises in our election manifesto might remember that it is a pledge we have amply fulfilled. But in our view that in itself is not enough. We believe that pensioners ought to have a share in the growing prosperity of this country. So in our package for Stage 3 we have gone well beyond making sure that the pension keeps up with prices.I announced last Monday that this year there would once again be an extra payment of £10 for every pensioner and for those in other categories who received the extra payment last year. I can tell you this morning that if Parliament approves the necessary legislation those who draw their pensions at Post Offices will get their extra pensions in the week beginning the 26th November. Those who are paid by other means will also get their £10 bonus before Christmas. £10 for those who draw their pensions at Post Offices in the week beginning 26th November, and the others will get it before Christmas.We believe that pensioners are entitled to extra consideration, particularly at a time when they are faced in the shops with the result of prices rising across the world. Some people asked me why we cannot do more. Of course, we would like to do more, and we mean to do more. Sometimes people go on to ask me why we cannot pay pensions at the same level they do in some other countries in the Community, particularly Germany and Holland. It is odd that the people who make that point are sometimes the same people who most bitterly opposed our joining the European Community. For the answer is a simple one.These other countries have managed to do better than we have in the field of pensions. They have done so precisely because they have managed to do better in achieving a steady rate of expansion of the economy. One of the main reasons why we are determined to keep the economy of this country expanding is that we want to do so much more - not only for the pensioner, but right across the field of social services.As our policies move forward, more and more people benefit from the Conservative philosophy of giving extra help to those in the greatest need. Sir Keith Joseph, who has done so much in this field, spelt it all out to you at the end of his speech. The same philosophy has been applied to housing.In the debate which you had on Wednesday, which Paul Channon answered so admirably, you concentrated mainly on what the Government is doing and should do to help people buy their own homes. This was right, and natural enough, especially for our own Party. For unlike the other Parties we believe that people who want to own their own homes should be able to do so. But there is another side to our housing policy, which is expressed in the Housing Finance Act.I have never understood why tenants who can afford a fair rent, because their earnings are high, should not be asked to pay it for the house which they rent. There has never seemed to me any good reason why tenants should be subsidised, often by people with lower pay or people who have retired or pensioners, by people less well off than themselves. But, of course, there is more in the Act than the fair rent.The Labour Party have said that they would repeal the Act. This must mean that they would also sweep away the system of rebates and allowances which are an essential part of our legislation.What does the Act achieve in practice? Let me just give you two examples of what is at stake here. Of course, the names I give you are imaginary, hut you will find people like them in your own towns and villages. Mr. and Mrs. Parker have two children. He only earns £25 a week and lives in a privately-rented home paying a rent of £4. Until we came into office he had no help with that rent at all. Now he and his family get a special rent allowance of £2.84 a week, so that they have to find only £116 out of their own pocket. That is the effect of our Act on privately-rented accommodation.Or take Mr. and Mrs. James with three children, earning too just £25 a week. The rent of their council house is £3.50. They live under a Labour-controlled council, which gave no rent rebates at all, until it was forced to do so as the result of our Act. Now because of that Act, Mr. and Mrs. James get a rent rebate of £3.29 a week, so that the rent which they pay from their own pocket is now down to 21 pence.These are the facts of Conservative policy. They are not proved by average figures or percentages, but in the actual experience of people\u2019s daily lives. I have chosen these two examples from the field of housing. I could find you many more such examples among the disabled, the very old, the over 80s, the widows, the chronically sick, and the other groups of people who need help and are now getting effective help for the first time under a Conservative Government.This week I have had the opportunity of meeting for the first time the new Youth Development Officers whom the Party has recruited in most parts of the country. Selwyn Gummer, as we know, has taken the lead in all of this. We discussed together how far there still existed among young people the myth that the Conservative Party was hard of head but also hard of heart. We agreed that it is our job to destroy this myth of hard-heartedness once and for all. We can do it conclusively by showing examples from practical, personal experience, such as the two I have just quoted, of what our policies mean in practice. I hope you will do it in your constituencies, that you will search out the practical examples and then let them be known so that everyone can see how much we have achieved in the field of the social services.Of course, it is very convenient for our opponents to forget what has been achieved over these three years, but do not let them forget, and do not let people forget.I know that more and more trade unionists all over the country, and their leaders with whom I have had so many hours of talks, are now beginning to understand the real meaning of the policies we have been pursuing. It has not been an easy time for us. Trade unionists have suffered, like everyone else, from the rise in world prices, yet in the ten months since we introduced our counter-inflation policy the days lost through strikes are less than a quarter of those lost in the ten months that went before - less than a quarter. That is a much more orderly development of our economy and of our labour relations.I believe that we are now seeing a fresh climate developing in industry. There is a new understanding that there are better ways to resolve problems than by calling a strike. Today the trade unionists come regularly to Downing Street, as do the employers, to tell us their views, to argue their case. They do not come in the heat of a crisis. They come in a calm atmosphere to discuss future policy. This has not been wasted time, for we have taken account of their views and suggestions in the counter-inflation policy. Too often in the past a strike was the only way for a union to make its views known. Those days are past. Our talks in Downing Street are held regularly before there is a dispute. They have had more influence on policy than any number of demonstrations or strikes.We recognise the contribution that the leaders of the trade union movement have to make to our policies. Surely a strike can now become a weapon of only the very last resort instead of being the first thing that comes into somebody\u2019s head. But we also recognise the contribution that ordinary men and women have to make in the running of the businesses in which they work. If employers fail to talk to their employees or, worse, do not listen to the views of their employees, they cannot really be surprised if their industrial relations are not as good as they might be. This is, however, neither a sensible nor a civilised way to run industry. Employers - and all the good employers recognise this and have long done so - have a duty to give their employees a much bigger say in the decisions that affect their everyday life.We shall soon be publishing our proposals and our ideas for extending and improving participation in industry. It will demonstrate once again our belief that co-operation is a better policy than conflict.Mr. President, I would like to take your mind back to the last Conference speech I made before the election of 1970. I told you then that we were setting out to fight for higher living standards, and those we have achieved; to fight for a better deal for those in need, and that has been ably fulfilled; to fight for a strong Britain with influence in the world, and I have described to you how we are bringing it about; to fight not for a narrow, sectional or class interest but for all the people in this country.That is what I said in 1969 and a little more than three months later my colleagues and I met and decided on the priorities necessary to carry this out. We announced a programme that was published on the front page of every national newspaper. It was headlined as a five-star plan.Tax cuts was the first - brought about by the Chancellor.The reform of industrial relations brought about by Robert Carr.The new pensions for the over-80s, more help for those in need - brought about by Keith Joseph.Action to deal with crime - brought about by Reggie Maudling and Robert Carr.New legislation on immigration and stricter control - brought about by Reggie Maudling and implemented by Robert Carr.Those were the five points - that was the five-star plan - which appeared the morning after our meeting. That meeting was at Selsdon Park. That was what was really laid down at that conference. That is the reality, not the myth of Selsdon Park.Do not forget - and do not let our opponents forget - that we carried out all this against a background of six years of socialism which squandered the skills, stunted the enterprise and drained the nation of energy and achievement. What we had to do when we took office was to reverse the dreary deflation and stagnation of those years.We set out on a course of expansion. We knew it was the only way to solve our problems. We set out to end the years of self-doubt. We were not the first government to set out on this course. It was not our ambition that was unique; it was our determination to achieve our objectives which was different from that of our predecessors.It was not easy at first. The effect of our new policies was not immediate. It has taken two budgets with the most massive cuts in taxation since the war.It is interesting how, when we were in opposition, the first problem which was always put to us was the problem of the burden of taxation on the people of this country. You do not hear about that now. It has been dealt with by this Government, and dealt with by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, dealt with by the Government as a whole. But do not let them forget.It has taken a series of measures to encourage investment like the Industry Act. Let those who read our manifesto also read there the pledge we gave that we would have an advanced regional policy, that we would never allow the regions to go on suffering as they have done in the past. Through the Industry Act, we are now achieving results such as have never been achieved before. What it is doing is to allow our industry to modernise rapidly in order to compete in Europe in the great market which is now open to us. It has taken time for a new climate of confidence to develop but now the results here are beginning to show. The economy is moving into higher gear and it is no coincidence that this is the time when we have joined the European Community.The British economy has been expanding far faster than for many years. In 1973 industrial output in Britain has risen by a massive 9 per cent. The volume of our exports has risen even faster, by over 12 per cent.We are quickly developing the all-important discoveries of oil in the North Sea, which will make such a vast difference to our future. The first oil will reach our shores next year.At the same time, although this rate of inflation is still far too high we have reduced the rate of inflation through domestic causes below the level of the majority of our competitors. These are achievements of which we can be proud. They are achievements which we are determined not to surrender.Of course, expansion brings new problems. It can produce shortages. Some employers report that they are finding it difficult to recruit workers, but that is not all bad news. It means that those who want to work can find a job. It means that the tragedy and the deprivation of unemployment are being eliminated. Inflation is a social evil with which we have to deal. Unemployment is a social evil with which we also have to deal. What would this Party at this Conference be saying to me here, and to my colleagues on this table, if today we were about to enter into another winter with one million unemployed in this country? That is the fact that people have to face. We have dealt with this social evil. It means that there is new money flowing into the homes of 300,000 people who could not find a job a year ago. It means that there are more opportunities for working overtime and for earning more money.In Scotland, in the North East, in Wales, all over Britain it means that there is a better choice of jobs. But, of course, it also means that employers do have to provide better working conditions to attract workers and all the things that go with it, if they want them to move there. It means there is more incentive for employers to invest in more efficient machinery, so we can get better investment backing for those who work in Britain.When we hear of these problems of expansion, let us not be faint hearted. Instead, let us remember the greater opportunities they bring. The challenge now is to create new skills by more training and better plant in our factories, by more investment, in order to maintain steady and continued expansion in the years ahead.The real problem facing us today is this, that we still have more than half a million unemployed and many tens of thousands of women who would like to be in jobs if suitable conditions could be arranged for them. But the people are in different places from the jobs, and they do not have the skills which are required. That is the real practical problem which not only the Government, the employers and the Unions, but the country also has to solve today. You do not solve it by imposing higher taxation, by deflation, and by increasing unemployment.Let us not forget that the real standard of living has risen twice as fast since we took office as it did in the six years of the Labour Government. That is the real reason we have been able to raise pensions by 55 per cent. That is why we have been able to begin a massive programme to rebuild our primary schools, as Margaret Thatcher has described to you. That is why we have been able to increase our spending on the social services. That is why we have been able to provide new help to some of the poorest, to some of the least fortunate people in Britain who never had any help before under any Government.I began by speaking to you, to the members of our Party, as your Leader. I want now to speak as Prime Minister to the nation. Four years ago it would have been quite possible for people to look at us and say with a sad smile that we were a country whose future was all in our past. We had lost our way, so it seemed to them. What lay ahead was too complex to comprehend. We faced it with trepidation, waiting for it to overwhelm us, and it very nearly did. Yet the future does not have to be a threat.Not for any individual. Not for any nation. It is too easy to say: \u2018Well, that is all in the future. We will have to face that when we come to it.\u2019 We will have to face it all right, but why wait until we come to it? Too often that just delays defeat. What is wrong with attacking the future? Why should the future not be made and moulded into what we want it to be? That is what we have been trying to do these last three years. We have made mistakes which we have acknowledged. We have had our setbacks, which are all too well known. But together in this country we have started to build something that is worth having. We have done it without the false stimulus of war. We have done it in a world that is changing further and faster than anyone could possibly have foreseen. What we are building is not just bricks and mortar. It is not even a question of getting figures right on a balance sheet, even though we need all of those things to make it work. It is just as much a creation of the mind and of the heart. It is building a society that works well and suits our nation, because it is a society that knows what is fair and because it is a society that knows that it must work as one.Some people have said that they thought we had forgotten how. And perhaps we did for a time, but this year has shown for the first time in a long time what we as a nation are capable of doing. It has shown something of what we can hope to receive in return. For the last three years we have known what we have wanted this country to be. We knew what we wanted. But we also knew that we might have to find different ways of getting there. The problems might be age-old problems, but in a changing world there might have to be new solutions.As a nation we are beginning to remember how to work together as we do at all the great moments in our history. We did not remember a moment too soon. For in today\u2019s world the future is no longer somewhere beyond the horizon. In today\u2019s world it is upon you almost before you know it. What we have been working for so hard is not some abstraction, some distant promise, to be delivered only to our children or our children\u2019s children. What we have been working for so hard is real. It is ready and we are earning it. We had the wit to see it and the courage to seize it.Today we are moving nearer to the kind of place we want in the kind of world that we want. If we throw away now what is in our hands we do not deserve to keep it. We are an island race. That is an accident of geography. But what we have achieved in the past, and what we are going to achieve in the future - that is no accident. That is the fruit of British character, of British determination, of British tolerance, above all it will be the victory of the British nation acting as one. (Prolonged applause)

aVThank you for a wonderful welcome.The first Conservative Party Conference I ever attended was in 1946 and I came to it as an undergraduate representing Oxford University Conservative Association (I know our Cambridge supporters will not mind). That Conference was held in this very hall and the platform then seemed a long way away and I had no thought of joining the lofty and distinguished people sitting up there, but our party is the party of equality of opportunity, as you can see.I know you will understand the humility I feel at following in the footsteps of great men like our Leader in that year, Winston Churchill, a man called by destiny to raise the name of Britain to supreme heights in the history of the free world; in the footsteps of Anthony Eden, who set us the goal of a property-owning democracy - a goal we still pursue today; of Harold Macmillan whose leadership brought so many ambitions within the grasp of every citizen; of Alec Douglas-Home whose career of selfless public service earned the affection and admiration of us all; and of Edward Heath, who successfully led the Party to victory in 1970 and brilliantly led the nation into Europe in 1973.During my lifetime all the leaders of the Conservative Party have served as Prime Minister and I hope the habit will continue. Our leaders have been different men with different qualities and different styles, but they all had one thing in common: each met the challenge of his time. Now, what is the challenge of our time? I believe there are two: to overcome the country\u2019s economic and financial problems, and to regain our confidence in Britain and ourselves.The economic challenge has been debated at length this week in this hall. Last week it gave rise to the usual scenes of cordial brotherly strife. Day after day the comrades called one another far from comradely names and occasionally, when they remembered, they called us names too. Some of them, for example, suggested that I criticised Britain when I was overseas. They are wrong. It was not Britain I was criticising, it was socialism, and I will go on criticising socialism and opposing socialism because it is bad for Britain. Britain and socialism are not the same thing, and as long as I have health and strength they never will be.Whatever could I say about Britain that is half as damaging as what this Labour Government has done to our country? Let us look at the record. It is the Labour Government that has caused prices to rise at a record rate of 26 per cent a year. They told us the Social Contract would solve everything, but now everyone can see that the so-called Contract was a fraud - a fraud for which the people of this country have had to pay a very high price. It is the Labour Government whose past policies are forcing unemployment higher than it need ever have been. Thousands more men and women are losing their jobs every day, and there are going to be men and women, many of them youngsters straight out of school, who will be without a job this winter because Socialist Ministers spent last year attacking us instead of attacking inflation.It is the Labour Government that brought the level of production below that of the three-day week in 1974. We have really got a three-day week now, only it takes five days to do it. It is the Labour Government that has brought us record peace-time taxation. They have the usual Socialist disease: they have run out of other people\u2019s money. It is the Labour Government that has pushed public spending to record levels. How have they done it? By borrowing and borrowing. Never in the field of human credit has so much been owed.Serious as the economic challenge is, the political and moral challenge is just as grave and perhaps even more so, because economic problems never start with economics. They have much deeper roots in human nature and roots in politics, and they do not finish at economics either. Labour\u2019s failure to cope, to look at the nation\u2019s problems from the viewpoint of the whole nation, and not just one section of it, has led to a loss of confidence, and to a sense of helplessness, and with it goes a feeling that Parliament, which ought to be in charge, is not in charge, and that the actions and decisions are taken elsewhere.It goes even deeper than that, to the voices that seem anxious not to overcome our economic difficulties, but to exploit them, to destroy the free enterprise society and put a Marxist system in its place. Today those voices form a sizeable chorus in the Parliamentary Labour Party, a chorus which, aided and abetted by the many constituency Labour Parties, seems to be growing in numbers. Mind you, anyone who says this openly is promptly accused of seeing Reds Under the Beds, but look who is seeing them now. On his own admission, Mr. Wilson has at last discovered that his own party is infiltrated by extreme Left Wingers, or to use his own words, it is infested with them. When even Mr. Wilson gets scared about their success in capturing key positions in the Labour Party, should not the rest of us be? Should not the rest of us ask him, \u2018Where have you been while all this has been going on, and what are you doing about it?\u2019 The answer is nothing.I sometimes think the Labour Party is like a pub where the mild is running out. If someone does not do something soon all that is left will be bitter, and all that is bitter will be Left.Whenever I visit Communist countries their politicians never hesitate to boast about their achievements. They know them all by heart; they reel off the facts and figures, claiming this is the rich harvest of the Communist system. Yet they are not prosperous as we in the West are prosperous, and they are not free as we in the West are free.Our capitalist system produces a far higher standard of prosperity and happiness because it believes in incentive and opportunity, and because it is founded on human dignity and freedom. Even the Russians have to go to a capitalist country - America - to buy enough wheat to feed their people - and that after more than 50 years of a State-controlled economy. Yet they boast incessantly, while we, who have so much more to boast about, forever criticise and decry. Is it not time we spoke up for our way of life? After all, no Western nation has to build a wall round itself to keep its people in.So let us have no truck with those who say the free enterprise system has failed. What we face today is not a crisis of capitalism but of socialism. No country can flourish if its economic and social life is dominated by nationalisation and State control.The cause of our shortcomings does not, therefore, lie in private enterprise. Our problem is not that we have too little socialism. It is that we have too much. If only the Labour Party in this country would act like Social Democrats in West Germany. If only they would stop trying to prove their Socialist virility by relentlessly nationalising one industry after another.Of course, a halt to further State control will not on its own restore our belief in ourselves, because something else is happening to this country. We are witnessing a deliberate attack on our values, a deliberate attack on those who wish to promote merit and excellence, a deliberate attack on our heritage and our great past, and there are those who gnaw away at our national self-respect, rewriting British history as centuries of unrelieved gloom, oppression and failure - as days of hopelessness, not days of hope. And others, under the shelter of our education system, are ruthlessly attacking the minds of the young. Everyone who believes in freedom must be appalled at the tactics employed by the far Left in the systematic destruction of the North London Polytechnic - blatant tactics of intimidation designed to undermine the fundamental beliefs and values of every student, tactics pursued by people who are the first to insist on their own civil rights while seeking to deny them to the rest of us.We must not be bullied or brainwashed out of our beliefs. No wonder so many of our people, some of the best and the brightest, are depressed and talking of emigrating. Even so, I think they are wrong. They are giving up too soon. Many of the things we hold dear are threatened as never before, but none has yet been lost, so stay here, stay and help us defeat socialism so that the Britain you have known may be the Britain your children will know.These are the two great challenges of our time - the moral and political challenge, and the economic challenge. They have to be faced together and we have to master them both.What are our chances of success? It depends on what kind of people we are. What kind of people are we? We are the people that in the past made Great Britain the workshop of the world, the people who persuaded others to buy British, not by begging them to do so but because it was best.We are a people who have received more Nobel Prizes than any other nation except America, and head for head we have done better than America, twice as well in fact.We are the people who, among other things, invented the computer, the refrigerator, the electric motor, the stethoscope, rayon, the steam turbine, stainless steel, the tank, television, penicillin, radar, the jet engine, hovercraft, float glass and carbon fibres, etc. - oh, and the best half of Concorde.We export more of what we produce than either West Germany, France, Japan or the United States, and well over 90 per cent of these exports come from private enterprise. It is a triumph for the private sector and all who work in it, and let us say so loud and clear.With achievements like that who can doubt that Britain can have a great future and what our friends abroad want to know is whether that future is going to happen.Well, how can we Conservatives make it happen? Many of the details have already been dealt with in the Conference debates. But policies and programmes should not just be a list of unrelated items. They are part of a total vision of the kind of life we want for our country and our children. Let me give you my vision: a man\u2019s right to work as he will, to spend what he earns, to own property, to have the State as servant and not as master - these are the British inheritance. They are the essence of a free country and on that freedom all our other freedoms depend.But we want a free economy, not only because it guarantees our liberties, but also because it is the best way of creating wealth and prosperity for the whole country, and it is this prosperity alone which can give us the resources for better services for the community, better services for those in need.By their attack on private enterprise this Labour Government have made certain that there will be next to nothing available for improvements in our social services over the next few years. We must get private enterprise back on the road to recovery, not merely to give people more of their own money to spend as they choose, but to have more money to help the old and the sick and the handicapped. And the way to recovery is through profits, good profits today leading to high investment, leading to well paid jobs, leading to a better standard of living tomorrow. No profits mean no investment and that means a dying industry geared to yesterday\u2019s world, and that means fewer jobs tomorrow. Other nations have recognised that for years now, and because they have recognised it they are going ahead faster than we are; and the gap between us will continue to increase unless we change our ways. The trouble here is that for years the Labour Party have made people feel that profits are guilty unless proved innocent.When I visit factories and companies I do not find that those who actually work in them are against profits; on the contrary they want to work for a prosperous concern, a concern with a future, their future.Governments must learn to leave these companies with enough of their own profits to produce the goods and jobs for tomorrow. If the Socialists will not or cannot, there will be no profit-making industry left to support the losses caused by fresh bouts of nationalisation. If any one should murmur that I am preaching laissez faire, let me say I am not arguing, and have never argued, that all we have to do is to let the economy run by itself. I believe that, just as each of us has an obligation to make the best of his talents, so governments have an obligation to create the framework within which we can do so - not only individual people, but individual firms and particularly small firms. If they concentrated on doing that, they would do a lot better than they are doing now. Some of the small firms will stay small, but others will expand and become the great companies of the future. The Labour Government have pursued a disastrous vendetta against small businesses and the self employed. We will reverse their damaging policies.Nowhere is this more important than in agriculture, one of our most successful industries, made up almost entirely of small businesses. We live in a world in which food is no longer cheap or plentiful. Everything we cannot produce here must be imported at a high price. Yet the Government could not have destroyed the confidence of the industry more effectively if they had tried deliberately to do so with the formula of empty promises and penal taxation.So today what is the picture? Depressed profits, low investment, no incentive, and, overshadowing everything, government spending, spending, spending, far beyond the taxpayers\u2019 means.To recover, to get from where we are to where we want to be - and I admit we would rather not be here - will take time. \u2018Economic policy,\u2019 wrote Maynard Keynes, \u2018should not be a matter of tearing up by the roots but of slowly training a plant to grow in a different direction.\u2019It will take time to reduce public spending, to rebuild profits and incentives, and to benefit from the investments which must be made. But the sooner that time starts, the better it will be for Britain\u2019s unemployed and for Britain as a whole.One of the reasons why this Labour Government has incurred more unemployment than any Conservative Government since the War is because they have concentrated too much on distributing what we have and too little on seeing that we have more.We Conservatives hate unemployment. We hate the idea of men and women not being able to use their abilities. We deplore the waste of natural resources and the deep affront to people\u2019s dignity from being out of work through no fault of their own. It is ironic that we should be accused of wanting unemployment to solve our economic problems by the very Government which has produced a record post-war unemployment and is expecting more.The record of Mr. Wilson and his colleagues on this is unparalleled in the history of political hypocrisy. We are now seeing the full consequences of nearly 20 months of Labour Government. They have done the wrong things at the wrong time in the wrong way, and they have been a disaster for this country.Now let me turn to something I spoke about in America. Some Socialists seem to believe that people should be numbers in a State computer. We believe they should be individuals. We are all unequal. No one, thank heavens, is quite like anyone else, however much the Socialists may pretend otherwise. We believe that everyone has the right to be unequal. But to us, every human being is equally important. Engineers, miners, manual workers, shop assistants, farm workers, postmen, housewives - these are the essential foundations of our society, and without them there would be no nation. But there are others with special gifts who should also have their chance, because if the adventurers who strike out in new directions in science, technology, medicine, commerce, and industry are hobbled, there can be no advance. The spirit of envy can destroy; it can never build. Everyone must be allowed to develop the abilities he knows he has within him, and she knows she has within her, in the way he chooses.Freedom to choose is something we take for granted until it is in danger of being taken away. Socialist governments set out perpetually to restrict the area of choice, and Conservative governments to increase it. We believe that you become a responsible citizen by making decisions for yourself, not by having them made for you. But they are made for you by Labour all right!Take education: our education system used to serve us well. A child from an ordinary family, as I was, could use it as a ladder, as an advancement, but the Socialists, better at demolition than reconstruction, are destroying many good grammar schools. Now this is nothing to do with private education. It is opportunity and excellence in our State schools that are being diminished under socialism. Naturally enough, parents do not like this, but in a Socialist society parents should be seen and not heard.Another denial of choice is being applied to health. The private sector helps to keep some of our best doctors here, and so available part-time to the National Health Service. It also helps to bring in more money for the general health of the nation; but under Labour, private medicine is being squeezed out, and the result will be to add to the burden of the National Health Service without adding one penny to its income.Let me make this absolutely clear: when we return to power we shall reverse Mrs. Castle\u2019s stupid and spiteful attack on hospital pay beds. We Conservatives do not accept that because some people have no choice, no one should have it. Every family should have the right to spend their money, after tax, as they wish, and not as the Government dictates. Let us extend choice, extend the will to choose and the chance to choose.I want to come now to the argument which Mr. Wilson is trying to put across the country: namely, that the Labour Party is the natural party of government because it is the only one that the trade unions will accept. From what I saw on television last week, the Labour Party did not look like a party of government at all, let alone a natural one.But let us examine the argument, because it is important. If we are told that a Conservative Government could not govern because certain extreme leaders would not let it, then general elections are a mockery, we have arrived at the one-party State, and parliamentary democracy in this country will have perished. The democracy for which our fathers fought and died is not to be laid to rest as lightly as that.When the next Conservative Government comes to power many trade unionists will have put it there. Millions of them vote for us at every election. I want to say this to them and to all of our supporters in industry: go out and join in the work of your unions; go to their meetings and stay to the end, and learn the union rules as well as the far Left knows them. Remember that if parliamentary democracy dies, free trade unions die with it.I come last to what many would put first, the rule of law. The first people to uphold the law should be governments, and it is tragic that the Socialist Government, to its lasting shame, should have lost its nerve and shed its principles over the Peoples Republic of Clay Cross, and that a group of the Labour Party should have tried to turn the Shrewsbury pickets into martyrs. On both occasions the law was broken and on one violence was done. No decent society can live like that, and no responsible party should condone it. The first duty of government is to uphold the law, and if it tries to bob, weave and duck round that duty when it is inconvenient, the governed will do exactly the same thing, and then nothing will be safe, not home, not liberty, not life itself.There is one part of this country where, tragically, defiance of the law is costing life day after day. In Northern Ireland our troops have the dangerous and thankless task of trying to keep the peace and hold a balance. We are proud of the way they have discharged their duty. This Party is pledged to support the unity of the United Kingdom, to preserve that unity and to protect the people, Catholic and Protestant alike. We believe our Armed Forces must remain until a genuine peace is made. Our thoughts are with them and our pride is with them, too.I have spoken of the challenges which face us here in Britain - the challenge to recover economically and the challenge to recover our belief in ourselves - and I have shown our potential for recovery. I have dealt with some aspects of our strength and approach and I have tried to tell you something of my personal vision and my belief in the standards on which this nation was greatly built, on which it greatly thrived and from which in recent years it has greatly fallen away. I believe we are coming to yet another turning point in our long history. We can go on as we have been going and continue down, or we can stop and with a decisive act of will say \u2018Enough.\u2019Let all of us here today, and others far beyond this hall who believe in our cause, make that act of will. Let us proclaim our faith in a new and better future for our Party and our people; let us resolve to heal the wounds of a divided nation, and let that act of healing be the prelude to a lasting victory.

aVI want to speak to you today about the rebirth of a nation. Our nation. The British nation.It is customary at Conferences to talk mainly about winning elections, to concentrate on the Party interest. There is nothing dishonourable about that. I am not against winning elections. On the contrary, I think that one of the problems facing this country is that our Party has not won enough of them lately. A situation we propose to remedy.But for the Conservative Party politics has always been about something more than gaining power. It has been about serving the nation. We are above all a patriotic party, a national party; and so it is not we who have been obsessed this week with how to take party advantage of the present crisis. What\u2019s good for General Motors may be good for the USA. But nothing that\u2019s bad for Britain can ever be good for Conservatives. What we have been concerned with is how we car tackle this crisis, how we can ensure the prosperity, the freedom - yes - and the honour of Britain. The very survival of our laws, our institutions, our national character - that is what is at stake today.Economically, Britain is on its knees. It is not unpatriotic to say this. It is no secret. It is known by people of all ages. By those old enough to remember the sacrifices of the war and who now ask what ever happened to the fruits of victory; by the young, born since the war, who have seen too much national failure; by those who leave this country in increasing numbers for other lands. For them, hope has withered and faith gone sour. And for we who remain it is close to midnight. As Ted Heath said with such force on Wednesday, Britain is at the end of the road. As we all know, he is a man who never sold the truth to serve the hour. I am indeed grateful for what he said. Let us all have his courage.The situation of our country grows daily, almost hourly, worse. As the bailiffs approach, can nothing be done? If the Labour Government is no longer able to act in the national interest, is there no alternative to the ruin of Britain? Yes, indeed there is - and that alternative is here at Brighton today.But if we in the Conservative Party are to shoulder the responsibility of government, to chart a fresh course for our country, then we must first understand what has happened to us - where things have gone wrong - and why I believe there are several reasons for what is known as \u2018the British sickness\u2019 - and they are not a criticism of the people of this country. They are a criticism of the Government of this country.First, we have become the big spenders of Europe - spenders of other countries\u2019 money. The Labour Governments of Harold Wilson and James Callaghan have spent and spent and spent again with unbridled extravagance. And they have exhausted the means to pay for it. They have nearly exhausted the patience and tolerance and respect of our friends. Under Labour the land of hope and glory has become the land of beg and borrow. Today, the Government are back once more at the money lenders for what may well be their last chance - and ours. For this time they are about to pledge the nation\u2019s credit to the hilt.Secondly, increasing interference and direction of industry have stopped it doing its job properly. The Government have chopped and changed policies; they have created confusion and uncertainty. They have added countless burdens. They have destroyed profits. They have raised the cost of borrowing to intolerable heights. And they have demoralised management and they have sapped the will to work. No wonder investment in industry has slowed to a crawl.The third reason - and it goes hand-in-glove with the second reason - is political rather than economic. It\u2019s the Labour Party\u2019s chronic schizophrenia about the future of free enterprise - although the world over, free enterprise has proved itself more efficient, and better able to produce a good standard of living than either Socialism or Communism; and although wherever free enterprise is strangled, freedom is strangled too. Even so, even against all that background, the Labour Party has remained confused and divided over whether free enterprise should be allowed to survive. Yet, in spite of everything, it has survived - so far. Not only that, but, taxed to the limit, it has been the prop and stay of the public sector. Today that survival is in danger. As everyone saw on their television screens last week, the Labour Party has now been taken over by extremists. After years of gnawing and burrowing away in the background, they have at last crept out of the woodwork - at of all places the Winter Gardens, Blackpool. It was a sight the country is unlikely ever to forget.The Labour Party is now committed to a programme which is frankly and unashamedly Marxist, a programme initiated by its National Executive and now firmly endorsed by its official Party Conference.In the House of Commons the Labour Left may still be outnumbered, but their votes are vital to the continuance of Labour in office, and that gives them a strength out of proportion to their numbers. And make no mistake, that strength, those numbers are growing. In the constituency Labour parties, in the Parliamentary Labour Party in Transport House, in the Cabinet Room itself, the Marxists call an increasing number of tunes - in addition to \u2018The Red Flag.\u2019 With the Labour Party more bitterly divided than ever, let no one imagine that this country will be protected by Mr. Callaghan\u2019s avuncular umbrella any more than it was protected by Sir Harold Wilson\u2019s raincoat. That umbrella was blown inside out at Blackpool.Let\u2019s not mince words. The dividing line between the Labour Party programme and Communism is becoming harder and harder to detect. Indeed, in many respects Labour\u2019s programme is more extreme than those of many Communist parties of Western Europe. So I hope that anyone who votes Labour in future will be aware both of the people and the ideas they are in fact supporting. It is not surprising that after the events of last week Mr. Callaghan should speak about a totalitarian threat. He should know all about that. He faces it in his own party. But it is arrogant and utterly wrong of him to suggest that the only alternative to his Government is dictatorship. He should have a higher opinion of the British people.Ours is one of the oldest democracies in the world. Our citizens have a passion for liberty. They have fought for it, and died for it. Provided they know what is happening, they will never surrender to the extremists, whether of the Left or Right. We are made of sterner stuff than the Labour Party. The trouble about the Socialist leader is that he talks tough but he never acts tough - until it\u2019s too late. He talked tough last week. He condemned the pawn-shop philosophy of his supporters. He even spoke of the need to earn wealth before it\u2019s distributed. He even mentioned profits - and at a Labour conference!Apart from reading our speeches, where have Mr. Callaghan and his colleagues been for the last few years? After the energy crisis 3 years ago, who was attacking us for cutting public spending and tightening the money supply? Callaghan and Co. Who fought the October 1974 Election saying that inflation was under control? Who said that there would be no great rise in unemployment? Who claimed that the Social Contract would take care of all our troubles? Callaghan and Co. Who doubled public spending? Who doubled unemployment? Who saw prices go up by more than 50 pence in every pound? Callaghan and Co. Who said \u2018Steady as she goes\u2019 - and then steered straight for the rocks? You\u2019ve guessed it. Callaghan and Co.Now half the Cabinet are beginning to tell half the truth. So what are the chances they\u2019ll change course? Nil, I\u2019m afraid. Because the very nature of the Labour Party prevents a Labour Government from doing what some of its members at long last realise must be done. For example, we are told that to cut public spending further is impossible because the Labour Party wouldn\u2019t stand for it. What an appalling admission! If the country\u2019s economy is bleeding to death, the Labour Party must stand for it. We must all stand for it.This brings us, not for the first time, to the question: \u2018Which comes first with the Labour leaders - party or country?\u2019 Don\u2019t tell me. It\u2019s too depressing. With their approach it\u2019s hardly surprising that Labour\u2019s record over the last 2 years has been so disastrous. First, there was Harold Wilson\u2019s administration. There\u2019s no secret why he resigned. He took to the hills while the going was bad but before it got worse. Now we understand he\u2019s been found and brought back to the City. A plunging pound and Wilson found. There\u2019s no end to our troubles. And now we have Mr. Callaghan. Between the pair of them, Sir Harold and Mr. Callaghan and their wretched Governments have impoverished and all but bankrupted Britain. Socialism has failed our nation. Away with it, before it does the final damage.Yesterday we heard that the Bank Rate had been raised to an unprecedented 15 per cent. You will remember in your time, Mr. Chairman, 7 per cent was a crisis measure. Now 15 per cent. The Government are going on taking stopgap measures to try to restore confidence in the £. They still won\u2019t or can\u2019t change course and take the painful steps that are needed.What would be the attitude of the Conservative Party if the Government did at last lay the right measures before Parliament for its approval? That is an important question for us all. In our response to it, we must be careful not to fall into a trap; a trap in which the Government look to us to support them over difficult decisions, knowing full well they can then buy off their own Left wing by putting through further Socialist measures which the Left will demand.It is no part of Conservative philosophy to help build a Socialist Britain. I have already said that the Conservative Party puts the national interest before short-term party advantage. But the national interest now requires not only that the Government should cut back their expenditure to reduce their borrowing, but also that they should drop the divisive legislation which they are steamrollering through Parliament: Bills like the Dockwork Regulation Bill; like the nationalisation of aircraft and shipbuilding; like the controversial Education and Health Bills. These Bills have nothing to do with saving the British economy. Indeed, they can only make that task much more difficult.We must distinguish clearly between governments and the measures they introduce. A few good measures dictated by events cannot redeem the appalling record and intentions of this Labour administration. We do not oppose good measures, but we will fight ceaselessly against bad government. Because the Britain we are seeking is a Britain which could never be founded on Socialism.The task of the next Conservative Government will be formidable. The sooner we start the better. We have two great obstacles to overcome - doubt and bewilderment. First, bewilderment about what should be done, because we seem to have tried every trick in the book. We have had National Plans and Pay Pauses, Price Freezes, Productivity Awards, Industrial Strategies and Growth Targets.We have been promised that the next bright ploy will hit the bullseye: that blue skies are just around the corner; that we will soon turn the corner; that the light is about to appear at the end of the tunnel - I quote from Mr. Callaghan\u2019s speeches in the past - that we are emerging from the valley of gloom; that we are heading for an economic miracle. We have bad whole regiments of clichés marching into the sunset; but the problems just go on getting worse. So it\u2019s not surprising that people are bewildered. It\u2019s not surprising that they are uncertain. Uncertain whether the task of doing what needs to be done - whatever that may be - is possible for a government of any party. For the Labour Party. Or for the Conservative Party. They are cynical about politics and politicians. They fear that a free future cannot be saved. It can be saved.We can overcome our doubts, we can rediscover our confidence, we can regain the respect of the rest of the world. The policies which are needed are dictated by common sense. That is the right approach. We have set out the broad lines in our strategy statement and we have shown how they stem from a clear, coherent political philosophy.We have first to put our finances in order. We must live within our means The Government must do so. And we must do so as a country. We can\u2019t go on like this. We are paying ourselves more than the value of what we produce. We are spending more than we earn. The gap has to be bridged. It can only be bridged at present by borrowing from overseas. But it cannot be bridged that way forever. And at any moment, if we forfeit the confidence of those who lend to us, that bridge can collapse. It is crumbling now. The only way to safety is to stop borrowing, and stop borrowing soon; and, moreover, to show that we can and will repay our debts in a strong currency and on time. That is usually the task of a Conservative government. To do that, the country must consume less than it produces. That means a drastic change in policies and in attitudes. But we shall have to proclaim openly that this is our purpose.Once we have taken the immediate emergency measures which are needed, we must chart the course for years ahead. There, the country faces a choice. Who is to spend less? At one extreme the Treasury can try to make us, the people, economise by putting up taxes. At the other it can concentrate all its economies on the Government\u2019s own spending. There is not much doubt about the right decision. The Government is spending about £200 a year more than it is raising in taxes, for each man, woman and child in the country. Surely no one, (that is no one outside the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party), can believe in the long term that taxes should go up still more.So the only common-sense answer is to reduce government spending. That is our answer. Economies started as a matter of urgency must he sustained deliberately, carefully and humanely over the period of a full Parliament. They won\u2019t be easy. They will not be popular, and we shall have to defer some of our hopes.We have indicated in The Right Approach those areas where cuts must be made. By getting rid of Socialist programmes. By removing indiscriminate subsidies. By rooting out waste and extravagance. By applying cash limits. By economies in most major spending programmes other than defence, the police and those on which the needy must depend. That is a very similar strategy to that which the Australian Liberal Party, our counterparts, fought their election upon. They are now doing it. That shows it can be carried out in practice; and the people are supporting them because they knew the measures must be taken.In opposition we cannot write our own public expenditure White Paper; it would be foolish to do so. But we may not be in opposition that much longer. So let me pledge that once we are the Government, what we have said we will do about public expenditure, we will do; and we will keep our word just as those other Conservative Governments that I have seen in action recently in Australia and New Zealand have kept theirs.If the present Government have no stomach for the fight, let them depart.Let us realise that their almost total commitment to extravagant government expenditure is not borne solely of compassion. Not a bit of it! It reflects a stubborn desire to regulate the day-to-day lives of rich and poor alike. The more a family has of its own money to spend, the more independent it is of the State. The more that is taken away from that family by taxation, the more that family are under the heel of the State; and that is where Socialism wants them.The Socialists\u2019 battle cry is always the same; we hear it in Parliament, \u2018The Conservatives,\u2019 they say \u2018want unemployment. Conservative cuts,\u2019 they claim, \u2018would double or treble those out of work.\u2019 Now this is nonsense. And we must recognise it as nonsense. No party deliberately seeks the misery and waste of unemployment. But what is the history of the last two-and-a-half years? It is a Labour government that has doubled the numbers out of work and set a shameful post-war record. And however well intentioned, it is Labour\u2019s policies that have brought this about.Yet curiously enough they have neither the wit to acknowledge it nor the courage to change those policies. They doubled public spending. That led to a doubling of unemployment, because they bled productive industry white of the resources it needed to provide jobs. Today their policies threaten the ultimate disaster. An economic earthquake that would ruin the livelihood of thousands of families.Of course we\u2019re not going to solve our problems just by cuts, just by restraint. Sometimes I think I have had enough of hearing of restraint. It was not restraint that brought us the achievements of Elizabethan England; it was not restraint that started the Industrial Revolution; it was not restraint that led Lord Nuffield to start building cars in a bicycle shop in Oxford. It wasn\u2019t restraint that inspired us to explore for oil in the North Sea and bring it ashore. It was incentive. Positive, vital, driving, individual incentive. The incentive that was once the dynamo of this country but which today our youth are denied. Incentive that has been snuffed out by the Socialist State.We Conservatives have to recreate the conditions cited by that wise French philosopher de Tocqueville - conditions which \u2018give men the courage to seek prosperity, the freedom to follow it up, the sense and habits to find it, and the assurance of reaping the benefits.\u2019 That says it all; everything that is not being done now but which we must do. We must break out of restraint if we are to have a prosperous and successful future. We shall do this by providing a stable economic background so that expansion and growth will pay and be seen to pay. We shall do it by letting profits rise to a level which offers a real incentive to expand. We shall do it by ensuring that men and women who invest their savings in their own business, or in someone else\u2019s business, can once more earn a reasonable return. We shall do it by following the example of other Conservative governments and cutting taxes as soon as we can. We shall encourage the production of wealth by spreading a share in its growth among those who have helped to create it.That is the programme which will lead to expansion - picking up speed over the years. Expansion - leading to more jobs. Expansion - leading to higher wages. Expansion - leading eventually to more resources for the nation, so that we can have the same standards of social services as our more successful competitors enjoy. That is a realistic strategy, and it is one which offers hope to our nation.These, then, are some of the guidelines of our strategy - prudent financial management and soundly based expansion. But there are many who will say: \u2018We agree, broadly, with what you want to do. But we are frightened that the trade unions won\u2019t let you do it.\u2019 This does less than justice both to us and to the trade unions. One of the best debates that we have had here was on industrial relations. During that debate one speaker after another, Conservative trade unionists, Conservative negotiators and shop stewards, distinguished the role of trade unions from that of Parliament. What shone through was the difference between what we understand by a social contract and what the Socialists mean. If the phrase social contract means that the job of the trade union negotiator in a factory or office is to secure good pay for good work, to secure good terms and conditions of service, to secure extra rewards for extra skill and responsibility, then we support the Social Contract wholeheartedly.We want to restore the right of unions and management to make the best bargain they can in circumstances they both know. So do most union leaders, But we believe that ideally there should first be a generally agreed basis for wage bargaining. This is a system which has worked elsewhere for years - in countries which have inflation rates far lower than ours. So, the first meaning of the Social Contract presents us with no problem. But Labour\u2019s social contract is not like that. It apparently allows a handful of trade union leaders to dictate to the Government the level of public spending, the number of industries to be nationalised, what the tax system should be, the terms on which we can borrow from the IMF - and so on and so on. I am bound to say to them: \u2018With great respect, that is not your job. It is Parliament\u2019s.\u2019 Parliament is the only body which represents all the people. The most famous definition of democracy is government of the people, by the people, for the people. Not government of a section of the people, by a section of the people, for a section of the people.I agree with the speaker who said that if a trade union leader, or anyone else for that matter, wants to run the country, he or she should stand for Parliament. In the Conservative Party we would welcome some more of them as candidates, although I should warn them that Selection Committees are a law unto themselves, as many non-trade unionists have discovered. But those who believe in good jobs, in raising their standard of living by their own efforts, in working hard for themselves and their families - all of those people, whether they are trade union leaders or shop stewards or ordinary union members, whether they belong to a union or do not belong to any union at all - all of them should welcome the return of a Conservative government.Let me make it absolutely clear that the next Conservative government will look forward to discussion and consultation with the trade union movement about the policies that are needed to save our country. As for confrontation, the confrontation that matters to us is confrontation with rising prices, with rising unemployment, with rising debts and with the grave threat to Britain\u2019s future. So nobody should allow the Labour Party to frighten them into thinking that there can be no domestic peace if we do what has to be done to save our economy. Common-sense policies must and will prevail if we fight hard enough.And those who share our common-sense views are not a small, beleaguered minority. We are a party of ordinary people with ordinary hopes and beliefs, but with extraordinary qualities of tenacity and purpose. Not for nothing are we privileged to belong to probably the oldest and certainly the most successful democratic party over the world.But in recent years we have had more than our share of disappointments at the polls. We have all too often won the argument, but lost in the ballot box. We have won minds - but we must now win hearts. This I believe we can do. Because today the Conservative Party is the truly national Party. On matters that concern ordinary men and women, it is we who represent the majority view, and the Socialists the minority. People are increasingly concerned about the quality of their children\u2019s education, but we are the Party that puts standards as our first priority. People want to buy rather than rent their homes. It is we, not the Socialists, who want to offer the opportunity of home ownership to everyone. People want protection from crime and vandalism in particular and it is we who are the Party that will emphatically not economise on the Police Force.People are becoming increasingly frustrated by the crushing weight of personal taxation in Britain, where we now have the highest starting rate of income tax in the world. We are the Party that wants to reduce taxation while the Socialists never stop trying to raise it.And we are the Party that believes it should pay more to work than to stay idle. A growing number of people are anxious about the strength of our Armed Forces. We are the Party that regards the defence of the Realm as the overriding duty of any government. We want to see a defeat of terrorism, especially in Northern Ireland. But what a distortion, what a travesty of the truth it is for the Socialists to call themselves the party of working people. Today we are all working people. Today it is the Conservatives and not the Socialists who represent the true interests and hopes and aspirations of the working people. Above all else, let us get that message into every corner of the United Kingdom.We are nearing the end of one of the best Conferences we have had since the War. Speaker after speaker, from every walk of life, has come forward to join in debates that have not only been of high quality but have reflected the grave position in which our country finds itself.Today I have tried to speak the truth to you as I see it - and through you to the nation - and beyond the nation to those who wait and watch from abroad, asking anxiously \u2018Where are the British going? What will they do?\u2019I call the Conservative Party now to a crusade. Not only the Conservative Party. I appeal to all those men and women of goodwill who do not want a Marxist future for themselves or their children or their children\u2019s children. This is not just a fight about national solvency. It is a fight about the very foundations of the social order. It is a crusade not merely to put a temporary brake on Socialism, but to stop its onward march once and for all. To do that we must reach out not only to the minds but to the hearts and feelings and to the deepest instincts of our people.Let us be clear in our thinking. Let us be confident in our approach. But above all, let us be generous in our understanding. If, as has been said and I believe, the Conservative Party is the last bastion between Britain and disaster, then let that bastion be broad enough and large enough to accommodate all our people, Conservative and non-Conservative, trade unionists and non-trade unionists, those who have always been with us and those who have never been with us but who are prepared to support us now because they put country before Party. Let no one be excluded from our crusade and let no one exclude himself. We are one nation. We may not know it with our brains but we know it with our roots.I am deeply conscious of the challenge to our Party and of the responsibility I face as its Leader, but I believe we shall be sustained by millions who are hoping and praying today that we shall rise to the level of events. We must not fail them, and we will not fail them. As I look to our great history and then at our dismal present, I draw strength from the great and brave things this nation has achieved. I seem to see clearly, as a bright new day, the future that we can and must win back. As was said before another famous battle: \u2018It is true that we are in great danger; the greater therefore should our courage be.\u2019So let us be in good heart. We are not alone. Across the world, from Australia to Sweden, from New Zealand to West Germany, Socialism is on the way out. The tide is turning. Be in good heart and we will give this nation back a sense of pride and purpose. Be in good heart and we will give our people back their self respect. Let nothing narrow or vindictive or self-righteous be any part of our crusade. Rather let us say with humility: \u2018We offer you hope and a new beginning. Together we shall meet the crisis of this country - and tomorrow the day will be ours.\u2019 (Prolonged applause.)

aVI want to begin with a confession. I do not greatly care for being in opposition, but we have certain plans to deal with that situation. I believe the essence of politics is not what you say, it is what you do, so I look to the day when we put Conservative principles into practice - in Government.I look to the day when we throw off the Socialist yoke and turn together to the task of setting our country on the road to a real and lasting recovery. That day can be postponed but it cannot be put off for ever. One Thursday - it will be a day just like any other Thursday, and yet, I believe, it will be a day that will prove the turning point of our time - one Thursday the Labour Party will have to keep their appointment with the voters. It is a prospect I relish.\u2018Either back us or sack us,\u2019 says Mr. Callaghan. Just give the people the chance, Jim, just give \u2019em the chance. He will not, of course, until he must. He dare not, which is why, instead of having a government with steel in its backbone, we have got one with Steel in its pocket.Last week at Brighton we were accused of \u2018an insatiable lust for power.\u2019 It is not the Tories who have wheeled and dealed and manoeuvred and manipulated to avoid one thing at all costs - facing the voters; it is Labour\u2019s limpet Government. Hence the Lib-Lab pact.So much for Labour\u2019s political principle. So much for the Liberals\u2019 genuine conviction, and so much for the courage to stand by what you believe in, even if by standing by it you lose your seat. Better to lose your seat than your self-respect.Just what is it that the Liberals have kept in office? A Government that for two and a half years overspent, over-taxed, interfered, nationalised, debased our currency and all but bankrupted Britain; in short, that acted like a Labour Government.Mr. Healey blandly refers to the horrors of 1974-5, but who was Chancellor of the Exchequer then? You have guessed - they were Healey\u2019s horrors. After him the deluge? No, because of him the deluge. \u2018The financial position has been reversed 180 degrees,\u2019 says the Chancellor with a flourish. Quite so, because his policies have been reversed 180 degrees - by order of the IMF. Twelve months ago, the four-budget-a-year man all but took the country over the cliff with him, until at the eleventh hour he turned back from Heathrow in a panic and headed for home to take out the most massive mortgage in our history. The prescription the IMF forced his Government to swallow is the prescription we have long been advocating - a good sound sensible Conservative prescription. So my message to Moses is this: keep taking the tablets.If Labour wants an election slogan I suggest - it is just a thought but one likes to be helpful - \u2018You know IMF government works.\u2019Some of the commentators are saying that the Prime Minister is stealing our clothes. Well, it is true that he has lost his own but he is going to look pretty ridiculous walking around in mine!Of course, all of us are deeply thankful that the wealth of the North Sea has started to flow; but the North Sea is not a Socialist sea and its oil is not Socialist oil. It was found by private enterprise; it was drilled by private enterprise; and it is being brought ashore by private enterprise. So let us put the picture in perspective.As the oil comes on stream, our balance of payments is going to look healthier. That is good news for Britain. Sterling should be safe from another Socialist slide. That is good news for Britain. The standard of living of our people might rise again, if only a little after its catastrophic fall. That would be good news for Britain, too. As I have said before, good news for Britain is good news for the Conservative Party.But look closer. The truth is that we are still grinding along in bottom gear, with our factories producing less than they were when Labour came to power. Real profits and therefore investment are still abysmally low; the number of men and women without a job is the highest since the War. And that is bad news for Britain.Now take prices, if you can catch them! The Government boasts of its success in bringing down the rate of inflation. But even if it falls as far as Mr. Healey predicts - and today not even his own No. 2 believes him - prices in Britain will still be going up faster than in other countries. If Labour survives into next year, prices will have doubled while they have been in power. Doubled! That is not an economic miracle. It is an economic and personal disaster.At Brighton last week we saw Socialism wearing its pre-election face. Beware the leopard when it is quiet. It has not changed its spots, it just does not want its victim to know that it is there. Why was it so quiet last week at Brighton? Because it wants the people to believe that it is a gentle, well behaved, social democratic pussy-cat.We all know the drill. In the run-up to each election the claws of Labour\u2019s extremists are not drawn; they are just withdrawn. The front men are paraded to talk quietly, moderately, almost sensibly. The Left-wing just allows them their little outing until the voters are once more in the trap.Now suppose the election is over. Make a supreme effort and imagine that Labour has won, only for a moment. What then? The trap is sprung and Labour\u2019s extremists resume the drive towards a Britain modelled on Eastern Europe.\u2018It cannot happen here,\u2019 you say. But at Brighton the annual election to Labour\u2019s National Executive produced the same line-up as before; not a single Left-winger lost out. It is the same Executive which produced Labour\u2019s Programme for Britain 1976, and that programme remains official Labour Party policy 1977. Mr. Benn was frank enough to say so, perhaps hoping the public was not listening.Nationalise the banks and insurance companies. That is Labour policy. Do you like the idea of their hands on your savings? How do you fancy Mr. Healey or Mr. Benn as your friendly neighbourhood bank manager?They want to nationalise all the land, not just some of it. All of it! They demand a free hand to take over almost any firm big or small, the building industry, the food industry, fishing, forestry, ports and many more. That is their policy, too. They want the power to make every business obey them. They want to cut tax relief for home buyers. They want higher income tax to pay for their plans. They want an immediate wealth tax on top of Capital Gains Tax, on top of Capital Transfer Tax. What is the point of building up your savings or your business if they are going to take it all away from you? But it\u2019s all there in their little red book. It\u2019s all official Labour Party policy. And to make it easier to ram through this frightening Socialist programme, they have just voted to abolish the House of Lords. There, behind the cosy Brighton front, you have the reality of Labour. Although, Mr. President, I rather agree with you about the House of Lords, they will not find it easy to abolish it, because while half the Labour Party are trying to abolish it the other half are trying to get in!When the election comes, will this actually appear in their Manifesto? Some of it will, and if they were to win, sooner or later they will do it all. Because, whenever Labour win an election, the Tribune Group grow stronger and stronger and stronger. From one election to the next, Labour\u2019s programme gets meaner, more narrow, more Marxist. Britain, beware! The signpost reads: \u2018This way to the total Socialist State.\u2019 Destroying freedoms we have cherished and defended down the centuries doesn\u2019t worry the far Left. They like everything about Eastern Europe - except, alas, going to live there - because, after all, the living standards there are very low for them.So let no one say today there is no true difference between the parties, no real choice before the nation. That is not what the people think. Many men and women who had voted Labour all their lives turned to us in Ashfield, Stechford, Workington and Walsall. They know the Labour Party they used to vote for is not the Labour Party of today. The Party of Hugh Gaitskell has become a Party fit for Andy Bevan and Peter Hain. The disillusioned, the disenchanted, the courageous, the converted, we welcome them, one and all, to our cause. But the job of cleaning up Labour the job of ditching the extremists, is not in our hands. It\u2019s in the hands of the people on that special Thursday for which we watch and wait and work.If just 5 or 6 out of every 100 voters switch from Labour to Conservative at the election, they will slash the size of the Tribune Group by about a third, and on a swing of that size 25 Tribunites will lose their seats. And Britain will have a Conservative Government, a truly moderate Government, moderate not by order of our foreign creditors, but by genuine conviction, a Government in touch and in tune with the people, carrying out the sort of sensible, prudent policies that work so well in other countries.Of course, that is not the picture our opponents are going to paint. And here let me make a personal prophecy. In the coming months you are going to see a carefully orchestrated campaign by the Labour Party and Labour Government to portray me as \u2018extremely this\u2019 or \u2018extremely that\u2019 - not to mention \u2018extremely the other,\u2019 A whole battery of extremist labels are going to be bandied about. Indeed, they are being bandied about already; and the closer the election looms, the faster and more furious will the bandying become. So just let me tell you a little about my \u2018extremism.\u2019I am extremely careful never to be extreme. I am extremely aware of the dangerous duplicity of Socialism, and extremely determined to turn back the tide before it destroys everything we hold dear. I am extremely disinclined to be deceived by the mask of moderation that Labour adopts whenever an Election is in the offing, a mask now being worn, as we saw last week, by all who would \u2018keep the red flag flying here.\u2019 Not if I can help it! The Conservative Party, now and always, flies the flag of one nation - and that flag is the Union Jack. So much for my so-called \u2018extremism.\u2019There is another word our opponents like. The word is \u2018reactionary.\u2019 They say that a Thatcher Government - and I must say that I like the sound of that; I like it a little more each time I hear it and they use it quite a lot so they must believe it - they say that a Thatcher Government would be reactionary. If to react against the politics of the last few years, which undermined our way of life and devastated our economy - if that is reactionary - then we are reactionary, and so are the vast majority of the British people.They believe, as we do, that Government is far too big - indeed, the next generation were telling us so earlier in the week. They believe, as we do, that Government does not know all the answers, that it has downgraded the individual and upgraded the State.We do not believe that if you cut back what Government does, you diminish its authority. On the contrary, a government that did less, and therefore did it better, would strengthen its authority. Our approach was put very simply by a Chinese philosopher centuries ago: \u2018Govern a great nation,\u2019 he counselled, \u2018as you would cook a small fish. Don\u2019t overdo it.\u2019if you ask whether the next Conservative Government will cut controls and regulations and keep interference in people\u2019s lives to a minimum, my answer is \u2018Yes, that is exactly what we shall do.\u2019 The best reply to full-blooded Socialism is not milk and water Socialism, it is genuine Conservatism. For 13 years from 1951 we curbed the powers of the State. Ask those who remember which they preferred: the steady increase in prosperity of the 13 Tory years or the white-hot Socialist stagnation of Messrs Wilson and Callaghan?By their fruits ye shall know them. What are the fruits of Socialism? Where is the prosperity? Where are the new jobs, the stable prices, the low taxes? Where is the money created by a thriving economy, to spend on our schools and our hospitals, on the pensioners, on the sick and the disabled?Today we know Socialism by its broken promises; above all, by the broken promise of a fairer and more prosperous society. Socialism has not made society fairer, it has made it less fair. It has not made Britain richer, it has made it poorer. It has not distributed the rewards of achievement more widely, it has decimated them.Just let us ask, and keep on asking, the question Labour can never answer: \u2018If your policies are right, why do they never work? And why is it only when you start doing some of the things we have told you to do that you ever take a few steps forward?\u2019But a few steps are not enough. If I have one message above all else it is this: I am not prepared to settle for the second, third or fourth best for Britain. I do not believe that our decline was inevitable any more than I believe that an accident of nature off our coasts has made our recovery automatic. I believe that if we confront - yes, \u2018confront\u2019 is the word I use - if we confront reality, if we pin our trust on the skill, the resource, and the courage of our people, then this country can work out its salvation and regain its prosperity, regain the respect of others and its own self-respect.Some people regard this as dangerous talk. \u2018The Tories,\u2019 they say \u2018want change; they want to challenge the rules and ideas and policies that govern Socialist society.\u2019 \u2018Risky,\u2019 they murmur, \u2018Right, of course, but risky - might upset Arthur Scargill or Jack Jones - better not do it, better not do it.\u2019 And there you have the root and heart of the choice facing our nation. What worries Jack Jones is that the leaders of his Party are living too well. What worries us is that ordinary people are not living well enough.That is why the next election will be so crucial. All elections are crucial, but this time the choice could be decisive for a generation, because this time how the country votes will settle which party is entrusted with the immense benefits of North Sea oil. If it is the Socialists, then the profits of free enterprise will be used to purchase Socialism, and to take more powers for the State. If it is the Conservatives, they will be used to give power back to the people. The choice is the classic choice. Labour will do what it has been doing for the last three years, only more so. We shall do what we have said we will do set the people free.The key question I am asked over and over again is, \u2018But will a Conservative Government be free? How will you get on with the trade unions, and will the trade unions allow a Conservative Government to govern?\u2019 Yes, the word is \u2018allow.\u2019 People who ask that question are already half way into Labour\u2019s trap. They have swallowed the bait and they are ripe for the catch. Here is the position: The Government dare not fight on their record or on any manifesto that would be acceptable both to their Marxist Left and to the people of Britain. So, like an unimaginative parrot, they keep on repeating: \u2018The Tories won\u2019t be able to work with the unions.\u2019 When the time comes, Jack Jones will be expected to mutter it; Hugh Scanlon to go along with it; David Basnett may actually say it; and Clive Jenkins - he will almost certainly shout it. And it will not be true, unless the union leaders are determined to make it true.Now let us take and face a hypothetical situation. Suppose they are so determined, suppose they have already made up their minds, to make the task of an elected Conservative Government impossible. Then we would face a situation in which an unelected minority was intent on getting rid of a government that it could not control and replacing it with one that it could. Is this what the union leaders seriously intend, to use then industrial muscle for political ends? I do not believe it. But people are asking: if it were so, what would happen? Could a handful of men with great power hold the nation to ransom? The answer is: it is possible. Should such a situation arise, for example in a vital nationalised industry, it would be presented as a conflict between Government and trade union. This would be false. The real conflict would be between union and people, because it would be the people who would suffer. It always is. In that case the duty of the Government, any Government, would be to act through Parliament on behalf of the nation as a whole. In a vital issue such as this, in which the Government had to take decisive action on a single specific matter, it would he important for the Government to know that it had the support of the majority of the people.It is in that context, and that context only, that I have suggested a referendum to test public opinion. In those circumstances in those special circumstances I say: \u2018Let the people speak.\u2019 But I hope, and believe, the situation will never arise.I would like to make two final points about the unions. First, a strong and responsible trade union movement is essential to this country, and its rights must be respected. Second, the belief that those rights take precedence over all other rights, and even over the law itself, could be fatal to this country. Happily, the great majority of trade unionists know this as well as, if not better than, some of their leaders. They know that while their leaders represent them at work, we represent them in Parliament.We in the Conservative Party look forward to a long and fruitful association with the unions, because a Conservative Britain will be as much in the interests of union members as of the rest of the community. They know that taxes today are too high, that they torpedo talent, and that they must be cut; and that is what we Conservatives will do. We shall cut income tax, so that once again it is worthwhile to work harder and to learn a skill. We want to keep our best brains in Britain. We want to bring home some of those who have been driven abroad. We want to hold out to the enterprising businessman a reward which matches the risks of building up a firm. We want to renew the spark of incentive in our economy, because without that, new jobs cannot and will not be created. We want to leave everyone with more of his own money in his own pocket to spend as he pleases.Our aim is to make tax collecting a declining industry. There are more civil servants in the Inland Revenue than there are sailors in the British Navy. If governments do not cut what they spend, we have to cut what we spend. There is one hand-out that the people really want today. That is the Government\u2019s hand out of their pocket.This is the positive approach, and it is the key to getting industry going again. We do not believe that Government can run industry better than the people who work there. It cannot. Countries that are more successful than we are owe their economic achievements above all to free enterprise, and the benefits are not confined to a few of their citizens. They are spread among the many. The whole community benefits, because, \u2018when the tide comes in, all the boats rise.\u2019 Of course, no Government in a modern industrial society - and certainly no sensible Conservative Government - can wholly withdraw from the market place. But Government support for ailing industry will only produce an ailing economy unless it is selective, unless the circumstances are exceptional, and unless that support is directed to two overriding aims: moving the firm out of the red into the black and then back to independence as quickly as possible. A sure recipe for industrial blight is a Government that gives what amounts to a blanket guarantee that virtually any firm will be saved from the consequences of its own mistakes. No firm and no nation can behave indefinitely as though there is little difference between profit and loss, high production and low, success and failure.In this as in so much else, Winston put his finger on it. \u2018It is a Socialist idea,\u2019 he said, \u2018that making profits is a vice. The real vice is making losses.\u2019We would like to see the workers who help to create the profits sharing them. The Labour Party want union leaders on boards of directors. We want more employees voting as shareholders at company meetings. Under a Conservative Government we hope that more of them will own a stake in industry and that more of them will own their own homes.We Conservatives are a family Party. We believe that in a healthy society more and more people should be able to buy the roof over their own heads. That is why we will give council tenants the right in law to buy their homes. That legislation, I promise you, will be announced in the first Queen\u2019s Speech of the next Conservative Government.Let the Labour Party go on offering newlyweds a place on the waiting list for a house on a council estate which they can never call their own. We offer them a place that belongs to them, their own home in which to start life together and later to bring up their children.What happens when the children go to school? We have got to stop destroying good schools in the name of equality. The main victims of Labour\u2019s recent attack on the direct grant schools have been able children from less well-off families. People from my sort of background needed grammar schools to compete with children from privileged homes like Shirley Williams and Anthony Wedgwood Benn.Our aim in education is simple: it is to raise standards for all our children. That means fighting far more vigorously against that small minority which believes that the principal purpose of education is to instil contempt for democratic institutions. That is not education, it is political propaganda, and I see no reason why you and I and every other taxpayer should pay for it. These destroyers would also destroy respect for our laws and the order on which a civilised society is based.People have asked me whether I am going to make the fight against crime an issue at the next election. No, I am not going to make it an issue. It is the people of Britain who are going to make it an issue. The old people in our city centres who are frightened to go out at night are going to make it an issue. The taxpayers and ratepayers who have to meet the bills for mindless vandalism - they are going to make it an issue. The parents, worried sick when their children go out on their own - they are going to make it an issue.Yes, law and order will be an issue, and it will be a vital issue, at the election. If anyone thinks that is Right-wing, they should talk to the workers in the factories and the women at the supermarket.The next Conservative Government will give more resources to the police. They are under-manned and poorly paid. We will bring them up to strength. We will give them the money to do the job. I do not intend to sit on the sidelines wringing my hands while London, Glasgow, Manchester, Birmingham and the rest of our cities go the way of New York.But if the violence in Britain is deeply disturbing, it is nothing to what has been endured by the people of Northern Ireland for nearly ten years. What happens in Ulster touches us all; it is part of our country, our United Kingdom. So let the people of Ulster be assured of this: the Conservative Party stands rock firm for the union of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.Today I would like to express our deep and lasting admiration for Betty Williams and Mairead Corrigan, the Belfast Peace Women who have been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Their courage symbolises to us and to the whole Western World the yearning of the people of Ulster for peace.We honour with them the Royal Ulster Constabulary, the Ulster Defence Regiment and our servicemen in Northern Ireland. I only wish that all the members of our armed forces who defend freedom there and in other parts of the world had a higher place in Socialist priorities. The Labour Party have cut present and future spending on defence by the staggering figure of £8 billion. What sort of Government is it that so neglects the welfare of our servicemen? What sort of Government forces front-line soldiers into claiming rent rebates and makes many of them worse off than people who do not even try to work at all?Our armed forces are poorly paid. They are denied the equipment, the stores, the back-up and the training that they know are vital to the job they do. Worse, they see the anti-Western wing of the Labour Party calling for still more gigantic cuts in defence, which a former Labour Defence Secretary said would mean, at best, neutrality and at worst, surrender. We have a Government that neglects our defences, a Government that lets down NATO so badly that our allies have rebuked it publicly. What a disgrace! A Government which spends money on nationalisation while cutting spending on the defence of the Realm. As I promised President Carter last month, the next Conservative Government will give defence the high priority that it demands. The Conservative Government will see that our troops are properly paid, increase defence spending so that we can meet our obligations to our allies and, by strengthening the defence of the West, restore the morale of our fighting services.Let us not forget - our first duty to freedom is to defend our own. It was to that end and purpose that I entered politics, and two years ago, in this hall from this platform, I spoke to you for the first time as Leader of our Party. I remember well my nervousness, and pride, as I tried to tell you something of my personal vision and my hopes for our country and our people. I felt deeply my responsibility then. Today I feel it even more deeply. For much has happened between those two Octobers. Two years ago I spoke of a man\u2019s right to work as he will, to spend what he earns, to own property, to have the State as servant and not as master. And today the threat to those democratic values has doubled and redoubled.I know only too well, as I go about the country, the fears felt for our British way of life. I know it from the letters I receive. And I know how many hopes ride with us today the hopes of millions who are Conservative, and millions who are not, but who look to us because they feel instinctively that what is happening to their country threatens not only their freedom but everything that made it materially and morally great.Paul Johnson expressed it movingly and with a writer\u2019s clarity, the other day, when he resigned from the Labour Party. \u2018I have come to appreciate, perhaps for the first time in my life,\u2019 he wrote, \u2018the overwhelming strength of my attachment to the individual spirit. The paramount need to keep it alive, I now see, is so great as to override any other principle whatever.\u2019These are deeply anxious and disturbing days for those whose eyes are open and who value freedom, but provided we are alert and alive to the danger, then the human will of the growing and quietly determined majority must prevail. The responsibility that rests upon the Conservative Party is huge and humbling. But as autumn moves towards winter, and we brace ourselves for the great task that lies ahead, let us make this promise to the British people: We will discharge that task with all our strength and all our faith. We shall not fail our country. (Prolonged applause)

aVI must first thank you, Madame Chairman, for the wonderful heart-warming welcome. I confess that this is the biggest birthday party that I have ever had. I just do not know whether my parents had in mind the timing of the party conference, but if that is what is meant by family planning I am all for it.One of the distinguished members of my shadow Cabinet sent me a birthday card today and said \u2018Don\u2019t think of it as another birthday; think of it as another year spent mastering the intricacies of a rewarding and demanding life.\u2019 That seemed to me a pretty fair description of the job.Let us turn to the nation\u2019s business. Political life may be unpredictable. Dull it isn\u2019t. Last month the nation was privileged to watch on television the first broadcast ever to present a chronic case of cold feet as a noble act of patriotism. \u2018Let\u2019s see it through together,\u2019 said the Prime Minister in his now notorious announcement that there would be no election, \u2018in the national interest.\u2019Of course, by seeing it through together he meant seeing it through with Labour. I am inclined to think that the people of this country will reject that invitation the moment that they are given the opportunity. Whenever the moment comes we are ready. As soon as Parliament reassembles we shall do all we can as a responsible Opposition to end the present damaging uncertainty, to defeat the Government and to bring about a general election.But I must warn you that the dying days of this administration may well see one last wretched round of manipulation and manoeuvre, of private deals or public pacts or cosy little understandings - always, of course, \u2018in the national interest\u2019 - before the Government are finally dragged kicking and screaming, to the polls. If that should be the case, so be it. I believe that the longer they wait the harder they will fall. But the harder, too, will be our task of halting and reversing the decline of Britain. Our party offers the nation nothing less than national revival, the deeply needed, long-awaited and passionately longed-for recovery of our country. That recovery will depend on a decisive rejection of the Labour Party by the people and a renewed acceptance of our basic Conservative belief that the State is the servant, not the master of this nation.But the problems we shall face are daunting. After nearly five years of Labour Government living standards have just got back to where they were when they took office. The Wilson-Callaghan years have left Britain close to the bottom of every international league table in terms of prices, in terms of jobs, and, above all, in terms of what we produce and what we owe to the rest of the world. Where they have left our country in terms of self-reliance and in terms of self-respect, in terms of national security, I hardly have to tell you.That is the legacy of Labour, and no amount of whistling in the dark by the Prime Minister or the Chancellor can change it. There is only one service they can do the nation now. It is to stand not upon the order of their going, but go. The damage that they have done to Britain is immeasurable. Our ancestors built a land of pride and hope and confidence in the future, a land whose influence grew out of all proportion to her size, whose constitution guaranteed a balance between freedom and order which used to be the British hallmark and became a model for the world. That was the heritage they handed down to us.What would they think of Labour Britain today. A country in which people ask, \u2018Why work if you can get by without?\u2019 \u2018Why save if your savings are taxed away, or inflated away or both?\u2019; \u2018Why do a good job when you will probably make out just as well if you do a bad one?\u2019; \u2018Why bother to get extra qualifications when differentials and earnings so often depend on political muscle, not personal merit?\u2019At home we are a country profoundly ill at ease with ourselves, while abroad a darkening and dangerous world scene confronts us. This is not just a Conservative analysis, it is a view shared here and overseas not least by those who love this land and wish it well. In their franker moments even some Labour Ministers subscribe to it. \u2018Land of hope and glory, mother of the free\u2019 sounds as stirring and moving as ever, but it is less and less like the land we live in today. Why is that? What has happened to this country of ours that we thought we knew? It is not just a question of pinning down who is responsible, important though that is. The first step in clearing your mind about where to go is to understand how you got where you are.Does what has happened to Britain over the last four and a half years imply that we have been governed by remarkably foolish people? No, though you may be able to think of one or two who would qualify under that heading. Is it the result of having been governed by unusually wicked people? No. There have been enough good intentions to pave the well-worn path twice over. The root of the matter is this: we have been ruled by men who live by illusions - the illusion that you can spend money you haven\u2019t earned without eventually going bankrupt or falling into the hands of your creditors; the illusion that real jobs can be conjured into existence by Government decree like rabbits out of a hat; the illusion that there is some other way of creating wealth than by hard work and satisfying your customers; the illusion that you can have freedom and enterprise without believing in free enterprise; the illusion that you can have an effective foreign policy without a strong defence force and a peaceful and orderly society without absolute respect for the law.It is these and many other Labour fallacies that have brought Britain to where we are today. Of course it is true that things have not deteriorated quite so quickly since the crisis of 1976. It was then, you will remember, that Denis Healey was put on probation to the International Monetary Fund. A strange man, Mr. Healey. He seems to think that being put on probation is some sort of achievement demanding recognition. Someone ought to tell him that you do not give the man who sets fire to your house a medal just because he phones for the fire brigade.Last week at Blackpool he was boasting again about his success. He could see growing confidence throughout the economy. We are poised, he said, for another \u2018great leap forward.\u2019 But, he told the assembled comrades, there were two conditions which Labour had to fulfil to win the election. First, and I quote him again, \u2018we have got to keep inflation under control.\u2019 Agreed. \u2018And we have got to strengthen, not weaken the authority of Jim Callaghan in this movement and in this country.\u2019 Disagreed. \u2018Those,\u2019 said Mr. Healey \u2018are the things you have got to ponder before you cast your votes.\u2019 Well, the brothers pondered and then they voted. They voted overwhelmingly to throw overboard the government\u2019s whole economic strategy, and with it, according to the Chancellor, the Prime Minister\u2019s authority.The following day Mr. Callaghan tried to restore it by speaking of the Government\u2019s \u2018inescapable responsibility\u2019 to deal with the present situation. He said nothing about his own inescapable responsibility for bringing that situation about. That is the charge against M.r Callaghan. Ask Sir Harold Wilson and Barbara Castle what they thought of his \u2018responsibility\u2019 nearly 10 years ago when he fought tooth and nail against their plan for reforming the trade unions, for making them - yes - more responsible. \u2018In Place of Strife\u2019 they called it. The unions did not like it. Mr. Callaghan saw it straight into the waste paper basket. The road to Blackpool 1978 was opened in 1969 by Mr. Callaghan. He cut the tape, and so long as it suited him, he travelled steadily down the road he had himself opened without so much as a backward glance.In 1974 during the dispute with the miners how did he define responsibility then? I will tell you how. He went to Wales and said to the miners: \u2018I am here as chairman of the British Labour Party because I wanted to come into the mining valleys to place the Labour Party firmly behind the miners\u2019 claim for a just and honest wage.\u2019 What would he say, what would the people of this country say, if the chairman of our party had gone down to East London and announced: \u2018I am here as chairman of the British Conservative Party because I wanted to come to Dagenham to place the Conservative Party firmly behind the Ford workers\u2019 claim for a just and honest wage\u2019?Well, now that the boot is on the other foot, what will the Conservatives do to him? Let me put his mind at rest. We are not going to follow in his footsteps. We won\u2019t accuse him of union bashing. We won\u2019t support a strike in breach of an agreement. We won\u2019t act irresponsibly, and he knows it. Nor do we rejoice at his discomfiture, for his problems are the country\u2019s problems. But a man who whets the tiger\u2019s appetite cannot expect much sympathy when it turns and bites him.Today the nation has a Prime Minister whose party has disowned his principal policy and destroyed the chief plank in his election strategy. Until last week that strategy was simple. Labour would play its union card, the one called \u2018special relationship.\u2019 The idea was this. A group of union leaders would try to persuade the country that if they were not allowed to call the tune there would be no music. Mind you, no union leader ever said: \u2018I shall overturn a Conservative Government.\u2019 It was always the union next door that was going to do that. For Labour this device would have had one splendid virtue. It would have made it possible for every Labour candidate to say in effect: \u2018Suppose Labour has created more unemployment than any Government since 1945; suppose it has produced a stagnant economy; suppose it has doubled prices; suppose it has nothing to offer but more and more nationalisation, more and more State control. The fact remains that only it can keep the unions happy, and without this the economy will grind to a halt.\u2019That, in a nutshell, was to be the Labour case when the election came, but the election did not come. Blackpool came - and with it, the great illumination.Today, Labour\u2019s policies are at a dead end, economically and politically. This is not something to crow about. We do not hope for a country in ruins so that we can take over. We want to be elected so that we can do better, not because we could not possibly do worse.This country is looking for a sign that we can succeed where socialism has failed. Labour\u2019s dead end has to be our beginning. The idea that only Labour can talk to labour drowned in the sea at Blackpool. Let me now at our Conservative Conference start the Conservative dialogue.Here are the facts as I see them - and I am talking now straight to the union leaders.\u2018We Conservatives don\u2019t have a blue-print for instant success. There isn\u2019t one. But at least we start with this advantage.\u2018We know what not to do. That path has been clearly signposted.\u2018If a government takes too much in tax, everyone wants higher wages.\u2018If a government bails out those who bargain irresponsibly, where does the money come from? The pockets of those who bargain responsibly.\u2018If a government tries to level everyone down, with year after year of totally rigid incomes policies, it destroys incentives.\u2018If a government enforces those policies with the underworld sanctions of blackmail and blacklist, it undermines its own authority and Parliament\u2019s. \u2018For years the British disease has been the \u201cus\u201d and \u201cthem\u201d philosophy. Many in industry are still infected with this virus. They still treat the factory not as a workplace but as a battlefield. When that happens, the idea of a common interest between employers and employed flies out of the window and so does the truth that if your company prospers, you will too.\u2018Now, you the trade union leaders have great power. You can use it well or you can use it badly. But look at the position of your members today, and compare it with the position of workers in other free countries. Can you really say, can anyone really say, you have used your power well? You want higher wages, better pensions, shorter hours, more government spending, more investment, more - more - more - more.\u2018But where is this \u201cmore\u201d to come from? There is no more. There can be but there won\u2019t be unless we all produce it. You can no more separate pay from output than you can separate two blades of a pair of scissors and still have a sharp cutting edge.\u2018And here let me say plainly to the trade union leaders, you are often your own worst enemies. Why isn\u2019t there more? Because too often restrictive practices rob you of the one thing you have to sell - your productivity. Restrictive practices are encrusted like barnacles on our industrial life. They\u2019ve been there for almost a century. They were designed to protect you from being exploited, but they have become the chief obstacle to your prosperity. How can it be otherwise? When two men insist on doing the work of one, there is only half as much for each.\u2018I understand your fears. You\u2019re afraid that producing more goods with fewer people will mean fewer jobs, and those fears are naturally stronger at a time of high unemployment. But you\u2019re wrong. The right way to attack unemployment is to produce more goods more cheaply and then more people can afford to buy them. Japan and Germany, mentioned several times this week - and rightly so - are doing precisely that and have been for years. Both have a large and growing share of our markets. Both are winning your customers and taking your jobs.\u2018Of course, we in Britain see the German success and want it here - the same living standards, the same output, the same low rate of inflation. But remember, what they have also had in Germany is strict control of the money supply, no rigid incomes policy, less state control than we have, lower personal tax and unions which are on the side of the future, not re-fighting the battles of the past.\u2018We shall do all that a government can to rebuild a free and prosperous Britain. We believe in realistic, responsible collective bargaining, free from government interference. Labour doesn\u2019t.\u2018We believe in encouraging competition, free enterprise, and profits in firms large and small. Labour doesn\u2019t.\u2018We believe in making substantial cuts in the tax on your pay packet. Labour doesn\u2019t. We will create conditions in which the value of the money you earn and the money you save can be protected.\u2018We will do these things. That I promise you. We\u2019ll play our part, if you, the trade union leaders, play yours responsibly.\u2018Responsibility can\u2019t be defined by the government setting a fixed percentage for everyone, because the circumstances are different in every concern in the country, whether nationalised or free. It\u2019s up to you, the trade union leaders, to act realistically in the light of all the facts, as the government must do. If you demand too much, you will bargain your firm into bankruptcy and your members on the dole. And no one wants that. \u2018Our approach works in other countries which are doing far better than we are. It worked here during 13 years of Conservative government. You did better, Britain did better - infinitely better than today under Labour.\u2018Let\u2019s make it work again.\u2019That is our message to the unions.You can hear the same message in country after country.You can hear distant echoes of it even from Labour Ministers. It would be nice to think that this was due to an irreversible shift in the distribution of common sense. But it\u2019s really due to the nearness of an election and a swelling tide of protest from every taxpayer, every home owner, every parent in the land.I look forward to Labour\u2019s continuing conversion to good sense, and after the election, to their becoming a helpful Opposition in the new House of Commons.So far I have spoken mainly of the practical and material failure of the last four Labour years and how we shall start to put things right. Let me turn now to something deeply damaging to this country.Many of us remember the Labour Party as it used to be. In the old days it was at least a party of ideals. You didn\u2019t have to agree with Labour to understand its appeal and respect its concern for the underdog. Gradually over the years there has been a change. I have no doubt that those ideals, those principles, are still alive today in the hearts of traditional Labour supporters. But among those who lead the Labour movement something has gone seriously wrong.Just compare the years of Clement Attlee and Hugh Gaitskell with those of Harold Wilson and James Callaghan. Today, instead of the voice of compassion, the croak of the Quango is heard in the land. There may not be enough jobs for the workers, but there are certainly plenty of jobs for the boys.That is the house that Harold built, to which his successor has not been slow to add a wing or two of his own.Many in the Labour Party wonder what has happened to it. Socialism has gone sour. Today Labour seems to stand too often for expediency, for greed, for privilege, for policies that set one half of society against the other.There are many reasons for this. One stems from that least attractive of emotions: envy. This spirit of envy is aimed not only at those privileged by birth and inherited wealth, like Mr. Wedgwood Benn. It is also directed against those who have got on by ability and effort.It is seen in Labour\u2019s bias against men and women who seek to better themselves and their families. Ordinary people, small businessmen, the self employed are not to be allowed to rise on their own. They must rise collectively or not at all.Object to merit and distinction and you\u2019re setting your face against quality, independence, originality, genius, against all the richness and variety of life.You are pinning down the swift and the sure and the strong, as Gulliver was pinned down by the little people of Lilliput.A society like that cannot advance. Our civilisation has been built by generation after generation of men and women inspired by the will to excel. Without them we should still be living in the Stone Age. Without the strong who would provide for the weak? When you hold back the successful, you penalise those who need help.Envy is dangerous, destructive, divisive - and revealing. It exposes the falsity of Labour\u2019s great claim that they\u2019re the party of care and compassion. It is the worst possible emotion to inspire a political party supposedly dedicated to improving the lot of ordinary working people.From there it is but a short step to the doctrine of class warfare. The Marxists in the Labour Party preach that this is not only just but necessary and inevitable.But let me put this thought to you. If it is wrong to preach race hatred - and it is - why is it right to preach class hatred? If it is a crime to incite the public against a man simply because of the colour of his skin - and it is - why is it virtuous to do so just because of his position?The political organisation of hatred is wrong - always and everywhere. Class warfare is immoral, a poisonous relic of the past. Conservatives are as fallible, as human and therefore as given to making mistakes as the next man. But we don\u2019t preach hatred and we are not a party of envy.Those who claim that we are a class party are standing the truth on its head. So, too, are those who claim that we are racists. Our determination to deal with the very real and difficult problems of immigration control has inspired Labour to a shameful attempt to frighten the coloured population of Britain.Last month the Liberal leader added his voice to the chorus. No doubt in an effort to distract attention from his many deep and pressing problems, he too did his best - or worst - to pin the label of \u2018racialism\u2019 on the Conservative Party.I realise that a drowning man will clutch at any straw. But let me remind young Mr. Steel, millions of Conservatives were among those who spent five years of their lives fighting a war against racialism when he was still in short trousers.It is true that Conservatives are going to cut the number of new immigrants coming into this country, and cut it substantially, because racial harmony is inseparable from control of the numbers coming in.But let me say a word to those who are permanently and legally settled here, who have made their homes with us. Your responsibilities are the same as those of every other British citizen, and your opportunities ought to be.Compulsory repatriation is not, and never will be, our policy and anyone who tells you differently is deliberately misrepresenting us for his on ends.Many other smears and charges will be thrown at us as election day comes nearer. But let us not be too concerned, however large the lie or absurd the charge. They are a sign of our opponents\u2019 desperation. For instance, you may have noticed, and so, I suspect, has the public, how often these charges contradict one another. One moment it is said that we have no policy, the next that our policies would bring about every disaster known to man. One moment, Shadow Ministers are said to be notorious villains - well, here the \u2018villains\u2019 are. The next minute, they are said to be unknown. Unknown? There\u2019s a charge from a party with household names like - let me see, now - Stanley Orme, not to mention Albert Booth. But then, no one does, do they?Well, Mr. Prime Minister, if there are any unknowns in the Shadow Cabinet we are all looking forward to becoming a lot better known at your earliest convenience.Until then, national uncertainty continues, and with it the continued weakening of one of our most ancient and deep-rooted traditions - respect for and safety under the law. When a rule of law breaks down, fear takes over. There is no security in the streets, families feel unsafe even in their own homes, children are at risk, criminals prosper, men of violence flourish, the nightmare world of \u2018A Clockwork Orange\u2019 becomes a reality.Here in Britain in the last few years that world has become visibly nearer. We have seen some of the symptoms of the breakdown of the rule of law - the growth in the number of unsolved and unpunished crimes, especially violent crimes, overcrowded courts, an underpaid and undermanned police force, judges insulted by a senior Minister of the Crown. Sometimes, members of the Labour Party give the impression that as between the law and the lawbreakers they are at best neutral.We Conservatives are not neutral. We believe that to keep society free the law must be upheld. We are 100 per cent behind the police, the courts, the judges, and not least the law-abiding majority of citizens.To all those engaged in law enforcement we pledge not just our moral but our practical support. As for the law-breakers, whether they are professional criminals carrying firearms, or political terrorists, or young thugs attacking the elderly, or those who think they can assault policemen with immunity, we say this: \u2018You will find in the new Conservative Government a remorseless and implacable opponent.\u2019The Conservative Party also stands for the defence of our realm. I am often told that there are no votes to be won by talking about defence and foreign policy. Well, I intend to go on talking about them, especially with elections to the European Parliament approaching. And, unlike Labour, we shall work to make a success of our place in the community, and we shall not need to be prompted to honour our obligations to our NATO allies.It was nearly three years ago that I warned of the growing danger of Soviet expansion.  I was at once attacked by Labour\u2019s Defence Secretary and the Soviet leaders - strange company, you might think, for a British Cabinet Minister. What has happened since I made that speech?The Soviet Union, through its Cuban mercenaries, has completed its Marxist takeover of Angola; Ethiopia has been turned into a Communist bastion in the Horn of Africa; there are now perhaps 10,000 Cubans in that continent, a deadly threat to the whole of Southern Africa. And as the Soviet threat becomes stronger, so the Labour Government have made Britain weaker. It has cut our forces time and again. We now have only 74 fighter planes to defend our country. We lost twice as many as that during one week of the Battle of Britain.I am well aware that modern Phantoms have many times the firepower of the Spitfire or Hurricane, but how does that help if you run out of Phantoms? There is a minimum level below which our defences cannot safety be allowed to fall. They have fallen below that level. And I give you this pledge: to bring them back to that minimum level will be the first charge on our national resources under the Conservative Government.It will not be easy, but there are no short cuts to security. There are only short cuts to defeat. Conservatives too will see that our Armed Forces are properly paid. They do an indispensable job abroad and at home, not least in Northern Ireland.I spent three memorable and moving days in Northern Ireland in June. The constancy and patience of the men and women of the Province who have endured so much pain through 10 years of terror is something that I shall never forget. I know that there are those who say: \u2018Leave them to solve their own problems and bring our boys back.\u2019 To them I must reply: \u2018If you wash your hands of Northern Ireland you wash them in blood.\u2019 So long as Ulster wishes to belong to the United Kingdom she will do so. That is the policy of the Conservative Party and it will be the policy of the next Conservative Government.The next Conservative Government. I have spoken of what four years of Labour Government have done to Britain, materially and morally, at home and abroad. I hope that after this afternoon it will not be possible for anyone to say again that there is really not much difference between the parties. There is all the difference in the world, and if it is the will of the country we will show the country and the world what that difference is.May I end on a personal note? Long ago I learned two lessons of political life - to have faith and to take nothing for granted. When we meet again the election will be over. I would not take the result for granted, but I have faith that our time is coming and I pray that when it comes we use it well, for the task of restoring the unity and good name of our nation is immense.I look back at the great figures who led our party in the past and after more than three years I still feel a little astonished that it has fallen to me to stand in their place. Now, as the test draws near, I ask your help, and not only yours - I ask it of all men and women who look to us today, who share with us our longing for a new beginning.Of course, we in the Conservative Party want to win, but let us win for the right reason - not power for ourselves, but that this country of ours, which we love so much, will find dignity and greatness and peace again.Three years ago I said that we must heal the wounds of a divided nation. I say it again today with even greater urgency. There is a cause that brings us all together and binds us all together. We must learn again to be one nation or one day we shall be no nation. That is our Conservative faith. It is my personal faith and vision. As we move towards Government and service may it be our strength and inspiration. Then not only will victory be ours, but we shall be worthy of it.

aVMr. President, since we last met there have been one or two changes on the political scene. On that occasion, as you so aptly remarked, I spoke to you as Leader of the Opposition. I am very pleased with my promotion to Prime Minister. I much prefer this job to the other.I am, as you may know, the first ... research chemist to hold this great position, and I hope that where I have led, others may follow - but not too soon. I mean, there is no rush. In fact, if you are agreeable I hope to be with you for quite a while.The job you have given me is at once a supreme honour and the greatest possible challenge. Now, more than, ever, my responsibility is not only to the Party but to the nation. I know that you understand that and would not wish it otherwise. But before we turn to the tasks that face our country, perhaps we can allow ourselves, at this great Party gathering, a moment or two to rejoice, to say \u2018thank you,\u2019 and to remember.On Thursday 3rd of May, we won a great victory. Yes, it was a victory for realism and responsibility. It was also a victory for conviction and commitment - your conviction and your commitment. And it was a victory for loyalty and dedication - your loyalty, your dedication. Through the long years of Opposition you kept faith; and you will, I know, keep faith through the far longer years of Conservative Government that are to come.An election victory such as ours is impossible without teamwork. It\u2019s invidious to single out this or that person for praise. However, one or two special tributes are due. We owe a tremendous debt to all our agents who did so magnificently. And I must also thank Lord Thorneycroft. He has been one of the most outstanding Chairmen the Conservative Party has ever had. This year he added another chapter to his memorable record of service to our Party and our country.Finally I wish to say a personal thank you to someone who was and is always there to give strength and authority to our cause, not least in time of trouble. No leader of a Party can ever have been given more sound or more loyal advice than I have had from my friend and deputy, Willie Whitelaw. And my husband has been absolutely marvellous, too. The victory to which all of you in this hall gave so much was five years coming, but when it came it was handsome. We won with the largest swing since the war and the largest majority in votes.I was particularly pleased by the support we attracted: the largest trade union vote in our history; the young people, so many of whom saw no future under Labour and who turned to us; and all those who have voted Labour before and who, this time, voted Conservative.Winning an election is a splendid thing but it is only the prologue to the vital business of governing. The work that the new Conservative Government has begun is the most difficult, the most challenging that has faced any Administration since the war.We have not wasted time. Already we have the raised the pay of our police and Armed Forces, as we promised to do - and they deserved it. We have set in hand the sale of council houses and flats. In June, we introduced our first Budget. We brought down income tax throughout the scale. We took care to protect the pensioners again inflation. Next month\u2019s increases will be the largest in cash terms ever paid. And war widows\u2019 pensions have been relieved of tax altogether. At last they have received justice.But all this is only the beginning. For this Government, it is not the first 100 days that count - and they have not been half bad, as you, Mr. President, observed. It is the first five years - and the next five after that. We have to think in terms of several Parliaments.We have to move this country in a new direction, to change the way we look at things, to create a wholly new attitude of mind. Can it be done?Well, the people have taken the first step by electing us, some, like us, with passionate conviction; others, I do not doubt, more in hope than belief, their fingers tightly crossed. I understand their caution. So much has been promised in the past, so much has come to nothing, no wonder they are sceptical. And impatient. Already I can hear some of them saying: \u2018The Conservatives have been in five months. Things do not seem to be that much better. What is happening? Do you think the Conservatives can really do it?\u2019 We say to them this: Yes, the Conservatives can do it. And we will do it. But it will take time. Time to tackle problems that have been neglected for years; time to change people\u2019s approach to what Governments can do for people, and to what people should do for themselves; time to shake off the self-doubt induced by decades of dependence on the state as master, not as servant. It will take time and it will not be easy.The world has never offered us an easy living. There is no reason why it should. We have always had to go out and earn our living - the hard way. In the past we did not hesitate. We had great technical skill, quality, reliability. We built well, sold well. We delivered on time. The world bought British and British was best. Not German. Not Japanese. British. It was more than that. We knew that to keep ahead we had to change. People looked to us as the front runner for the future.Our success was not based on Government hand-outs, on protecting yesterday\u2019s jobs and fighting off tomorrow\u2019s. It was not based on envy or truculence or on endless battles between management and men, or between worker and fellow worker. We did not become the workshop of the world by being the nation with the most strikes.I remember the words written on an old trade union banner: \u2018United to support, not combined to injure.\u2019 That is the way we were. Today we still have great firms and industries. Today we still make much of value, but not enough. Industries that were once head and shoulders above their competitors have stumbled and fallen.It is said that we were exhausted by the war. Those who were utterly defeated can hardly have been less exhausted. Yet they have done infinitely better in peace. It is said that Britain\u2019s time is up, that we have had our finest hour and the best we can look forward to is a future fit for Mr. Benn to live in. I do not accept those alibis. Of course we face great problems, problems that have fed on each other year after year, becoming harder and harder to solve. We all know them. They go to the root of the hopes and fears of ordinary people - high inflation, high unemployment, high taxation, appalling industrial relations, the lowest productivity in the Western world.People have been led to believe that they had to choose between a capitalist wealth-creating society on the one hand and a caring and compassionate society on the other. But that is not the choice. The industrial countries that out-produce and outsell us are precisely those countries with better social services and better pensions than we have. It is because they have strong wealth-creating industries that they have better benefits than we have. Our people seem to have lost belief in the balance between production and welfare. This is the balance that we have got to find. To persuade our people that it is possible, through their own efforts, not only to halt our national decline, but to reverse it and that requires new thinking, tenacity, and a willingness to look at things in a completely different way. Is the nation ready to face reality? I believe that it is. People are tired of false dawns and facile promises. If this country\u2019s story is to change, we the Conservatives must rekindle the spirit which the socialist years have all but exhausted.Do we have the authority? Last month I was accused of \u2018waving a phoney mandate.\u2019 In a democracy the word \u2018mandate\u2019 does not imply that a voter has read and accepted his party\u2019s manifesto from end to end, and so not only knows, but is voting for, everything it contains. It would be absurd if it did.Not everyone who votes for a political party has read everything in its manifesto. Not everyone who votes for a political party has read anything in its manifesto. But when a voter takes his decision and slips his paper into the ballot box he does know broadly speaking what the party of his choice stands for. In these days of mass communication we can hardly help knowing, and those who voted Conservative know the principal policies we stood for, and that in voting for us they were voting for all those policies. That was and is our mandate, and we have every right to carry it out and we shall.Let us have a look at four economic issues because these were central to our Conservative campaign. They are inflation, public spending, income tax and industrial relations. These four are not four separate and distinct issues. You do not take them and discuss them separately on the sort of \u2018now I turn to\u2026\u2019 basis as though they had no relationship to one and other. They are closely related. You cannot cut tax unless you curb public spending. Ask the Chancellor. Ask the Chief Secretary. They know. They have the job of doing both. It is your tax which pays for public spending. The Government have no money on their own. There is only taxpayers\u2019 money. Of course, if we had the money we could all think of ways in which to spend it. Hospitals which should have been modernised years ago. More help for the elderly, the sick and the disabled. But Governments in one form or another already spend nearly half our entire national income. Mr. President, if Labour\u2019s lavish spending solved all problems, we would have no problems left to solve.So public spending and taxation are linked.And inflation is a major problem which cannot be cured without curbing public spending. If the Government overspends, and borrows or prints money to meet the deficit, then prices and interest rates will go on rising - there you have inflation - and the poor, and the pensioners, and the young home-buyers will all suffer.But there are some who think they have a right to contract out of the effects of inflation. If they are organised in a powerful union with enough muscle to impose their will on a suffering public.What madness it is, that winter after winter we have the great set-piece battles, in which the powerful unions do so much damage to the industries on which their members\u2019 living standards depend; the struggles for wage increases disregard output, profit or any other measure of success. They ignore the reality that there is an inescapable link between prosperity and production.Since 1979 began, scarcely a week has passed without some group calling for higher pay. Listening to the chorus of pay demands you might imagine that a one hundred per cent pay rise for everyone in the country would solve all our economic problems. But we all know that the only result would be doubled prices. No one would have more food, more clothing, more anything. The key to prosperity lies not in higher pay but in higher output. In 1979 you have all heard endless discussions about pay. How often have you heard similar discussions about how to raise output? The reason why Britain is today the third poorest nation in the European Community has little to do with pay, but it has everything to do with production. We hanker after a West German standard of output. The truth is very simple: West German pay plus British output per man equals inflation.And that is exactly what has been happening.The unions win pay awards their members have not earned. The company pays out increases it cannot afford. The prices to the customer go up. Government print the money to make it all possible and everyone congratulates them on their success as an honest broker, with or without beer and sandwiches, at Number Ten.It has been happening for years. The result has been the most uncompetitive industry, the lowest economic growth rate and the highest rate of inflation in the industrialised world. In the trade unions the lesson is drawn that militancy paid again, that the company did have the money. It did not. The Government just printed their way out of trouble - until next time round. This Government want the greatest possible co-operation with both sides and we will go a long way to get it. But we shall not - repeat not - print money to finance excessive pay settlements.Conquering inflation, controlling public spending and cutting taxes are the first three stages of a long journey, all inter-related. The fourth I mentioned is to make certain limited but essential changes in the law on industrial relations. We have to make these changes because as we saw last winter the law is out of keeping with the needs of the time. When the trade union movement began it set out to secure for its members a fair return for their work from employers. But today the conflict of interest is not so much between unions and employers as between unions and the nation, of which trade unionists and their families form a large part. It is the British people who have to bear the brunt of the suffering which strikes impose on society. We have to bring about a fair and just balance between a man\u2019s right to withhold his labour and the determination of a small minority to impose its will open the great majority.As a Government, as Jim Prior said yesterday, we cannot and will not coerce people, but we can and we must protect people from being coerced. And so, before the year is out we shall introduce legislation concerning secret ballots, secondary picketing and the closed shop.The majority of the unions\u2019 own rank and file, so many of whom helped to elect this Government, welcomed our proposals. I hope that the union leaders who have said that they will work with the elected government of the day will accept them too. The days when only employers suffered from the strike are long since past. Today strikes affect trade union members and their families just like the rest of us. One union can deprive us all of coal, or food, or transport easily enough. What it cannot do is defend its members against similar action by other unions. If schools and hospital wards are closed, if there is no petrol at the pumps, no raw materials on the factory bench, the trade unions are as powerless as the rest of society, and when the bills come in for the stoppage their members have to pay up too.Recently there was a strike which prevented telephone bills from being sent out. It is all right now, but wait until they come in. The cost of that strike to the Post Office is £110 million. It will have to be paid for by everyone who uses the telephone. £110 million loss, caused by a strike of only 150 people in a public service. What nonsense it is. The recent two day a week strike by the engineering union lost the industry £2,000 million in sales. We may never make up those sales and we shall lose some of the jobs which depended on them. And who will send up a cheer? The Germans, the Japanese, the Swiss, the Americans.Instead of exporting engineering goods, we shall have exported engineering jobs. And who will suffer? The members of the trade unions who caused these strikes. I think that the nation recognises, and has recognised for a long time, that trade union power is out of balance. That is why people are supporting us in legislating for trade union reform.Let me say a word about these matters. We place special emphasis on the secret ballot. We believe that the great power wielded by unions calls for greater accountability to their members. We are particularly concerned about the working of the closed shop. The closed shop, together with secondary picketing, makes it possible for small groups to close down whole industries with which they have no direct connection.Cross the picket line to do your job and you risk losing both your union card and your job, as Stan Sorrell said so graphically yesterday. He is a constituent of mine and one of the many union members who supports the Conservative Party so actively. During the engineers\u2019 strike, news reached London of a new resistance movement in East Anglia. Whole factories were actually working, but so afraid were the employees of the consequences that they dare not reveal their identity, or that of the company, to the media. Millions of British workers go in fear of union power. The demand for this Government to make changes is coming from the very people who experience this fear.It is coming from the trade unionists themselves. They want to escape from the rule of the militants. We heard this in the conference hall yesterday. They look to us to help them. Today trade unions have more power over working people and their families than any boss has. The irony is that unions can exist only in a free society. Those who seek freedom for their own purposes should not deny that same freedom to others.I have been speaking of the deep and difficult problems of industry - most of it big industry. But the future of this country depends largely on the success of small businesses. I would like to read to you a letter which I have received from a small businessman in the West Midlands. He put it so much better than I could. He wrote:'I thought I would write to you about the profound effect the change of Government has had upon one small businessman. In 1977, at the age of 38, I was so disillusioned with the Socialist regime and its policies that I could see no future for the small to medium business and sold my company to a large group and virtually retired. Financially this was a satisfactory state of affairs, but I yearned to get back into what I knew best. When your Government was elected, I hoped there would be a change of emphasis and indeed that is what has happened. The letterhead on which I write to you is of a new company which I have formed recently, and the biggest factor in its creation has been the steps which you have taken to restore incentive to work at all levels of the community. Not only can self-employed proprietors of small businesses keep more of the profits of those businesses but, more important, those good and hardworking employees who are patently worth a high level of wages are also feeling the benefit of more cash in the pocket, and it is now worth their while to work that bit harder or longer as the case may be.'He said this:'Please stick to your policy. It is the only way that we shall eventually solve our problems. It may be hard to bear in the short term, but I truly believe that the bulk of public opinion is now behind a return to the basic commonsense fact that the country as a whole cannot continue to be paid more and more money for less and less work.'Here we have proof that the policy is working. It is creating more wealth and more jobs. This is exactly the kind of person whom our Government seek to encourage. We rang him up to ask him if we could use the letter because it was so good and said that we would not dream of embarrassing him by revealing his name or anything like that. \u2018What\u2019 he said, \u2018non-attribution. I want to stand up and be counted.\u2019 It is small businessmen like this who, given the chance will provide more jobs and more wealth, and the only Government from whom they will get the chance is this Conservative Government.So far I have spoken of matters of absolutely vital concern to us here at home. But we have important responsibilities overseas as well, particularly Rhodesia. In his speech on Wednesday, Peter Carrington described the progress which has been made in our efforts to bring Rhodesia to independence with the widest possible international recognition. I understand and share your impatience to bring this about. The entire Government and party care deeply about the future of Rhodesia. There have been too many wasted opportunities.It is Britain\u2019s responsibility and Britain\u2019s alone to bring Rhodesia to legal independence. But it is also in Rhodesia\u2019s interests that we should bring as many other countries as possible along with us in recognising an independent Rhodesia. We undertook to give to Rhodesia the kind of independence constitution which we had given to our other former colonies. We have had a great deal of experience of independence constitutions. These constitutions had certain fundamental principles in common. Each also contained provisions designed to meet the country\u2019s own particular circumstances.Those same things are true of the constitution under which we are ready to give independence to Rhodesia. Bishop Muzorewa has already accepted that constitution. It must be in Rhodesia\u2019s interests, and it is an inescapable duty for the British Government, to do everything possible to bring an end to a war which has caused the most cruel suffering.What is the purpose of continuing this war? It cannot be to bring about majority rule; that has already been accomplished. If it is to win power, then those who wish to do so must be prepared to proceed democratically through the ballot box and not through the bullet.At Lusaka, the Heads of Government called for free and fair elections, supervised under the British Government\u2019s authority. We stand ready to do this. I think that we have some reason to be proud of what has been achieved since Lusaka. I trust that no one will now put that achievement in jeopardy. In view of what has been accomplished on the Independence constitution, the time for lifting sanctions cannot be far off. There is no longer any vestige of excuse for the conflict in Rhodesia to continue.Nearer home, in Europe, we are part of a Community of some 250 million people. It is no use joining anything half-heartedly. Five months after taking office we have done much to restore the trust and confidence that the last Conservative Government enjoyed with our partners in Europe, and which the Labour Government did not. We are a committed member of the Community. But that does not mean that we are content with the way all its policies work. If nothing is done we are faced in 1980 with the appalling prospect of having to pay £1,000 million more to our European partners than we receive from them, even though we have almost the lowest income per head in the Community.The hard-pressed British taxpayer will not stand for paying still more in order to reduce the tax bills of our wealthier Community partners. At the European Council in Strasbourg in June we persuaded the other Heads of Government to agree to tackle this problem. We shall expect to make very real progress at the next European Council at the end of November. I do not underestimate the problems that face us on the Budget, in fisheries, or in reforming the common agricultural policy. But equally we must not underestimate our opportunities as members of the Community. The future of Western Europe is our future too. What in the end are the objectives of the States which have come to make up the Community? The three most important are international peace and justice, economic prosperity and freedom under the law.We in Europe have unrivalled freedom. But we must never take it for granted. The dangers to it are greater now than they have ever been since 1945. The threat of the Soviet Union is ever present. It is growing continually. Their military spending goes up by 5 per cent a year. A Russian nuclear submarine is launched every six weeks. Every year the Russians turn out over 3,000 tanks and 1,500 combat aircraft. Their military research and development is enormous.The Soviet forces are organised and trained for attack. The Russians do not tell us why they are making this tremendous and costly effort to increase their military power. Heaven knows, they have enough to do on the consumer side. But we cannot ignore the fact that this power is there and growing. So far the North Atlantic alliance has preserved our freedom. But in recent years the Soviet Union\u2019s growing strength has allowed it to pull ahead of the Alliance in many fields. We and our allies are resolved to make the effort that will restore the balance. We must keep up all our defences, whether nuclear or conventional. It is no good having first class nuclear forces if we can be overwhelmed by an enemy\u2019s conventional forces. Deterring aggression cannot be piecemeal. If it is our effort is wasted.Recently, we and our allies have all become more and more alarmed at the number of modern Soviet nuclear weapons targeted on Western Europe. At the same time, NATO\u2019s own nuclear forces in Europe are out of date. We and our friends in NATO will soon have to decide whether to modernise our nuclear weapons. These will be difficult decisions for some of our allies, and we must expect to see the Soviet Union mount a powerful psychological campaign to prevent the Alliance from redressing the balance. We shall be looking very closely at President Brezhnev\u2019s recent speech to see whether it is the opening shot in that campaign or whether it is a genuine attempt to reduce tension in Europe.Nor will we neglect our conventional forces. Our most precious asset is the men and women who serve in our Forces. As you know, Mr. President, as our very able Secretary of State for Defence, we faced a grave situation on taking office. Recruitment was poor, and many of our most skilled and experienced Servicemen were leaving the Forces. We immediately restored the pay of the Services to its proper level, and we will keep it there.We have also taken steps to encourage the rebuilding of our Territorial Army and other reserve forces.After so much neglect it will take time to put right the weaknesses. Nonetheless, we must see that it is done. We owe it to our Servicemen and women who give our country such magnificent service. Nowhere has that service been more magnificent than in Northern Ireland. More than 300 of our Servicemen have given their lives there, and their bravery is matched by the courage of the Royal Ulster Constabulary and the Prison Service.It is hard to speak of Northern Ireland without emotion. One thinks of Warrenpoint, of Lord Mountbatten, of Airey Neave. To any who seek to advance their cause by violence, and who claim to be soldiers of an army fighting for freedom, let me say in the words of the Lord Chancellor, \u2018Such men are not soldiers. They are not an army. They are not fighting for freedom. They are fighting for chaos.\u2019We who believe in the one true freedom - freedom under the law - far outnumber and outweigh, in the strength of our resolve, those who set out to murder and to maim. No ends could justify such means. The act of murder can have no moral basis whatsoever.The British Government is doing everything possible to strengthen the security forces in the fight against the men of violence. Our goal is the same peace for which the Pope appealed so movingly during his visit to Ireland.To all the people of the Province of Ulster, I repeat this pledge: we do not forget you, we will not abandon you. We must and we will find a way of restoring to you more control over your own affairs. We must and we will find a way to peace for your deeply troubled part of our United Kingdom.We come to the closing moments of our victory Conference. It has been a Conference to remember, and it was a victory to remember.Throughout most of my life, the chief complaint against politicians has been that they shrank from telling the truth when the truth was in the least unpleasant or controversial, that they were inclined to woo when it was their duty to warn, and to please when it was their business to prophesy. Early in my career, I decided that that was one mistake that I would not make. My harshest critics will perhaps agree that I have succeeded in that modest ambition.For the complaint that they have against me is the opposite one - apparently I am inclined to speak my mind, even occasionally to nag.Today I have again pointed to the dangers as I see them and I have said what I believe the source of those dangers to be. But let us remember that we are a nation, and that a nation is an extended family. Families go through their hard times; they have to postpone cherished ambitions until they have the means to satisfy them.At times like these, the strength of the family is truly tested. It is then that the temptation is greatest for its members to start blaming one another and dissipating their strength in bitterness and bickering. Let us do all in our power to see one another's point of view and to widen the common ground on which we stand. As we close our conference, a caring and united party, I think for a moment of last week\u2019s events at Brighton. I think of those members of the Labour Party and trade unionists who see the movement they serve abandoning the ideals to which they have devoted their lives. They do not yet share our Conservative ideals - at least they think they do not - but they do want free and responsible trade unions to play an honourable part in the life of a free and responsible society. So do we.I give them my pledge that my colleagues and I will continue to talk to them, to listen to their views, so long as it is understood that national policy is the sole responsibility of Government and Parliament. In return I would ask every man and woman who is called on in the next few months to take part in disruptive industrial action to consider the consequences for themselves, their children and their fellow countrymen. But our supreme loyalty is to the country and the things for which it stands.Let us work together in hope and above all in friendship. On behalf of the Government to which you have given the task of leading this country out of the shadows let me close with these words: You gave us your trust. Be patient. We shall not betray that trust.

aVMr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen, most of my Cabinet colleagues have started their speeches of reply by paying very well deserved tributes to their junior Ministers. At Number 10 I have no junior Ministers. There is just Denis and me, and I could not do without him.I am, however, very fortunate in having a marvellous deputy who is wonderful in all places at all times in all things - Willie Whitelaw.At our party conference last year, I said that the task in which the Government were engaged - to change the national attitude of mind - was the most challenging to face any British Administration since the war. Challenge is exhilarating. This week we Conservatives have been taking stock, discussing the achievements, the set-backs and the work that lies ahead as we enter our second parliamentary year. As you said, Mr. Chairman, our debates have been stimulating and our debates have been constructive. This week has demonstrated that we are a party united in purpose, strategy and resolve. And we actually like one another.When I am asked for a detailed forecast of what will happen in the coming months or years, I remember Sam Goldwyn\u2019s advice: \u2018Never prophesy, especially about the future.\u2019 (Interruption from the floor) Never mind, it is wet outside. I expect that they wanted to come in. You cannot blame them; it is always better where the Tories are. And you - and perhaps they - will be looking to me this afternoon for an indication of how the Government see the task before us and why we are tackling it the way we are.Before I begin, let me get one thing out of the way. This week at Brighton we have heard a good deal about last week at Blackpool. I will have a little more to say about that strange assembly later, but for the moment I want to say just this.Because of what happened at that conference, there has been, behind all our deliberations this week, a heightened awareness that now, more than ever, our Conservative Government must succeed. We just must, because now there is even more at stake than some had realised.There are many things to be done to set this nation on the road to recovery, and I do not mean economic recovery alone, but a new independence of spirit and zest for achievement.It is sometimes said that because of our past we, as a people, expect too much and set our sights too high. That is not the way I see it. Rather it seems to me that throughout my life in politics, our ambitions have steadily shrunk. Our response to disappointment has not been to lengthen our stride, but to shorten the distance to be covered. But with confidence in ourselves and in our future, what a nation we could be!In its first seventeen months, this Government have laid the foundations for recovery. We have undertaken a heavy load of legislation, a load we do not intend to repeat because we do not share the Socialist fantasy that achievement is measured by the number of laws you pass. But there was a formidable barricade of obstacles that we had to sweep aside. For a start, in his first Budget Geoffrey Howe began to rest incentives to stimulate the abilities and inventive genius of our people. Prosperity comes not from grand conferences of economists but by countless acts of personal self-confidence and self-reliance.Under Geoffrey\u2019s stewardship, Britain has repaid $3,600 million of international debt, debt which had been run up by our predecessors. And we paid quite a lot of it before it was due. In the past twelve months Geoffrey has abolished exchange controls over which British Governments have dithered for decades. Our great enterprises are now free to seek opportunities overseas. This will help to secure our living standards long after North Sea oil has run out. This Government thinks about the future. We have made the first crucial changes in trade union law to remove the worst abuses of the closed shop, to restrict picketing to the place of work of the parties in dispute, and to encourage secret ballots.Jim Prior has carried all these measures through with the support of the vast majority of trade union members. Keith Joseph, David Howell, John Nott and Norman Fowler have begun to break down the monopoly powers of nationalisation. Thanks to them, British Aerospace will soon be open to private investment. The monopoly of the Post Office and British Telecommunications is being diminished. The barriers to private generation of electricity for sale have been lifted. For the first time, nationalised industries and public utilities can be investigated by the Monopolies Commission - a long overdue reform.Free competition in road passenger transport promises travellers a better deal. Michael Heseltine has given to millions - yes, millions - of council tenants the right to buy their own homes.It was Anthony Eden who chose for us the goal of \u2018a property-owning democracy.\u2019 But for all the time that I have been in public affairs that has been beyond the reach of so many, who were denied the right to the most basic ownership of all - the homes in which they live.They wanted to buy. Many could afford to buy. But they happened to live under the jurisdiction of a Socialist council, which would not sell and did not believe in the independence that comes with ownership. Now Michael Heseltine has given them the chance to turn a dream into reality. And all this and a lot more in seventeen months.The Left continues to refer with relish to the death of capitalism. Well, if this is the death of capitalism, I must say that it is quite a way to go.But all this will avail us little unless we achieve our prime economic objective - the defeat of inflation. Inflation destroys nations and societies as surely as invading armies do. Inflation is the parent of unemployment. It is the unseen robber of those who have saved.No policy which puts at risk the defeat of inflation - however great its short-term attraction - can be right. Our policy for the defeat of inflation is, in fact, traditional. It existed long before Sterling M3 embellished the Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin, or \u2018monetarism\u2019 became a convenient term of political invective.But some people talk as if control of the money supply was a revolutionary policy. Yet it was an essential condition for the recovery of much of continental Europe.Those countries knew what was required for economic stability. Previously, they had lived through rampant inflation; they knew that it led to suitcase money, massive unemployment and the breakdown of society itself. They determined never to go that way again.Today, after many years of monetary self-discipline, they have stable, prosperous economies better able than ours to withstand the buffeting of world recession.So at international conferences to discuss economic affairs many of my fellow Heads of Government find our policies not strange, unusual or revolutionary, but normal, sound and honest. And that is what they are.Their only question is: \u2018Has Britain the courage and resolve to sustain the discipline for long enough to break through to success?\u2019Yes, Mr. Chairman, we have, and we shall. This Government are determined to stay with the policy and see it through to its conclusion. That is what marks this administration as one of the truly radical ministries of post-war Britain. Inflation is falling and should continue to fall.Meanwhile we are not heedless of the hardships and worries that accompany the conquest of inflation.Foremost among these is unemployment. Today our country has more than 2 million unemployed.Now you can try to soften that figure in a dozen ways. You can point out - and it is quite legitimate to do so - that 2 million today does not mean what it meant in the 1930s; that the percentage of unemployment is much less now than it was then.You can add that today many more married women go out to work.You can stress that, because of the high birth rate in the early 1960s, there is an unusually large number of school leavers this year looking for work and that the same will be true for the next two years.You can emphasise that about a quarter of a million people find new jobs each month and therefore go off the employment register.And you can recall that there are nearly 25 million people in jobs compared with only about 18 million in the 1930s. You can point out that the Labour party conveniently overlooks the fact that, of the 2 million unemployed for which they blame us, nearly a million and a half were bequeathed by their Government.But when all that has been said the fact remains that the level of unemployment in our country today is a human tragedy. Let me make it clear beyond doubt. I am profoundly concerned about unemployment. Human dignity and self respect are undermined when men and women are condemned to idleness. The waste of a country\u2019s most precious assets - the talent and energy of its people - makes it the bounden duty of Government to seek a real and lasting cure.If I could press a button and genuinely solve the unemployment problem, do you think that I would not press that button this instant? Does anyone imagine that there is the smallest political gain in letting this unemployment continue, or that there is some obscure economic religion which demands this unemployment as part of its ritual? This Government are pursuing the only policy which gives any hope of bringing our people back to real and lasting employment. It is no coincidence that those countries, of which I spoke earlier, which have had lower rates of inflation have also had lower levels of unemployment.I know that there is another real worry affecting many of our people. Although they accept that our policies are right, they feel deeply that the burden of carrying them out is falling much more heavily on the private than on the public sector. They say that the public sector is enjoying advantages, but the private sector is taking the knocks and at the same time maintaining those in the public sector with better pay and pensions than they enjoy.I must tell you that I share this concern and understand the resentment. That is why I and my colleagues say that to add to public spending takes away the very money and resources that industry needs to stay in business let alone to expand. Higher public spending, far from curing unemployment, can be the very vehicle that loses jobs and causes bankruptcies in trade and commerce. That is why we warned local authorities that, since rates are frequently the biggest tax that industry now faces, increases in them can cripple local businesses. Councils must, therefore, learn to cut costs in the same way that companies have to.That is why I stress that if those who work in public authorities take for themselves large pay increases they leave less to be spent on equipment and new buildings. That in turn deprives the private sector of the orders it needs, especially some of those industries in the hard-pressed regions. Those in the public sector have a duty to those in the private sector not to take out so much in pay that they cause others unemployment. That is why we point out that every time high wage settlements in nationalised monopolies lead to higher charges for telephones, electricity, coal and water, they can drive companies out of business and cost other people their jobs.If spending money like water was the answer to our country\u2019s problems, we would have no problems now. If ever a nation has spent, spent, spent and spent again, ours has. Today that dream is over. All of that money has got us nowhere, but it still has to come from somewhere. Those who urge us to relax the squeeze, to spend yet more money indiscriminately in the belief that it will help the unemployed and the small businessman, are not being kind or compassionate or caring.They are not the friends of the unemployed or the small business. They are asking us to do again the very thing that caused the problems in the first place. We have made this point repeatedly.I am accused of lecturing or preaching about this. I suppose it is a critic\u2019s way of saying \u2018Well, we know it is true, but we have to carp at something.\u2019 I do not care about that. But I do care about the future of free enterprise, the jobs and exports it provides and the independence it brings to our people. Independence? Yes, but let us be clear what we mean by that. Independence does not mean contracting out of all relationships with others. A nation can be free but it will not stay free for long if it has no friends and no alliances. Above all, it will not stay free if it cannot pay its own way in the world. By the same token, an individual needs to be part of a community and to feel that he is part of it. There is more to this than the chance to earn a living for himself and his family, essential though that is.Of course, our vision and our aims go far beyond the complex arguments of economics, but unless we get the economy right we shall deny our people the opportunity to share that vision and to see beyond the narrow horizons of economic necessity. Without a healthy economy we cannot have a healthy society. Without a healthy society the economy will not stay healthy for long.But it is not the State that creates a healthy society. When the State grows too powerful people feel that they count for less and less. The State drains society, not only of its wealth but of initiative, of energy, the will to improve and innovate as well as to preserve what is best. Our aim is to let people feel that they count for more and more. If we cannot trust the deepest instincts of our people we should not be in politics at all. Some aspects of our present society really do offend those instincts.Decent people do want to do a proper job at work, not to be restrained or intimidated from giving value for money. They believe that honesty should be respected, not derided. They see crime and violence as a threat not just to society but to their own orderly way of life. They want to be allowed to bring up their children in these beliefs, without the fear that their efforts will be daily frustrated in the name of progress or free expression. Indeed, that is what family life is all about.There is not a generation gap in a happy and united family. People yearn to be able to rely on some generally accepted standards. Without them you have not got a society at all, you have purposeless anarchy. A healthy society is not created by its institutions, either. Great schools and universities do not make a great nation any more than great armies do. Only a great nation can create and involve great institutions - of learning, of healing, of scientific advance. And a great nation is the voluntary creation of its people - a people composed of men and women whose pride in themselves is founded on the knowledge of what they can give to a community of which they in turn can be proud.If our people feel that they are part of a great nation and they are prepared to will the means to keep it great, a great nation we shall be, and shall remain. So, what can stop us from achieving this? What then stands in our way? The prospect of another winter of discontent? I suppose it might.But I prefer to believe that certain lessons have been learnt from experience, that we are coming, slowly, painfully, to an autumn of understanding. And I hope that it will be followed by a winter of common sense. If it is not, we shall not be diverted from our course.To those waiting with bated breath for that favourite media catchphrase, the \u2018U\u2019 turn, I have only one thing to say: \u2018You turn if you want to. The lady\u2019s not for turning.\u2019 I say that not only to you but to our friends overseas and also to those who are not our friends.In foreign affairs we have pursued our national interest robustly while remaining alive to the needs and interests of others. We have acted where our predecessors dithered and here I pay tribute to Lord Carrington. When I think of our much-travelled Foreign Secretary I am reminded of the advert, you know the one I mean, about \u2018The peer that reaches those foreign parts that other peers cannot reach.\u2019Long before we came into office, and therefore long before the invasion of Afghanistan, I was pointing to the threat from the East. I was accused of scaremongering. But events have more than justified my words.Soviet Marxism is ideologically, politically and morally bankrupt. But militarily the Soviet Union is a powerful and growing threat.Yet it was Mr. Kosygin who said: \u2018No peace loving country, no person of integrity, should remain indifferent when an aggressor holds human life and world opinion in insolent contempt.\u2019 We agree. The British Government are not indifferent to the occupation of Afghanistan. We shall not allow it to be forgotten. Unless and until the Soviet troops are withdrawn, other nations are bound to wonder which of them may be next. Of course there are those who say that by speaking out we are complicating East-West relations, that we are endangering detente. But the real danger would lie in keeping silent. Detente is indivisible and it is a two-way process.The Soviet Union cannot conduct wars by proxy in South-East Asia and Africa, foment trouble in the Middle East and Caribbean and invade neighbouring countries and still expect to conduct business as usual. Unless detente is pursued by both sides it can be pursued by neither, and it is a delusion to suppose otherwise. That is the message we shall be delivering loud and clear at the meeting of the European Security Conference in Madrid in the weeks immediately ahead.But we shall also be reminding the other parties in Madrid that the Helsinki Accord was supposed to promote the freer movement of people and ideas. The Soviet Government\u2019s response so far has been a campaign of repression worse than any since Stalin\u2019s day. It had been hoped that Helsinki would open gates across Europe. In fact, the guards today are better armed and the walls are no lower. But behind those walls the human spirit is unvanquished.The workers of Poland in their millions have signalled their determination to participate in the shaping of their destiny. We salute them.Marxists claim that the capitalist system is in crisis. But the Polish workers have shown that it is the Communist system that is in crisis. The Polish people should be left to work out their own future without external interference.At every Party Conference, and every November in Parliament, we used to face difficult decisions over Rhodesia and over sanctions. But no longer. Since we last met the success at Lancaster House, and thereafter in Salisbury - a success won in the face of all the odds - has created new respect for Britain. It has given fresh hope to those grappling with the terrible problems of Southern Africa. It has given the Commonwealth new strength and unity. Now it is for the new nation, Zimbabwe, to build her own future with the support of all those who believe that democracy has a place in Africa, and we wish her well.We showed over Rhodesia that the hallmarks of Tory policy are, as they have always been, realism and resolve. Not for us the disastrous fantasies of unilateral disarmament, of withdrawal from NATO, of abandoning Northern Ireland.The irresponsibility of the Left on defence increases as the dangers which we face loom larger. We for our part, under Francis Pym\u2019s brilliant leadership, have chosen a defence policy which potential foes will respect.We are acquiring, with the co-operation of the United States Government, the Trident missile system. This will ensure the credibility of our strategic deterrent until the end of the century and beyond, and it was very important for the reputation of Britain abroad that we should keep our independent nuclear deterrent as well as for our citizens here.We have agreed to the stationing of Cruise missiles in this country. The unilateralists object, but the recent willingness of the Soviet Government to open a new round of arms control negotiations shows the wisdom of our firmness.We intend to maintain and, where possible, to improve our conventional forces so as to pull our weight in the Alliance. We have no wish to seek a free ride at the expense of our Allies. We will play our full part. In Europe we have shown that it is possible to combine a vigorous defence of our own interests with a deep commitment to the idea and to the ideals of the Community.The last Government were well aware that Britain\u2019s budget contribution was grossly unfair. They failed to do anything about it. We negotiated a satisfactory arrangement which will give us and our partners time to tackle the underlying issues. We have resolved the difficulties of New Zealand\u2019s lamb trade with the Community in a way which protects the interests of the farmers in New Zealand while giving our own farmers and our own housewives an excellent deal, and Peter Walker deserves to be congratulated on his success. Now he is two-thirds on his way to success in making important progress towards agreement on a common fisheries policy. That is very important to our people. There are many, many people whose livelihoods depend on it.We face many other problems in the Community, but I am confident that they too will yield to the firm yet fair approach which has already proved so much more effective than the previous Government\u2019s five years of procrastination.With each day it becomes clearer that in the wider world we face darkening horizons, and the war between Iran and Iraq is the latest symptom of a deeper malady. Europe and North America are centres of stability in an increasingly anxious world. The Community and the Alliance are the guarantee to other countries that democracy and freedom of choice are still possible. They stand for order and the rule of law in an age when disorder and lawlessness are ever more widespread.The British Government intend to stand by both these great institutions, the Community and NATO. We will not betray them.The restoration of Britain\u2019s place in the world and of the West\u2019s confidence in its own destiny are two aspects of the same process. No doubt there will be unexpected twists in the road, but with wisdom and resolution we can reach our goal. I believe we will show the wisdom and you may be certain that we will show the resolution.In his warm hearted and generous speech, Peter Thorneycroft said that, when people are called upon to lead great nations they must look into the hearts and minds of the people whom they seek to govern. I would add that those who seek to govern must in turn be willing to allow their hearts and minds to lie open to the people.This afternoon I have tried to set before you some of my most deeply held convictions and beliefs. This Party, which I am privileged to serve, and this Government, which I am proud to lead, are engaged in the massive task of restoring confidence and stability to our people.I have always known that that task was vital. Since last week it has become even more vital than ever. We close our Conference in the aftermath of that sinister Utopia unveiled at Blackpool. Let Labour\u2019s Orwellian nightmare of the Left be the spur for us to dedicate with a new urgency our every ounce of energy and moral strength to rebuild the fortunes of this free nation.If we were to fail, that freedom could be imperilled. So let us resist the blandishments of the faint hearts; let us ignore the howls and threats of the extremists; let us stand together and do our duty, and we shall not fail.

aVThank you, Mr. President, for that wonderful introduction, one so typical of your own generosity and your dedicated service to our cause.I turn now for a moment to another great servant of our Party. Six and a half years ago I asked Peter Thorneycroft to become our Chairman. Of course I was anxious whether he would agree to take on the very heavy responsibilities that go with the Chairmanship. But my anxiety was misplaced. He who had already given more than forty years service to our party wanted to do more. We all came to respect his wise judgement, his zeal for our cause, his breadth of vision and his devotion to the enduring honour of our country. It was typical of his magnanimity that he himself suggested that I should appoint a younger Chairman. I know that it is the wish of all us that we should send to Peter and Carla on the last day of our Conference a message of affection and of gratitude for the unique qualities which he placed unreservedly at the service of the Party in which he believes so deeply.And to our present Chairman may I say this: I want to let you into a secret. I asked Peter\u2019s advice about you. With that characteristic caution and understatement he said: \u2018I think he\u2019d do it rather well\u2019 - and so say all of us.This week in Blackpool we have had the grand assize of the nation. Once more the Conservative Party has demonstrated that it is the party of all the people. We are not here to manipulate millions of block votes in some travesty of democracy; nor were we drawn here by the tinsel glamour of a marriage of convenience. We are here as representatives of a myriad of different interests from every constituency in the land. We are here because we share a deep and abiding concern for the future of our country and our party.There has been strenuous discussion and dissent - I welcome it. For years as our Conference has assembled I have grown used to the charge that we are bland and anodyne, careful to avoid differences. I do not think that that is a charge that can be levelled at us this year.We have witnessed here this week a party conscious of its awesome responsibilities as Government at an immensely difficult time, difficult not only for us but for many other countries in the world as well, for we are not alone in our problems. The diversity of our Party is not a source of weakness; it is a part of our strength, for it is a reflection of the personal commitment that each one of us brings to the task that lies ahead.Let me say at once that I am glad that Ted Heath addressed our Conference and delighted that he will be helping us in the Croydon by-election.Our country is weathering stormy waters. We may have different ideas on how best to navigate but we sail the same ocean and in the same ship.I have listened to much of the debate that has taken place in this hall and, you know, I seem to have heard a good deal of what has been said to us around and, as you put it, Mr. Chairman, in your introduction, even beyond the fringe. This afternoon I want to draw together what seem to me to be the main strands of your wisdom and advice to the Government and to express some of your worries.First among these is the deep and heartfelt concern for the personal hardship and waste reflected in every factory closure and redundancy. I learnt from childhood the dignity which comes from work and, by contrast, the affront to self-esteem which comes from enforced idleness. For us, work was the only way of life we knew, and we were brought up to believe that it was not only a necessity but a virtue.The concern of this Conference is focused on the plight of the unemployed. But we seek not only to display and demonstrate that concern but to find and pursue those policies which offer the best hope of more lasting jobs in future years.To do that we must learn the lessons of the past in order to avoid the mistakes that led to the increase of inflation and unemployment in the first place. Today\u2019s unemployment is partly due to the sharp increase in oil prices; it absorbed money that might otherwise have gone to increased investment or to buying the things which British factories produce. But that is not all. Too much of our present unemployment is due to enormous past wage increases unmatched by higher output, to union restrictive practices, to overmanning, to strikes, to indifferent management, and to the mistaken belief that, come what may, the Government would always step in to bail out companies in difficulty. No policy can succeed that shirks those basic issues.We have to earn our living in a world which can choose between the goods we produce and those of other countries. The irony is that many of our people spend five days of the week making British goods and on Saturday go out and spend their earnings on goods produced abroad, goods made in countries which have embraced more modern technology and where management and workforce understand that they are on the same side.Oh, yes, unemployment is the most emotional issue in our country, and however much we may explain what has led to it we cannot alter the fact - (Interruption) - Yes, in this Conference it does matter; it matters enough not only for us to talk about it but to try to do something constructive about it.However much we may explain what has led to it, we cannot alter the fact that many people who worked loyally and well for firms up and down the country feel bruised and resentful when, after long and devoted service, they suddenly find themselves without a job.I understand this - I would feel the same. But that would make it even more inexcusable if any Minister, let alone the Prime Minister, were to deceive them with false hopes or spurious remedies. We are dealing with one of the most complex and sensitive problems of our time and neither rhetoric nor compassion is enough, and demonstrating will not help either.There have been many voices in the past few weeks calling on us to spend our way back towards a higher level of employment and to cut interest rates at the same time. It is a familiar treatment, and it has been tried by many different Governments these past thirty years.In the early days it worked well enough. In the 1950s a few million pounds of what we learned to call reflation earned a swift reward in jobs and output. But as time went on the dose required grew larger and the stimulus achieved grew less. By the 1960s it was needing hundreds of million of extra spending to lift some hundreds of thousands of our people back into employment. By the 1970s we found that after thousands of extra millions had been spent we still had unemployment at levels which ten or twenty years before would have been unthinkable. The trick had been tried too often. The people, as earners and consumers, had rumbled what the Government was doing to their money. They knew the Government was creating inflation and they took that into account in their wage demands. So all the extra money went into wages and prices and not into more jobs.So today, if we were to heed the calls to add another thousand million pounds to our plans for spending, we might thereby create an extra 50,000 jobs in two years time, and even those would be all too swiftly cancelled out by the loss of other jobs in private industry as the result of what we had done.The fact is that a good chunk of the higher taxes and the higher interest rates needed to find the money for the extra spending would come from the tills of every business in the land. \u2018Ah,\u2019 but we are told, \u2018don\u2019t put up the taxes or the interest rates - put them down instead.\u2019 In other words, \u2018print the money.\u2019 That way, I must tell you, lies a collapse of trust in sterling both at home and abroad, lies the destruction of the savings of every family. It would lead to suitcase money and penury as the sole reward for thrift. That is not what this Government was elected to do.But these problems are not peculiar to Britain. Governments all over the world are seeking to borrow on a scale hitherto unknown, and that is why interest rates in every major financial centre have been rising steeply. Indeed, if we had been members of the European Monetary System we might very well have found our interest rates going up long before this September.That is why it is not a question of choosing between the conquest of inflation and the conquest of unemployment. Indeed, as one of our speakers reminded us yesterday, we are fighting unemployment by fighting inflation. Of course there are those who promise success without tears. I wish they were right. Who more than the Prime Minister would benefit from an easy answer to our troubles? But they would not benefit because there is no easy answer - (Interruption). It makes it much more exciting, doesn\u2019t it? As the President said, it is like the Empire Loyalists when we were young and sitting down there.But if there were a way of beating inflation and unemployment by displeasing no one in the meantime, I should take it like a shot. I can tell you unhesitatingly that if I thought Britain could solve her problems more easily, if I found that world conditions opened up a less rugged road, I should not hesitate to take it. There would be no question of sticking doggedly to so-called dogma. I do not want to prove anything, except that Britain can once again succeed and that all of us can share in the fruits of that success.But, Mr. President, I cannot bow to the pressures to take a route which I know will lead us even further from that prospect. That is not obstinacy. It is sheer common sense. The tough measures that this Government have had to introduce are the very minimum needed for us to win through. I will not change just to court popularity. Indeed, if ever a Conservative Government start to do what they know to be wrong because they are afraid to do what they are sure is right, then is the time for Tories to cry \u2018Stop.\u2019 But you will never need to do that while I am Prime Minister.Mr. President, in the teeth of international competition British business is beginning to win the major orders that for too long went elsewhere. As the Chairman reminded us earlier this week, £1,000 million of British goods are sold abroad every week. In the last month alone Standard Telephones has won the £170 million contract for a telephone cable right across the Pacific from Australia to Canada - the longest contract that has ever been put out to tender. British Steel has gained contracts worth £70 million in the North Sea and across the world in Hong Kong. The Davy Corporation leads the international consortium to build the £1,250 million steelworks for India. Foster Wheeler has started work on a £140 million petrochemical plant in Greece. Great international companies like Texas Instruments, Hewlett Packard and Motorola are demonstrating their faith in Britain\u2019s future by choosing this country under a Conservative Government as the main location for their expansion.This is the way to get extra jobs - thousands of extra jobs - for Britain. That is the real recovery. And it is happening now. We are winning through.These are the headline-catching stories, but every bit as important to this Government is the health of the many small and thrusting businesses. We have already taken some sixty measures of direct practical help for small businesses. Indeed, our business start-up scheme is one of the most radical and effective in the Western World. Ten thousand new businesses are starting every month. From them will come so much of the new and lasting employment of the future. I salute their work and their enterprise and we all wish them well.But yes, I know. You have said it all week. Private business is still being held to ransom by the giant monopolist nationalised industries. And you are right. They do not price themselves on to the dole queues. They do that to other people. They do not have to match the competition. They have captive markets at their beck and call. While free enterprise prices are going up in single figures, prices in the nationalised industries are going up by 20 per cent.The fact is that only when we introduce the spur of competition in the State owned industries do they begin to respond to the needs of the customer. That is why, for example, Norman Fowler, when he was at the Ministry of Transport stripped away the veto powers of British Rail on bus coach licences. If you can travel now from Manchester to London or from Edinburgh to Bristol by road or rail at fares lower than when we took office that is thanks to Norman Fowler, just as it is thanks to Freddie Laker that you can cross the Atlantic for so much less than it would have cost you in the early 1970s. Competition works.You heard Patrick Jenkin speak of companies as different as Cable and Wireless and British Transport Hotels. I never thought that we should be able to make so much progress with denationalisation in these first two and a half years. And I can assure you that there will be more of these measures in the next session of Parliament.Mr. President, if this is dogmatism, then it is the dogmatism of Mr. Marks and Mr. Spencer, and I\u2019ll plead guilty to that any day of the week.But, you know, the thought does sometimes occur to me. If only we had never had all those nice Labour moderates - the sort that now join the SDP - we should never have had these problems in the first place. For it was the Labour moderates who nationalised those industries. They are the guilty men. And they have now shacked up with David Steel - although I do not think that Mr. Gladstone would have put it in quite those words. The Liberal leader seems to have quite a passion for pacts, associations, understandings and alliances - a sort of man for all fusions. But, of course, there is nothing wrong with pacts provided they are based on a broad identity of principle. But without any genuine common ground parties that cannot advance on their own two feet tend to be trodden on by their partners.The marriage is for one election only. After that either party can call it a day and go its separate way. Well, of course, nothing is for ever. But it is an odd couple that pencils in a date for divorce before they have even sat down to the wedding breakfast. Perhaps the caution is understandable. Little is known about the SDP, except that its four leaders were senior members of Labour cabinets of the 1960s and 1970s. And if the country is in difficulty today they played their part in bringing that difficulty about. And they have not repudiated their Socialism. Mr. Jenkins may remark that, good Lord, he has not used the word \u2018Socialism\u2019 for years, but he has not disowned it. Nor have his former Cabinet colleagues, the other leaders of the new party whom the Liberals are being asked to embrace.At a time of growing danger for all who cherish and believe in freedom this party of the soft centre is no shield, no refuge and no answer.As Quintin Hailsham said so vividly a few days ago, \u2018In a confrontation with the politics of power, the soft Centre has always melted away.\u2019 And when the soft centre SDP has melted away, we are left with the hard shell of the Labour Party.And make no mistake, the leadership of the Labour Party wants what it has always wanted, the full-blooded socialism that has been the driving force and purpose of its political life and leadership.Mr. Wedgwood Benn says that \u2018The forces of Socialism in Britain cannot be stopped.\u2019 They can be and the will be. We shall stop them. We shall stop them democratically, and I use the word in the dictionary sense, not the Bennite sense. What they cannot be is half stopped, least of all by those who for years helped to nurture and support them.Some of the most important things in life are beyond economics. Last Sunday I visited the victims of the IRA bomb outrage in Chelsea, the kind of outrage that has occurred time and again in Northern Ireland. After seeing the injured children and young soldiers, the heartbreak of their parents and wives, one began to count one\u2019s blessings. For their world had been suddenly and cruelly shattered by the bombers and terrorists who are the enemies of civilised society everywhere.We are all in it together, because a breakdown of law and order strikes at everyone. No one is exempt when the terrorists and the bully boys take over. We look to the police and to the courts to protect the freedom of ordinary people, because without order none of us can go about our daily business in safety. Without order fear becomes master and the strong and the violent become a power in the land. This was why the first action after the riots in Brixton and Toxteth was to restore order. Nothing, but nothing, could justify the violence that we saw that week.I listened to every word of the debate on Tuesday. You made your views absolutely plain. Much as we are doing to support the police and uphold the rule of law you urge us to do even more. I will give you this pledge. Above all other things this Government are determined to maintain order and uphold the Queen\u2019s peace. Order depends upon discipline, overwhelmingly upon self-discipline. It is lamentable that the virtues of self-discipline and self-restraint that mark a mature democracy have lately been so little preached in some homes and schools that they have become so poorly practised in our society.It is when self-discipline breaks down that society has to impose order. It is in this sense that we Conservatives insist that Government must be strong, strong to uphold the rule of law, strong to maintain order, strong to protect freedom. This was the truth which our ancestors knew well, but which some of our generation have managed to unlearn. What is freedom if it does not include freedom from violence and freedom from intimidation?One of the most revealing things about the rhetoric of the Left is the almost total absence of any reference to the family. Yet the family is the basic unit of our society and it is in the family that the next generation is nurtured. Our concern is to create a property owning democracy and it is therefore a very human concern. It is a natural desire of Conservatives that every family should have a stake in society and that the privilege of a family home should not be restricted to the few.The fact that over 55 per cent own their own homes is a tribute to successive Conservative Governments, each one of whom have helped to build the property-owning democracy.It is now our turn to take a major step towards extending home ownership to many who, until now, have been deliberately excluded. Councils, particularly Socialist councils, have clung to the role of landlord. They love it, because it gives them so much power. So, more than two million families have seen themselves paying rent forever. Petty rules aid restrictions and bring enforced dependence. These are the marks of this last vestige of feudalism in Britain. It is the arrogance of the Socialist creed to insist that they know best. For them, equality of opportunity means their opportunity to make sure that everyone else is equal.Nowhere is this more true than in education. For every family the chance to give your children a better start than you had is one of the greatest joys. Yet we have been so obsessed with the reorganisation of education and with buildings and equipment that we have failed to concentrate on the quality and content of what is taught in our schools. This is precisely what is of greatest concern to parents and that is why this Government have given them so much more say in the way schools are run, so much more choice in which school to pick for their children, so much more responsibility for the next generation.But the best schools, and the best housing and the best education will avail us nothing if we lack the means or the resolve to defend the way of life of our people. For abroad, this is a time of danger. We face in the Soviet Union a Power whose declared aim is to \u2018bury\u2019 Western civilisation. Experience has taught us that threats such as we now face do not disappear unless they are met calmly and with ingenuity and strength. We cannot defend ourselves, either in this island or in Europe, without a close, effective and warm-hearted alliance with the United States. Our friendship with America rests not only on the memory of common dangers jointly faced and of common ancestors. It rests on respect for the same rule of law and representative democracy. Our purpose must be not just to confirm but to strengthen a friendship which has twice saved us this century.Had it not been for the magnaminity of the United States, Europe would not be free today. Nor would the peace have been kept in Europe for what is now thirty-six years. Assuming we hold this peace for eight more years we shall then have enjoyed a longer time free from European war than for two centuries. What a triumph for the Western alliance.One thrust of Soviet propaganda is concerned to persuade the world that the West, and the United States in particular, is the arms-monger, not the Soviet Union. Nothing could be further from the truth. But it is not surprising that the Russians have found a ready audience for none of us has any illusions about the horror of nuclear war and we all shrink from it. However, that should force us to consider what is the most likely way of securing peace. It is precisely because I believe that the unilateralists make war more likely that I seek another way.Should we more easily get the Soviet side to the table to negotiate disarmament if we ourselves had already renounced nuclear weapons? Why should they negotiate if we had already laid down our arms? Would they follow our example? There are no unilateralists in the Kremlin. Until we negotiate multilateral disarmament we have no choice but to retain sufficient nuclear weapons to make it clear to any would-be aggressor that the consequences of an attack on us would be disastrous for them.To those who want us to close down the American nuclear bases in this country, let me say this. We in Britain cannot honourably shelter under the American nuclear umbrella and simultaneously say to our American friends \u2018You may defend our homes with your home-based missiles, but you may not base those missiles anywhere near our homes.\u2019 The cost of keeping tyranny at bay is high but it must be paid, for the cost of war would be infinitely higher and we should lose everything that was worthwhile.It is in this dangerous world that Britain must live. She cannot escape it or retreat into an island bunker. Yet that is precisely what the Labour Party proposes. It has become the \u2018get out\u2019 party - to get out of our defence obligations, get out of our NATO nuclear commitments, and get out of the European Community.It is in European affairs that the contrast with the Conservative is particularly marked. When in power Labour did nothing to improve the European Community. In two and a half years this Government have slashed our budget contribution and set the Community on the road to far-reaching reform. It is vital that we get it right. Forty three out of every £100 we earn abroad comes from the Common Market. Over two million jobs depend on our trade with Europe, two million jobs which will be put at risk by Britain\u2019s withdrawal. And even if we kept two-thirds of our trade with the Common Market after we had flounced out - and that is pretty optimistic - there would be a million more to join the dole queues. That is only the beginning.American and Japanese firms are coming to this country to build factories and provide jobs for us, so that they can sell to the whole of Europe. If we came out future investors would not come here. They would go to Germany, France or Greece. Even those who are already here would not be satisfied with a market of fifty million \u2018cribb\u2019d, cabin\u2019d and confined\u2019 by import controls, customs duties and tariffs. They would up sticks and away. They would take their investment, their expansion and their jobs into the rest of Europe.For the unspoken assumption behind policies of withdrawal from the Community and unilateral disarmament is that others will continue to bear their burdens and pick up ours as well. Others would continue to accept our products, even though we refused to accept theirs, that others would continue to ensure the defence of Europe and provide a shield behind which we would shelter.What a contemptible policy for Britain. Nothing is beyond this nation. Decline is not inevitable. They say I\u2019m an optimist. Well, in this job you get called all sorts of things. An optimist is one of the nicer ones and I would not deny the label. I remember what our country used to be like and I know what we can become again. But first we must rid ourselves of the idea that the laws of economic gravity can somehow be suspended in our favour and that what applies to other nations does not apply to ours.We must finally come to accept what in some ways we have not accepted since the war - that although then, we, with superb defiance, helped the free world to survive, the world has not since then, and on that account, owed us a living.We in the Conservative Party know that you cannot get anything for nothing. We hold to the firm foundation of principle, grounded in common sense, common belief and the common purpose of the British people, the common sense of a people who know that it takes effort to achieve success, the common belief in personal responsibility and the values of a free society the common purpose that is determined to win through the difficult days to the victory that comes with unity. This Government, this Government of principle, are seeking the common consent of the people of Britain to work together for the prosperity that has eluded us for so long. There are those who say our nation no longer has the stomach for the fight. I think I know our people and I know they do.

aVMr. President, thank you for that splendid welcome. You\u2019re right. This has been a year of the unexpected, and in turning our thoughts to an issue which transcends party politics you do well to remind us of what happened in the spring of the year.This is not going to be a speech about the Falklands campaign, though I would be proud to make one. But I want to say just this, because it is true for all our people. The spirit of the South Atlantic was the spirit of Britain at her best. (hear, hear. Applause) It has been said that we surprised the world, that British patriotism was rediscovered in those spring days.Mr. President, it was never really lost. (applause) But it would be no bad thing if the feeling that swept the country then were to continue to inspire us. For if there was any doubt about the determination of the British people it was removed by the men and women who, a few months ago, brought a renewed sense of pride and self-respect to our country. (applause)They were for the most part young. Let all of us here, and in the wider audience outside, pause and reflect on what we who stayed at home owe to those who sailed and fought, and lived and died - and won. (applause) If this is tomorrow\u2019s generation, then Britain has little to fear in the years to come. (applause)In what by any standards was a remarkable chapter in our island history, it is they who this year wrote its brightest page. (applause)In remembering their heroism, let us not forget the courage shown by those same Armed Forces nearer home. We see them and the other forces of law and order display these qualities day after day in Northern Ireland. (applause) Yes, and even closer at hand. I have seen no more moving sight in the last year than the Blues and Royals bearing their tattered standard proudly past the spot in Hyde Park where their comrades had been murdered in a cruel and cowardly bomb attack only two days before. (applause)Terrorism is a deadly threat to our way of life, and we will not be cowed by it. We will continue to resist it with all our power and to uphold the principles of democratic government. (applause)Mr. President, I cannot remember a better Conference. Our debates have been lively, good-humoured - indeed, at one moment I was very proud to think that I had served in John Nott\u2019s Cabinet, (laughter) and quite relieved to know that the Secretary of State for Employment will in future have confidence in the Treasury forecasts about the cost of living. (laughter) He should. He actually compiles the index. He should be telling us. (laughter)They have been lively, good-humoured and humming with ideas, and they have tackled the real issues of the day.There have been two other Party Conferences before this, and perhaps I will have a word to say about them later. (laughter)First, I want to come to something that dwarfs party politics - indeed, to an issue that dwarfs every other issue of our time.We have invented weapons powerful enough to destroy the whole world. Others have created political systems evil enough to seek to enslave the whole world. (applause)Every free nation must face that threat. Every free nation must strain both to defend its freedom and to ensure the peace of the world.The first duty of a British Government is the defence of the Realm, and we shall discharge that duty. (applause)Ever since the War the principal threat to our country\u2019s safety has come from the Soviet bloc. Twenty-six years ago the Russians marched into Hungary. Twenty-one years ago they built the Berlin Wall. Fourteen years ago they re-conquered Czechoslovakia. Three years ago they entered Afghanistan. Two years ago they began to suppress the first stirrings of freedom in Poland. Oh, they knew the strength of the human spirit. They knew that if freedom were allowed to take root in Poland it would spread across Eastern Europe and perhaps to the Soviet Union itself. They knew that the beginning of freedom spelt the beginning of the end for Communism. (applause)Yet despite these regular reminders of the ruthless actions of the Kremlin there are still those who seem to believe that disarmament by ourselves alone would so impress the Russians that they would obligingly follow suit. (laughter)But peace, freedom and justice are only to be found where people are prepared to defend them. This Government will give the highest priority to our national defence, both conventional and nuclear. (applause)I want to see nuclear disarmament. I want to see conventional disarmament as well. I remember the atomic bombs that devastated Hiroshima and Nagasaki. I remember, too, the bombs that devastated Coventry and Dresden. (applause) The horrors of war are indivisible. We all want peace, but not peace at any price. Peace with justice and freedom. (applause)We seek agreement with the Soviet Union on arms control. We want to reduce the levels of both conventional and nuclear forces. But those reductions must be mutual, they must be balanced and they must be verifiable.Oh, I understand the feelings of the unilateralists. I understand the anxieties of parents with children growing up in the nuclear age. But the question, the fundamental question for all of us is whether unilateral nuclear disarmament would make war less likely.I have to tell you it would not. (applause) It would make war more likely. (applause) Aggressors attack because they think they are going to win, and they are more likely to attack the weak than they are to attack the strong. (hear, hear. Applause)The springs of war lie not in arms races, real or imaginary, but in the readiness to use force or threaten force against other nations. Remember what Bismarck said: \u2018Do I want war? Of course not. I want victory.\u2019 The causes of wars in the past haven\u2019t changed, as we know to our cost. But because Russia and the West know that there can be no victory in nuclear war, for thirty-seven years we have kept the peace in Europe, and that is no mean achievement. (applause)That is why we need nuclear weapons, because having them makes peace more secure. Yet at Blackpool last week, the Labour Party, by a huge majority, adopted a new official defence policy. It went like this: Polaris to be scrapped; Trident to be cancelled; Cruise missiles in service to be removed. It is now clear beyond doubt that given the change the Labour Party wants, they would dismantle Britain\u2019s defences wholesale.And yet do you remember how Aneurin Bevan pleaded with an earlier Labour Party Conference not to send a Labour Foreign Secretary naked into the Conference chamber? Well, it is a good thing that there isn\u2019t going to be a Labour Foreign Secretary. (applause)Yet the Labour Party wants to keep Britain in NATO, continuing to shelter behind American nuclear weapons - so long as they are not on our soil. What utter hypocrisy. To expect an insurance policy but to refuse to pay the premium. (hear, hear. Applause)There must be millions of Labour supporters who are thoroughly disheartened by what they saw at Blackpool last week. I say to them \u2018Forget about the Militant Tendency - come over and join the Tory tendency.\u2019 (applause)Mr. President, a strong and united Western alliance is a guarantee of our peace and security. It is also a beacon of hope to the oppressed people of the Soviet bloc. Mr. President, Britain is a reliable ally, and with a Conservative Government will always remain so - reliable in NATO, reliable beyond NATO, an ally and a friend to be trusted. And trusted not least by our partners in the European Community.Of course, ancient nations do not always find it easy to live together. Yet our commitment to the Common Market is clear. We are all democratic countries where freedom and the rule of law are basic to our institutions.At present, as you know, Britain pays quite large sums to Community partners often richer than we ourselves. That is fundamentally unjust. (applause) It is also short-sighted.As you know, we have just come to the end of our first three-year arrangement. We shall really have to fight - (smiles) courteously, of course (laughter) - to make sure that we have a fair deal for the future. But those who would pull us out of Europe must come to terms with the damage that that would do to our people. (hear, hear. Applause). Even the threat of withdrawal destroys jobs. Firms that invest in the Common Market often decide to come to Britain. Labour\u2019s threat to withdraw makes companies hesitate and look elsewhere. That Labour threat is losing us jobs now. (applause)Mr. President, the great economies of Germany and France, once the engine of growth of the European Community, are struggling with declining output and a growing army of unemployed. Across the Atlantic, the United States, Canada and the countries of Latin America, they have been faced with the most prolonged slump for fifty years. Even the miracle economies of the Pacific Basin - Japan, Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Singapore - even they are now being hit.But the economies of the Eastern bloc are in a far worse state, far worse state than the West. Poland and Romania are hard pressed to pay their debts, and the Soviet bloc countries generally are riven with shortages of everything, from seed corn to sewing thread.Of course, none of us foresaw a world recession of such gravity. Last week in Blackpool the Opposition suggested that I, single-handed, had brought it about. (laughter) What powers they attribute to me! (laughter, applause) If I had that sort of power I would banish recession forever. (laughter) But we\u2019ve no time for dreams and delusions. The main culprit, and there are others, is the greatest sustained inflation in modern times. Almost every developed country has suffered from it.For more than a decade economic growth has been thwarted. For more than a decade savers in America and Europe have been systematically robbed by the steady erosion of their savings and for more than a decade the ranks of the unemployed have swollen in the wake of inflation. In 1979 many of us in Europe began the long hard job of wringing inflation out of the system. As you know Governments had promised to do this over and over again. But when the going got tough they resorted to the printing press. No wonder people became cynical.Journalists, many but not all of them on the Left, were almost daily predicting U-turns. Some indeed, confidently went around the bend. (laughter, applause) Now most commentators, with attitudes varying from awe to rage, recognise that we are sticking to our policy. (hear, hear. Applause) Oh yes, we have been to the IMF. But unlike the last Government we went not as a nation seeking help but as a country giving help to others - a much more fitting role for Britain. (applause) From Socialist supplicant to Conservative contributor. (applause)With inflation falling, interest rates coming down, and honest finance, confidence is returning. In spite of hostilities in the South Atlantic, the exchange rate held steady. What a tribute to the determined and unruffled Chancellorship of Geoffrey Howe. (applause) No longer will the saver find his money devalued. No longer shall we have two nations, those who profit from inflation and those who lose by it. No longer will paper booms explode in confetti money.Mr. President, there is no road to inflation-free prosperity except through our own efforts. Two hundred years ago, Edmund Burke blamed the French revolutionaries for trying everywhere to \u2018evade and slip aside from difficulty.\u2019 He said they had a \u2018fondness for trickery and short-cuts.\u2019Mr. President, there are just as many evaders and short-cutters around today, in the Labour Party, the SDP and among the Liberals, taken jointly or severally, according to taste. (laughter, applause) Inflate a little here, expand a bit there; it\u2019s all so easy. Mr. President, in real life such short cuts often turn out to be dead ends. (applause)In the 60s and 70s the fashion was to say that the long term does not matter very much because, as Maynard Keynes put it, \u2018In the long run we are all dead.\u2019 (laughter) Anyone who thought like that would never plant a tree. (applause)We are in the business of planting trees, for our children and grandchildren, or we have no business to be in politics at all. (applause) We are not a one generation party. We do not intend to let Britain become a one generation society. Let us not forget the lesson of history. The long term always starts today.For, Mr. President, falling inflation on its own will not ensure growth and jobs. We need other things, too. Whether we like it or not, things are changing. They are changing in technology, as we have seen at this conference, with this thing that comes up. We (laughter) keep abreast of the times. They are changing on the map. Far-away countries scarcely heard of ten years ago now overtake us in our traditional industries. Suddenly we are faced with the need to do everything at once - to wake up, catch up and then overtake, even though the future is as hard to predict as ever.So we have to look as far into that future as we can, make sure that all the best talents are free to work at full stretch to help to lead this country into that future. Now Socialists believe that the State can do this better than individuals. Nothing could be more misguided. They are wrong. We can\u2019t opt out of the technology race and try to stand comfortably aside. If we were to do so we should lose not just particular products but whole industries. And we dare not leave our neighbours to inherit the world of the microchip. As one production engineer put it, \u2018The real threat in new technology is the threat of your worst enemies using it. Mr. President, inflation has not been beaten, even when prices stop rising. It is beaten only when costs stop rising. (hear, hear. Applause) That makes wage costs vital. Pay must relate to output, as every self-employed person will tell you. In the last five years of the 1970s the amount we in Britain paid ourselves for what we produced went up by nearly 100 per cent. One hundred per cent. In Germany their increase was only 15 per cent. In Japan it was zero - nought. Of course Japanese workers got more pay, but only from more output.So, they got the orders and we lost the jobs. The CBI put it starkly: \u2018Because we have lost over 100 per cent of the home market to imports.\u2019 I\u2019m sorry, that\u2019s not what they said. \u2018Because we have lost ten per cent of the home market to imports, and 2½ per cent of world export markets to our competitors in the last 12 years we have lost 1½ million jobs.\u2019One and a half million jobs - through losing a fair chunk of our home market to importers and a fair chunk of the export markets to our competitors. Now there is a challenge to management and unions. Get those markets back and we shall get our jobs back. (applause)And the public sector, well, as you know the Chancellor of the Exchequer has just announced 3½ per cent more available for next year\u2019s public pay bill. And before you say \u2018that\u2019s not much,\u2019 just remember, for the German civil service it is not going to be 3½ per cent but 2 per cent. In Japan, the Japanese civil servants are getting no rise at all. So maybe that will put the 3½ per cent in perspective.But it is important to keep wage costs down, to accept new technology. If it is important to do all that, then good management and good industrial relations are vital to our future. We heard a lot at Blackpool about how Labour would work with the unions. Of course, they don\u2019t really mean that. What they mean is a cosy get-togethers  at No. 10. That is the old pals\u2019 act. It has nothing to do with life on the shop floor and that is where the real problems are sorted out. (applause)When I travel overseas, time and again they say to me, \u2018Strikes. You have so many strikes. If it were not for that we would give you more contracts. We would invest more in Britain.\u2019 In vain do I say that private industry has very few strikes. But the fact is that the much publicised disruptions in the public sector do Britain down every time. (applause) I only wish that some of those trade union members on strike in the public sector would realise how many jobs their actions lose - oh, not necessarily their own jobs, but the jobs of people in manufacturing industries, whose taxes pay their wages. (applause) We can\u2019t say it too often  - \u2018Strikes lose jobs.\u2019Mr. President, it\u2019s going to take a long time to get employment up sufficiently, to get unemployment down as far as we all want. The task is even harder because we are going through a phase in Britain when the number of people of working age is rising.There are many more young people leaving school and wanting jobs than there are older people reaching retirement. Over a period of eight years there will be 1¼ million extra people of working age. So even without the recession we should have needed a lot more new jobs just to stop the number of unemployed rising. That shows you the magnitude of the task. Today\u2019s unemployed are the victims of yesterday\u2019s mistakes.Government destroyed jobs by fuelling inflation; trades unions destroyed jobs by restrictive practices; militants destroyed jobs by driving customers away. But that is the past and whatever the problems, we have got to tackle them, not with words, not with rhetoric, but with action. Rhetoric is easy but it does not produce jobs. (applause) Indeed, if rhetoric could cure unemployment we would have jobs galore by this time.Now for the future, you heard from Norman Tebbit that every 16-year-old who leaves school next year will either have a job or a year of full time training. Unemployment will not then be an option, and that is right. But, of course, the Government can\u2019t do everything.If we are to beat unemployment - and we must - we have to do it together. The Government\u2019s getting inflation down, interest rates down, reforming trade union law, cutting regulations and removing restrictions. The rest is up to industry, the work force and management in partnership. Because in the end it is private employers who will produce the great majority of jobs.Mr. President, time and again history beats out the same message. Competition is better for the consumer than State control. (applause) We are acting on that conviction. Three and a half years ago defenders of the status quo tried to brand denationalisation as irrelevant. Now the critics are finding it harder to ignore the evidence of their own eyes. They cannot help seeing the new, long-distance coaches speeding down the motorways, at very much lower fares. They cannot miss the success of Cable and Wireless or British Aerospace. Britoil will be the next to be denationalised and British Telecommunications after that. (applause) How absurd it will seem in a few years\u2019 time that the State ran Pickford\u2019s removals and Gleneagles Hotel. (laughter applause)Mr. President we are only in our first term. But already we have done more to roll back the frontiers of socialism than any previous Conservative Government. (hear, hear. Loud applause)And in the next Parliament we intend to do a lot more. (applause) And we are seeing increasing evidence of the savings that can be made. Local authority after local authority has found that even the prospect of contracting out their refuse collection produced amazing economies from their staff. (laughter) As Dr. Johnson nearly said: \u2018Depend on it, when you know you are going to be privatised in a fortnight it concentrates the mind wonderfully.\u2019 (laughter, applause)And I hope that every Conservative councillor in the land will act on what Councillor Chope of Wandsworth told us. (applause) Wandsworth has gone out to private contractors and down have come the rates. And don\u2019t we all want that. (applause) Where Wandsworth has led, let other Conservative councils follow.Mr. President I would like to say a word about the Health Service. Because value for money is just as important in the Health Service. Our opponents\u2019 picture of us as a party that doesn\u2019t care about the Health Service is utterly untrue, and is particularly ridiculous from the Labour Party. When they were in office they had nearly 2,000 fewer hospital doctors and 40,000 fewer nurses than we have, and every one of them was then much worse paid than today. But that same Labour Party now supports those who are disrupting the National Health Service and lengthening the very waiting lists that we have brought down. What sort of twisted compassion is that? (hear, hear. Applause)\u2018I believe that we should condemn industrial action with its damage to the Health Service, whether it comes from doctors, nurses or anyone else who works in the service.\u2019 Those aren\u2019t my words; that were the Labour Minister of Health\u2019s, David Ennals, when he was in charge. (laughter, applause) He supported him because it was true then, and it is true now. (applause) We have a magnificent record in the National Health Service. We heard that splendid speech from Norman Fowler in one of the best debates in this conference. (hear, hear. Applause) This year we are spending 5 per cent more in real terms on the Health Service than Labour, so under Conservatives we have more doctors, more nurses, more money. Hardly the behaviour of a Government bent on destroying the Health Service. (applause)Naturally, we have a duty to make sure that every penny is properly spent, and that is why we are setting up a team to examine the use of manpower in the National Health Service. Naturally we have a duty to do that. It is part of our duty towards the taxpayer. Of course we welcome the growth of private health insurance. There is no contradiction between that and supporting the National Health Service. It brings in more money, it helps to reduce the waiting lists, and it stimulates new treatments and techniques. But let me make one thing absolutely clear. The National Health Service is safe with us. (applause) As I said in the House of Commons on December 1 last: \u2018The principle that adequate health care should be provided for all, regardless of ability to pay, must be the foundation of any arrangements for financing the Health Service.\u2019 We stand by that. (applause)But Mr. President, it is not only in the National Health Service that our record has been very good. Next month the old age pension will go up by 11 per cent, and that despite the worst recession since the 1930s. That is some achievement too. (applause) Whatever our difficulties, nine million pensioners have been fully protected from inflation. We gave our promise and we\u2019ve kept it. (applause)But we do not measure our success merely by how much money the Government spends. The well-being of our people is about far more than the welfare state. It is about self reliance, family help, voluntary help as well as State provision. In a society which is truly healthy, responsibility is shared and help is mutual. Wherever we can we shall extend the opportunity for personal ownership and the self-respect that goes with it. Three hundred and seventy thousand families have now bought their own homes from councils, new towns and housing associations. (applause) That\u2019s the result of this Government\u2019s housing policy carried through in the teeth of opposition from the Labour Party. We have fought them all the way, and we won. (applause) Half a million more people will now live and grow up as freeholders with a real stake in the country and with something to pass on to their children. (audience) There is no prouder word in our history than \u2018freeholder.\u2019Mr. President, this is the largest transfer of assets from the State to the family in British history and it was done by a Conservative Government. (applause) And this really will be an irreversible shift of power to the people. The Labour Party may huff and puff about putting a stop to the sale of council houses. They may go on making life unpleasant for those who try to take advantage of their legal rights, and what a wicked thing it is to do that. But they do not dare pledge themselves to take those houses back because they know we are right, because they know it is what the people want. (applause) And besides, they would be making too many of their own councillors homeless, not to mention one or two of their MPs. (laughter)And we want to bring more choice to parents, too. Parents, we as parents have the prime responsibility to set the standards and to instil the values by which our children are brought up. (applause) And none of us have the right to blame the teachers for failing to make up for our shortcomings. (applause) But we have every right to be involved in what goes on in our children\u2019s schools. (applause) As parents we want to be sure not just about the teaching of the three Rs, but also about the discipline and about the values by which our children are taught to live. We have given parents more say in the choice of school. We have put parents on governing bodies. For the first time in modern Britain a Government is really paying attention not just to school organisation, but to the curriculum; not just to the buildings, but to what is taught inside them. (applause)And we are not afraid to talk about discipline and moral values. (applause) To us \u2018Law and Order\u2019 is not an election slogan. It is the foundation of the British tradition. And I believe that, looking back on this first Parliament of ours, it will be said that we have done more to support the police than any British Government since the war. (applause) There are more of them, we pay them better, we train them better and we equip them better, and for that you know who we have to thank. I am eternally grateful for the good sense, good humour and loyalty of Willie Whitelaw. (bows to WW; hear, hear, applause) Perhaps only I know how staunch he was throughout the whole of the Falklands Campaign, and the difficult decisions we had to take. Thank you very much. (applause)Mr. President, it cannot be the police alone who are on duty. As parents, as teachers, as politicians and as citizens, what we say and do, whether in the home, the classroom or the House of Commons is bound to leave its mark on the next generation. The television producer who glamorises violence may find his viewing figures ultimately reflected in the crime statistics. (applause) And a public figure who comments to the camera on issues of the day should be especially careful what he says. (applause)The other day, the last Labour Prime Minister - and I do mean \u2018the last Labour Prime Minister\u2019 (laughter) - spoke of what he called \u2018a contingent right\u2019 in certain circumstances to break the law. Mr. President, none of us has a right, contingent or otherwise, to uphold the law that suits us and to break the one that does not. (loud applause) That way lies anarchy. (hear, hear) The last Labour Prime Minister. (laughter)Mr. President, there are many people in Britain who share the hopes and the ideals of the Conservative Party. They share our great purpose to restore to this country its influence and self-respect. But they are anxious about the future and uncertain about the changes that we have had to make. They have not recognised how far the debating ground of British politics has moved to the Left over the last thirty years. Where the Left stood yesterday, the Centre stands today. Yet the British people haven\u2019t moved with it. Instinctively they know that we have to pull this country back to the real centre again. (applause) But the anxious say to us \u2018You really cannot do everything at once. The recession and the international economic situation make things particularly difficult. Why not adapt your approach a little, give in for the time being, till things are getting better and then you can start again after the election, next election when you have longer time to do it.\u2019Mr. President, to do that would be a betrayal. (applause) People in Britain have grown to understand that this Government will make no false promises, nor will it fail in its resolve. How can the Government urge the people to save and build for tomorrow if the people know that that same Government is willing to bend and trim for the sake of votes today? (applause) That\u2019s not trusting the people, and it is not the way to be trusted by them. Nothing could be more damaging to our prospects as a nation if this Government to throw away the reputation it has earned for constancy and resolve. It would throw away three years of hard-won achievement.On what moral basis would we be entitled to ask for the nation\u2019s support next time? Mr. President, the only way we can achieve great things for Britain is by asking great things of Britain. (applause) We will not disguise our purpose, nor betray our principles. We will do what must be done. We will tell the people the truth and the people will be our judge. (ovation)

aVWe meet in the aftermath of a General Election. I think we can say that the result was not exactly a photo-finish. We are grateful for victory. We are grateful to you and the thousands of people in every part of the country who worked so hard to ensure success. We thank you all, and we do not forget today [Cecil Parkinson] the man who so brilliantly organised the campaign.Last June we again won the honour to serve the British people. How best shall we do it? Not by being complacent about our majority, nor by assuming that our past achievements will automatically bring us future success. Our first four years were the preparation for further action. Further action there will be.When we were first elected in May 1979, it was to tackle the real problems which others had shirked. We did tackle them. Anyone who understood those problems never expected them to be solved in the space of one Parliament. We have made a start and we shall see it through.We were elected to bring inflation down. We brought it down. It was and still is a series of continuing battles which commands our unremitting effort. The pessimists told us it could not be done. They under-estimated three things: This Government, you, [Sir Geoffrey Howe] Mr. President, and the British people.We were elected to reform the trade unions. With the support of millions of trade unionists, we have passed two major acts of Parliament. And what a lot we owe to Norman Tebbit. But there is a lot more to do, a great deal more, and you can rely on us to do it.We were elected to extend home ownership, and we gave council tenants the right to buy their own homes. And never let it be forgotten that Labour fought it tooth and nail in their local councils, in Parliament and through the courts. It was not part of their philosophy that council tenants should acquire the rights and dignity of freeholders. It is because of Conservative conviction and persistence that nearly three quarters of a million more council tenants have either bought or are buying their homes, and with Ian Gow as Minister of Housing there will be many, many more.We were elected to reduce direct taxation. We have reduced the rates of income tax, and we have raised the thresholds. But there are still too many people paying income tax and the burden is still too great. The fight for lower taxes will go on, and no one will fight harder to bring them down than our new Chancellor of the Exchequer, Nigel Lawson.We were elected to strengthen the forces of law and order. Thanks to Willie Whitelaw, there are now more policemen, better paid, better equipped, than ever before, and more of them back on the beat. But as you heard from Leon Brittan, this Government is reinforcing its efforts. But it is not just a case of \u2018leave it to Leon.\u2019 Law and order is not just his problem - it involves every citizen in the land. None of us can opt out.We were elected with a clear commitment to the European Community and to fight tenaciously for British interests within it. We have honoured that commitment. We have both fought for our interests and extended our influence. But we are not half-hearted members of the Community. We are in, and we are in to stay. And I look forward to another famous victory in the European elections next June.We were elected to secure the defence of the Realm. We have made clear through word and deed, to friend and foe alike, our resolve to keep Britain strong and free. No one doubts now that this country, under this Government, stands shoulder to shoulder with her allies to defend the cause of justice and freedom and to work together for peace. Under Michael Heseltine\u2019s vigorous leadership we won the argument against one-sided nuclear disarmament.That is the record we put before the British people at the General Election. They are the ultimate jury, and they found in our favour.These things were achieved by strong Government, strong to do what only Governments can do. But a strong Government knows where to draw the line. It has the confidence to trust the people. And a free people know that the power of Government must be limited. That trust and that confidence are the hallmark of the Government which was re-elected on 9th June.At that election, Socialism offered yesterday\u2019s policies for today\u2019s problems. Socialism was routed. The other day at Brighton they were given a re-spray, polished and offered once again to the people. But they are still yesterday\u2019s policies, and even yesterday they did not work.Our people will never keep the Red Flag flying here. There is only one banner that Britain flies, the one that has kept flying for centuries - the red, white and blue.One of the great debates of our time is about how much of your money should be spent by the State and how much you should keep to spend on your family. Let us never forget this fundamental truth: the State has no source of money other than money which people earn themselves. If the State wishes to spend more it can do so only by borrowing your savings or by taxing you more. It is no good thinking that someone else will pay - that \u2018someone else\u2019 is you. There is no such thing as public money; there is only taxpayers\u2019 money.Prosperity will not come by inventing more and more lavish public expenditure programmes. You do not grow richer by ordering another cheque book from the Bank. No nation ever grew more prosperous by taxing its citizens beyond their capacity to pay. We have a duty to make sure that every penny piece we raise in taxation is spent wisely and well. For it is our party which is dedicated to good housekeeping - indeed, I would not mind betting that if Mr. Gladstone were alive today he would apply to join the Conservative Party.Protecting the taxpayer\u2019s purse, protecting the public services - these are our two great tasks, and their demands have to be reconciled. How very pleasant it would be, how very popular it would be, to say \u2018spend more on this, expand more on that.\u2019 We all have our favourite causes - I know I do. But someone has to add up the figures. Every business has to do it, every housewife has to do it, every Government should do it, and this one will.But throughout history clever men, some of them economists, not all of them rascals, a few of them vicious men, have tried to show that the principles of prudent finance do not really apply to this Government, this budget, that institution. Not so. They always do, and every sensible person knows it, no one better than you, Mr. President, who had to deal with countries which flouted those principles and are now up to their eyes in debt. Who do they turn to? Those who follow prudent principles like us.When there is only so much money to spend, you have to make choices, and the same is true of Governments. It is sometimes suggested that Governments can opt out of these choices. They cannot. Let me for a moment take the subject which we have so much debated, the Health Service.People talk about a \u2018free\u2019 service. It is not free. You have to pay for it. Five years ago, just before I came into No. 10, a family of four was having to pay on average through various taxes some £560 a year for the Health Service; this year that same family will have to pay £1,140 a year, more than double. Let me put it another way. This year, the Health Service is costing over £15,000 million - half the total yield of income tax.The Health Service has one million employees. It is the largest employer in Europe. It really is our job to see that it is managed properly.I pay tribute, as we all do, to those doctors, nurses and others who work so hard to keep up the standards of care. We are all grateful for the great advances in public health since the war: the continuing decline in child mortality, the virtual eradication of diseases like diphtheria and tuberculosis, and the miraculous new techniques of surgery.But every human institution can be improved. I reject totally the Socialist view that the most efficient organisation is the one that employs the largest number.Now let me get one or two things through about that budget. Let me put the facts on record just a little bit more. The Health Service budget is very large. We are not cutting it. We are keeping to the plans we announced before the election, and which I repeated as a pledge during the election. I will say it again. We are spending £700 million more on health this year alone, another £800 million next year, and a further £700 million the year after that. That is the pledge I made and that is the pledge that will be kept. And we have to keep within that huge budget. That is what good management means and that is what we are doing, as Norman Fowler explained in his outstanding speech yesterday morning.Of course our opponents could never begin to match our record, once again trying to pin on us all the adjectives in the dictionary of denigration - harsh, uncaring, uncompassionate and the rest. I am told that the new leader of Her Majesty\u2019s Opposition, and long may he hold that office, went so far as to say at Brighton last week that I was engaged in \u2018terminating the health service.\u2019Mr. President, let me tell you how you really terminate the health service. You do it by pretending there are no hard choices. You do it by behaving as though Britain has a bottomless purse. You do it be promising what you cannot deliver, by assuming that all you need to do is to snap your fingers, cry \u2018abracadabra\u2019 and lo and behold, the sky\u2019s the limit. But the sky is not the limit, for this or any other Government, or indeed for any other country, and to imply that it is or ever can be is sheer humbug and a fraud on the people.Our opponents would spend, spend and spend before they had even filled in the coupon, let alone win the pools. At this Conference last year you remember that I said the National Health Service is safe with us. I will go further. The National Health Service is safe only with us, because only this Government will see that it is prudently managed and financed and that care is concentrated on the patient rather than on the bureaucrat. That is the true and the genuine caring. When our opponents start demanding more spending on hospitals, schools, roads or for the old folk, I do not hear them at the same time calling for more income tax, or an extra 5 per cent on VAT or even more on local authority rates.In facing up to this problem of controlling public expenditure we in Britain are far from alone. Let me give you one or two examples of what is happening in other countries. In Socialist France they have introduced boarding charges for hospital patients. The French and the West Germans have delayed pension increases and are cutting unemployment benefit. In Holland they are cutting social security benefits and the pay of the public service by 3½ per cent. In Belgium and Denmark they have de-indexed social security benefits. Think what people would say in this country had we done some of those things.I do not say that these measures are the ones we should follow but I do say that no Government, whatever its political complexion, can suspend the laws of arithmetic or run away from reality.There is something else we share with other nations. The world recession has brought high unemployment to almost every country. In such times people understandably ask where will the new jobs come from. There is always a temptation to believe that the dynamism of the past will be exhausted and that the best we can hope for is to share out the work we have already got. Nothing could be more mistaken. That is not how our fathers and grandfathers transformed the standard of living in the western world. They did not wait for the boost or scan the horizon for the upturn. They were the upturn and they provided the boost themselves.If Britain had stayed as it was in 1900, millions of people in this country would still be working in agriculture and domestic service would still be at 1900 levels. If people had known then that by 1983 less than 3 per cent of the population would be in agriculture and only a tiny fraction in domestic service, they would surely have asked, \u2018Where will the other millions find jobs?\u2019 Who could have foretold then that what people would want today and what they would buy today? Who could have foretold then what inventiveness would produce decades hence? While some machines that were invented replaced unskilled work others created new goods undreamed of - motor cars, kitchen equipment, new fabrics, films - and these created, these new machines, thousands of jobs.But as new industries sprang into being the old ones declined, causing unhappiness and hardship. We did not then have the means or the organisation to temper the winds of change - the cash benefits, the retraining schemes, the redundancy benefits - that we have now. Tories have long been prominent in creating those schemes and benefits.Again and again Tory Governments took the lead; in extending unemployment insurance, in providing compensation for past industrial injury and disease and in bringing in training schemes for the future.In the declining industries we have made available compensation on a uniquely generous scale for those who have had to lose their jobs. Let no one accuse this party or this Government of failing to care about the unemployed. This Government has also taken two very far-reaching steps to see that Britain is never again left unprepared for technological change.Our youth training scheme is the most imaginative in the western world and when it is well underway every 16-year-old will have the choice either to stay on at school or to find a job or to receive training. At that age, unemployment should not be an option. That is our objective.We are responding to the needs of industry by reintroducing technical training into our schools - and not a moment too soon.This Government is building for the future. We all want a higher standard of living, as individuals and as a community. The same is true in other countries. The challenge we face is not one of sharing out the limited amount of work - like spreading butter thinly on a slice of bread. It is how to translate our wants and aspirations into work to be done by our people. It is by producing what people want to buy that unemployment will be solved.The same drive and inventiveness that created the great industries of the past and brought prosperity to our people are still at work today. New industries are still being born. New products are still coming onto the market. New services are still developing.Only last month I opened the largest oil production platform in the North Sea. Fifteen years ago the oil and gas industry, the offshore industry, employed only a handful of people. Today it employs more than 100,000. Who, 10 or 20 years ago, could have foretold that so many homes would have video recorders, which we are just beginning to produce here, music centres, home computers and pocket calculators? Who would have foreseen the revolution in office equipment and information technology? These may be called light industries but they produce tens of thousands of solid new jobs.In service industries too, the past 10 years has seen some of the most rapid increases in jobs. Let me give you a few examples because I know you are still wondering where the new jobs are going to come from, and I am trying to show you they have come from new machinery and new technology in the past, and that is still happening today. Let us have a look at the new service industries and see what has happened recently.Over 300,000 more jobs have been created in insurance, banking and finance than there were 10 years ago. There are over 600,000 more jobs in the scientific and professional services, over 200,000 more jobs in hotels and catering and nearly 60,000 more jobs in sport and other recreations. All of those are service jobs, for skilled and unskilled workers alike. So, as we have redundancies in the declining industries we are getting new jobs in the new industries, new jobs in some of the older industries that are modernising themselves, and new jobs in some of the service industries. They are being created by our dynamic economy of today.Let us not belittle our achievements. There must be quite a lot right about a country that can sell 30 per cent of its output in the teeth of fierce competition.And this is a country that can still export £1,000 million worth of goods every week, without counting oil. Which is the second biggest exporter of services in the world, second to the United States? It is Britain. So let us send our warm thanks and congratulations to all of those whose splendid achievements are bearing such fruit.But, although it is a marvellous record, we have to remember something else. Our competitors are improving all the time and some of them started well ahead of us. So we must improve even faster than they do if we are to catch up. It is no good just beating our previous best; we have to beat our competitors. That means that our Government must not put a heavier burden on our industry than other Governments place on theirs.What does that mean? I will tell you. It means we must stick to the policies that get inflation and interest rates down, which keep business taxes down, and local rates down, policies that cut through the thicket of restrictions and policies that will reduce the time taken for planning permission. It is important that we continue with each and every one. If Atlas carries the world on his shoulders, we need a good, strong Atlas and not too heavy a world.Our job in Government is to provide the right framework in which enterprise can flourish, and we are doing it. But, of course, it rests with the people themselves to pick up the challenge and it is in the people that we Conservatives place our trust.The great surges of progress and prosperity in this country did not come directly from Government action. They were not based on national plans. They came from free men, working in a free society, where they could deploy their talents to their best advantage for themselves, for their countries and for the future. That is our policy. It has worked in the past and it will work again. It is to achieve a new prosperity and the new jobs for our people in the future.The first duty of Government is to make our future and our way of life secure. In the election campaign it became clear that the overwhelming majority of our people were determined to see that our country was properly defended. They recognised that Britain\u2019s possession of nuclear weapons has helped to prevent not only nuclear war, but conventional war too. Those of our opponents who said the opposite hastily had to pretend that they did not really mean what they said.Those of our friends overseas, who might have doubted the resolve of the British people, were reassured by our victory. To retain peace with freedom and justice we must maintain the unity of NATO. Most of our people would never vote for a party that undermines NATO and snipes at our allies.The so-called peace movement may claim to be campaigning for peace, but it is NATO and the Western Alliance which have been delivering peace in Europe for more than 30 years. Peace does not come by chanting the word like some mystical incantation. It comes from that ceaseless vigilance which the Western Allies have sustained for nearly two generations. Peace is hard work, and we must not allow people to forget it.The Soviet challenge remains. To say that is not to welcome the fact and still less to take pleasure in it. But if we are properly to defend ourselves, we must first make a realistic assessment of the threat we face. No one can wish away the post-war history of the Soviet use of force, nor wipe out the grim calendar of Soviet suppression of freedom. You know the calendar almost as well as I do: 1953 East Germany, 1956 Hungary, 1961 the Berlin Wall, 1968 Czechoslovakia, 1979 Afghanistan, 1981 Poland, 1983 the South Korean civil airliner.The Soviet Union is unlikely to change much or quickly. Internal difficulties will not necessarily soften its attitudes. Nor should we overestimate the influence of the West on that vast, suspicious country. Its leaders are likely to remain distrustful and hostile to the West and ruthless in their international deeds. Economically, of course, you may say, we have nothing to fear. Whatever the difficulties, economies that flourish do so under the banner of the market and not of Marx.In the battle of ideas, the Soviet Union are in retreat as more and more peoples in Africa and Asia discover what Europe has already discovered - the cruel emptiness of Marxism. And, you know, the Russian leaders know this. Why else do they prevent their people from travelling freely? Why else do they jam Western broadcasts? Why else do they look away those of their fellow citizens who have the temerity to ask that the Soviet Union should abide by its undertakings at Helsinki?But whatever we think of the Soviet Union, Soviet Communism cannot be disinvented. We have to live together on the same planet and that is why, when the circumstances are right, we must be ready to talk to the Soviet leadership. That is why we should grasp every genuine opportunity for dialogue and keep that dialogue going in the interests of East and West alike. But such exchanges must be hard headed. We do not want the word \u2018dialogue\u2019 to become suspect in the way the word \u2018détente\u2019 now is. And a major element in that dialogue must be arms control. Indeed, we in the Western world would like to have arms reduction, provided always that the balance is kept and the undertakings to reduce or destroy weapons can be verified. Arms reduction in those circumstances, on those grounds; that is our aim.I think it is important that we understand exactly what kind of negotiations are going on in Geneva. We are negotiating about two classes of nuclear weapons - the intermediate weapons and also the long-range strategic missiles. Two sets of negotiations.Let me talk about the intermediate weapons first. Some six years ago, the Soviet Union began to replace hers by the more accurate SS20s which have three times as many warheads. We had nothing comparable, so NATO in 1979 decided to modernise our intermediate weapons with Cruise and Pershing II missiles in order to restore the balance. But at the same time we tried to persuade the Soviet Union to reduce the number of SS20s. There was no response.Then we offered to eliminate our missiles if they would eliminate theirs. If they agreed, no Cruise or Pershing II missiles would be deployed. That is President Reagan\u2019s zero option. Still there has been no positive response from the Soviet Union and all the signs are that there will not be. In that case, the first Cruise and Pershing II missiles will be deployed at the end of this year.Nevertheless, in Geneva we shall persist in our efforts for an agreement to keep the numbers as low as possible on both sides. No weapons would be better than some, but few would be better than more.Meanwhile, the whole situation has been deliberately clouded and confused by the Soviet propaganda attempt to suggest that our strategic weapon, Polaris, should be included in the intermediate weapon talks. Now, Polaris is our last resort deterrent. We had it long before the SS20s and then, and now, we need it in case we should ever be threatened by Russia\u2019s great arsenal of strategic weapons. And however you measure it, our strategic force amounts to only 2½ per cent of theirs; 40 of theirs to every one of ours.But there are separate talks in Geneva concerning strategic weapons. The Soviet Union and the United States have some 9,000 warheads each. In 1981, President Reagan suggested that as a first step the missile warheads should be cut on both sides by one third. Once again, there has been no positive response from the Soviet Union. But if ever this enormous strategic armoury were drastically reduced, then, of course, we should wish to consider how we in Britain could contribute to the arms control process.As you personally know, Mr. President, the West has made proposal after proposal for arms reduction, and the day the leaders of the Soviet Union genuinely decide that they want, through arms control agreements, to make this a safer world, they will be pushing at an open door. Until then, our threefold policy will be the same - realistically to assess the potential aggressor, firmly to maintain our capacity to defend and deter, and always to stand ready to talk.As I am sure you will understand, there is no one more anxious for genuine disarmament than the person who bears the ultimate responsibility for the nuclear deterrent in our own country. I wanted to say that to you. You will understand how important it is to me that we try to make these arms reduction talks succeed.We won a great election victory on 9 June and there is no reason on earth why we should not take pleasure in that alone, but I really believe that we have done more than that. The election showed that something remarkable has happened in this country - and our opponents were just as aware of it as those millions of people who supported us. What I think we discovered and expressed, both in our four years of Government and in the programme which grew out of these four years, was where the heart of the British people lies.We are a mature nation which, through centuries of trial, sorrow and achievement, has developed a common view of life. There are things for which we as a people have stood for centuries - the will and capacity to defend our way of life, the rule of law, the belief in private property and home ownership, the protection of the elderly and the sick, the limitation of Government and the freedom of the individual. And by giving voice to these convictions in 1979, by holding fast to them for four years, by having them reaffirmed in 1983, I believe we have altered the whole course of British politics for at least a generation. We have created the new common ground, and that is why our opponents have been forced to shift their ground. Both the policy and direction of State Socialism on which they have been fighting for years have been utterly rejected by our people. State Socialism is not in the character of the British people. It has no place in our traditions. It has no hold on our hearts.A Socialist party can only hope to survive in Britain by pretending that it is something else. We are told the Labour party is reassessing its attitude to home ownership and is thinking again about Europe. We are told the Social Democrats now see the virtues of capitalism, competition and the customer. We have entered a new era. The Conservative party has staked out the common ground and the other parties are tiptoeing on to it.The Conservative party has a greater responsibility than ever before. Now, more than ever, we draw our support from all sections of the nation. It is our pride and our purpose to strive always to be a national party - a party which speaks for and to the whole nation.In 1975, standing where I am standing today, I said that I had a vision for Britain - a Britain strong in the defence of peace and justice, a Britain strong in support of personal freedom, a Government strong enough to protect the weak, but a Government with the strength to allow people to lead their own lives.Visions do not become a reality overnight, or even in four years. They have to be worked for, consistently, unswervingly. We have set a true course - a course that is right for the character of Britain, right for the people of Britain and right for the future of Britain. To that course we shall hold fast. We shall see it through - to success.

aVThe bomb attack on the Grand Hotel early this morning, was first and foremost an inhuman, undiscriminating attempt to massacre innocent, unsuspecting men and women staying in Brighton for our Conservative conference. Our first thoughts must at once be for those who died and for those who are now in hospital recovering from their injuries.But the bomb attack clearly signified more than this. It was an attempt not only to disrupt and terminate our conference; it was an attempt to cripple Her Majesty\u2019s democratically elected Government. That is the scale of the outrage in which we have all shared, and the fact that we are gathered here now, shocked but composed and determined, is a sign not only that this attack has failed, but that all attempts to destroy democracy by terrorism will fail. I should like to express our deep gratitude to the police, firemen, ambulance men, nurses and doctors, to all the emergency services, and to the staff of the hotel, to our ministerial staff and the Conservative Party staff who stood with us and shared the danger.As Prime Minister and Leader of the Party, I thank them all and send our heartfelt sympathy to all those who have suffered.Now it must be business as usual We must go on to discuss the things we have talked about during this conference, one or two matters of foreign affairs and after that two subjects I have selected for special consideration: unemployment and the miners\u2019 strike.This conference has been superbly chaired - and our Chairman came on this morning with very little sleep and carried on marvellously. The conference, with excellent contributions from our members, has been an outstanding example of orderly assembly and free speech. We have debated the great national and international issues as well as those which affect the daily lives of our people. We have seen at the rostrum miner and pensioner, nurse and manager, clergyman and student.In Government we have been fulfilling the promises contained in our election manifesto which was put to the people in a national ballot. This Government is reasserting Parliament\u2019s ultimate responsibility for controlling the total burden of taxation on our citizens, whether levied by central or local government. And in the coming Session of Parliament we shall introduce legislation which will abolish the GLC and the metropolitan county councils.In the quest for sound local government, we rely on the help of Conservative councillors. Their task should never be understated and their virtues should not go unsung. They work hard and conscientiously with a true spirit of service. I pay special tribute to the splendid efforts of Conservative councils up and down the country in getting better value for money through greater efficiency and putting out work to competitive tender. This is privatisation at the local level and we need more of it.At national level, since the general election just over a year ago, the Government has denationalised five major enterprises, making a total of 13 since l979. Yesterday, you gave Norman Tebbit a standing ovation. Today our thoughts are with him and his family.Again and again denationalisation has brought greater motivation to managers and workforce, higher profits and rising investment. What is more, many in industry now have a share of the firm for which they work. We Conservatives want every owner to be an earner and every earner to be an owner. Soon we shall have the biggest ever act of denationalisation with British Telecom, and British Airways will follow. And we have not finished yet. There will be more to come in this Parliament.And just as we have stood by our pledge on denationalisation, it is our pride that despite the recession we have kept faith with nine million pensioners. Moreover, by keeping inflation down we have protected the value of their savings. As Norman Fowler told the conference on Wednesday, this Government has not only put more into pensions but has increased resources for the National Health Service. Our record for last year, to be published shortly, will show that the Health Service today is providing more care, more services, and more help for the patient than at any stage in its history. That is Conservative care in practice. I think that it is further proof of the statement I made in Brighton in this hall two years ago. Perhaps some of you remember it, \u2018The National Health Service is safe with us.\u2019 This performance in the social services could never have been achieved without an efficient and competitive industry to create the wealth we need. Efficiency is not the enemy but the ally of compassion.In our discussions here, we have spoken of the need for enterprise, profits, and a wider distribution of property among all the people. In the Conservative Party, we have no truck with outmoded Marxist doctrine about class warfare. For us, it is not who you are, who your family is, or where you come from that matters. It is what you are and what you can do for our country that counts. That is our vision. It is a vision worth defending and we shall defend it. Indeed, this Government will never put the defence of our country at risk.No one in their senses wants nuclear weapons for their own sake. But equally no responsible Prime Minister could take the colossal gamble of giving up our nuclear defences while our greatest potential enemy kept theirs. Policies which would throw out all American nuclear bases - bases which have been here since the time of Clem Attlee, President Truman and Sir Winston Churchill - would wreck NATO and leave us totally isolated from our friends in the United States - and friends they are.No nation in history has ever shouldered a greater burden, or shouldered it more willingly nor more generously, than the United States. This party\u2019s pro-American. We must constantly remind people what the defence policy of the Opposition party would mean. Their idea that by giving up our nuclear deterrent could somehow escape the result of a nuclear war elsewhere is nonsense. And it is a delusion to assume that conventional weapons are sufficient defence against nuclear attack. And do not let anyone slip into the habit of thinking that conventional war in Europe is some kind of comfortable option. With the huge array of modern weapons held by the Soviet Union, including chemical weapons in large quantities, it would be a cruel and terrible conflict. The truth is that possession of the nuclear deterrent has prevented not only nuclear war but also conventional war. And to us, peace is precious beyond price. We are the true peace party. The nuclear deterrent has not only kept the peace but it will continue to preserve our independence. Winston Churchill\u2019s warning is just as true now as when he made it many, many years ago. He said: \u2018Once you take the position of not being able in any circumstances to defend your rights against aggression, there is no end to the demands that will be made or the humiliations that must be accepted.\u2019He knew, and we must heed his warning. Yet Labour\u2019s defence policy remains: no Polaris, no cruise missiles in Britain, no United States nuclear bases in Britain, no Trident, no independent nuclear deterrent. There is I think just one answer the nation will give - no defence, no Labour Government.In foreign affairs this year has seen two major diplomatic successes. We have reached a detailed and binding agreement with China on the future of Hong Kong. It is an agreement designed to preserve Hong Kong\u2019s flourishing economy and unique way of life. We believe that it meets the needs and wishes of the people of Hong Kong themselves.A few weeks ago the unofficial members of the Executive Council of Hong Kong came to see me. We kept in touch with them the whole time and they have frequently made journeys to No. 10 Downing Street as the negotiations with China have proceeded. We were just about to initial the agreement, and we consulted them of course about its content. Their spokesman said that while the agreement did not contain everything he would have liked, he and his colleagues could nevertheless recommend it to the people of Hong Kong in good conscience. In good conscience. That means a lot to us. If that is what the leaders of Hong Kong\u2019s own community believe, then we have truly fulfilled the heavy responsibility we feel for their long-term future.That agreement required imagination, skill, hard work and perseverance - in other words, it required Geoffrey Howe.In Europe, too, through firmness and determination, we have achieved a long-term settlement of Britain\u2019s Budget contributions, a fair deal for Britain and for Europe too. If we had listened to the advice of other party leaders, Britain would not have done half as well. But patient diplomacy and occasionally, I confess, a little impatient diplomacy, did the trick.Also, we have at last begun to curb surplus food production in the Community. We know that for some farmers this has meant a painful adjustment and we are very much aware of their difficulties. Their work and their success are the great strength to our country. Michael Jopling and his colleagues will continue to fight to achieve a fair deal for them.We have also won agreement on the need to keep the Community\u2019s spending under proper control. The Community can now enter on a new chapter and use its energies and influence to play a greater part in world affairs, as an example of what democracies can accomplish, as a very powerful trading group and as a strong force for freedom.We had one of the most interesting debates of this conference on employment, which we all agree is the scourge of our times. To have over 3 million people unemployed in this country is bad enough, even though we share this tragic problem with other nations. But to suggest, as some of our opponents have, that we do not care about it is as deeply wounding as it is utterly false.Do they really think that we do not understand what it means for the family man who cannot find a job, who has to sit at home with a sense of failure and despair? Or that we do not understand how hopeless the world must seem to a young person who has not yet succeeded in getting his first job? Of course we know; of course we see, and of course we care. However could they say that we welcome unemployment as a political weapon?What better news could there be for any Government than the news that unemployment is falling? The day cannot come too soon for me. Others, while not questioning our sincerity, argue that our policies will not achieve our objectives. They look back 40 years, to the post-war period, when we were poised to launch a brave new world, a time when we all thought we had the cure to unemployment.In that confident dawn it seemed that having won the war, we knew how to win the peace. Keynes had provided the diagnosis. It was all set out in the 1944 White Paper on employment. I bought it then, I have it still. My name is on the top of it. Margaret H. Roberts.One of my staff took one look at it and said, \u2018Good heavens, I didn\u2019t know it was as old as that!\u2019 We all read that White Paper very carefully, but the truth was that some politicians took some part of the formula in it and conveniently ignored the rest. I reread it frequently.Those politicians overlooked the warning in that paper that government action must not weaken personal enterprise or exonerate the citizen from the duty of fending for himself. They disregarded the advice that wages must be related to productivity and, above all, they neglected the warning that without a rising standard of industrial efficiency, you cannot achieve a high level of employment combined with a rising standard of living.Having ignored so much of that, and having ignored other parts of the formula for so much of the time, the result was that we ended up with high inflation and high unemployment. Now, this Government are heeding the warnings. They have acted on the basic truths that were set out all those years ago in that famous White Paper.If I had come out with all this today some people would call it Thatcherite, but in fact it is vintage Maynard Keynes. He had a horror of inflation, a fear of too much state control and a belief in the market. We are heeding those warnings. We are taking the policy as a whole and not only in selected parts. We have already brought inflation down below 5 per cent. Output has been rising steadily since 1981 and investment is up substantially.But if things are improving, why, you will ask, does unemployment not fall? That was the question one could feel throughout that debate, even though people know that there is always a time lag between getting the other things right and having a fall in unemployment. Why does unemployment not fall?May I try to answer that question? First, more jobs are being created, as Tom King pointed out. Over the last year more than a quarter of a million extra jobs have been created, but the population of working age is also rising very fast, as the baby boom of the l960s become the school leavers of the l980s. So although the number of jobs are rising, the population of working age is also rising. And among the population of working age, a larger proportion of married women are seeking work.So you will see why we need more jobs just to stop unemployment rising and even more jobs to get it falling. On top of that, new technology has caused redundancy in many factories. But it has also crated whole new industries providing products and jobs that only a few years ago were undreamed of. So it has two effects. The first one is redundancies; the second, and slightly later, new jobs and new products become possible. This has happened in history before.A few days ago I visited York, where I saw the first railway engine, Stephenson\u2019s Rocket. I thought of the jobs, the prospects and the hope that the new steam engines and the railways then brought to many people. Communities queued up to be on a railway line, to have their station. Those communities welcomed change and it brought them more jobs. I confess I am very glad we have got the railways. If we were trying to build those same railways today, I wonder whether we would ever get planning permission, it sometimes takes so long. That is one thing that can sometimes delay the coming into existence of jobs.That was one example from history, but let us go through during my lifetime, as we had this same phenomenon - redundancies from new technology, more jobs from new technology. In the 1940s, when I took a science degree, the new emerging industries were plastics, man-made fibres and television, Later it will be satellites, computers and telecommunications. And now it is biotechnology and information technology. Today our universities and science parks are identifying the needs of tomorrow. So, there are new industries and new jobs in the pipeline.I remember an industrialist telling me when I first went into business, and I have always remembered it, \u2018Our job is to discover what the customer will buy and to produce it.\u2019 And in Wrexham the other day, at a youth training centre, I was delighted to see a poster saying \u2018It is the customer that makes pay days possible.\u2019 So these young people were not only learning new technology, they were learning the facts of business life and how we create new jobs.It is the spirit of enterprise that provides new jobs; it is being prepared to venture and build a business. And the role of Government in helping to do that? It is in cutting taxes, cutting inflation, keeping costs down, cutting through regulations and removing obstacles to the growth of small businesses, for that is where many of the new jobs will come from - small businesses. The role of Government is also in providing better education and training.The youth training scheme, now in its second year, was set up to give young people the necessary skills for the new technologies and the necessary approach to industry. A majority of the first year graduates are getting jobs. A much bigger proportion of those leaving the youth training scheme are getting jobs, compared with those leaving the youth opportunities scheme. And so they should, because it is a much better training scheme and it will improve again this year.I was very interested in it. David Young started it, and I offered to take a trainee for our office, No. 10 Downing Street. We would love to have one. He or she might not have made it to be Prime Minister in one year, but the work at No. 10, because we have a staff of about 100 to run the office, is varied and interesting and we really wanted to take on a trainee. We also said that we would take some trainees into the other parts of the civil service. So we were not willing, we were really welcoming this person, or people, and looking forward to it.At first the unions said yes; then they said no, And the result is that young people have been denied training places. The same problem arose at Jaguar. First the unions said yes; then they said no. So 130 unemployed teenagers have been denied training. That means young people were denied jobs. We cannot create jobs without the willing co-operation not only of employers, but of trade unions and all the work force in industry and commerce.Yesterday, in the debate, we were urged to spend more money on capital investment. It looks a very attractive idea, but to spend more in one area means spending less in another, or it means putting up taxes. In Government, we are constantly faced with these difficult choices. If we want more for investment I have to ask my colleagues in Cabinet, \u2018What are you going to give up? Or you? Or you? Or you? Or you?\u2019 Or should I perhaps ask them \u2018whose pay claim are you going to cut? The doctors? The police? The nurses?\u2019 I do not find many takers, because we have honoured the reviews of pay for doctors, nurses and the police, and others in full.You would not have cheered me if we had not done so and quite right too. I am bringing this to you because although people can say that the way to solve unemployment is to give a higher capital allocation I have to ask \u2018what are we going to give up?\u2019 Or I have to turn to Nigel Lawson and ask him which taxes would he put up.Would it be income tax? Personal income tax is already too high. Value added tax? I should get a pretty frosty reception from Nigel and I should get a pretty frosty reception from you. But I would be loath to ask him, anyway. But, you see, Governments have to make these difficult choices, because as you know, whether you are running households or your businesses, there is a certain amount of income and you are soon in trouble if you do not live within it.That I want to say to you is that we do consider these difficult choices in the public expenditure annual round, and we are just coming up to it. And we have managed to allocate a very considerable sum to capital investment. Indeed we have found the money for the best investment projects on offer. Believe you me, it has been because of very good management in each and every Department; it has been cutting out waste so that we could make room for these things and be certain that we could say to you that we were getting value for money.Let me give you a few examples of some of the investment projects for which we have found money by careful budgeting. There is the M25 road for example. It has been completed. British Railways has been given the green light to go ahead with electrification if it can make it pay. We have started or built 49 new hospitals since 1979. Capital investment in the nationalised industries as a whole is going up. Of course, we look at various things like new power stations, and in a year after drought we look at things like more investment in the water supply industry. So we are going ahead with major capital investment.So what is the conclusion that we are coming to? It is that it is the spirit of enterprise that creates new jobs. And it is the Government\u2019s task to create the right framework, the right financial framework in which that can flourish, and to cut the obstacles which sometimes handicap the birth of enterprise. And also to manage our own resources carefully and well.That is more or less what that employment policy White Paper in 1944 said. Let us just return to it. Page 1: \u2018For employment cannot be created by Act of Parliament or by Government action alone; the success of the policy outlined in this paper will ultimately depend on the understanding and support of the community as a whole - and specially of the efforts of employers and workers in industry.\u2019 It was true then. It is true now. And those are the policies that we are following and shall continue to follow, because those are the policies that we believe will ultimately create the genuine jobs for the future. In the meantime, it is our job to try to mitigate the painful effects of change, and that we do, as you know, by generous redundancy payments and also by a community enterprise scheme which not only finds jobs for the long-term unemployed, but finds them in a way which brings great benefits to the communities. And then, of course, where there are redundancy schemes in steel and now in coal, the industries themselves set up enterprise agencies both to give help to those who are made redundant and to provide new training. All of this is a highly constructive policy both for the creation of jobs and a policy to cushion the effects of change.May I turn now to the coal industry. For a little over seven months, we have been living through an agonising strike. Let me make it absolutely clear. The miners\u2019 strike was not of this Government\u2019s seeking, nor of its making. We have heard in debates at this conference some of the aspects that have made this dispute so repugnant to so many people. We were reminded by a colliery manager that the NUM always used to accept that a pit should close when the losses were too great to keep it open. And that the miners set great store by investment in new pits and new seams. Under this Government that new investment is happening in abundance. You can almost repeat the figures with me - £2million in capital investment in the mines for every day this Government has been in power. So no shortage of capital investment.We heard moving accounts from two working miners about just what they have to face as they try to make their way to work. The sheer bravery of those men and thousands like them who have kept the mining industry alive is beyond praise. \u2018Scabs\u2019 their former workmates call them. Scabs? They are lions. What a tragedy it is when striking miners attack their workmates. Not only are they members of the same union, but the working miner is saving both their futures because it is the working miners - whether in Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire, Lancashire, Leicestershire, Staffordshire, Warwickshire, North Wales or Scotland - it is the working miners who have kept faith with those who buy our coal and without whose custom thousands of jobs in the mining industry would be already lost.Then we heard, unforgettably, from the incomparable Mrs. Irene McGibbon, who told us what it is like to be the wife of a working miner during this strike. She told us of the threats and intimidation suffered by herself and her family and even her 11-year-old son. But what she endured only stiffened her resolve. To face the picket line day after day must take a very special wind of courage, but it takes as much, perhaps ever more, for the housewife who has to stay at home alone. Men and women like that are what we are proud to call the best of British. And our police who uphold the law with an independence and a restraint, perhaps only to be found in this country, are the admiration of the world.To be sure, the miners had a good deal. To try to prevent a strike the National Coal Board gave the miners the best ever pay offer, the highest ever investment and, for the first time, the promise that no miner would lose his job against his will. This we did despite the fact that the bill for losses in the coal industry last year was bigger than the annual bill for all the doctors and dentists in all the National Health Service hospitals in the United Kingdom. Let me repeat it: the annual losses in the coal industry are enormous - £13 billion last year. You have to find that money as taxpayers. It is equal to the sum we pay in salaries to all the doctors and dentists in the National Health Service. This is a dispute about the right to go to work of those who have been denied the right to go to vote. And we must never forget that the overwhelming majority of trade unions, including many striking miners, deeply regret what has been done in the name of trade unionism. When this strike is over, and one day it will be, we must do everything we can to encourage moderate and responsible trade unionism so that it can once again take its respected and valuable place in our industrial life.Meanwhile, we are faced with the present executive of the National Union of Mineworkers. They know that what they are demanding has never been granted either to miners or to workers in any other industry. Why, then, demand it? Why ask for what they know cannot be conceded? There can be only one explanation.  They did not want a settlement. They wanted a strike. Otherwise they would have balloted on the coal board\u2019s offer. Indeed, one third of the miners did have a ballot and voted overwhelmingly to accept the offer.What we have seen in this country is the emergence of an organised revolutionary minority who are prepared to exploit industrial disputes, but whose real aim is the breakdown of law and order and the destruction of democratic parliamentary government. We have seen the same sort of thugs and bullies at Grunwick, more recently against Eddy Shah in Stockport, and now organised into flying squads around the country. If their tactics are to be allowed to succeed, if they are not brought under the control of the law, we shall see them again at every industrial dispute organised by militant union leaders anywhere in the country.One of the speakers earlier in the conference realised this fact, realised that what they are saying is \u2018Give us what we want or we are prepared to go on with violence.\u2019 He referred to Dane-geld. May I add to what that speaker said? \u2018We never pay anyone Dane-geld, no matter how trifling the cost; for the end of that game is oppression and shame, and the nation that plays it is lost.\u2019 Yes, Rudyard Kipling. Who could have put it better?Democratic change there has always been in this, the home of democracy, but the sanction for change is the ballot box. It seems that there are some who are out to destroy any properly elected Government. They are out to bring down the framework of law. That is what we have seen in this strike. And what is the law they seek to defy? It is the common law created by fearless judges and passed down across the centuries. It is legislation scrutinised and enacted by the Parliament of a free people. It is legislation passed through a House of Commons, a Commons elected once every five years by secret ballot of one citizen, one vote. This is the way our law was fashioned, and that is why British justice is renowned across the world.No Government owns the law. It is the law of the land, the heritage of the people. \u2018No man is above the law, and no man is below it; nor do we ask any man\u2019s permission when we require him to obey it. Obedience to the law is demanded as a right - not asked as a favour.\u2019 So said Theodore Roosevelt.The battle to uphold the rule of law calls for the resolve and commitment of the British people. Our institutions of justice, the courts and the police require the unswerving support of every law-abiding citizen, and I believe that they will receive it.The nation faces what is probably the most testing crisis of our time - the battle between the extremists and the rest. We are fighting as we have always fought for the weak as well as for the strong. We are fighting for great and good causes. We are fighting to defend them against the power and might of those who rise up to challenge them. This Government will not weaken. This nation will meet that challenge. Democracy will prevail.

aVIn thanking you, Mr. President, for that wonderful welcome, my first words must be of gratitude to those who organised this Conference and looked after our security, bringing us safely to this great meeting.There are many here today who still bear the scars of injury and bereavement inflicted last year by terrorists when they struck in the hours of darkness. It reminds us of the risks we all take and will continue to take for freedom. I should like, too, to say a word about our friend and colleague John Gummer, whose dedication and tirelessness in those traumatic hours and for many days afterwards won universal admiration. We thank him for his Chairmanship of our Party, for his unfailing sense of duty and loyalty, and wish him well in his new work as a member of our ministerial team. Nobody could have followed this Conference or listened to the speeches made here this week without being struck by one overriding impression. It has been a serious, friendly and responsible Conference, a conference of those who know what it means for a political party to hold office, a conference of those who understand the realities of power exercised responsibly, the limitations, the dilemmas and the agonised choices which face those in government. Thank you for a marvellous Conference.Not for us the partisan rhetoric of class warfare, uttered with clenched fists through clenched lips. Not for us the bland never blueprints of those who have never sweated on the actual building site of responsible office, nor ever will. For us the keynote has been idealism tempered by realism, and I am sure you have been very impressed by the quality and confidence of our whole team of Ministers.For my part, I would like to add my congratulations and thanks to all those who have taken the Chair at this Conference with skill and unfailing good humour. In our Party we really rather like one another.It is ten years, Mr. President, as you reminded us, since I first addressed this Conference as Leader, in the same town - we all love Blackpool - in the same hall and on this same platform. I remember that meeting as though it were yesterday - the welcome, the warmth, the generous support that came from the hall. I already knew only too well the task that faced me, but I had not fully realised the strength that would be given to me by our people, and it was to sustain me first in the years of Opposition and then as Prime Minister.In that speech I said that it was not part of my purpose to preside over the continuing decline of Britain, over diminishing international esteem, or over the ebb of our independent spirit. I also said it was no part of my policy to perpetuate Socialism by proxy. Do you remember the Labour Britain of 1979? It was a Britain in which union leaders held their members and our country to ransom; a Britain that still went to international conferences but was no longer taken seriously; a Britain that was known as the sick man of Europe and which spoke the language of compassion but which suffered the winter of discontent. Government had failed to tackle the real problems. They dodged difficult problems rather than face up to them. The question they asked was not \u2018will the medicine work?\u2019 but \u2018will it taste alright?\u2019When we Conservatives said \u2018this is the way,\u2019 they said \u2018forget it.\u2019 We were told \u2018you can\u2019t reform trade union leaders; you can\u2019t reform trade unions, their leaders won\u2019t let you.\u2019 But we did. We were told \u2018you can\u2019t abolish price and wage controls; inflation will go up.\u2019 But we did, and it came down. We were told \u2018you can\u2019t give council tenants the right to buy. But we did and the houses sold like hot cakes.\u2019 They said \u2018you can\u2019t denationalise; the unions won\u2019t wear it.\u2019 But we did, and the workforce positively snapped up the shares. And we were told \u2018you\u2019ll never stand a major industrial strike, let alone a coal strike.\u2019 It lasted a whole year but we did just that \u2013 and won.It was a strike conducted with violence and intimidation on the picket line and in the villages. Yet Labour supported that strike to the bitter end. Indeed, three months into the strike Mr. Kinnock told Mr. Scargill publicly that there was \u2018no alternative but to fight - all other roads are shut off.\u2019What do you think would have happened if Mr. Scargill had won? I think the whole country knows the answer - Neil would have knelt. Courage is not making a speech in Bournemouth long after the event. Courage is what you show in the heat of the battle, not at the post-mortem.Real courage was the courage shown by the working mines, by the working lorry drivers, by the working railwaymen, by the working steelmen, by the working dockers - the very people the Labour Party disowned. But we Conservatives stood with them, the nation stood with us, and a major strike called without a ballot of its members failed. It was a notable victory for a free law-abiding people and their freely elected democratic government.In the six and a half years we have served the nation, much has been achieved. It has been said at this Conference many times but let me repeat it. The nation\u2019s output, the nation\u2019s investment, the nation\u2019s standard of living are at an all time high. Inflation is down, and this morning we heard that it had gone down further. Personal ownership is growing. Our overseas assets have multiplied more than six-fold in six years. They now bring us an annual income of some £3,000 million a year. There are 700 additional new businesses starting up every week. Indeed, for the first time in our history the number of companies in Britain has topped one million.Rates of income tax are down. Three major taxes have been abolished, and on Wednesday you heard my next door neighbour, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in confident mood. On the social services, you have heard me say that the Health Service was safe with us. So it was, so it is, and so it will be. But our opponents have conducted a relentless campaign to convey the opposite. The only way to nail a lie constantly repeated is to repeat the truth even more frequently.We have more doctors and nurses and they are treating more patients than ever. And it took a Conservative Government to give the nurses the independent Pay Review Body for which they were asked. The Royal College of Nursing had said consistently over the years: \u2018Our nurses never strike. The patient comes first.\u2019Pensioners too have been the object of a sustained and particularly cruel campaign of false propaganda. Let me say this to every pensioner. The basic pension goes on. That was never in doubt. And if anyone tells you otherwise, don\u2019t believe them. Under this Conservative Government the pension has been increased by more than prices. And when it goes up again next month it will be worth more than ever before. All this is a remarkable record of which every Conservative can be proud. But there is much more to do.I am only too painfully aware of the problem of unemployment. It affects not only Britain but the whole of Europe. But that does nothing to relieve the anxiety and frustration of someone who can\u2019t find a job. People say: \u2018You do understand?\u2019 Of course, I do. There is no problem which occupies more of my thinking and that of my colleagues. Scarcely a day passes without the Government looking at new ways of speeding job creation. People say: \u2018make it easier for firms to take on more employees.\u2019 We have done. We\u2019ve abolished Labour\u2019s tax on jobs and this week we cut National Insurance contributions for the lower paid. They say: \u2018Help people to start up in business on their own.\u2019 We\u2019re doing that by the highly successful enterprise allowance, and by cutting red tape. Though heaven knows there\u2019s plenty still to be cut.They say: \u2018Train more young people.\u2019 We are, with the largest youth training programme this country has ever seen. The millionth young person will join before Christmas. That is a great achievement. I have seen it at work myself - in Glasgow and Chester, in Wrexham and Surrey, in Cornwall and all over the country. Young people working hard and well, many of them taken on later by the employer who has trained them.And we are expanding this programme so that everyone under the age of 18 can have either job or education or training, and unemployment will not be an option. People say, too - we heard it again at the conference; so many of these things we have heard here \u2013 \u2018Give the unemployed the chance to work for the community.\u2019 Right. We have expanded the community programme to 230,000 people next year. Then they say: \u2018Let more people retire early.\u2019 Many companies are doing just that, and the Government have special schemes which enable some to retire to make way for others looking for work.We are doing all these things, and a lot more beside, but I will not list them all. But there is one thing we will not do. We will not reflate. We are sometimes told by politicians and pollsters that people would prefer more inflation and less unemployment. You cannot choose to have either inflation or unemployment. They are not alternatives.Past Governments have tried that. They have deliberately created inflation in the hope of reducing unemployment. It always finished up with worse inflation and worse unemployment. You cannot build a secure future on dishonest money.There is a fundamental truth from truth from which no Government can escape. It is customers who create business, and it is business which creates jobs. And it is happening. In the last two years, some 650,000 additional jobs have been created, more than in the rest of the European Community put together. The jobs are coming and enterprise is returning to Britain. That is where the new jobs will come from.I share the deep concern of parents about the education of our children. The basic teaching you receive in school can influence the rest of your life and shape your whole future. Today, more money is being spent per pupil than ever before. There are more teachers proportionately to pupils than ever before. Their training is better than ever before. But, alas, that has not solved all the difficulties.We are all worried about the teachers\u2019 strike and its effect on the children. The burden on heads and deputy heads is enormous, and we are very much aware of the strains on them and on many teachers, So, some £1,250 million of your money has therefore been pledged in pay for teachers over and above the annual increases. That would mean pay scales in November next year running from £7,500 a year for a new graduate to more than £24,000 for the head of a big secondary school with much better promotion opportunities in between. By the way, I notice that the Labour Opposition regard £20,000 a year as their definition of the rich to be soaked up by higher taxes. I do not agree, and I do not suppose that those head teachers do either.We believe that this offer would not only be a fair deal for teachers but it would enable us, first, to have a salary system which would reward the better teachers, and, second, to spell out teachers duties clearly so that we can get rid of all the arguments. I most earnestly hope that this strike will soon be settled. Teachers should lead by example, and this is a bad one.While many parents are well content with the education their children are receiving, the story for some, especially in the inner city areas, is very different: poor examination results; lack of good discipline; the unhappiness which some quiet and sensitive children sometimes suffer; political indoctrination in our schools; and the attempts by some local education authorities to control the curriculum and use it for political ends. No wonder parents are worried, and so are a lot of the teachers, especially those who have to deal with disruptive pupils who make their tack difficult and exhausting. What is more, when teachers take disciplinary measures they do not always receive the backing from the local education authority which they are entitled to expect. Some teachers and parents are speaking out. Those who believe, as we do, that the schools of this country are for teaching and learning and not for political indoctrination. In the debate we had you pulled no punches. I prefer it that way. I believe that you performed a public service by bringing this matter into the open, and Sir Keith and his colleagues will do everything in their power to root out this pernicious influence and to see that our children have the education to which they are entitled.Last week at his party conference, the Labour leader gave what we were told was a clarion call to moderation in the Labour party. It was, announced Labour\u2019s deputy leader - now there is an unbiased observer - a turning point in history. But \u2018by their fruits ye shall know them.\u2019 So never mind the PR, let us have a look at the policies.Last week at Bournemouth the Labour party voted to scrap the laws which give union members a secret ballot and to hand back to the leaders, those barons of the block vote, their former feudal powers. They voted to give up the British independent nuclear deterrent for nothing in return. They voted to take political control over the operations of the police. They voted to indemnify councils and trade unions who choose to break the law for political ends. Anything else? I have hardly started.Here are some Labour policies for the next general election in two or three years\u2019 time. They would nationalise and renationalise our industry with scant regard for the newly accrued shares of employees. There would be no automatic right to buy your own council house. Decisions would be left to Labour councils such as Sheffield, Hackney and Camden, and you can imagine what sort of a deal you would get from them.And Labour would hijack and direct the pension and insurance fund money of some 12 million people. Independent schools would go, and quickly. There would be the usual mishmash of higher taxes and, I need hardly say, higher borrowing. \u2018To borrow and. to borrow and to borrow\u2019 is not Macbeth with a heavy cold. It is Labour party policy. But most people do not want to mortgage the future and leave their children to pick up the bill.Labour\u2019s banner reads \u2018Back!\u2019 Back to a high tax society. Back to the old days of inflation by social contract. Back to rule by Congress House, when the Labour party was a wholly owned subsidiary of the unions.The Labour party, Mr President, is two different factions in a state of civil war, with the Left steadily gaining ground. As the oldstagers retire or are forced out, they are replaced by the new militant Left. You can see socialism in action today in the council chambers of local government - in Liverpool, Lambeth, Haringey - and many others, so vividly described at this conference. That is what it would be like if Labour ever got power at Westminster.The militant Left will not be beaten by brave words and ritual disclaimers. If the Labour leadership is genuinely against these people why do they not expel them? Is not the real reason that they are a bigger and bigger part of the Labour party and that the present leadership cannot do without them?And where do the so-called Alliance stand? Take defence. Did we see them reaffirm one-sided disarmament or did they decide this year to keep a few missiles? Or is it only the ones that are out of date they would keep? Or is it a case of defending all of the people some of the time or some of the people all of the time? It is all very confusing. Those who want the country to have a strong and sure defence can\u2019t rely on the Labour Party, the SDP or the Liberals. They can rely on us.By the end of this century, it is predicted that several more countries will have acquired nuclear weapons. Labour wants Britain to give them up. At the very time when any sensible person would be renewing his insurance cover, Labour wants to cancel Britain\u2019s policy altogether. Moreover, they want to get rid of American bases from Britain and all nuclear weapons from British soil.Does anyone who has witnessed Mr. Gorbachev\u2019s performance think that he respects weakness? No, it is recognition of the West\u2019s strength and cohesion that has brought the Soviet Union back to the negotiating table. Our wish is to see substantial reductions in nuclear weapons, provided they are balanced and verifiable. I know that will be President Reagan\u2019s objective at his meeting with Mr. Gorbachev, and he has our full support and good wishes as he goes to Geneva. The West could have no better or braver champion.The whole country is rightly concerned about security at home, about violence in the streets. We utterly condemn anyone and everyone who takes part in riots in Britain. Whoever these people are who riot, burn and murder; whoever they are organised by, there is no excuse, no justification whatsoever, for such crime and vandalism. Those who take to the streets on the first available pretext, to fire, loot and plunder, will be subject to the full rigours of the criminal law.In Tottenham and Handsworth the police suffered a hail of bricks and petrol bombs, apparently ready to hand. Yet one of the delegates to the Labour Party Conference was loudly applauded when he called the police \u2018The Enemy.\u2019 \u2018Enemy\u2019? The overwhelming majority of the British people regard the police as friends: they admire and are deeply thankful for the courage of the police and the courage of their families.It isn\u2019t the police who create threats to public order. All too often they are the victims, as we saw only too tragically at Tottenham. Nor is it social conditions that generate violence. Yes, unemployment breeds frustration. But it\u2019s an insult to the unemployed to suggest that a man who doesn\u2019t have a job is likely to break the law.In the 1930s, when unemployment was proportionately higher, and virtually unrelieved by benefits, crime levels were not higher, they were lower. In parts of the world where the standard of living is high, the environment attractive, and jobs are relatively plentiful - parts of America for example - crime is worse than in Britain.In a free country everyone has to choose. And the overwhelming majority of our fellow citizens - black or white, in or out of work, living in the suburbs or city centres - freely make their choice. They respect the law; and they will have no truck with crime masquerading as social protest. The government will continue steadfastly to back the police.If they need more men, more equipment, different equipment, they shall have them. We don\u2019t economise on protecting life and property.And we shall oppose politicians, national or local, who want to interfere in the operational independence of the police. There is no place for politics in policing. But our concern about violence goes far beyond the riots.A child abused, perhaps destroyed, within her own home can\u2019t begin to know where, if anywhere, to look for safety. An elderly couple, nervous to step outside their home shouldn\u2019t have to look about them in fear. A teenager who\u2019s slid towards drugs may no longer he able to help himself. Who is to answer the child crying for help? Who is to protect the elderly couple? Who can win back the youngster hooked on drugs? Police, social workers, the voluntary organisations all must, and do, respond, but that\u2019s not enough. We are the neighbours of that child, of that elderly couple, of that youngster. Upholding the law can\u2019t he left to the police and the courts alone. We are all involved. We cannot pass by on the other side. Government apart, the strengths of a civilised nation depend on the natural authority of the family, the school, the church and our great institutions. It is when that authority weakens and it has weakened that nations turn to the power of the State. When the power of the state increases, the dignity of the individual declines. Our national character and greatness was not founded on the all-embracing power of government. It was not founded on material worth. It was founded on freedom, orderly freedom, within the law. For without law, there can he no freedom.In Britain today we have seen the hard left operating within our political system, conspiring through union power or local government to break, defy and subvert the law. Because the Labour Party will not expel these people, a unique responsibility is placed on today\u2019s Conservative Party and Government. We have to conserve the rule of law itself, conserve it for people of all parties and of none.That is our overriding duty. Success will require the cooperation of every law-abiding citizen. No one can opt out.Come with us, then, towards the next decade. Let us together set our sights on a Britain where three out of four families own their home, where owning shares is as common as having a car, where families have a degree of independence their forefathers could only dream about; a Britain where there is a resurgence of enterprise with more people self-employed, more businesses and therefore more jobs; a Britain where there is a standard of healthcare far better than anything we have ever known, where savings keep their value and where people can look forward to their retirement, certain of their pension and confident of its buying power; a Britain where standards in our schools are a source of pride and where law-abiding men and women go their way in tranquillity with their children, knowing that their neighbourhood is safe and their country secure.Step by step we are rolling back the frontiers of socialism and returning power to the people. Yes, we have set our sights high. But these goals are within our reach. Let us ensure that we bring them within our grasp.

aVMr. President, this week at Bournemouth, we\u2019ve had a most responsible conference: the conference of a party which was the last government, is the present government, and will be the next government. We have heard from ministers a series of forward-looking policies which are shaping the future of our country and not only from ministers, but from the body of the hall has come speech after speech of advice, encouragement and commitment. We are a party which knows what it stands for and what it seeks to achieves. We are a party which honours the past that we may build for the future.Last week, at Blackpool, the Labour party made the bogus claim that it was \u2018putting people first.\u2019 Putting people first? Last week, Labour voted to remove the right to a secret ballot before a strike. Voted to remove the precious right we gave to trade union members to take their union to a court of law.Putting people first? Last week Labour voted for the state to renationalise British Telecom and British Gas, regardless of the millions of people who have been able to own shares for the first time in their lives. Putting people first? They voted to stop the existing right to buy council houses, a policy which would kill the hopes and dreams of so many families. Labour may say they put people first: but their conference voted to put government first and that means putting people last.What the Labour party of today wants is: housing municipalised, industry nationalised, the police service politicised, the judiciary radicalised, union membership tyrannised, and above all - and most serious of all - our defences neutralised. Never. Not in Britain.We have two other oppositions who have recently held their conferences, the Liberals and the SDP. Where they\u2019re not divided they\u2019re vague, and where they\u2019re not vague they\u2019re divided. At the moment they appear to be engaged in a confused squabble about whether or not Polaris should be abandoned or replaced or renewed or re-examined and if so, when; and how; and possibly why? if they can\u2019t agree on the defence of our country, they can\u2019t agree on anything. Where Labour has its Militant Tendency, they have their muddled tendency. I\u2018ll have rather more to say about defence later.Conservative moralityBut just now I want to speak about Conservative policies, policies which spring from deeply held beliefs. The charge is sometimes made that our policies are only concerned with money and efficiency. I am the first to acknowledge that morality is not and never was been the monopoly of any one party, nor do we claim that it is. But we do claim that it is the foundation of our policiesWhy are we Conservatives so opposed to inflation? Only because it puts up prices? No, because it destroys the value of people\u2019s savings, because it destroys jobs. And with it people\u2019s hopes. That\u2019s what the fight against inflation is all about. Why have we limited the power of trade unions? Only to improve productivity? No, because trade union members, want to be protected from intimidation and to go about their daily lives in peace like everyone else in the land.Why have we allowed people to buy shares in nationalised industries? Only to improve efficiency? No. To spread the nation\u2019s wealth among as many people as possible. Why are we setting up new kinds of schools in our towns and cities? To create privilege? To give families in some of our inner cities greater choice in the education of their children, a choice denied them by their Labour councils. Enlarging choice is rooted in our Conservative tradition, without choices talk of morality is an idle and an empty thing.Britain\u2019s industrial futureMr. President, the theme of our conference this week is the next move forward. We have achieved a lot in seven short years. But there is still a great deal to be done for our country.  The whole industrial world, not just Britain, is seeing change at a speed that our forebears never contemplated, much of it due to new technology. Old industries are declining, new ones are taking their place, traditional jobs are being taken over by computers, people are choosing to spend their money in new ways. Leisure, pleasure, sport and travel, all these are big business today. We would be foolish to pretend that this transition can be accomplished without problems, but it would be equally foolish to pretend that a country like Britain, which is so heavily dependent on trade with others, can somehow ignore what is happening in the rest of the world, can behave as if these great events have nothing to do with us, can resist change. Yet that is exactly what Labour proposes to do: they want to put back the clock and set back the country.Back to state direction and controls, back to the old levels of over-manning, back to the old inefficiency, back to making life difficult for the very people on who the future of Britain depends.  The wealth creators, the scientists, the engineers, the designers, the managers, the inventors all those on who we rely to create the industries and jobs of the future. What supreme folly. It defies all common sense.JobsAs do those Labour policies which, far from putting people first, would put them out of jobs. The prospects of young people would be blighted by Labour\u2019s minimum wage policy because people could not then afford to employ them and give them a start in life. A quarter of a million jobs could be at risk. many thousands of jobs would go from closing down American nuclear bases.Labour want sanctions against South Africa. Tens of thousands of people could lose their jobs in Britain, quite apart from the devastating consequences for black South Africans. Out would go jobs at existing nuclear power stations. Whatever happened to Harold Wilson\u2019s \u2018white heat of technological revolution\u2019?On top of all this, jobs would also suffer as would-be investors in Britain took one look at Labour and decided to set up elsewhere. Labour say they would create jobs. But those policies would destroy jobs. This government has created the climate that\u2019s produced a million extra jobs over the past three years. Here in Britain, it is encouraging that more of the population are in work than in Italy, or France, or Germany.Nevertheless, as you heard yesterday, more has to be done, and is being done. Meanwhile no other country in Europe can rival our present range of help for people to train, retrain and find jobs.And would like just to say, Mr. President: training is not a palliative for unemployment. It will play an ever-larger part in our whole industrial life. For only modern, efficient industry and commerce will produce the jobs our people need.Popular capitalismOur opponents would have us believe that all problems can be solved by state intervention. But governments should not run business. Indeed, the weakness of the case for state ownership has become all too apparent. For state planners do not have to suffer the consequences of their mistakes. It\u2019s the taxpayers who have to pick up the bill. This government has rolled back the frontiers of the state and will roll them back still further.  So popular is our policy that it\u2019s being taken up all round the world. From France to the Philippines, from Jamaica to Japan, from Malaysia to Mexico, from Sri Lanka to Singapore, privatisation is on the move. There\u2019s even a special Oriental version in China. The policies we have pioneered are catching on in country after country. We Conservatives believe in popular capitalism, believe in a property owning democracy - and it works!Power to the peopleIn Scotland recently, I was present at the sale of the millionth council house: to a lovely family with two children who can at last call their home their own. Now let\u2019s go for the second million! And what\u2019s more, millions have already become shareholders, and soon there will be opportunities for millions more, in British Gas, British Airways, British airports and Rolls Royce. Who says we\u2019ve run out of steam, we\u2019re in our prime! The great political reform of the last century was to enable more and more people to have a vote. Now the great Tory reform of this century is to enable more and more people to own property.Popular capitalism is nothing less than a crusade to enfranchise the many in the economic life of the nation. We Conservatives are returning power to the people. That is the way to one nation, one people.Return of national prideYou may have noticed there are many people who just can\u2019t bear good news. It\u2019s a sort of infection of the spirit and there\u2019s a lot of it about, in the eyes of these hand-wringing merchants of gloom and despondency. Everything that Britain does is wrong. Any setback. However small. Any little difficulty, however local, is seen as incontrovertible proof that the situation is hopeless. Their favourite word is crisis: it\u2019s a crisis when the price of oil goes up and a crisis when the price of oil comes down. It\u2019s a crisis if you don\u2019t build new roads. it\u2019s a crisis when you do. It\u2019s a crisis if Nissan does not come here. And it\u2019s a crisis when it does.What a rotten time these people must have, running round running everything down. Especially when there\u2019s so much to be proud of. Inflation at its lowest level for twenty years. The basic rate of tax at its lowest level for forty years. the number of strikes at their lowest level for fifty years. The great advances in science and industry. The achievement of millions of our people in creating new enterprises and new jobs. The outstanding performance of the arts and music and entertainment worlds. And the triumphs of our sportsmen and women. They all do Britain proud. And we are mighty proud of them.Conservatives careOur opponents, having lost the political argument, try another tack! They try to convey the impression that we don\u2019t care. So let\u2019s take a close look at those who make this charge, they\u2019re the ones who supported and maintained Mr. Scargill\u2019s coal strike for a whole year, hoping to deprive industry, homes and pensioners of power to heat and light. They\u2019re the ones who supported the strike in the health service which lengthened the waiting time for operations just when we were getting it down; they\u2019re the ones who supported the teachers\u2019 dispute which disrupted our children\u2019s education. They are those Labour councillors who constantly accuse the police of provocation when they deal with violent crime and drugs in the worst areas of our inner cities. We\u2019re not going to take any lessons in caring from people with that sort of record. We care profoundly about the right of people to be protected against crime, hooliganism and the evil of drugs. The mugger, the rapist, the drug trafficker, the terrorist. All must suffer the full rigour of the law. And that\u2019s why this party and this government consistently back the police and the courts of law, in Britain and Northern Ireland. For without the rule of law there can be no liberty.It\u2019s because we care deeply about the health service that we\u2019ve launched the biggest hospital building programme in this country\u2019s history. Statistics tell only part of the story.  But this government is devoting more resources of all kinds to the health service than any previous government. Over the past year or so, I\u2019ve visited five hospitals. In the North West, at Barrow in Furness I visited the first new hospital in that district since the creation of the health service forty years ago. In the North East another splendid new hospital. At North Tyneside, with the most wonderful maternity unit and children\u2019s wards. Just north of London I went round St Alban\u2019s hospital where new wards have been opened and new buildings are underway. I visited the famous Elizabeth Garrett Anderson hospital for women, which this government saved. The service it provides is very special and greatly appreciated. And then last week I went back to the royal Sussex Country hospital in Brighton, to open the new renal unit. Many of us have cause to be very thankful for that Brighton hospital, everywhere patients were loud in their praise of the treatment they received from doctors and nurses whose devotion and skill we all admire. This government\u2019s record on the health service is a fine one. We\u2019re proud of it and we must see to it that people know how much we\u2019ve done. Of course there are problems still to be solved. The fact that there\u2019s no waiting list in one area does not help you if you have to wait for an operation in your area. It doesn\u2019t help if there\u2019s a new hospital going up somewhere else. But not where you\u2019d really like it.We are tackling these problems, and we shall go on doing so. Because our commitment to the National Health Service is second to none.  We\u2019ve made great progress already. The debate we had on Wednesday, with its telling contributions from nurses and doctors in the health service, was enormously helpful to us. It\u2019s our purpose to work together and to continue steadily to improve the services that are provided in hospital and community alike.This is Conservatives putting care into action and we care deeply that retired people should never again see their hard-earned savings decimated by runaway inflation. For example, take the pensioner who retired in 1963 with a thousand pounds of savings. Twenty years later, in 1983, it was only worth one hundred and sixty pounds. That is why we will never relent in the battle against inflation. It has to be fought and won every year. We care passionately about the education of our children. Time and again we hear three basic messages: bring back the three Rs into our schools; bring back relevance into the curriculum; and bring back discipline into our classrooms.  The fact is that education at all levels - teachers, training colleges, administrators - has been infiltrated by a permissive philosophy of self-expression. And we are now reaping the consequences which, for some children have been disastrous. Money by itself will not solve this problem, money will not raise standards, but by giving parents greater freedom to choose; by allowing head teachers greater control in their school; by laying down national standards of syllabus and attainment; I am confident that we can really improve the quality of education. Improve it not just in the twenty new schools, but in every school in the land. And we\u2019ll back every teacher, head teacher and administrator who shares these ideals. We care most of all about our country\u2019s security. The defence of the realm transcends all other issues. It is the foremost responsibility of any government and any Prime Minister. For forty years, every government of this country of every political persuasion has understood the need for strong defences: by maintaining and modernising Britain\u2019s independent nuclear deterrents; by membership of the NATO alliance, an alliance based on nuclear deterrence; and by accepting, and bearing in full, the obligations which membership brings. All this was common ground.Last week, the Labour party abandoned that ground. In a decision of the utmost gravity, Labour voted to give up Britain\u2019s independent nuclear deterrent unilaterally. Labour would also require the United States to remove its nuclear weapons from our soil and to close down its nuclear bases: weapons and bases which are vital not only for Britain\u2019s defence but for the defence of the entire Atlantic Alliance.Furthermore, Labour would remove Britain altogether from the protection of America\u2019s nuclear umbrella, leaving us totally unable to deter a nuclear attack, for you cannot deter with conventional weapons an enemy which has, and could threaten to use, nuclear weapons. Exposed to the threat of nuclear blackmail, there would be no option but surrender.  Labour\u2019s defence policy - though defence is scarcely the word - is an absolute break with the defence policy of every British government since the Second World War. Let there be no doubt about the gravity of that decision - you cannot be a loyal member of NATO while disavowing its fundamental strategy. A Labour Britain would be a neutralist Britain. It would be the greatest gain for the Soviet Union in forty years, and they would have got it without firing a shot. I believe this total reversal of Labour\u2019s policy for the defence of our country will have come as a shock to many of Labour\u2019s traditional supporters.It was Labour\u2019s Nye Bevan who warned his party against going naked into the conference chamber; it was Labour\u2019s Hugh Gaitskell who promised the country to fight, fight and fight again against the unilateral disarmers in his own party. That fight was continued by his successors. Today the fight is over; the present leadership are the unilateral disarmers. The Labour party of Attlee, of Gaitskell, of Wilson is dead, and no one has more surely killed it than the present leader of the Labour party. There are some policies which can be reversed, but weapon development and production takes years and years. Moreover, by repudiating NATO\u2019s nuclear strategy, Labour would fatally weaken the Atlantic Alliance and the United States\u2019 commitment to Europe\u2019s defence. The danger caused by Labour\u2019s policies would be irrevocable - not only present but future generations would be at risk.Of course there are fears about the terrible destructive power of nuclear weapons. But it is the balance of nuclear forces which has preserved peace for forty years in a Europe which twice in the previous thirty years tore itself to pieces. Preserved peace not only from nuclear war, but from conventional war in Europe as well. And it has saved the young people of two generations from being called up to fight as their parents and grandparents were. As Prime Minister, I could not remove that protection from the lives of present and future generations. Let every nation know that Conservative governments, now and in the future, will keep Britain\u2019s obligations to its allies. The freedom of all its citizens and the good name of our country depend upon it. This weekend, President Reagan and Mr. Gorbachev are meeting in Reykjavik. Does anyone imagine that Mr. Gorbachev would be prepared to talk at all if the West had already disarmed? It is the strength and unity of the West, which has brought the Russians to the negotiating table. The policy of Her Majesty\u2019s opposition is a policy that would help our enemies and harm our friends. it totally misjudges the character of the British people. After the Liberal Party conference, after the SDP conference, after the Labour party conference, there is now only one party in this country with an effective policy for the defence of the realm. That party is the Conservative party.Throughout this conference, we have heard of the great achievements of the last seven years. Their very success now makes possible the next moves forward, which you have seen set out this week, and we shall complete the manifesto for the next election within the next eighteen months. That manifesto will be a programme for further bold and radical steps in keeping with our most deeply held beliefs. We do our best for our country when we are true to our convictions. As we look forward to the next century, we have a vision of the society we wish to see. The vision we all serve.We want to see a Britain where there is an ever-widening spread of ownership, with the independence and dignity it brings, a Britain which takes care of the weak in their time of need. We want to see a Britain where the spirit of enterprise is strong enough to conquer unemployment north and south. A Britain in which the attitude of \u2018them and us\u2019 has disappeared from our lives. We want to see a Britain whose schools are a source of pride and where education brings out the best in every child. A Britain where excellence and effort are valued and honoured. we want to see a Britain where our streets are free from fear, day and night. And above all, he wants to see a Britain which is respected and trusted in the world which values the great benefits of living in a free society and is determined to defend them. Our duty is to safeguard our country\u2019s interests and to be reliable friends and allies. The failure of the other parties to measure up to what is needed places an awesome responsibility upon us.I believe that we have an historic duty to discharge that responsibility and to carry into the future all that is best and unique in Britain. I believe that our party is uniquely equipped to do it. I believe the interests of Britain can now only be served by a third Conservative victory.

aVMr. President, friends, thank you for that wonderful welcome. It is my first duty and pleasure to pay tribute to the police, and especially to the Lancashire police for the protection they have given to our Conference at Blackpool. Their professionalism, their dedication, have ensured that, no matter what the threat, nothing will stop the free debate of a political party in Britain. The police and the security forces are the true guardians of our liberties, and to them we extend our deep gratitude.Mr. President, a lot has happened since we last met. There was, for instance, our election victory in June. They tell me that makes it three wins in a row. Just like Lord Liverpool. And he was Prime Minister for fifteen years. It\u2019s rather encouraging. It was an historic victory. And I want to thank all those who did so much, Above all, our Chairman, Norman Tebbit. Norman and Margaret hold, and will always hold, a unique place in our esteem and affection. Thank you, too, Margaret. And on the 11th June, we even won some nine seats we failed to gain in 1983. And we won back three we lost at by-elections. To the victors we say - congratulations. To our former colleagues who lost - come back soon. We miss you.Just why did we win? I think it is because we knew what we stood for, we said what we stood for, and we stuck by what we stood for. And since the election, it sometimes seems we are the only party that does. From Impossibility to VictoryMr. President, twelve years ago, I first stood on this platform as Leader of the Conservative Party. Now one or two things have changed since 1975. In that year, we were still groaning under Labour\u2019s so-called \u2018social contract.\u2019 People said we should never be able to govern again. Remember how we had all been lectured about political impossibility? You couldn\u2019t be a Conservative, and sound like a Conservative, and win an election, they said. And you certainly couldn\u2019t win an election and then act like a Conservative and win another election. And this was absolutely beyond dispute - you couldn\u2019t win two elections and go on behaving like a Conservative, and yet win a third election. Don\u2019t you harbour just the faintest suspicion that somewhere along the line something went wrong with that theory?Right up to the 11th of June, the Labour Party, the Liberals and the SDP were busy saying that Conservatism doesn\u2019t work. Oddly enough, since the 12th of June, they\u2019ve been saying that it does. And so our political opponents are now feverishly packaging their policies to look like ours. And it\u2019s interesting that no Party now dares to say openly that it will take away from the people what we have given back to the people. Mr. President, Labour\u2019s language may alter, their presentation may be slicker, but underneath, it\u2019s still the same old socialism. Far be it from me to deride the sinner that repenteth. The trouble with Labour is they want the benefit of repentance without renouncing the original sin. No way!And the so-called \u2018Alliance\u2019? During the election campaign, I used to wonder what the Alliance leaders meant by consensus politics. I have a feeling that, if Dr. Owen didn\u2019t know it before, he knows now: six inches of fraternal steel beneath the shoulder blades.Mr. President, we are a successful party leading a successful nation. And I\u2019m often asked what\u2019s the secret. It\u2019s really quite simple. What we have done is to re-establish at the heart of British politics a handful of simple truths.First, no economy can thrive if Government debases the coinage. No society can be fair or stable when inflation eats up savings and devalues the pound in everyone\u2019s pocket. Inflation threatens democracy itself. We\u2019ve always put its defeat at the top of our agenda. For it\u2019s a battle which never ends. It means keeping your budget on a sound financial footing. Not just one year, but every year, and that\u2019s why we need Nigel Lawson.The second, men and women need the incentive that comes from keeping more of what they earn. No one can say that people aren\u2019t interested in their take-home pay. If that were true, a lot of trade union leaders would be out of a job. So as economic growth has taken off, we\u2019ve cut income tax. And as soon as we prudently can, we\u2019ll do it again.And third, as people earn more, they want to own more. They value the security which comes from ownership - whether of shares or homes. Soon there will be more shareholders than trade unionists in this country. Of course, not all trade unionists are shareholders - yet. But I hope that before long they will be. Home ownership too has soared. And to extend the right to council tenants, we had to fight the battle as you know, the battle in Parliament every inch of the way. Against Labour opposition. And against Liberal opposition. Does the Labour Leader now applaud what has happened? Does the Liberal Leader welcome it? Surely, now that it\u2019s proved so popular, it must be the sort of liberating measure of which even he would approve. For years we Conservatives had talked about wanting to create a property-owning democracy. Looking back, I wonder whether we did as much as we should have done to achieve that goal. But I don\u2019t believe that anyone will be able, in the years ahead, to make a similar charge against this Government; indeed, extending ownership has been one of the achievements of which I am most proud.And fourth, it is our passionate belief that free enterprise and competition are the engines of prosperity and the guardians of liberty.These ideas have shaped free political institutions and brought unimagined wealth to countries and continents. Just look at what we have achieved - low inflation; tax cuts; wider ownership; a revival of enterprise and, over the last year, unemployment has fallen at record speed by 400,000. And we want it to fall further. And with continued economic growth, it should. And our economic success has enabled Britain to play a more prominent role in the world at large.We are now the second biggest investor in the world, and the very model of a stable economy. And that\u2019s why Nigel Lawson has been able to play a leading role in helping to tackle the world debt crisis. International bankers, the finance Ministers of other nations: they all listen to you a lot harder when they owe you money rather than the other way round. The old Britain of the 1970s, with its strikes, poor productivity, low investment, winters of discontent, above all its gloom, its pessimism, its sheer defeatism - that Britain is gone. And we now have a new Britain, confident, optimistic, sure of its economic strength - a Britain to which foreigners come to admire, to invest, yes and to imitate. I have reminded you where the great political adventure began and where it has led. But is this where we pitch our tents? Is this where we dig in? Absolutely not. Our third election victory was only a staging post on a much longer journey.And I know with every fibre of my being that it would be fatal for us just to stand where we are now. What would be our slogan for the 1990s if we did that? Would \u2018consolidate\u2019 be the word that we stitch on our banners? Whose blood would run faster at the prospect of five years of consolidation? Of course, we secure what we\u2019ve achieved. But we move on - applying our principles and beliefs to even more challenging ground. For our purpose as Conservatives is to extend opportunity - and choice - to those who have so far have been denied them.Education And, Mr. President, our most important task in this Parliament is to raise the quality of education. You heard what Kenneth Baker had to say about it in that most interesting, stimulating debate we had the other day. It\u2019s in the national interest. And it\u2019s in the individual interest of every parent and above all, of every child. We want education to be part of the answer to Britain\u2019s problems, not part of the cause.To compete successfully in tomorrow\u2019s world - against Japan, Germany and the United States - we need well-educated, well-trained, creative young people. Because if education is backward today, national performance will be backward tomorrow. But it\u2019s the plight of individual boys and girls which worries me most. Too often, our children don\u2019t get the education they need - the education they deserve. And in the inner cities - where youngsters must have a decent education if they are to have a better future - that opportunity is all too often snatched from them by hard left education authorities and extremist teachers. And children who need to be able to count and multiply are learning anti-racist mathematics - whatever that may be. Children who need to be able to express themselves in clear English are being taught political slogans.Children who need to be taught to respect traditional moral values are being taught that they have an inalienable right to be gay. And children who need encouragement - and children do so much need encouragement - so many children - they are being taught that our society offers them no future. All of those children are being cheated of a sound start in life - yes cheated.Of course - in the country as a whole - there are plenty of excellent teachers and successful schools. And in every good school, and every good teacher, is a reminder of what too many young people are denied. I believe that government must take the primary responsibility for setting standards for the education of our children. And that\u2019s why we are establishing a national curriculum for basic subjects. It is vital that children master essential skills: reading, writing, spelling, grammar, arithmetic; and that they understand basic science and technology. And for good teachers this will provide a foundation on which they can build with their own creative skill and professionalism. But the key to raising standards is to enlist the support of parents. The Labour left - hard, soft and in-between - they hate the idea that people should be able to choose. In particular, they hate the idea that parents should be able to choose their children\u2019s education. The Conservative Party believes in parental choice. And we are now about to take two dramatic steps forward in extending choice in education. First, we will allow popular schools to take in as many children as space will permit. And this will stop local authorities from putting artificially low limits on entry to good schools. And second, we will give parents and governors the right to take their children\u2019s school out of the hands of the local authority and into the hands of their own governing body.This will create a new kind of school funded by the State, alongside the present State schools and the independent private schools. These new schools will be independent state schools. They will bring a better education to many children because the school will be in the hands of those who care most for it and for its future. Mr. President, there\u2019s no reason at all why local authorities should have a monopoly of free education. What principle suggests that this is right? What recent experience or practice suggests it is even sensible? In these ways, we are furthering our Conservative tradition of extending opportunity more widely. This policy will be of the greatest advantage, not to those schools where the parents are already satisfied with their children\u2019s education, but to those schools where the parents are dissatisfied and believe that their children could do a lot better. Nowhere is this policy more needed than in what have come to be known as \u2018inner cities.\u2019 It will profit those people most.Inner CitiesNow, Mr. President, the phrase \u2018inner cities\u2019 is a kind of convenient shorthand for a host of problems. Cities have risen and declined throughout history. Risen by responding to the opportunities the markets, the technologies of their day have offered. And declined when they clung to old, outdated ways and new markets passed them by. That is what\u2019s happened to many of our great cities. And their decline was sometimes aggravated by the worst form of post-war town planning - a sort of social vandalism, carried out with the best of intentions but the worst of results. All too often, the planners cut the heart out of our cities. They swept aside the familiar city centres that had grown up over the centuries. They replaced them with a wedge of tower blocks and linking expressways, interspersed with token patches of grass and a few windswept piazzas, where pedestrians fear to tread. The planners didn\u2019t think \u2018Are we breaking the pattern of people\u2019s lives. Are we cutting them off from their friends, their neighbours?\u2019 They didn\u2019t wonder \u2018Are we uprooting whole communities?\u2019 They didn\u2019t ask \u2018Can children still play safely in the street?\u2019 They didn\u2019t consider any of these things. Nor did they consult the police about how to design an estate in which people could walk safe from muggers and vandals. They simply set the municipal bulldozer to work.What folly, what incredible folly. And the people who didn\u2019t fit into this urban utopia? They dispatched them to outlying estates without a pub or corner shop or anywhere to go. Oh! the schemes won a number of architectural awards. But they were a nightmare for the people. They snuffed out any spark of local enterprise. And they made people entirely dependent on the local authorities and the services they chose to provide. And as if that were not enough, some of our cities have also been dominated by Labour councils implacably hostile to enterprise. So when industries left, they piled higher rates on those that remained. When old markets vanished, they sought not new markets but new subsidies. And they capitalised not on their strengths, but on their weaknesses. And in fact they accelerated decline.So dying industries, soulless planning, municipal socialism - these deprived the people of the most precious things in life: hope, confidence and belief in themselves. And that sapping of the spirit is at the very heart of urban decay. Mr. President, to give back heart to our cities we must give back hope to the people. And it\u2019s beginning to happen. Because today Britain has a strong and growing economy. Oh yes, recovery has come faster in some parts of the country than others. But now it is taking root in our most depressed urban landscapes. We all applaud the organisation \u2018Business in the Community\u2019 - it is over 300 major firms that have come together to assist in reviving the urban communities from which so many of them sprang. So many of the amenities of our towns and cities - the parks and public gardens, the libraries and art galleries, the churches and schools - they had their origin in the philanthropy of men who made good themselves, and they wanted to do good for others.That impulse - that sense of obligation to the wider community - it is that we must enlist today. I\u2019ve seen the start of recovery for myself: on Teeside, in Gateshead, in Wolverhampton and the West Midlands. And in Glasgow, which is undergoing a remarkable revival, thanks largely to the work of George Younger and Malcolm Rifkind. I shell never forget one Glaswegian I met on my visit there. \u2018How do you do,\u2019 I said. \u2018My name\u2019s Margaret Thatcher.\u2019 \u2018Mine\u2019s Winston Churchill,\u2019 he replied. And astonishingly enough it was. And he produced a document to prove it. Winston Harry Churchill. Absolutely splendid person.Mr. President, to speed up the process of recovery in these and other places, we have a whole battery of special measures and programmes - you heard about them from Kenneth Clarke: special measures and programmes to clear derelict land - to renovate run-down council estates - and to regenerate city centres - and to turn dereliction into development. But by themselves these measures are not enough. We must also give people in the inner cities the opportunity to improve their own lives and the belief that they can do it.The major reforms in our programme are, of course, designed for the whole country. But they will be of particular benefit to inner cities. We will free tenants from their dependence on council landlords. We will free parents to choose the schools they want for their children. We will free businesses in the urban development areas from irksome planning restrictions and controls. And with our rate reform legislation, socialist councils will no longer be able to drive out small businesses and destroy employment by imposing sky-high rates.And above all, the community charge will make local councils far more accountable to all their voters. With all these things taken together, these measures will greatly reduce the power of the local council over tenants, parents, pupils and businesses; and greatly increase the opportunities open to those very people. To coin a phrase it is an \u2018irreversible shift... of power... in favour of working people and their families.\u2019Mr. President, the social problems of some inner cities are deep-seated. Quick and easy solutions are not possible. But the philosophy of enterprise and opportunity, which has put the spark back into our national economy that is the way - and the only way - to rejuvenate our cities and restore their confidence and pride.The Fight against CrimeBut our greatest concern, in inner cities and elsewhere, is to reverse the tide of crime which disfigures our lives. On Wednesday, we debated crime with a depth of concern that reflects the feelings of every decent person in the country. Crime invades homes; it breaks hearts; it drags down neighbourhoods; and it spreads fear. The Government is playing its full part in the fight against crime. We have strengthened the police. We have introduced tougher sentences. Violent crime concerns us, above all. It\u2019s not just that violent crime is worse than other crime. It\u2019s much worse. And that\u2019s why we are now taking still tougher action against knives and against guns.Even so, the feeling persists that some of the sentences passed by the courts have not measured up to the enormity of crime. And so as Douglas Hurd announced this week, we shall be introducing legislation to provide for an appeal against sentences which are too lenient. And may I point out it will be the second time this Government has brought a measure of this kind before Parliament. And I hope that this time it will receive a speedy passage on to the statute book. But we shall make little progress in the drive against crime if we expect the police and the courts to take on the whole burden.When we are sick, we turn to the doctor; yet we accept responsibility for taking care of our health. When fire breaks out, we call in the Fire Brigade; yet we know it is up to us to take sensible precautions against fire. So it is with crime. There is enormous scope for the public to help the police in what, after all, is a common duty: in neighbourhood watch; in business watch; in crime prevention; in prompt reporting of crime seen or suspected; and in readiness to give evidence. But even that is not enough.Civilised society doesn\u2019t just happen. It has to be sustained by standards widely accepted and upheld. And we must draw on the moral energy of society. And we must draw on the values of family life. For the family is in the first place where we learn those habits of mutual love, tolerance and service on which every healthy nation depends for its survival. It was Sir William Haley, the great Editor of The Times, who, twenty years ago, said this, \u2018There are things which are bad and false and ugly and no amount of argument or specious casuistry will make them good or true or beautiful. It is time that these things were said.\u2019 And he said them.But if we are to succeed today, all those in authority must recover that confidence and speak with a strong, emphatic and single voice. Because too often, they speak in different and conflicting voices. The great majority of crimes are committed by young people, in their teens and early twenties. It is on such impressionable young people that anti-police propaganda and the glamorisation of crime can have the most deadly effect.And when left-wing councils and left-wing teachers criticise the police they give moral sanction to the criminally inclined. When the broadcasters flout their own standards on violent television programmes, they risk a brutalising effect on the morally unstable. When the Labour Party refuses to support the Prevention of Terrorism Act - an Act that saves lives - they weaken society, they weaken society\u2019s resistance to the modern scourge of terrorism. Local councils, teachers, broadcasters, politicians: all of us have a responsibility to uphold the civilised values which underpin the law. We owe it to society of which we are a part. And we owe it especially to future generations who will inherit the society that we create.DefenceMr. President, our conference takes place at a time which could prove to be a historic turning point in world affairs. And we can say - with some pride - that Britain has played a major part in creating the opportunities which now open up before us. It is, of course, a time of tension and even of danger in the Persian Gulf.But there, too, Britain is giving a strong lead. And I do indeed pay tribute to both Geoffrey Howe and you, Mr. President, for the lead which you have given. May I join you, Mr. President, in speaking for this whole conference - and indeed for the people of this country - when I express our thanks and appreciation to the Merchant Officers and seamen who sail that vital waterway; and to the Royal Navy\u2019s Armilla Patrol and its minesweepers which protect them. We honour their dedication and their courage.But today is also a time of hope. Indeed there is no mistaking the bracing air of change in the Soviet Union. In my many hours of talking with Mr. Gorbachev in Moscow earlier this year, his determination to bring about far-reaching reform was plain. The difficulties and obstacles confronting him are massive. But we must recognise that anything which increases human liberty, which extends the boundaries of discussion and which increases initiative and enterprise in the Soviet Union, is of fundamental importance in terms of human rights. And that\u2019s why we support it. That is why we have publicly welcomed and encouraged those aspects of Mr. Gorbachev\u2019s reforms which do just this. They are genuinely courageous - not least in their admission that, after seventy years, the socialist system has failed to produce the standard of life the Russian people want.But Mr. President, we have yet to see that change carried through into the Soviet Union\u2019s policies towards the outside world. The traditional instruments of Soviet power - military strength, subversion, propaganda - are all being exercised as vigorously as ever. Afghanistan is still occupied. The Berlin Wall still stands, and Soviet weapons are still pouring into Third World countries which need food but not arms. They get the food from the free world and arms from the Soviet Union. There is however hope in the agreement which now seems certain to be signed later this autumn, by the United States and the Soviet Union, to eliminate medium and shorter-range nuclear missiles. We welcome that agreement. Indeed Britain has contributed in a major way to its achievement.It\u2019s a success for the West - especially for the United States and President Reagan. But let us remember one thing. If we had listened to the Labour Party and to CND - insofar as you can distinguish between the two - that agreement would never have been achieved. The Russians would have kept their thirteen hundred nuclear warheads, while the West would have given away its three hundred, for nothing in return. That lesson must never be forgotten. Reductions in nuclear weapons come about not from weakness, but from strength.Our PoliciesOur policies, Conservative policies, are bearing fruit and we have every reason to be pleased. But we must not let satisfaction turn to euphoria. We are ready for improved relations with the Soviet Union. But we can\u2019t afford to take anything on trust. Nor should we be deceived by changes in style rather than substance. We shall continue to judge the Soviet Union not by what they say but by what they do. We believe that the strategic nuclear weapons of the United States and the Soviet Union could be reduced by 50 per cent without endangering Western security. But so long as the Soviet Union continues to enjoy massive superiority in chemical and conventional forces, we say that reductions in nuclear weapons in Europe have gone far enough. As the Supreme Allied Commander in Europe reminded us recently: it is not a nuclear-free Europe we want, it is a war-free Europe. Nuclear weapons will continue to play a vital role in preventing war in Europe - as they have done for forty years. And that is why we will press ahead with Trident and the modernisation of our independent deterrent, vital to our security.Mr. President, the British people want peace. But it must be a peace with freedom and justice. And that peace is only maintained by keeping our defences strong, by resisting violence and intimidation at home, and by standing up to tyrants and terrorists abroad. That is the true spirit of the British people. That is the spirit which sustained us through two world wars. And it guides us still.ConclusionMr. President, you may perhaps have heard that I\u2019m a faithful student of Rudyard Kipling. Occasionally, I\u2019ve even been known to quote him. So it won\u2019t come as a complete surprise if I refer to his poem Recessional, in which he warned us to beware of boasting and to keep \u2018A humble and a contrite heart.\u2019 That\u2019s sound advice to any Government. But may I say today we have both a right and a duty to remind the whole free world that, once more, Britain is confident, strong, trusted.Confident, because attitudes have changed. \u2018Can\u2019t be done\u2019 has given way to \u2018What\u2019s to stop us?\u2019 Strong, because our economy is enterprising, competitive and expanding. And trusted, because we are known to be a powerful ally and a faithful friend. All this has been made possible by the national revival which we have carried through. And everyone in this hall, and millions outside it, can claim a share in that revival.Now, once again, it has fallen to the Conservatives to lead the nation into the 1990s. Let us face that future with quiet confidence born of what we have accomplished in the last eight years. Britain\u2019s institutions are shaped by the character of her people. It\u2019s all that is gifted, just and fair in that character which reassures our friends and allies; and brings hope to those who have yet to know the liberty we take for granted. Mr. President, it is a great trust which has been placed in our care. May we never fail that trust.

aVMadam President, friends. Four years have passed since we last came to Brighton for our conference. We all have memories of that week: memories sad and memories brave. But the human spirit is indomitable. And today we take inspiration from those of our friends, many of them here in this hall, friends who survived to rededicate themselves to the cause of freedom.Madam President, all elections matter. But some matter more than others. Some elections are not just part of history. They make history, And such was our Conservative victory in 1979. After a series of socialist Governments that said, \u2018we can\u2019t,\u2019 Britain wanted a Government that said \u2018we can.\u2019 And it got one. Nearly ten years in government - how much energy and commitment we have all put into the battle. And no one more so than the great friend and colleague we are delighted to have with us today: Willie Whitelaw. Just like old times. Nearly ten years in Government - and a resurgence of freedom and prosperity without parallel. Nearly ten years - yet it\u2019s still we Conservatives who set the pace, generate the ideas, and have the vision. Alone amongst the political parties, we hold fast to our convictions. But next year\u2019s tenth anniversary is no time to rest on our laurels. It marks the start of our next ten.We are all too young to put our feet up. I\u2019m not so sure though about our political opponents. They don\u2019t seem to have had too good a summer. After the two platoons of the old Alliance went their separate ways, they popped up last month at Torquay and Blackpool respectively. The second called the first one names, but seemed to have some difficulty knowing what name to call themselves. All those initials are so confusing, aren\u2019t they?I suggested SOS - but clearly things have gone too far for that. In the end, I think they decided to be one thing in the country and whatever they felt like in the House of Commons. Or was it the other way round? As for Labour\u2019s goings on at Blackpool, for half an hour or so it seemed that their leader had seen the light and would shortly be calling his memoirs \u2018I did it her way.\u2019 Whatever happened to Socialism?I began to compose a gracious little tribute to get the new session off to a bright start. Alas for high hopes. Was Labour about to shake off its union shackles and go it alone? Not on your Todd, - and that, Madam President, is positively the last Todd joke at this Conference. So it\u2019s back to square one for the Socialists. The Labour Leopard can\u2019t change its spots - even if it sometimes thinks wistfully of a blue rinse.Materialism - The CommunityMadam President, nearly ten years into this Conservative Government and everybody knows that our policies work and that Labour\u2019s don\u2019t, and that our policies have produced a standard of living undreamed of by our parents and the highest standard of social services this country has ever known. The Japanese call it Britain\u2019s economic miracle - and who are we to argue? Well I\u2019m proud that with a Conservative Government people are better off than they\u2019ve ever been before. But an odd thing has happened recently. Because we strive to increase the prosperity of the nation and its citizens, we\u2019re accused of materialism. It\u2019s a curious charge. For years one of the main arguments in British politics was how to secure economic growth.Now we\u2019ve done that, now we\u2019ve halted and reversed the years of decline over which Labour presided, we are told that all we care about is \u2018Loadsamoney.\u2019 Because we give people the chance to better themselves, they accuse us encouraging selfishness and greed.What nonsense. Does someone\u2019s natural desire to do well for himself, to build a better life for his family and provide opportunities for his children - does all this make him a materialist? Of course it doesn\u2019t. It makes him a decent human being, committed to his family and his community, and prepared to take responsibility on his own shoulders. The truth is that what we are actually encouraging is the best in human nature. The prosperity brought about by our policies offers a wider choice to more people than ever before. Yes, our children can travel to see the treasures and wonders of the world. Yes, older people can enjoy greater comfort and pursue their own interest. Yes, culture and the arts are thriving. Yes, people can expect to enjoy these things. And if that is the change, Madam President, I plead guilty.And there\u2019s another reply to Labour\u2019s charge of materialism, our approach has meant more to spend on the social services. More on the Health Service. More on the disabled. Indeed, if you measure community concern by community spending as Labour does - we win hands down every time. Now, of course, we don\u2019t expect the Labour Party to have anything good to say about us. After all, they have hardly anything good to say about each other. But it\u2019s time we took the credit for some of the things we have achieved. For example - the eight million patients treated in hospitals each year; the 80 per cent increase in spending on benefits for the disabled; and an increase in real terms of in nurses\u2019 pay. It\u2019s not for Labour, who cut nurses\u2019 pay and cut hospital building, to lecture Conservatives on care and compassion. Our Government has made enormous increases in the amount spent on social welfare to help the less fortunate and so have individuals. As prosperity has increased, so the fundamental generosity of our people has prompted far more personal giving.Of course, there will always be a minority whose sole concern is themselves. But those who care, and they are the great majority of us, now have the means to give. And they are giving in full measure: over £1,500 million a year to boost charities, rebuild churches, help medical research and feed the hungry. That\u2019s a marvellous record. And it doesn\u2019t stop at individuals. Many businesses are now giving a percentage of their profits to help the community in which they are situated. Is this materialism? Is this the selfish society? Are these the hallmarks of greed? The fact is that prosperity has created not the selfish society but the generous society. Madam President, Labour\u2019s charge is absurd.Individual in the CommunitySo our critics come up with a new charge. They say the individual gains success only at the expense of the community. That\u2019s wrong, too. Personal effort doesn\u2019t undermine the community; it enhances the community. When individual talents are held back, the community is held back too. Encourage the individual and the community benefits. A parent\u2019s success is shared by his family, a pupil\u2019s success by his school, a soldier\u2019s by his regiment.A man may climb Everest for himself, but at the summit he plants his country\u2019s flag. We can only build a responsible, independent community with responsible, independent people. That\u2019s why Conservative policies have given more and more of them the chance to buy their own homes, to build up capital, to acquire shares in their companies. But there are some people such as those living on housing estates controlled by hard left councils or parents with children going to inadequate schools who, by the time of the last election, had not benefited from our policies as much as we\u2019d like. And our last manifesto had those people especially in mind. And that\u2019s why we\u2019re giving council tenants new rights in housing. We believe that where families have a bigger say in their own home, the whole street looks up.In some areas, it\u2019s already happening. And we\u2019re giving parents more say in their children\u2019s education. We believe that if parents help to run schools, we\u2019ll get the best schools not just for their children, but for all children. But Madam President it\u2019s not enough to pass new laws at Westminster. We have to see that the benefits reach the people for whom they were intended. And we have to do that.We have to help those families. Otherwise they\u2019ll be brow-beaten by Socialist Councillors and bombarded by Socialist propaganda calculated to deny them the opportunities we have provided. Greater responsibility gives more dignity to the individual and more strength to the community. And that belief is at the heart of Conservatism. And we must make it live.The EconomyMadam President, when we were returned at that historic election in 1979 we were faced with the overriding threat of inflation. It was inflation that had redistributed wealth from the thrifty to the fly-by-night. It was inflation that had undermined confidence, first in the currency, then in savings, then in investment, and finally in our country\u2019s future. To salvage our economy, we had first to defeat inflation, and only then could the great revival of the British economy begin. Today we are in our eighth year of growth. Our unemployment figures are below the community average. We have created more jobs than they have.And other countries come to our shores to see what we do and go home to copy. Since we took office we have handed 18 State Enterprises back to the British people - 18 so far, more to come. We have encouraged ownership at home and ownership at work. We have turned small business from an endangered species to a vital and rapidly growing part of our economy. The habits of hard work, enterprise, and inventiveness that made us great are with us again. But however firmly rooted our new found strength, you can\u2019t steer an economy on automatic pilot. Success doesn\u2019t look after itself. You have to work at it. In economics, there are no final victories. At home, the fast pace of economic growth has put more money into people\u2019s pockets and more money into industry\u2019s profits.Some has been invested, but with rapid growth in consumption, imports have grown faster than exports, leaving us with a substantial trade deficit. And too much buying has been paid for by too much borrowing. And so to encourage people to spend less and save more, the Chancellor has had to raise interest rates. It\u2019s never popular to push them up - except perhaps with savers - but popular or not, the Chancellor has dose the right thing, as you\u2019d expect of him. And the right thing is to make sure that we continue to grow steadily, if less fast than in recent months. Too much borrowing has also meant that inflation today is too high. Make no mistake. We intend to bring inflation down again. That\u2019s not an expression of hope. It\u2019s a statement of intent. And I think the country knows us well enough by now to recognise that we say what we mean and we mean what we say.As you know there are always pressures on Government to spend more than the country can afford. We\u2019re not going down that road. Not this year. Not next year. Not any year. We\u2019ll continue to keep a firm grip on public spending. And I look forward to those who so roundly condemn extravagance with private money, giving their whole-hearted enthusiastic support to our prudence in handling the public\u2019s money.Protecting our WorldMadam President, there is nothing new or unusual about the Tory commitment to protect the environment. The last thing we want is to leave environmental debts for our children to clear up - slag, grime, acid rain and pollution. For too much of human history, man assumed that whatever he did, he could take his natural world for granted. Today we know that simply isn\u2019t true. In the last century or so, we have seen an unprecedented increase in the pace of change, quite unprecedented: the growth in population, the spread of industry, the dramatically increased use of oil, gas and coal, the cutting down of forests.And these have created new and daunting problems, you know them: acid rain, the greenhouse effect - a kind of global heat trap and its consequences for the world\u2019s climate. In the past, science has solved many of the problems which at the time seemed quite insuperable. It can do so again. We are far too sensible to think that in 1988 we can turn the clock back to a pre-industrial world where Adam delved and Eve span. The Garden of Eden had a population of two. Our world has a population of five billion going on six. And it has more than doubled in my own lifetime. Those people need to cook meals, heat homes, clothe themselves, find work. They need factories, roads, and power stations. All these things are part of our lives today and the ambition of the third world tomorrow.So the choice facing us is not industrial development or a clean environment. To survive we need both. Industry is part of our habitat; economic growth is one of the systems that sustain human life today. Madam President, pride in these islands - our countryside, our seas and rivers - runs like a thread through our history and literature. Sometimes, it seems a perverse pride. \u2018Fog, fog everywhere\u2019 begins one of Dickens\u2019 greatest novels. That was still true in London when I first went to work there. But the Clean Air Act of 1956 - passed by a Conservative Government - banished smog from the air we breathe.The Thames is now the cleanest metropolitan estuary in the world and £4 billion is now being spent on the Mersey. I want to see the industrial rivers of the North and Midlands - and of Europe - as clean as the Thames. We have led Europe in banning the dumping of harmful industrial waste in the North Sea. And given our record, we are well placed to take the lead with other Governments in practical efforts to protect the wider world. We will work with them to end the destruction of the world\u2019s forests. We shall direct more of our overseas aid to help poor countries to protect their trees and plant new ones.We will join with others to seek further protection of the ozone layer - that global skin which protects life itself from ultraviolet radiation. We will work to cut down the use of fossil fuels, a cause of both acid rain and the greenhouse effect. But that means a policy for safe, sensible and balanced use of nuclear power. It\u2019s we Conservatives who are not merely friends of the Earth - we are its guardians and trustees for generations to come. The core of Tory philosophy and the case for protecting the environment are the same. No generation has a freehold on this earth. All we have is a life tenancy with a full repairing lease. And this Government intends to meet the terms of that lease in full.Law and OrderMadam President, year in, year out this Conservative Government has taken action against crime - action on police numbers, on police powers, on firearms, on fraud, on prison building, on compensation for victims, on stiffer penalties. And action against football hooligans and those who carry knives and firearms. And there is more to come.Witness, for example, the new Criminal Justice Act. That is the action we have consistently taken. I hope that the Courts will continue to take account of the strong public support for tough penalties against violent criminals. I am sure they will pay the most careful attention to the longer sentences that are now available to them. Anyone who mugs an old lady leaving the post office with her pension, anyone who rapes a teenager walking home from an evening with friends, anyone who commits violence against a child, should have no shred of doubt about the severity of the sentence for that sort of brutality. Violent crime is a blight on too many lives. And its reduction has a claim not only on the political energy of the Government, but on the moral energy of the people. We are not spectators in the battle between the police and criminals. We are all involved. To witness a crime and say nothing about it, hinders the police and helps the criminal. To protect our own home from burglary, hinders the criminal and helps the police.There\u2019s a breed of left-wing politicians who excuse violence on the grounds that it\u2019s not the criminal who is guilty - but the rest of us. That\u2019s a specious argument left over from the sixties. In effect it excuses, indeed even encourages, crime by absolving the criminal of guilt in advance.  Weasel words can never justify the actions of the robber, the thug or the hooligan.Conservatives need no sermons from Socialists on the rule of law. We proposed tougher sentences for criminals who carry guns: they opposed them. We proposed that over-lenient sentences should be referred to the appeal court: Labour voted against. We condemned violence on the picket line: they equivocated. And, year after year, they will not support the Prevention of Terrorism Act, an act which is vital to the defeat of the IRA and which has saved so very many lives. I find that very hard to forgive.Northern IrelandIn this country and in other democracies, the enemies of civilisation and freedom have turned to the gun and the bomb to destroy those they can\u2019t persuade. The terrorist threat to freedom is worldwide. It can never be met by appeasement. Give in to the terrorist and you breed more terrorism. At home and abroad our message is the same. We will not bargain, nor compromise, nor bend the knee to terrorists.In our United Kingdom, the main terrorist threat has come from the IRA. Their minds twisted by hatred and fanaticism, they have tried to bomb and murder their way to their objective of tearing more than a million citizens out of the United Kingdom. The truth is that the whole IRA campaign is based on crushing democracy and smashing anyone who doesn\u2019t agree with them. To all those who have suffered so much at their hands, to the Northern Ireland policemen, prison officers and their families, to the soldiers, the judges, the civil servants and their families, we offer our deepest admiration and thanks for defending democracy, and our thanks for facing danger while keeping within the rule of law - unlike the terrorist who skulks in the shadows and shoots to kill. We thank too the security forces who had the guts to go to Gibraltar to give evidence to the inquest, demonstrating conclusively that they acted at all times within the law and to save lives. The lives of countless people who would have been killed had the IRA fulfilled their murderous purpose. What a pity it is that there are still some in this country not prepared to accept the verdict of the jury, so great is their prejudice against the security forces.What comfort that must be to the terrorists. We will work to increase co-operation in security between the sovereign governments in London and Dublin, We will work to involve both Protestants and Catholics fully and fairly in the economic and political life of Northern Ireland. But we will never give up the search for more effective ways of defeating the IRA. And if the IRA think they can weary us or frighten us, they have made a terrible miscalculation. People sometimes say that it\u2019s wrong to use the word never in politics. I disagree - some things are of such fundamental importance that no other word is appropriate. So I say once again today that this Government will never surrender to the IRA. Never. East/West and DefenceMadam President, great changes are taking place in world affairs, no less momentous, no less decisive for our future than those which followed the Second World War. But there is a crucial difference. This time liberty is gaining ground the world over. Communism is in retreat, democracy and free enterprise are showing that only they can meet the real needs of people.Britain\u2019s resurgence and our close relationship with the United States under President Reagan\u2019s strong leadership has put us right at the forefront of these great events. And once again we are playing the part which history and our instincts demand. President Reagan has rebuilt the strength and confidence of the West - not without a little help - and he has inspired the democracies to go out and win the battle of ideas. It\u2019s vital that Britain and America should always stand together. So the next President of the United States will have the United Kingdom as a staunch ally. The need for strong leadership in America and in Britain will be no less in the period ahead. Perhaps one day the exciting developments taking place in the Soviet Union will lead to a freer society and less expansionist aims. Let us hope so. But hope is no basis for a defence policy. For all the bold reforms, the Soviet Union remains a one-party state, in which the Communist Party is supreme, and Soviet forces remain far in excess of what they need for defence alone. So we have to keep our sense of perspective and our defences in good repair.The old dangers persist and we also have to be alert to new dangers. Even as relations with the Soviet Union become more hopeful, some other countries have already acquired chemical weapons and missiles. And what\u2019s more, some seek nuclear weapons. Madam President, it\u2019s in the nature of democracies to relax at the first sign of hope. This we must not do.For great change is also a time of great uncertainty, especially in the countries of Eastern Europe. Now more than ever before the West must be united and prepared. NATO\u2019s purpose is to prevent not only nuclear war, but all war. And its strategy recognises that conventional weapons alone can\u2019t provide an adequate and effective deterrent against either nuclear threat or the massive conventional and chemical weapons of the Warsaw Pact. Yet last week in Blackpool, Labour reduced the defence of the realm to a farce. Their new secret weapon for Britain\u2019s defence was revealed. It was a form of words. Labour\u2019s leadership proposed a composite resolution embracing unilateral disarmament, bilateral disarmament and multilateral disarmament, all at the same time. Not to defend Britain against her enemies, but to defend the Labour leader against his.And like all forms of appeasement, it failed. The Labour Conference passed a resolution reaffirming Labour\u2019s commitment to one-sided disarmament. But the only resolution that matters is the unswerving resolution of this Conservative Government. The British people know that it is our strength which keeps us safe.EuropeMadam President, as you know, I spoke recently in Bruges about Britain\u2019s views on Europe. It caused a bit of a stir. Indeed, from some of the reactions you would have thought I had re-opened the Hundred Years War. And from the avalanche of support, you\u2019d have thought I\u2019d won it single-handed. And why all the fuss? Because I reminded people that Europe was not created by the Treaty of Rome? Because I said that willing and active co-operation between independent sovereign states is the best way to build a successful European Community? Because I said that to try to suppress nationhood and concentrate power at the centre of a European conglomerate would be highly damaging and would jeopardise the objectives we seek to achieve?Of course, that wasn\u2019t at all convenient for those who want to bring about a federal Europe by stealth. They don\u2019t like having these points aired publicly. That was evident from their confusion. First they argued that national identity is not threatened by Brussels. Then they said that the whole idea of nationhood is old-fashioned and out-of-date. Well, they can\u2019t have it both ways! But I welcomed the debate, because it\u2019s brought into the open an equally fundamental question. The choice between two kinds of Europe:There\u2019s no doubt what the Community\u2019s founders intended. The Treaty of Rome is a charter for economic liberty, which they knew was the essential condition for personal and political liberty.Today that founding concept is under attack from those who see European unity as a vehicle for spreading Socialism. Well, we haven\u2019t worked all these years to free Britain from the paralysis of Socialism only to see it creep in through the back door of central control and bureaucracy from Brussels. That wasn\u2019t what we joined the European Community for. Ours is the true European ideal. It is that ideal which will fire our campaign in the European elections. That\u2019s why we must win every possible seat in the European Parliament for the Conservative cause.We shall point out:With these sort of credentials, no-one should doubt Britain\u2019s wholehearted commitment to Europe.ConclusionMadam President, every year the press tells us in advance that Conservative conferences are dull affairs in which everyone agrees with everyone else. And every year we have a debate on law and order. Still, the press is right in one respect. Everyone can see, through all the cut-and-thrust of debate, that this Party is united on the great fundamentals of politics. We believe that individuals have a right to liberty that no state can take away. That Government is the servant of the people, not its master. That the role of Government is to strengthen our freedom, not deny it. That the economic role of Government is to establish a climate in which enterprise can flourish, not to elbow enterprise out of the way. That a wise Government will spread opportunities, but that individuals must seize them. That citizens who are protected by the law have a duty to assist in maintaining the law. That freedom entails responsibilities, first to the family, then to neighbours, then to the nation and beyond. And that a strong Britain is the surest guarantor of peace.As well as these grand themes, we have always believed in what is small and precious, in the value of what is local and familiar, in the patchworks of voluntary groups and associations, each with its own purpose, but all pursuing the common purpose of making the country a better and more civilised place.These are the beliefs which sustain us. Other parties may discard their principles along with their names, or seek to conceal their beliefs in order to win power. Not right because they serve our interests. Not even right just because they work. But right because they express all that is best in human nature. Nothing less would have sustained us through the difficult early days of this Government. Nothing less would have ensured the loyalty of our supporters and the trust of the British people when the going wasn\u2019t so good. But we had - and we have - the great assurance that our beliefs are not lofty abstractions confined to philosophy lectures. They are the common sense of the British people. They are what ordinary men and women agree on instinctively. Madam President, the Conservative Party occupies the common ground of British politics Indeed, we staked out that ground. And it is where the great mass of the British people have pitched their tents. And so it has fallen to us to lead Britain into the 1990s. And, who knows, beyond. There will be new challenges, new problems, new tests. For there are no final victories in politics either.But, Madam President, we will meet them strengthened by our belief in this country. In the talents and wisdom of its people. In their tolerance and fairness. In their decency and kindness. And in their confidence and their courage.

aVMr. President, friends, I can think of no more fitting Chairman for this final session of our Conference than you, Mr. President, the greatest team player in British politics, a straight bat at the wicket, steady on the green, mighty in the scrum. Your role in Government was invaluable: always wise, often witty, and just occasionally wily. I know that I speak for everyone when I say that this Conference extends to you and to Celia the warmest possible thank you. It\u2019s marvellous to see you both here. And may I say thank you to our Party Chairman, Kenneth Baker, our Conference off to a flying start with such a terrific speech. Speeches from all ministers have been superb. We are the right team for Britain\u2019s future.Mr. President, this Conference, as distinct from last week\u2019s little exercise in shadow-boxing in Brighton, has addressed, head-on, the real issues of the day. Which is what you would expect from a Party and a Government of real beliefs. Not for us, disposable ideals. Not for us, throwaway conviction. Not for us, rent-a-principle. We Conservatives know what we believe, say what we believe, and stand by what we believe.The Triumph of FreedomMr. President, what a fantastic year this has been for freedom. 1989 will be remembered for decades to come as the year when half the people of half our continent began to throw off their chains. The messages on our banners in 1979 - freedom, opportunity, family, enterprise, ownership - are now inscribed on the banners in Leipzig, Warsaw, Budapest and even Moscow. For decades, East Germans had risked their lives to claw their way through the barbed wire to freedom. Now they come, not by the brave handful but by the cheerful thousand. Hungary, turning day by day more confidently towards freedom and dignity, dismantles Communism and opens her borders to the West. In Poland, the freely elected representatives of a courageous people move resolutely into the seats of government. And let us never forget Poland\u2019s contribution to our own Finest Hour. What happened in Russia in 1917 wasn\u2019t a revolution. It was a coup d\u2019etat. The true revolution is what is happening in Russia and Eastern Europe today.In 1979, we knew that we were starting a British revolution; in fact, we were the pioneers of a world revolution. So it\u2019s ironic that as enterprise and liberty rise from the dead ashes of State Control, the Labour Party here is still trying to blow life into those old embers. Imagine a Labour canvasser talking on the doorstep to those East German families when they settle in, on freedom\u2019s side of the wall: \u2018You want to keep more of the money you earn? I\u2019m afraid that\u2019s very selfish. We shall want to tax that away. You want to own shares in your firm? We can\u2019t have that. The state has to own your firm. You want to choose where to send your children to school? That\u2019s very divisive. You\u2019ll send your child where we tell you.\u2019Mr. President, the trouble with Labour is that they\u2019re just not at home with freedom. Socialists don\u2019t like ordinary people choosing, for they might not choose Socialism. That\u2019s why Labour wants the State to take more and more of the decisions. \u2018But that\u2019s all changed,\u2019 we\u2019re told. If you believe the reports, Brighton last week was the scene of an unprecedented mass conversion. Nothing like it since the Chinese General who baptised his entire army with a hosepipe. Isn\u2019t it amazing? The Party which fought to stop council tenants having the right to buy their homes now tells us it is the Party of home ownership. The Party which called for one-sided nuclear disarmament now says it stands for strong defence. The Party which took us to the IMF, like some Third World Country, now primly poses as a model of financial rectitude. And it\u2019s all happened, as dear old Tommy Cooper used to say: \u2018Just like that.\u2019Would you believe it? Well no, actually I wouldn\u2019t. You see, one can\u2019t help wondering: \u2018If it\u2019s that easy for the Labour Leader to give up the principles in which he does believe, won\u2019t it be even easier for him to give up the principles in which he does not believe?\u2019 The truth is, nothing has really changed. Labour just wants power at any price and they\u2019ll say anything to get it. Labour\u2019s real prescription for Britain is the disease half the world is struggling to cure. And as for the leaders of the former Alliance parties, I will say no more than this: They have never learned what every woman knows: you can\u2019t make a soufflé rise twice.The Heart Of The MatterMr. President, it is no accident that Socialism has failed, nor that the democracies and free enterprise economies of the West have prospered. These results are the inevitable consequences of two quite different approaches. It\u2019s not a question of a little less planning here or a little less regulation there, or of a fraction more private capital in this sector or a touch more competition in that. Socialism is not just about economics. Its central dogma is to make the State the ultimate authority for the whole of life. It\u2019s based on coercion. It denies the dignity of people. It is a secular creed which has utterly failed. The ruins that remain of Socialism in Europe today are physical shortages, a corrupt bureaucracy, growing unrest, and the urgent cry of those refugees, \u2018We want to get out.\u2019Our creed never set out to dominate the whole of life. At the heart of our belief is the principle of freedom, under a rule of law. Freedom that gives a man room to breathe, to take responsibility, to make his own decisions and to chart his own course. Remove man\u2019s freedom and you dwarf the individual, you devalue his conscience and you demoralise him. That is the heart of the matter. Some talk as if we should be ashamed of harnessing men\u2019s talents to the common good. They paint wealth as selfishness, a better standard of living as greed. But only by creating wealth can you relieve poverty.It\u2019s what you do with your wealth that counts. In these ten Conservative years, voluntary giving has doubled. Individuals and companies contribute unprecedented sums to rejuvenate the inner cities and support great charitable causes. Others give their time and their effort. Of course, there are people who are selfish. There are people who are downright evil. Human wickedness is always with us but you\u2019ll find it\u2019s not in this Party that crime and hooliganism are excused. For the most part, freedom enables and moves men and women to be warm hearted and generous. For every Pharisee our system produces, you will find at least three good Samaritans.EconomyTen years ago, we set out together on a great venture. To provide a new lexicon for prosperity. To replace \u2018It can\u2019t be done,\u2019 with \u2018I\u2019ll have a go.\u2019 And we succeeded. Yes, there are still serious problems to tackle and I\u2019ll come to them in a moment. But let us set them against the massive achievements of our period in office. Industry - modernised at a pace unrivalled in the post-war years. Productivity in manufacturing - gains far exceeding those in Europe and North America. Profits - the best for 20 years, leading to investment at record levels. Jobs - more people in work in Britain than ever before. Living standards - higher than we have ever known. Reducing the national debt - not piling it up for our children to repay. Privatisation - five industries that together were losing over £2 million a week in the public sector, now making profits of over £100 million a week in the private sector. That is the measure of our achievements. But if you really want to see how the economy is doing, look at the newspapers. No, I didn\u2019t say read them. Just count the ones that didn\u2019t exist before 1979 - and weigh the ones that did.And if you\u2019re still not satisfied, talk to the Americans and Japanese. They are investing more in Britain than in any other European country. Moreover, for the first time in years there are as many British as there are German companies in the top 100 in Europe. And, further, of these, six of the seven top earners are British or part British. And, with all these achievements under our belt, who presumes to advise us on inflation? Labour - who hold the record for the highest inflation for 50 years: 27 per cent. Mr. President, all inflation is painful. So is reducing it. But in 1982, we got it down to 5 per cent and by 1986 to 3 per cent. Today, inflation is 7.6 per cent. For a Conservative Government that\u2019s far too high. We must get it down again. And we will.But I know what a worry inflation is, especially for pensioners. We have always promised that whatever the rise in inflation, the retirement pension will be fully protected against it. This month\u2019s figure for inflation, which came out this morning, is the one used for the pension increase next April. That means that the single pension next April will go up by £130 and the married pension by £530. This Government keeps its promises. I also know what a worry high interest rates are for families with mortgages and for those involved in farming and other small businesses. But when the choice is between high rates now or persistent higher inflation later, with all the damage that would do, the choice is clear.Inflation will come down through the use of high interest rates, as it has in the past. And so it must, for the rest of the world isn\u2019t standing still. America, Japan, West Germany - they\u2019re all investing, modernising, and cutting costs. To stay competitive, we must do the same. As Nigel Lawson made clear yesterday, industry must not expect to find refuge in a perpetually depreciating currency. Only by steadily improving efficiency will we win and keep our share of the world\u2019s markets. Britain\u2019s economy is strong. When inflation is beaten - and it will be - Britain will be stronger still.Conservatism and ChoiceMr. President, we Conservatives have extended ownership of homes, shares and pensions to more people than ever before. We\u2019ve created that democracy of ownership upon which political democracy depends. We\u2019ve laid the economic foundations of a decent and prosperous future. None of this would have been possible without the two finest Chancellors of the Exchequer since the War: Geoffrey Howe and Nigel Lawson. Their achievements have enabled us to provide more resources where they were needed for schools, for hospitals, for pensioners and disabled people. But money can\u2019t achieve everything.We have to make sure that public services meet the needs of the public and not just the convenience of those who work in them. It would be wholly wrong if people could only exercise choice in the private sector, and were given no choice in the public sector if they had simply to take it or leave it. If patients had no choice where they were to be treated, they\u2019d be left on long waiting lists. If parents couldn\u2019t choose their children\u2019s school, they\u2019d have to go where the local authority sent them. If tenants had no say in the way their estates were run, they would be under the thumb of their council landlords. What could be more democratic than to give people a direct say in these things? What could be more arrogant than to deny it to them? That\u2019s why choice matters so much, choice for the less well off as much for the comfortably off.HealthMr. President, in every year since I became Prime Minister, more money has been spent on the Health Service, in every year more doctors and nurses have been recruited and in every year more patients have been treated. These are the actions of a Government determined to make the Health Service one of the best in the world. The advances in the last ten years have by any standards been remarkable. At the same time people rightly worry about waiting lists for operations and also about the time that outpatients have to wait before being seen. The time taken to treat patients can be weeks in one area and years in another. There are some who say that the only way to improve the NHS further is to give it more money. So we have. Two billion pounds more this year than last. But the truth is that money on its own is not the answer. That\u2019s why we are looking at other ways of improving the service to the patient.We want those hospitals and doctors who carry the heaviest burden of work to be rewarded for it. We want people to be able to choose where they can get the best and quickest hospital care. In view of some of the false impressions that have been created, let me emphasise one simple point: The National Health Service will not be privatised. The National Health Service was never going to be privatised. No matter what the emergency, accident or disease; no matter how long or complicated the treatment, the Health Service is there, the Health Service will always be there, to provide the finest care. There to heal, there to cure and there to tend the needs of the patient.EducationMr. President, we all want our children to have more opportunity than we had ourselves. We know their individual strengths and capacities. We wish every one to be able to explore the limits of their own abilities and to find their place in the world. And we fervently believe that parents are the best people to judge what is right for their children.Socialists, however, are obsessed with equal outcomes at the expense of equal opportunities. Time and again, we erected ladders for children to climb; time and again, the Socialist politicians climbed them, and having done so, they tried to kick them away. They did it with Grammar Schools. They did it with Direct Grant Schools. They want to do it with Assisted Places and Grant Maintained Schools. Mr. President, they haven\u2019t changed. Let me tell you what I found when I opened a new school in Nottingham a fortnight ago. It was a City Technology College. The local Labour controlled council had told an eleven-year-old girl that she would be thrown out of the Council\u2019s Music School if she attended the CTC where she\u2019s been accepted. To deprive an eleven-year-old of her music classes because she goes to a school that the Council doesn\u2019t control - there\u2019s Socialist compassion for you.In the teeth of fierce Labour opposition, we have enlarged the choice of schools for parents and children and brought in major education reforms. We\u2019ve brought in a National Curriculum of ten subjects which all children have a right and need to know: with mathematics, English, and science at their core. Who now argues that we were wrong? They know that we were right: right to insist on higher standards in the classroom, right to establish a curriculum which gives children the skills for work and the knowledge for a full life, right to pass on the best of our heritage and scholarship to the next generation, and right to establish wider opportunities throughout the entire education system.Passports to OpportunityBut there are still too many ways in which opportunity after school can be blocked. For instance, there are prejudices about the age at which people can begin a new career. Well, I started being Prime Minister at the age of 53. I\u2019d never been a Prime Minister before, But I adapted to the work. I did my best. And my employers have twice asked me to stay on. Then again, some people find a lot of jobs blocked to them because they don\u2019t have the right qualifications. I went to Oxford University, but I\u2019ve never let it hold me back. Let there be no mistake: skills, degrees, diplomas, qualifications - these are necessary in the modern industrial world.But opportunity mustn\u2019t be cut short at eighteen. We must make sure it lasts a lifetime. We have already set up the first training scheme that\u2019s open to all young people and a new adult training scheme for the long-term unemployed. Incidentally, it\u2019s the best of its kind in Europe. Other people come here to see how we do it. But we also need to remove those obstacles and disincentives which government itself has erected. That\u2019s why I\u2019m proud that this month we abolished the earnings rule for pensioners. Income Tax and National Insurance can also be an obstacle to those starting work, especially the low paid. So, again, I\u2019m proud that this Government has cut income tax at all levels. And this very month we have cut the national insurance contributions by up to £3 a week.And thanks to the Chancellor, from next April, married women will be taxed separately, giving them complete privacy in their tax affairs. And then, Mr. President, in 1992 the professions will have the freedom move throughout Europe. That will open up a much wider vista for all young people. These and other changes are passports, passports that will enable their holders to overcome a false start in early life, passports with no expiry date, passports to the Conservative world of opportunity.EnvironmentMr. President, when I spoke to the Royal Society about the environment over a year ago, I spoke about the global threat of climate change. I set out the magnitude of the challenge we face. Until recently, we have always thought that whatever progress humanity makes, our planet would stay much the same.That may no longer be true. The way we generate energy. The way we use land. The way industry uses natural resources and disposes of waste. The way our populations multiply. Those things taken together are new in the experience of the earth. They threaten to change the atmosphere above us and the sea around us. That is the scale of the global challenge. We have to work to solve these problems on a sound scientific basis so that our remedies will be effective. It is no good proposing that we go back to some simple village life and halve our population by some means which have not been revealed, as if that would solve all our problems.Indeed, some of the Third World\u2019s primitive farming methods created the deserts and denuded the forests. And some of Eastern Europe\u2019s crude technologies polluted the skies and poisoned the rivers. It\u2019s prosperity which creates the technology that can keep the earth healthy. We are called Conservatives with good reason. We believe in conserving what is best the values of our way of life, the beauties of our country. The countryside has shaped our character as a nation. We have a special responsibility not to let the towns sprawl into it. We will keep the Green Belt green.And to make Britain cleaner, we shall bring in a new Environment Bill to give us much tougher controls on pollution, litter and waste. Next month, I shall be going to the United Nations to set out our view on how the world should tackle climate change. We have proposed a global convention - a sort of good conduct guide - on the environment for all the world\u2019s nations, on problems like the greenhouse effect. Britain has taken the lead internationally and we shall continue to do so.This is not only a question of acting responsibly, though we do. There is something deeper in us, an innate sense of belonging, of sharing life in a world that we have not fully understood. As Voyager 2, on its remarkable 12 year flight, raced through the solar system to Neptune and beyond, we were awestruck by the pictures it sent back of arid, lifeless planets and moons. They were a solemn reminder that our planet has the unique privilege of life. How much more that makes us aware of our duty to safeguard our world. The more we master our environment, the more we must learn to serve it. That is the Conservative approach.Change and UncertaintyMr. President, there are always new dangers to be faced, new battles to be fought. We are at war against drugs: against those who produce drugs, against those who peddle drugs, against those who launder the profits of the drug trade. Drugs stunt young lives, they break up families, they injure babies before they are even born. There are those in Britain who say we should legalise certain drugs. As though burglary could be defeated by legalising theft. How typical of the muddled thinking of the so-called progressives. In fact, such action would expose many more of our young people to the danger of drugs. We must continue to protect them with the full force of the law. The police and customs officers deserve our thanks for all they do.We also face a continuing battle against the terrorists and those who take hostages. We think of Terry Waite, Brian Keenan, John McCarthy - and of their families and friends who endure so much. Any government which has influence over those who hold hostages should be ready as a matter of course to use that influence to bring about their release. A country cannot support terrorism and still expect to be treated as a member of the international community. To take hostages is to exclude yourself from the civilised world.In Germany in the last few weeks we have seen the IRA gun down a young army wife sitting alone in her car. And in Britain, we have seen them bomb the young musicians in the Royal Marines Band. Some can\u2019t wait to put the blame on security arrangements, as though they were somehow responsible for these appalling crimes.Let us pin the responsibility where it belongs: on the common murderers of the IRA. We thank our servicemen and women and the police for their courage and dedication.DefenceMr. President, in today\u2019s rapidly changing world, you never know where conflict may arise. In the last ten years, we have seen the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, the Iran/Iraq war, Vietnam\u2019s occupation of Cambodia conflicts in Africa and Central America, attacks on shipping in the Gulf, one crisis after another in the Lebanon and the Middle East. And for us, the battle for the freedom of the Falklands.Times of great change are also times of uncertainty and even danger. The lesson is that you must always keep your defences strong so that you are prepared for any situation. Some among us remember all too well what happened in the 1920s and 1930s, when we allowed our hopes for a peaceful world to outrun our judgements on the need for defence. And the world paid a terrible price. We know now that it\u2019s strong defence which protects peace, and it\u2019s weakness which brings war.So we have kept our defences strong and we have kept the peace in Europe. Yes, we are ready to negotiate to reduce the levels of weapons on both sides. But only so long as it can be done without jeopardising our security. President Gorbachev understands that principle very well. From our very first meeting he has always told me that he would never do anything to put the Soviet Union\u2019s security in danger and he knows that I would never endanger our security, nor would the Government I lead. Yet that\u2019s just what Labour would do. Endanger our security.Last week the Labour Party voted overwhelmingly to cut Britain\u2019s defence budget by a quarter - almost equivalent to the entire Royal Navy. Of course, Labour says that they would keep our nuclear deterrent. But what for? Not to defend or deter, certainly not. Only to negotiate it away as quickly as possible in return for a small cut in the Soviet Union\u2019s vast nuclear arsenal. We would give up all our nuclear weapons while the Soviet Union would keep most of theirs. What a bargain.Labour\u2019s supposed conversion to multilateralism is no more than a confidence trick to try to make Labour electable. It\u2019s still unilateral disarmament - unilateral disarmament by agreement with the Soviet Union. That isn\u2019t a defence policy to see Britain through the 1990s; it\u2019s a form of words to see Labour through the next election. How does one explain the Labour leader\u2019s contortions? Is he being false to his convictions? Or true to his character?Mr. President, politicians come in many colours, but if you aspire to lead this nation: \u2018This, above all, to thine own self be true.\u2019 You don\u2019t reach Downing Street by pretending you\u2019ve travelled the road to Damascus when you haven\u2019t even left home. It will be our job to expose Labour\u2019s defence policy and make sure no one is taken in. It is Government\u2019s responsibility to safeguard our defence. Today, as for the past ten years, only a Conservative Government can be trusted to do that.ConclusionMr. President, I spoke to you first as Leader of our Party here in Blackpool, on this platform, at our Party Conference in 1975. I remember it so well. It was not the height of our political fortunes, nor the height of Britain\u2019s. Freedom was in retreat. The countries of Eastern Europe seemed crushed forever under the communist heel. But I said then that we were coming up to a turning point in our history. Few believed it but that turning point came in 1979. For we Conservatives were the pathfinders. We did not know it at the time, but the torch we lit in Britain which transformed our country, the torch of freedom that is now the symbol of our Party, became the beacon that has shed its light across the Iron Curtain into the East. Today that beacon shines more strongly than at any time this century. You can see it reflected in the faces of the young people from the Communist countries who have reached the West.Like most young people the world over, they are resolved to make their own way; to achieve success by their own efforts; to live the life they choose as part of a free world, a free world they have never known. They are retelling the story of our history. We cannot know the direction in which free nations in the future will progress. But this we do know - and dare not forget. Only those whose commitment to free enterprise and opportunity is a matter of conviction, not convenience have the necessary strength to sustain them. Only those who have shown the resolve to defend the freedom of the West can be trusted to safeguard it in the challenging, turbulent and unpredictable times that lie ahead. Mr. President, the decade and the century which open up before us must see the lasting triumph of liberty, our common cause. The world needs Britain - and Britain needs us - to make that happen.

aVMr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen. I want to begin on a personal note and I think you will understand why. Since we met last year, I have lost the best of friends, Ian Gow, and we have all lost one of our wisest and bravest colleagues. Before he was murdered by the IRA, Ian taught us how a civilised community should respond to such an outrage. This is what he said: \u2018The message that should go out from all decent people - and 99 per cent of people in Northern Ireland and 99 per cent of people in Great Britain are decent people - is that we will never, never surrender to people like this.\u2019Let us pledge to Ian\u2019s memory that we will never waver from the steadfast courage he showed in defence of our fellow citizens in Ulster, their rights and their liberties. Ian was a brave man. It is brave men and women who will ensure that democracy triumphs over darkness.Mr. President, this year the world seems to have relived the opening sentence of A Tale of Two Cities: it was the best of times, it was the worst of times. The worst of times as a tyrant struck down a small country that stands at the gateway to the Gulf; the best of times as tyranny crumbled and freedom triumphed across the continent of Europe. The toppling of the Berlin Wall. The overthrow of Ceausescu by the people he had so brutally oppressed. The first free elections in Eastern Europe for a generation. The spread of the ideas of market freedom and independence to the very heart of the Soviet Leviathan.Who could have foreseen all this? Who will ever forget the testimonies of courage we heard yesterday in this very hall? Our friends from Eastern Europe reminded us that no force of arms, no walls, no barbed wire can for ever suppress the longing of the human heart for liberty and independence. Their courage found allies. Their victory came about because for forty long, cold years the West stood firm against the military threat from the East. Free enterprise overwhelmed Socialism.This Government stood firm against all those voices raised at home in favour of appeasement. We were criticised for intransigence. Tempted repeatedly with soft options. And reviled for standing firm against Soviet military threats. When will they learn? When will they ever learn? Now again in the sands of the Middle East, principle is at stake. Mr. President, dictators can be deterred, they can be crushed they can never be appeased. These things are not abstractions. What changed the world and what will save the world were principle and resolve.Our principles: freedom, independence, responsibility, choice - these and the democracy built upon them are Britain\u2019s special legacy to the world. Everywhere those who love liberty look to Britain. When they speak of parliaments they look to Westminster. When they speak of justice they look to our common law. And when they seek to regenerate their economies, they look to the transformation we British have accomplished. Principles and resolve: They are what changed Britain a decade ago. They are what the Conservative Patty brings to Britain. They alone can secure her freedom and prosperity in the years ahead.Mr. President, this has been the Conference of a Party and a Government with a clear message. Kenneth Baker has given us two fizzing speeches. And our Government\u2019s plans for the 1990s have been set out by Ministers. We\u2019ve heard John Major, Peter Lilley and Michael Howard set out the policies that will maintain Britain\u2019s prosperity. We\u2019ve heard Douglas Hurd and Torn King make clear that Saddam Hussein will be forced to disgorge Kuwait. We\u2019ve heard Cecil Parkinson outline his plans for new investment in transport, and from John Gummer, our Party\u2019s commitment to farming and the countryside. We\u2019ve heard David Waddington, Ken Clarke, Chris Patten, Tony Newton and John MacGregor describe how their reforms will make Britain a safer, cleaner, healthier, more secure and better educated country.Meanwhile, quietly in the background, Norman Lamont, our Chief Secretary to the Treasury, has been making some of the most effective speeches of all. They\u2019re quite short speeches. Monosyllables even. Short monosyllables. But they seem to have an effect on his audience quite out of proportion to their length. What a fabulous team we\u2019ve got.We in this Government all realise that we are to continue generating the wealth to finance better public services tomorrow, we must have sound money and control of public spending today.As always some of the best speeches have come from the floor. I was glad to see even more women speakers this year. Some years ago, I heard a speaker here - a young man - deliver the line: Women are the backbone of the Conservative Party. They must be brought to the fore. That showed an uncertain knowledge of anatomy, but a very sound gasp of politics. Mr. President, a decade ago we revived this country by setting out in a new Conservative direction. We didn\u2019t seek a more comfortable way of muddling through, some means of making Socialism work in a less destructive way. We too had learned what our Polish guest had experienced far more bitterly: that Socialism can\u2019t be improved, it has to be removed. So we cut taxes, reduced controls, denationalised state industries, widened share ownership. And we put the union bosses in their rightful place under the control of their own members. It wasn\u2019t easy.And it was only possible because we had faith in the country\u2019s enterprise and talent and because we had the tenacity to see our policies through. The Strength to Succeed. Remember the strikes that were supposed to bring Britain to a halt. The steel strike ten years ago - backed by Labour. The violent coal strike which lasted a year - backed by Labour. And a host of other strikes backed by Labour. We stood firm. And last year in Britain there were fewer strikes than at any time since the war. And there was a record number of people in jobs. Yesterday\u2019s jobs have been replaced by new jobs. Better jobs. Cleaner jobs. In modern industries. Young people now face a brighter working future. Our scientific research is second to none. Our universities, our polytechnics, our colleges of further education - they\u2019re doing a superb job. Industry now has a new underlying strength. As a recent survey shows, of the 50 most successful European companies, the French have 8, Germany has 2, and 28 are British. It can be - and often is - better made in Britain.Mr. President, exactly a week ago, John Major dropped one of his quiet surprises on an unsuspecting press. Well, they surprise us sometimes too. He announced that interest rates would be cut by 1 per cent and that Britain would enter the Exchange Rate Mechanism. Of course, we have long been committed to joining the ERM, but only when our own policies of firm financial discipline were seen to be working. The signs are clear that our policies to bring down inflationary pressures are succeeding and that monetary growth is back within its limits. It was this which enabled us to it interest rates. Inflation announced this morning is 10.9 per cent. But it will soon begin to decline. Joining the ERM will reinforce our own financial discipline against it. And it will require industry to remain competitive. But, inflation is still too high. It must and will be beaten.Mr. President, our entry into the ERM has been warmly welcomed by our Community partners. But as John Major made absolutely clear yesterday, this Government has no intention of agreeing to the imposition of a single currency. That would be entering a federal Europe through the backdoors. Any such proposal involves a loss of sovereignty which Parliament would not accept. I hope that the Community will agree to John Major\u2019s important proposals for a common currency to be used alongside existing national currencies. Europe works better when we respect one another\u2019s different national and Parliamentary traditions.But, meanwhile, we must continue the prudent policies of successive Tory Chancellors. They have enabled us, out of the budget surpluses of the last three years, to repay twenty six thousand million pounds of the national debt - that is well over one thousand pounds for every household in the land. We have kept control of public finances but we have also honoured our pledge to protect the value of pensions against inflation. We will continue to do so. It means that next April the single pension will go up by £5.10 to £52 a week, and the married pension by £8.15 to £83.25 a week. This Party keeps its promises.Last week, Mr. President, I seemed to hear a strange sound emanating from Blackpool. I thought at first it was seagulls. Then I remembered that Labour was holding its annual Conference there. And I realised it wasn\u2019t seagulls it was chickens, chickens being counted before they were hatched - except for Labour\u2019s call to enter the ERM and cut interest rates. A case of counting chickens after they\u2019d flown the coop. Then, I heard voices getting all worked up about someone they kept calling \u2018the Prime Minister in Waiting.\u2019 It occurs to me, Mr. President, that he might have quite a wait.I can see him now, like the people queuing up for the winter sales. All got up with his camp bed, hot thermos, woolly balaclava, CND badge. Waiting, waiting, waiting. And then when the doors open, in he rushes, only to find that, as always, there\u2019s \u2018that woman\u2019 ahead of him again. I gather there may be an adjective between \u2018that\u2019 and \u2018woman,\u2019 only no one will tell me what it is.But I\u2019ll tell you this: that man is going to trip over his promises in the rush if he\u2019s not careful. There is his promise, for example, to cut taxes \u2018for many years to come.\u2019 That\u2019s the one Labour promise it\u2019s safe to believe. Indeed the Labour leader was being unduly modest. He won\u2019t cut taxes ever. Why? Because he\u2019s a Socialist and they just don\u2019t like the idea. In government, they put taxes up and in opposition they fight our proposals to bring taxes down. And taxes would go up - up and up - if Labour spends as much of your money as they\u2019ve promised. But, they say: we\u2019re reformed characters, next time it will be different, we\u2019ve paid our debt to society.If that were true, it would be the first debt Labour has ever paid. We Conservatives say that society must be protected from such a persistent offender and a sentence of eleven years in opposition is nowhere near enough. Then Labour say they\u2019re going to introduce \u2018freedom and fairness\u2019 in trade union law. In other words, freedom to force their members out on strike against their will. Freedom to organise secondary strikes against third party employers, other workers and the general public. And freedom to give wings to flying pickets to go round the country and bring it to a halt.Those aren\u2019t freedoms. They\u2019re powers to hurt others, and there\u2019s nothing fair about them. Labour\u2019s third pledge is to replace the Community Charge by the unfairness of rates with all the additional horrors of a revaluation. What Labour wants is for local authorities to be accountable not to the citizen, but to its own Left-wing. For years, council after council has been hijacked by Socialist extremists. The residents wanted litter-free zones, but what they got was nuclear-free zones. The Community Charge is making them more accountable and less electable.No wonder Labour councillors don\u2019t want it. Then there\u2019s this plan of Labour\u2019s for smaller, more decentralised government which would contain two brand new ministries, a couple of new departments of state, nine different bodies in each region, a hundred new committees, heaven knows how many councils and commissions on top, and a great herd of quangos thundering up Whitehall. A mere 2012 new bureaucratic bodies in all. It\u2019s the oldest law of politics: government tends to expand and Socialist government expands absolutely. Mr. President, that\u2019s four impossible pledges so far. And I could go on for hours quoting from Labour\u2019s lexicon of logical contradictions. There is its pledge to cut emissions of carbon dioxide - by burning more coal. And its promise to improve educational standards by phasing out tests. But the really remarkable thing about Labour is, they want you to swallow that they\u2019re now a party of moderation. Labour\u2019s Blackpool Conference was the amateur dramatics of the season, a grand masquerade at which militants and Trots peeped out from behind a painted smile. Glenda had given them a few professional tips. The audience had learnt its lines. The rehearsals had gone splendidly. Ron Todd gave a dazzling performance as Mr. Moderation. Alas, on the night, the extras got everything mixed up and voted the wrong way to emasculate defence, to bump up public spending, to ditch our electoral system, to deselect moderate MPs. The audience applauded like mad. Only Dennis Skinner remained glued to his seat. The theatre of the absurd was clearly not for him.Well, Mr. President, they can produce all the assurances in the world. They can say that they never read their own manifestos or understood their own. But there\u2019s one thing they can\u2019t do. They can\u2019t tell the nation why it should trust a Party whose only claim to office is that it has ditched its principles, disguised its policies and denied its past. And when a party does that, how could anyone trust its promises for the future?That brings me to the Liberal Party. I gather that during the last few days there have been some ill-natured jokes about their new symbol, a bird of some kind, adopted by the Liberal Democrats at Blackpool. Politics is a serious business, and one should not lower the tone unduly. So I will say only this of the Liberal Democrat symbol and of the party it symbolises. This is an ex-parrot. It is not merely stunned. It has ceased to be, expired and gone to meet its maker. It is a parrot no more. It has rung down the curtain and joined the choir invisible. This is a late parrot.And now for something completely different. Mr. President, most of us remember a time when although people saved for a rainy day, they couldn\u2019t hope to leave what one might call a capital sum to their children. These days, it\u2019s different. Many more people have homes and shares and savings to pass on. Indeed, the average real value of what pensioners can leave to their children is almost twice what it was only ten short years ago.So as time goes by capital passes from one generation of a family to another, bringing a wealth of opportunity and an opportunity for wealth. Labour\u2019s response to people\u2019s well-being is to sneer at it as materialism - when they are not denying it as myth. They relish class division. They depend on it. It\u2019s the root of all Socialism.We relish opportunity for all through education, through training, through lower taxes, through ownership of homes and shares. So that people can make their own way by hard work and enterprise and build up capital by saving and investment. We relish choice for all - in health, in schools, in housing. So that people get what they want, not what politicians want. The more we foster the things, the more we break down barriers - barriers between workers and bosses, skilled and unskilled, tenants and owners, barriers between private and public. That\u2019s the kind of open classless Britain I want to see. And it\u2019s the kind of opportunity Britain the Conservative Party stands for.A Britain where people begin by improving their own lives and end by helping to improve the lives of others. Much has been done. But more remains to be done.Lower Taxation. So far, we\u2019ve slashed income tax, abolished seven taxes, and given married women their own separate tax allowance. That\u2019s good. But not good enough. So as soon as it\u2019s safe to do so, we\u2019ll cut income tax again.Wider Share Ownership. We\u2019ve trebled the number of shareholders in Britain and privatised 20 major industries. That\u2019s good, but not enough. We want more shareholders and more workers to own shares. So we\u2019ll privatise the major ports; then tackle British Rail with more to come.More Home Ownership. We have enabled three million more people, half of them council tenants, to become new homeowners. Good, but not enough. So we\u2019ll introduce a pilot scheme in England to allow New Town tenants to turn their rents into mortgages - as we did with great success in Scotland and Wales. If this scheme succeeds like those, we\u2019ll extend it nationwide.More Choice in Training. Mr. President, children leaving school - and some adults who\u2019ve missed out - deserve the chance to learn a skill. We need more flexible training. So we\u2019ve put it into the hands of local businessmen, who know the skills needed for the future. That\u2019s good - but not enough. Now we\u2019re giving a brand new voucher to trainees in eleven pilot areas so they can use it to get the training they want. If that\u2019s a success, we shall make them available nationwide. This training voucher gives real motivation and power to young people. It\u2019s the first voucher scheme we\u2019ve introduced and I hope it won\u2019t be the last.Improving Education. Mr. President, this Government has made education a top priority. Br providing the framework for higher standards. By establishing a national curriculum. By spending more on each child than ever before. By the smallest class sizes ever. But, above all, by freedom, choice and competition. Some 50 grant maintained schools - that is, the new independent state schools - are the first to relish their freedom from local authority control and the extra resources that freedom brings. That\u2019s good, but not enough. I want to see far more schools becoming independent State schools. As John MacGregor announced on Wednesday, we shall give every primary and secondary school in the country the opportunity to have independent status. But let us be perfectly clear: governments can determine the structure of education. They can\u2019t determine its soul. It\u2019s for parents to use their new power to insist on the best. It\u2019s for teachers and heads to provide it. And it\u2019s for the examination boards and the Inspectorate to be rigorous in monitoring the results.Asking too little of our children is not only doing them an injustice, it\u2019s jeopardising our national future. They tell us: \u2018Spelling doesn\u2019t matter.\u2019 It does if you\u2019re after a job. They say: \u2018Grammar is old-fashioned.\u2019 Not if you want to make sense. They add: \u2018Doing sums is outdated.\u2019 I\u2019m glad nobody told me that when I was negotiating the return of our money from Europe. And then the education specialists tell us: \u2018It depends what you mean by standards.\u2019 If they don\u2019t know that, what are they doing in education?Let me give them some clues: we are open to new methods of teaching. But not if they mean our children can\u2019t read. Yes, we do want more learning for work. But not at the cost of academic achievement for the most gifted children. Of course we want more examination successes. But not a confetti of meaningless qualifications. Employers will soon see through that one.A new battle for Britain is under way in our schools. Labour\u2019s tattered flag is there for all to see. Limp in the stale breeze of Sixties\u2019 ideology. But let\u2019s be fair. Labour wouldn\u2019t neglect education, they\u2019ve promised us action. That\u2019s what alarms me. Action to close down the newly independent State schools, the Grammar schools, the City Technology Colleges. Action to stamp out choice for ordinary people, and to impose State uniformity. Action to rob parents of power and give it to Unions and administrators. Labour is stuck fast in the egalitarian sands from which the rest of the world is escaping.We Conservatives have run up our flag. Choice, high standards, better teachers, a wider horizon for every child from every background. The Labour leader has chosen education to be his Party\u2019s battleground. We need have no fear of the result.Mr. President, I know the importance this Conference attaches to reducing crime. Crime and violence injure not only the victim, but all of us, by spreading fear and making the streets no-go areas for decent people. Government has strengthened police numbers, improved police pay and revolutionised police technology. We\u2019ve provided stiffer sentences for the men of violence. When the courts hand down severe sentences for violent crimes they will receive this Government\u2019s unqualified support.To be soft on crime is to betray the law-abiding citizen. And to make excuses for the criminal is to offer incentives to dishonesty and violence. Crime flourishes in a culture of excuses. We Conservatives know, even if many sociologists don\u2019t, that crime is not a sickness to be cured - it\u2019s a temptation to be resisted, a threat to be deterred, and an evil to be punished.Mr. President, this year we celebrated the Fiftieth Anniversary of the Battle of Britain. We remembered \u2018the few\u2019: and as the Hurricanes, the Spitfires and the lone Lancaster flew over London, we looked back to a time when our nation stood alone and showed its true mettle.That spirit is just as much alive today. The world knows it can count on Britain to be staunch in defence. That\u2019s why London was chosen for NATO\u2019s summit meeting last July, one of the most important ever held. Now at last we can afford to reduce our forces in Europe. But we mustn\u2019t weaken our defence: we adapt it to meet new threats to prepare for the unexpected.Danger never sleeps. Governments which assume that there are no clouds on the horizon risk finding themselves at the heart of the storm. When NATO Foreign Ministers met in Scotland in June, I warned that NATO must be ready to act beyond its boundaries, that our dependence on Middle Eastern oil will grow again in the next century, and that we must have the capacity to defend our trade routes.These warnings were more timely than I knew. In the Gulf today we face an attempt to extinguish liberty and nationhood. Saddam Hussein took Kuwait by war, with no respect for her people, for property or for international law. And everyday he remains is a new act of war. This tyrant has taken our people hostage. Not a day goes by without our thinking of their plight and how we can bring them safely home to their families.Mr. President, Saddam Hussein must withdraw from Kuwait and the legitimate government must be restored. As Winston Churchill said in the Thirties: If you give in to aggression there will be no end to the humiliation you have to suffer. In times of great crisis, Britain and the United States stand as always together, and President Bush deserves our admiration and full support for the lead he has given. Sanctions are being drawn tighter and tighter and we most earnestly hope they will work. If not, the military option is there and the build up of forces continues. We must be ready for any contingency. Some people suggest there should be negotiations. But what is there to negotiate about? You don\u2019t negotiate with someone who marches into another country, devastates it, killing whoever stands in his way. You get him out, make him pay and see that he is never in a position to do these things again.Saddam Hussein can\u2019t do these things without paying compensation. He and those who carry out his orders must be made answerable for their crimes. Never before have the nations of the world been so united in a single resolve: that aggression shall not pay.But if this Government had not kept Britain\u2019s defences strong, we would not have had the forces and the equipment to send to the Gulf: our Tornadoes, Jaguars, frigates, minesweepers, and the Desert Rats. Our servicemen and servicewomen have already demonstrated their superb professionalism. Yet, even at a time when tyrants like Saddam Hussein are getting closer to having nuclear weapons of their own, Labour would still give up our nuclear deterrent. Mr. President, this government will maintain our nuclear deterrent, guardian of the peace for 40 years. We shall keep Britain strong and secure. We will never take risks with our defences.Mr. President when the call came to send forces to the Gulf, it was independent nations - above all the United States and Britain - which took rapid and decisive action. Many other nations followed, especially in the Arab world. Nationhood remains the focus of loyalty and sovereignty in the modern world. The revolutions of 1989 in Eastern Europe showed how deep that feeling is. As the Eastern Europeans detach themselves from the aberration of Communism, they look to their own country and heritage. So, too, do the people of newly united Germany.The speeches on the day of unification echo and re-echo with references to sovereignty and independence. Europe cannot be built by ignoring or suppressing this sense of nationhood, by trying to turn us into regions rather than nations. The way forward lies in willing co-operation between independent sovereign states. Nor do we see the Europe of the future as a tight little inward looking protectionist group which would induce the rest of the world to form itself into similar blocs. We want a Europe which is outward looking, and open to all the countries of Europe once they are democratic and ready to join.We do not judge how European you are by how much you want to increase the power of the unelected Commission. Intervention, centralisation and lack of accountability may appeal to Socialists. They have no place in our Conservative philosophy. We shall resist unnecessary regulation and bureaucracy, but when rules have been agreed, our fellow members of the European Community will find that Britain has the best record for implementing them openly and honestly. We are careful about money and rightly so. We\u2019re the second biggest net contributor to Europe, paying over £2 billion a year.But - and it is a crucial but - we shall never accept the approach of those who want to use the European Community as a means of removing our ability to govern ourselves as an independent nation. Our Parliament has endured for 700 years and has been a beacon of hope to the peoples of Europe in their darkest days. Our aim is to see Europe become the greatest practical expression of political and economic liberty the world over. We will accept nothing less.Mr. President, this was the year when time ran out on Socialism. Marxist Socialism is not yet buried, but its epitaph can now be written. It impoverished and murdered nations. It promoted lies and mediocrity. It persecuted faith and talent. It will not be missed. We have entered an age in which the people increasingly yearn for the path of freedom, free enterprise and self-reliance. Even in the newly liberated East, they are not seeking some third way between free enterprise and Socialism. They know, if Labour doesn\u2019t, that the third way leads only to the Third World.Labour\u2019s vision has been shattered. Beneath its contrived self-confidence lies a growing certainty that the world and history have passed it by; and that if Britain rejects them yet again, as I believe it will, Socialism must return for ever to its proper place - the reading room of the British Library where Karl Marx found it. Section: History of Ideas. Subsection: 19th Century. Status: Archaic. The new world of freedom into which the dazzled Socialists have stumbled is not new to us.What to them is uncharted territory is to us familiar and well-loved ground. For Britain has returned to those basic truths and principles which made her great: personal liberty, private property and the rule of law, on which democratic freedoms everywhere are based. Ours is a creed which travels and endures. Its truths are written in the human heart. It is the faith which once more has given life to Britain and offers hope to the world. We pledge in this Party to uphold these principles of freedom and to fight for them. We pledge it to our allies overseas. And we pledge it to this country we are proud to serve.

aVEarlier this week this Conference welcomed Mrs Thatcher. You gave her the most tumultuous reception. She deserved it. She led our country for over 11 years, our Party for over 15. We owe Margaret a great debt. The Britain she left us is immeasurably stronger than the Britain she found. Above all, she helped others to believe in us and us to believe in ourselves. And on those foundations she laid three great election victories. It\u2019s good to applaud; it\u2019s grand to cheer. But the greatest tribute we can pay her is to do as she did. To win, and win, and win again. At this Conference - and what a successful Conference it\u2019s been - you have heard how the next Conservative Government will secure the best future for Britain. We\u2019ve heard some cracking speeches this week. From the right team. A young team - in fact the youngest Cabinet this century. A professional team.Just think for a moment. When the going gets rough in international affairs, who would be the first person you would send for? Gerald Kaufman? No, he would be the second person. The first person would be anyone but Gerald Kaufman. But far and away the best person would be Douglas Hurd, one of the finest Foreign Secretaries this country has ever had. Of course, Labour\u2019s Captain tries to talk up his team. \u2018A winning team,\u2019 he calls them. After three election defeats? Well, it goes to show that there must be more than one way to look at history. Take Waterloo. You thought Wellington won Waterloo? No, Waterloo was a smash hit for Napoleon.But we can all help Labour to win one thing the record for the longest run of election defeats. Played four, lost four. And a probable vacancy for team captain. Last week at Brighton we had speech after speech about a fairytale future for the British people. Then there was sing-along-a-leader. It was all good fun, if you like that sort of thing.But while this was happening out front, there was something thoroughly nasty seeping from under the platform. I refer, of course, to what Labour pretends to believe are the Government\u2019s plans for the National Health Service. There\u2019s only one way to deal with a lie: nail it to the wall of truth, as William Waldegrave so conclusively did yesterday. We have all been brought up with the Health Service. We use it, we cherish it, we are proud of it. I know that for millions of people in this country the National Health Service means security. I understand that. Because I am - and always have been - one of those people. I know that even when you\u2019re fit and well, it brings peace of mind just to know it\u2019s there. It is unthinkable that I, of all people, would try to take that security away.A genuine belief I can respect, even when I profoundly disagree with it. But deliberate calumny - repeated, repeated and repeated - merely diminishes its authors. The Health Service has been in existence for over 40 years. And who has been in Government for most of that period? We have. For 29 of those years it has been a Conservative Government. It has been under Conservative Governments that the National Health Service has been built up, enlarged and improved. And our reforms will carry that right through into the 1990s. So let me say now, once and for all, and without qualification - under this Government the National Health Service will continue to offer free hospital treatment to everyone. And so that no one can misunderstand the position - and I hope the whole country is listening - let me make it even clearer. There will be no charges for hospital treatment, no charges for visits to the doctor, no privatisation of health care, neither piecemeal, nor in part, nor as a whole. Not today. Not tomorrow. Not after the next election. Not ever while I\u2019m Prime Minister. And if, after all I have said, there are still those who set out to frighten the vulnerable, the weak, and the old, with carefully calculated smears, then the public will know where to find them - in the gutters of public debate. Such people are not friends of the Health Service. They are the parasites that live on its back.No Conservative need be defensive about the health service. On the contrary, every Conservative has the right to share my disgust at what is said. Go to your local hospital. What do you find? You\u2019ll find Conservatives. In the hospital shop. Serving with the League of Friends. Working on the wards. They are not just the friends of the Health Service. They are part of the Health Service. The National Health Service doesn\u2019t belong to the Labour Party. As its name makes clear, it belongs to the Nation. And, in both senses of the phrase, Labour isn\u2019t going to get away with it. The Health Service is not a political football to be kicked around in the hope that, somehow or other, it will reopen the door of Downing Street to a Labour government. It won\u2019t. Neither by hook or by crook.This is the first Conference I have addressed as Leader of the Conservative Party. It is hard to explain quite how I feel about that. It is a long road from Coldharbour Lane to Downing Street. It is a tribute to the Conservative Party that that road can be travelled. Perhaps at the back of this hall today there is another young man or woman who stands where I did 30 years ago. Who knows few people here. Who feels it is a long road to this platform, too. They should remember the last two leaders were a builder\u2019s son from Broadstairs and a grocer\u2019s daughter from Grantham. We don\u2019t need lectures in the Conservative Party about opportunity. We are the Party of opportunity. This Party is open to all. And to all those who may be watching, wherever you come from, whatever your background, I say simply this: \u2018Come and join us.\u2019 There are no barriers in our Party, just as there will be no barriers in the Britain we are building together.Some people ask whether we will have a different sort of Conservatism in future. Of course we will. We all bring our own beliefs, our own instincts, and our own experiences to politics. And I am no exception. But the fundamental beliefs of the Conservative Party, those beliefs that brought me into this Party, are the beliefs that Chris Patten expressed so brilliantly on Tuesday. They remain as strong today as ever. Old though our Party is, the values behind it are older still. They are rooted in the instincts of every individual. And it is through our policies that we make them come alive. What is it that we offer? A strong Britain, confident of its position, secure in its defence, firm in its respect for the law. A strong economy, free from the threat of inflation, in which taxes can fall, savings can grow, and independence is assured.I want to give individuals greater control over their own lives. Every mother, every father, a say over their child\u2019s education. Every schoolchild, a choice of routes to the world of work. Every patient, the confidence that their doctors can secure the best treatment for them. Every business, every worker, freedom from the destructive dictatorship of union militants. Every family, the right to have and to hold their own private corner of life: their own home, their own savings, their own security for their future and for their children\u2019s future. Building the self-respect that comes from ownership. Showing the responsibility that follows from self-respect. That is our programme for the 90s. I will put it in a single phrase: the power to choose and the right to own.Do you know what Labour believe? That choice is something for them. They just can\u2019t accept that choice is something most of us can be trusted with. You might make mistakes, they say. What arrogance. As if the State had never made mistakes, in our name, with our money. Try telling that to the tenants of the crumbling tower blocks that disfigure our cities. And tell that to the citizens of Eastern Europe, who have risked their very lives for these freedoms, for the right to own, and for the power to choose. Ordinary values for which ordinary people have, in our time, fought an extraordinary fight.During the summer, I did quite a bit of travelling: Headingley, Edgbaston, Trent Bridge, Lord\u2019s, the Oval. Also Moscow, Peking, Hong Kong and Kennebunkport. Wherever I went abroad, I found the same story. Britain is respected again. We don\u2019t always realise the admiration and affection for Britain abroad. We\u2019ve earned it, because when others have hesitated, we have always stood firm and given a lead.As we did again this year. In defence of freedom in Kuwait. We didn\u2019t want that war, its waste, its suffering, its grief. But to achieve greater security in the world, we had to reverse the annexation of Kuwait. And to keep that security we must destroy Iraq\u2019s nuclear weapons capacity. They are still trying to cling to it, still cheating, still lying. They cannot be permitted to succeed. One way or another, that nuclear capacity must go. I hope it will go peacefully. If not, it must go by force. But go it will.In January I flew by helicopter over our army in the Gulf. I can still see the scene below me. A great convoy of troops and heavy equipment moving forward across the sands. For mile after mile. You could only marvel at the organisation and planning involved. But down on the ground, I had a different impression. Dug into position, each unit seemed almost alone. Young men, mostly very young, thousands of miles from home in the wastes of the desert.Let me tell you what was in my mind when I met them. What would they think? Here was a new Prime Minister, unknown to them, untried, asking them to prepare for battle, perhaps not to return. How would they respond to that? And would they understand the reasons why they were there? Whatever doubts I had soon disappeared. They knew why they were there. They knew the cause was right. And they knew that they could do the job. They asked only to be allowed to get on with it. And, when they did, my goodness, how they proved their point. They really were the best of Britain.I learned something else from that extraordinary war, and especially from that precision bombing that amazed the world. It\u2019s this: If our troops are to do the job we ask, it is absolutely vital that their equipment and their training are the best. That is why in the last few weeks we have bought the new anti-submarine helicopter from Westland - the best. Why we are moving ahead with the new Challenger tank from Vickers - the best. And that\u2019s why we will keep our own independent nuclear deterrent, Trident. The best security for Britain. And we will take with just a little pinch of salt the conversion of those who campaigned for CND for the past thirty years and then suddenly let their principles - what was the word? - lapse. What principles? First, peace at any price. Then power at any price. I know what this country will say to that. Never at any price. For a man with no fixed view on the defence of Britain, there can be no fixed abode in Downing Street.As we saw again in the aftermath of war, a confident Britain is a force for good in a troubled world. If we had not created those safe havens in Iraq, hundreds and thousands of Kurdish people would have died last winter in bitter, freezing mountains. We spoke out strongly for human rights in Peking and spoke out first against the return of tyranny in Moscow. Alone among all the nations of the world we stand at the hub of three great interlocking alliances. Of NATO, which is and must remain the core of our defence. Of the European Community. And of the Commonwealth, which meets in conference next week. There we must persuade 50 nations, some - frankly - with a chequered political history, to a formal commitment to democracy and human rights.And in the 1990s, I hope to see one former member of the Commonwealth once more take its rightful place. We have always fought for an end to apartheid. But we have worked just as consistently for the long-term goal of a fully free and prosperous South Africa. I believe that both goals are now in sight. And when they are reached I want to see South Africa back where she belongs - as a fully-fledged member of our Commonwealth of nations.A great debate is now underway in Europe. One in which the Conservative Party can speak with authority. Harold Macmillan first sought to take Britain into the Community, Ted Heath finally led us there, and Margaret Thatcher signed the Single European Act - with its vision of ever-closer union between states. Closer union between states. Not a federal merger of states. That is still our policy.I believe strongly in partnership in Europe. Britain, as a great European power, has gained from our membership of the Community. That is the verdict of those people in our country who live by business, banking and trade, the very people on whom our prosperity and jobs depend. But it must be the right Europe. Let me set out for you the objectives that I have in mind, the principles that I will fight for, and the propositions I will resist.First, we want a Community that will in time embrace the new democracies of the East. We have the chance to heal the scar that divided and disfigured Europe for two generations. The nations of Eastern Europe - Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia, the Baltic States - need to know now that when their economies are ready for the Community, the Community will be ready for them. Second, I want a genuine single market, open for business right across the Community. It must have common rules. And these rules must be obeyed. When we sign up to something, we put words into action. Some of our partners, I fear, are keener on making new rules than on keeping them. We need a system that can deal effectively with those who call themselves good Europeans, but who hijack lorries or hold up free trade.We are now negotiating new Treaties on political and economic union. I am always ready to listen to new ideas. But they must be workable ideas. Ideas that make sense for Europe, and for Britain. There are vital issues at stake. They involve hard judgments of where our true interests lie. The idea of a single European currency is one with enormous ramifications, both practical and political. At best, it is an uncertain prospect. Any treaty must provide for a separate decision to be taken - not now - but at a future date by the British Government and the British Parliament. It\u2019s our decision. A single currency cannot be imposed upon us. And I would not accept, on behalf of Britain, any treaty which sought to impose a single currency - at however distant a date.We already work closely with our European partners in financial affairs. So, too, in foreign policy and defence. When national interest and Community interest coincide, then common action is only common sense. But in no circumstances - not now, not at Maastricht - will a Conservative Government give up the right, our national right, to take the crucial decisions about our security, our foreign policy and our defence. We are working to reach an agreement at Maastricht in December. But I cannot guarantee that our negotiations will succeed. For it is no easy task to get 12 nations to agree. And for my part, I shall put the interests of our country before any agreement. Not any agreement before the interests of our country.I hope we can reach agreement. If we do, I will submit that agreement to Parliament, for it is here in Britain that the crucial decisions must be taken. Not in the European Parliament. Not in the Council of Ministers. Not in the Commission - certainly not in the Commission. It will be for Parliament to decide on behalf of the people of Britain who elected it.So far I have spoken of alliances. Of how much we can achieve if we work with other nations. But when it comes to the search for new markets, even our closest allies remain our competitors. I have never accepted the craven argument that Britain can\u2019t compete with Germany or Japan. And I have contempt for the defeatists who run down our country and write off its future. Those who said we couldn\u2019t compete in Europe when we led Britain into the Exchange Rate Mechanism. Those who said that we would have to push up interest rates. And that our inflation was bound to stay far higher than the rest of the Continent. All that was just a year ago this week. And look what has really happened since. We have cut interest rates eight times. Our exports to the rest of the Community have shot up. Our imports have fallen. Our trade deficit with Europe has been almost wiped out.And in case you haven\u2019t heard this morning\u2019s news, our inflation rate has fallen to just 4.1 per cent. For the first time in a generation, we have brought inflation down to German levels. They said we couldn\u2019t do it. We did it, and in just one year. Let me remind the \u2018sell Britain short\u2019 brigade of just a few facts. We attract more American investment than any other European country, and twice as much investment from Japan. Only two years ago, this country had a £17,000 million deficit on manufactured trade. This summer, we had a surplus. Our manufacturers sold more abroad than ever before. They didn\u2019t sell Britain short. They sold for Britain. And they had to fight for their markets when the going was hard.I know times have been tough. Unemployment has risen. Many people have faced great difficulties. I know how they feel - what it\u2019s like for a family when a business collapses. What it\u2019s like when you\u2019re unemployed and when you have to search for the next job. I have not forgotten - and I never will. It is because of that that I will never play fast and loose with the economy. Many have pressed us to do so this past year - siren voices, urging us on to the rocks of inflation, and off the course to recovery. The Chancellor and I ignored those voices. And, as he told you, we can now see the way ahead, out of recession, to the recovery that will bring investment. To the investment that will bring jobs. And the clearer the signs of recovery, the louder the Labour Party complains.Look how they rounded on the Governor of the Bank of England. All because he dared to confirm what everyone else was saying. That recovery is on the way. When he said there was a recession they cheered him. When he said it was coming to an end they called for his head. What are they going to do with those hundreds of businessmen telling the CBI exactly the same thing? Will Labour threaten to sack them too? All of them? Do Labour realise what their policies would do to business? Stab it in the back just when it\u2019s winning the battle for trade. Impose new levies. Pile on new costs. Bring back union power.It may be true that a Labour Prime Minister would no longer get his marching orders over beer and sandwiches at No. 10. No. In these days of designer socialism, he\u2019d get them over a G&T - down at the old T&G.A minimum wage would create the very unemployment they claim to care about. New burdens would drive business out of markets. Higher taxes would drive business talent abroad. Above all, inflation would drive our economy out of the future and back to the past. Remember who suffers from inflation. Infant businesses. People on fixed incomes. Pensioners.Inflation is a tax paid by those least able to protect themselves. It is Labour\u2019s invisible tax. It wouldn\u2019t come through the letter box, though there are plenty that would. They have eight new taxes lined up already. Well, that\u2019s not surprising. We\u2019ve costed Labour\u2019s spending promises. £35 billion extra and still rising. Of course, they say there would be hardly any more tax for hardly anyone. But that\u2019s hardly credible. The next Labour Manifesto will be the biggest tax demand in history. They love nationalisation. High taxes nationalise choice. It won\u2019t be a case of \u2018you pays your money; you takes your choice.\u2019 It will be they take your money; they take your choice.High taxes would enrich the businesses, the laboratories, and the universities of America and the rest of Europe at the expense of the businesses and universities of Britain. We\u2019d be back with something we haven\u2019t heard of for twelve years - the brain drain. Our low tax policies have built up a brain bank for Britain. Our Party has always kept personal tax rates down. And in the next Parliament we will go on doing so. Lower taxes don\u2019t just mean richer people. They mean a richer life. A life with wider horizons, in which people can develop their interests. Support their favourite charity, pursue their hobbies. Go fishing or to a football match, the theatre or the cinema, or just save up for a holiday. But lower taxes give people more powerful choices, too. The chance to save for the long-term, to invest in the future. Building up a pension. Starting a business. Giving their children a good start in life - and passing on to them the fruits of a lifetime\u2019s work.In the 1980s we began a great revolution. Our aim was a life enriched by ownership, in which homes, shares and pensions were not something for others, but something for everyone. We can now see the lifeblood of ownership of wealth running through the veins of the country. Nearly four million more families own homes. And eight million people more own shares. And four and half million people now have personal pensions. But this revolution is still not complete. In the 1990s we must carry it further. We must extend savings and ownership in every form. And we now have the chance to make enduring change. For people in their middle years are inheriting homes, businesses, farms on a scale never before seen. The pioneers of the property owning democracy are the parents of the capital owning democracy to come.We Conservatives have always passed our values on, from generation to generation. I believe that personal prosperity should follow the same course. I want to see wealth cascading down the generations. We do not see each generation starting out anew, with the past cut off and the future ignored. So, in the next Parliament, I believe that we must go much further in encouraging every family to save and to own. To extend every family\u2019s ability to pass on something to their children, to build up something of their own for their own. Labour have their eyes on the money stored in the homes in which millions of people now live and in the businesses they have created. But I believe that what people have worked to build up in life, the State should never destroy. As Harold Macmillan once memorably put it: people walk in public gardens, but they tend their own. I want to build a pride in our common inheritance of town and city, coast and countryside. In the very fabric of our nation.I want to foster ownership in its widest sense. In making people feel that public property belongs to them. Giving them more say at the local level in how things are run. Giving them a choice. Putting them in control. That\u2019s the idea behind our Citizen\u2019s Charter about which Francis Maude spoke so well yesterday. It will be a centrepiece of our policies for the 1990s. I want to see public services in which the passenger, the patient, the parent can have confidence. And in which public servants can have pride.I see that Labour are now trying to copy my ideas. I suppose we shouldn\u2019t be too surprised at that. Even the Labour Party has to have some good ideas amongst all the bad. It\u2019s just that they filch the good ideas from us. The bad ones, of course, they think up for themselves. They don\u2019t even hide it when they steal some of my clothes. Did you see how many of them were wearing grey suits last week? Have they no shame?The test for Labour will come in the next session of Parliament. We will be legislating on the Citizen\u2019s Charter. We shall be giving parents a greater say in schools. Making the big utilities more responsive to customers. And, as Michael Heseltine promised us yesterday, exposing incompetence in the council chamber. And how do you imagine Labour will vote? With us? For the Charter? And for the consumer? Or against us? For the trade unions? For the old ways? For the past? But it\u2019s not just a matter of changing the way we run things. It\u2019s a matter of breaking down the false and futile divisions, based on class and envy, that have been around for generations. They are wholly artificial.Labour fosters those divisions. It thrives on them. Our task is to end them for good. I spoke of a classless society. I don\u2019t shrink from that phrase. I don\u2019t mean a society in which everyone is the same, or thinks the same, or earns the same. But a tapestry of talents in which everyone from child to adult respects achievement; where every promotion, every certificate is respected; and each person\u2019s contribution is valued. And where the greatest respect is reserved for the law.There can be no harmony in a lawless society. The recent outbreaks of violence in some of our council estates involved a brutal disrespect for other people and their property. Such behaviour cannot be excused and will not be tolerated. In the face of such violence, I know this Party will give the police the support that we always have. We admire the bravery and the professionalism of those young policemen and women who have been the front line against violent attacks. This Conference must leave no shred of doubt. Rioting is a crime, a serious crime. And it will be dealt with as such.But dealing with crime is not just something for other people the police, or the courts, or the Government. It\u2019s a challenge to everyone. And the way to fight crime is to change the attitudes that lie behind crime. The attitudes of people who say that theft or vandalism are somehow less serious. They call it \u2018property crime.\u2019 Property crime? Tell that to the widow who has been robbed of treasured mementoes of her past life. That\u2019s not a property crime, it\u2019s a personal wound that can never be healed.This Government is going to crack down on crime, as Ken Baker made clear this week. Let me give you an example. What the irresponsible call \u2018joyriding,\u2019 we know as simple theft; dangerous driving, a disregard for human life, and the destruction of other people\u2019s property. Some of these people are too young for a licence. We will ensure that when they reach driving age they can be banned from the road. As for those parents who stand by and watch while their children commit crimes, they are going to be held responsible for their children\u2019s actions. Those in authority - parents and teachers as well - should use their authority to teach a sense of respect for others, for their rights, not just your own; for their opinions, their welfare and their possessions. Without respect for others, there can be no proper respect for the law.We don\u2019t help our children by excusing bad behaviour, we betray them. And we lead them into worse behaviour. Sometimes it\u2019s right to say no. A great deal has been written about my education. Never has so much been written about so little. Perhaps that\u2019s why I am so keen on the subject. I believe that Ken Clarke\u2019s programme of reform is a turning point in education. It will mean that parents and pupils come first, that the key subjects are studied properly, and that the status of teachers is restored. Some have said that Ken Clarke and I are wrong to insist on simple pencil and paper tests for children in schools. Well, I\u2019ll tell you what marks I would give to people like those. Nought out of ten for concern. Nought out of ten for interest in our children. Nought out of ten for commonsense. And, so long as there is a Conservative Government, they\u2019ll get nought out of ten for influence in our schools.It will take more than platitudes in Brighton to efface the memory of years of left-wing vandalism in our classrooms. And we will take no lectures from those who led the long march of mediocrity through our schools. What Labour Governments did, and what all too many Labour Councils are still doing, is unforgivable - the years of levelling down; the destruction of good schools; the harassment of good teachers; the kicking away of the ladder of opportunity by those who climbed up it themselves; the setting of the union rule book above all other text books; the neglect even of spelling. That is where the long march of the Left in education has led us. Well, we are now rooting these ideas out. We are giving parents more influence in schools. If we want them to exercise responsibility for their children, we must give them a say in the education of their children. I will fight for my belief in a return to basics in education. The progressive theorists have had their say. And they\u2019ve had their day.In the last twelve months we have seen the Socialist philosophy collapsing in ruins. Who will ever forget those days of high drama in the Soviet Union last August? Or the three young men in Moscow who gave their lives for reform. When I visited the place where they died, I was struck by the number of young people who pressed in around me. They had copied Western fashions, wore Western gear. For decades, they and their parents had been taught that Socialism was the destiny of the future. That the Soviet Union would bury the West. But it wasn\u2019t the West that the Socialist system had buried. It was the hopes and dreams of their own people. Socialism has gone in Czechoslovakia, gone in Poland, gone in Hungary, gone even in Sweden. And here in Britain, I\u2019ll tell you what you\u2019ll see over the next few months. You\u2019ll see the Red Flag dying here. It\u2019s going. Going. Gone. Suddenly, it\u2019s just so old fashioned, so irrelevant, so out of date.What I owe to this country and to its people is difficult to put into words. My greatest wish now is to give back something of what I have been given. I want to work for a Britain that is the best educated and the best governed. Where schools and universities are the finest and accessible to all. Where inner cities don\u2019t mean deprivation, but communities that bind and belong. And where no one has to go in fear at night. I should like to live in a world where opportunity is for everyone, where peace is truly universal, and where freedom is secure. If that is what you believe in, then go back to your constituencies. Tell them what we stand for. Tell them what we care for. And ask them to choose.

aVWell it hasn\u2019t exactly been a dull week has it?  What we have seen has been democracy in action.  And this Party is stronger and healthier for it. Someone - I forget who it was - said that nothing that\u2019s good is ever easy.  I\u2019m beginning to know what they meant. Politics is a rough, tough, unpredictable business - and troubles come in bunches.  But you have to keep your nerve.  And remember that when you come out of the teeth of the gale you\u2019re tougher, more battle-hardened. Take my word for it. I know.In this stormy period, some people seem to have forgotten something rather important.  Just six months ago this very day, this Conservative Party won the General Election.  We did so against all the odds.  Everyone said we hadn\u2019t a chance.  The opinion polls - and in those days people actually believed them! - they were against us.  The pundits were against us. They said history was against us.  They all got even more egg on their faces than I did.  Because they left something out of their calculations.  14½ million British people were with us.  We got more votes than ever before in any election in the whole of British history.         So why was it that those television exit polls were so wrong?  Why didn\u2019t the commentators see?  Why didn\u2019t the experts see?  Why didn\u2019t the BBC?There were two reasons why we won that record level of support.  First, it was the principles we all stood for - the principles we stand for still.  And second, it was the people who worked for that victory.  You.  And thousands like you.  Who did so much, gave so much, campaigned so hard together.  There is one lesson we should never forget.  When the Conservative Party is united, it is an irresistible political force. We Conservatives have great hopes and dreams for our country.  But to make them reality we must win the battles we care about.  Lift our country back into growth. And, in all we do, create the society we want for our children and their future.But before I turn directly to the great decisions that face us, I\u2019d like to say something about someone not with us today - Chris Patten.  We planned the Election in the early days of January. We knew we would go into it behind in the polls - and we were confident we\u2019d come out of it ahead.  But we knew, too, that for Chris to run the Election - and hold Bath - would be desperately difficult. So it proved.  He\u2019s a huge loss, not just to us, but to British politics.  It was typical of him to decline a by-election, turn down a peerage, and take one of the toughest jobs in the world - as Governor of Hong Kong. Chris, win for Hong Kong, just as you won for us.  And when you come back, come and join us - in Government.  Because you\u2019ll still be welcome.  And we\u2019ll still be there.There was someone else who was a tower of strength through that Election - Norman Fowler.  He was always at my side.  Always there - with everything from beef burgers to wise advice.   But every time I went out with Norman, something very curious happened: people threw eggs at him.  But they kept missing him and hitting me. There are moments when great truths become evident.  And this was one.  A man who was able to duck so fast so often was clearly the right man for Central Office.  Norman \u2013 it\u2019s good to have you back. But, above all, I must thank someone who is not a politician. Someone to whom my debt is too personal to express fully.  She is here today - just as she was on every day of the Election campaign - I mean, of course, Norma.  Her role was even bigger than you may think.  If I hadn\u2019t met her on April 9th 1970, I might never have picked April 9th 1992.  All those oceans of ink guessing the election date!  Wasted!  If only they\u2019d asked Norma!In all our conferences there is theatre.  You expect to hear us expose our opponents\u2019 policies.  Expect none of that from me today.  For Labour and the Liberals are utterly irrelevant.  Let us leave them on the sidelines - where they are and where they deserve to be.  I intend to address myself to the country, the Conference and the Conservative Party. Debates over our place in Europe have always touched raw nerves - in our Party and in our country.  I don\u2019t find that surprising.  There are gut issues at stake.  Opinions are passionately held.  It is right to speak plainly and directly, even if for some it is uncomfortable.  People must know exactly what\u2019s at stake.  The great dangers for our country and - as Douglas Hurd pointed out so graphically in that marvellous speech on Tuesday - for our Party if we make the wrong choices.  And the right choices can only be based on facts.  They can never be built on fears.  Of course, emotions run high.  We saw that from both sides in that great Conference debate earlier this week.  For many of you, I know, the heart pulls in one direction and the head in another.  There is nothing that can stir the heart like the history of this country.  It is part of us.  Nothing can change that. But it\u2019s a different world now.  Our families are growing up in a different age.  They know we can\u2019t pull up the drawbridge and live in our own private yesterday.  They know we live in a world of competition - and we can\u2019t just wish it away.  Change isn\u2019t just coming, it\u2019s here.  I want Britain to mould that change, to lead that change in our own national interest. That\u2019s what I mean by being at the heart of Europe.  Not turning a deaf ear to the heartbeat of Britain.  But having the courage to stand up and do what we believe to be right.  Right for British industry; right for British jobs; right for British prosperity. During the summer, when I was in Cornwall, a lady came up to speak to me.  \u2018Mr. Major,\u2019 she said, \u2018please, please don\u2019t let Britain\u2019s identity be lost in Europe.\u2019  She didn\u2019t tell me her name.  But she spoke for the anxieties of millions.  She spoke for this country.  She spoke for me.  So let me tell this Conference what I told that lady in Cornwall.  I will never - come hell or high water - let our distinctive British identity be lost in a federal Europe.  Let no one in this Conference be in any doubt: this Government will not accept a centralised Europe.And if there are those who have in mind to haul down the Union Jack and fly high the star-spangled banner of a United States of Europe, I say to them: you misjudge the temper of the British people.  And you do not begin to understand the determination of this Prime Minister to put the interests of this country first - now and always. It\u2019s true, the European Community has centralised too much.  It has talked too much about European directives - and thought too little about Europe\u2019s direction.  But at Maastricht we began to reverse that trend.  And at Birmingham and Edinburgh we will carry that further.  So let me say to the European politicians: if you don\u2019t heed that, you will never build the European Community you want.  You will break up the European Community you have.  You cannot go forward by browbeating Denmark.  And to those who offer us gratuitous advice, I remind them of what a thousand years of history should tell them: you cannot bully Britain.I speak as one who believes Britain\u2019s future lies with Europe.  But, when I hear assertions from others in Europe, that we or the Danes should sign up on their terms, I\u2019ll tell you what I think.  I think they should keep their advice to themselves.  Sign up on their terms?  Before I was born, if this country hadn\u2019t fought on our terms there\u2019d be no free Europe to sign up to.  All these are frustrations.  They cause great anger.  But emotion must not govern policy.  At the heart of our policy lies one objective and one only - a cold, clear-eyed calculation of the British national interest.  What is right for Britain.  What is right for our future.  And from that calculation I will not be budged.Let me come directly to the issue that has caused such controversy.  The Treaty of Maastricht seems to have become enshrouded in myth and legend.  Certainly, the Treaty I hear talked about is not the one I negotiated.  What are the fears people have about Maastricht?  We heard many of them in our debate this week.  A Single Currency?  Under the Maastricht Treaty, Britain is not committed to a single currency.  Immigration?  Immigration policy is specifically excluded under the Maastricht Treaty.  Jobs and working conditions?  I refused to sign up for the Social Chapter.  Education?  The Treaty explicitly rules out any Community interference in what is taught in schools or the way education is run.  Defence?  Defence is kept out of the control of the Community.  Citizenship?  We are British citizens and we will always remain British citizens. If I believed what some people said about the Treaty I would vote against it.  But I don\u2019t.  So I'm going to put the real Treaty - the one I negotiated - back to the House of Commons.There is one great prize in the Treaty.  For the first time we have reached agreement on developing the community in voluntary co-operation between independent nation states.  That means outside the Treaty of Rome; outside the jurisdiction of the European Court; outside the competence of the European Commission.  We have wanted this principle established for years.  And we now have it in the Treaty I agreed. It is time the distortions were put to one side.  It is time to return the debate to reality and away from myth.  In the Treaty, there was give and take - there has to be in any partnership.  But in the end we got what we wanted.  Not the agreement our partners signed up to: a better agreement.  We obtained for Britain the flexibility and freedom which others signed away. When I hear some of the criticisms of the Treaty I think of Don Quixote - you may remember him.  He read too many old books and got carried away, fighting imaginary battles. He tilted at windmills in the belief they were giants.  He saw things that weren\u2019t there.  There has been a lot of that in the current debate on Maastricht.Yes, we made concessions.  But so did our partners.  What would they now think of a British Prime Minister who fights a tough negotiation, gives firm undertakings, and then comes back and breaks his word?  What would we think of someone who did that to us?  Who would ever trust Britain again?  We would have broken faith.  A demeaning position in which no British Government should ever be placed. But, far more than that, what is at stake is something practical and hard-headed.  We wouldn\u2019t just be breaking our word.  We would be breaking Britain\u2019s future influence in Europe. We would be ending for ever our hopes of building the kind of Europe that we want.  And we would be doing that, just when across Europe the argument is coming our way.  We would be leaving European policy to the French and the Germans.   That is not a policy for Great Britain.  It would be an historic mistake. And not one your Government is going to make. Let us not forget why we joined the Community.  It has given us jobs.  New markets.  New horizons.  Nearly 60 per cent of our trade is now with our partners.  It is the single most important factor in attracting a tide of Japanese and American investment to our shores, providing jobs for our people. It is absolutely vital for businesses, big and small - and for our prospects of economic growth.  There isn\u2019t a single business leader who believes Britain\u2019s interests lie outside.  And I hope they will make their views clear - and public. But the most far-reaching, the most profound reason for working together in Europe I leave till last.  It is peace.  The peace and stability of a continent, ravaged by total war twice in this century.  Today, as we meet here in Brighton, images of violence and exile are being acted out on the shores of the Adriatic.  Where only two years ago the children of a million tourists laughed and played, young men of Europe are locked in a bloody civil war.That\u2019s why I want Britain to work in the \u201990s for a wider and wiser Community, embracing the new democracies of the East.  That is the vision we have for the next generation.  And it\u2019s vital for our own security.  But it is a vision we will only make reality if we\u2019re in there arguing for it, not out there, scowling in the wings.I\u2019m not starry-eyed about Europe.  If I\u2019m starry-eyed, it\u2019s about this country.  Britain has always grown and prospered when it has looked outwards - from the time of the First Elizabeth, right through to the Second.  Let us then not turn away and put up the shutters, but do what we believe - with faith, and courage and conviction.  In the name of the present, and in the name of the future, we cannot sit this one out.Some take the view that we must choose between Europe and our friendship with the United States. What total nonsense.  Britain is the unbreakable link between the United States and the continent of Europe.  We have growing ties of commerce and trade with Europe, but we have blood ties over many generations with our friends in America.We in this Party will preserve and strengthen our special relationship with the United States.  It is long-standing.  Tested in many battles.  Reinforced by ties of kinship, language and shared values.  Britain and America have stood side by side many times in many theatres of war against tyranny and oppression.  And we always will.Eight weeks ago, we decided to send some 2,000 troops to Yugoslavia under the flag of the United Nations.  They will bring aid to the victims of that terrible civil war.  Without this common effort, we would be seeing in a few months time hundreds of thousands of people - men, women and children in Bosnia - in Europe - dying of starvation, of cold, and lack of medicine. Britain is already the largest supplier of medicines.  And, amidst all the dangers, our RAF Hercules have played a leading part in the airlift into Sarajevo.  Those young men know the risks; but they have met them, just as the young men who will keep open the land corridors know the risks and will meet them.  We can be proud of them - and we are.The safety of those troops will always be first in our minds.  They are there for humanitarian reasons.  They are not there to hold the combatants apart - and they will not be asked to do so.  They are there to fight only in self-defence and then they have the authority to use all the force they need. We are asking a lot of them.  But they know what we know - and what our soldiers in Northern Ireland who stand in the front line against terrorism also know:  there is a duty to be done.  I believe it is a duty that this Conference, gathered here in Brighton, would not want Britain, of all nations, to shirk.  In these difficult and dangerous tasks, they deserve - and they will get - this Party\u2019s full support.I have spoken of our plans for Europe, and our beliefs about Britain\u2019s place in the world.  We now have to lead Britain through difficult times at home, as we have done so often in our history. You know the things I care about - we all care about - the things I dreamt about as a boy.  The chance to get on in life.  To acquire knowledge, security, the prospect of a better future and a life fulfilled.  A corner of life that you can call your own.  That\u2019s what people struggle for and sacrifice for when they watch their children grow. If we\u2019re going to meet those hopes, fulfil those dreams - then we must build a strong economy.  And looking around the world, we can see ever more clearly what makes an economy strong. A Government that secures two things: low inflation, and the right climate for business to succeed.People - not government. Business - not bureaucracy. Enterprise - not interference.But business can\u2019t succeed if Government doesn\u2019t play its part.  Low taxes - low inflation.  Leaving people more of their own money to spend and save.  Protecting them from those robber barons of the twentieth century: inflation and the State.I believe - I know - that it was for those tasks that the British people elected us to govern again.  They didn\u2019t trust anyone else to control inflation. They didn\u2019t trust anyone else with their taxes. They didn\u2019t trust anyone else to keep the state off industry\u2019s back.  We must - and we will - keep faith with that trust. But today even the world\u2019s most successful economies face difficulties.  In the United States.  In Japan.  Throughout Europe - yes, and in Germany, too.  And here in Britain I know how great is the personal hardship that many people are facing.  Some have lost their jobs; some their businesses; some their homes.  We must continue to pursue policies that will bring real hope back into their lives.In this terrible world recession, I know how hard people are being hit - here in Britain - by the misfortune that befalls home after home, family after family.  Unemployment is a bitter experience.  So I don\u2019t want a temporary cure.  I want a lasting recovery.  I want to come out of this recession safe from the threat of its repetition.  That\u2019s why we\u2019re looking for long-term solutions.  That\u2019s why we\u2019ll take no risks with inflation.  And that\u2019s why we will continue to do everything possible to create prosperity that lasts.Yes it\u2019s true.  Inflation is down from nearly 11 per cent to just over 3½ per cent in the past two years.  And today I can tell you that even the underlying rate - that hard core we have found so difficult to reduce - has come down to 4 per cent.  Yes, it\u2019s true.  Interest rates are down from 15 per cent to 9.  The starting rate of income tax - down from 25 per cent to 20.  Mortgage payments - down, on average, £80 a month.  All putting more of people\u2019s own money back in their own pockets.And, yet, despite that progress, it\u2019s been taking such a long time for things to get going.  I know how frustrating that is.  Here as abroad, debt has made people cautious. Slow to spend. That\u2019s made things tough for small businesses.  Tough for industry, too. There are signs of improvement.  But that\u2019s not enough. It is only a beginning. Now, I believe, we must aim for more.With a low inflation rate, we can compete with the best in Europe.  And I want to thank Norman Lamont for his courage in bringing that inflation rate down.  Now we must keep it down at the point where it no longer interferes with the decisions people and businesses have to make in their daily lives.But, last month, we faced turmoil in the markets and rising interest rates across Europe.  European interest rates were driven so high that the Exchange Rate Mechanism was no longer the servant of Europe\u2019s prosperity.But let us not waste time looking back.  We have to deal with the world as it is.  With a lower exchange rate, we have a new competitive edge in Europe.  And provided we don\u2019t blunt it with inflation, it gives us a real opportunity, in a single European market of 330 million people.  A market for British computers.  British cars.  British televisions. British textiles. British services - British skills.The biggest free trade area in the world.  That\u2019s the market in which British enterprise must succeed. And the Government will back British business all the way.Let us return to that old and vivid slogan: Britain means business. And let me say a little more about what I believe Government can do.  We must create an economic environment in which more people are willing to invest their effort, their savings, their skills in new businesses because of the rewards that exist.  Those who risk their savings must know that if they build up wealth by their efforts, they will be able to keep more of it. What families have worked a lifetime to create, the taxman will not be allowed to destroy.  Those who build up new businesses must be confident they won\u2019t be stifled by taxation.  And we know what that means for Government - it means standing firm against all those pleas for extra public spending.  All so attractive to someone - so disastrous in combination.Where more is really needed we will spend more.  Our plans allow for that.  But more for some programmes may have to mean less for others.  Because we have set our limits - and we will stick to them.It\u2019s too easy - when spending is under pressure - to forget the long term. To let the burden fall on private industry alone.  We must work with industry, to see whether the public and private sectors working together can do more to invest in our future. More to improve the infrastructure of this country. I know the problems. But it is time to look afresh at whether we can find new solutions.But that\u2019s not enough.  We must also see what more we can do to help our exporters win for Britain. In the single market - and in the world trading system.  We are battling for free trade - and to make sure we take the best advantage of it. I want to see British enterprise succeeding across the globe. Winning contracts. Creating British jobs. Generating our future prosperity.  And to help them we must do more to lighten the burden of government regulation. Government should stand behind business - not in its way.This is a battle we\u2019ve been fighting since 1979. But it\u2019s a battle that is never won. And now is the time to mount a new offensive. We\u2019re already on the march against the Eurocrat and his sheaf of directives. But, you know, it isn\u2019t just Brussels that rolls out the red tape.  It\u2019s Whitehall. And town hall. Everyone likes to tie another knot. Good intentions - bad results.  Piling costs on industry. Mr. President, that has got to stop.It\u2019s not just big business that suffers. Far too often, it is the small firms who really suffer. Small firms - fed up with filling in the forms - who feel that it is just not worth being in business at all.Of course, we want to have confidence in the safety of the food we eat; the homes we buy; the places we work in; the people who take charge of our children. But when this reaches the point where you may need 28 separate licences, certificates and registrations just to start a business, then I say again: this sort of thing must stop.I have asked Michael Heseltine to take responsibility for cutting through this burgeoning maze of regulations.  Who better for hacking back the jungle?  Come on, Michael.  Out with your club.  On with your loin cloth.  Swing into action!You know, deregulation isn\u2019t just about making life better for business.  It\u2019s about making life better for everybody.  Take the bureaucratic controls which mean Whitehall decides whether you have the chance to stop off the motorway.  Every parent knows what I mean.  Next services, 54 miles - when your children can\u2019t make 10!  Or take the system that keeps air fares far too high. It\u2019s absurd that international air travel is regulated under rules set out before the jet airliner was even invented. And why should so many people, from all over Britain, have to come to London when they want to fly abroad? I want to see more flights directly out of Glasgow, Manchester and Birmingham and each and every one of our regional airports that want them. That\u2019s better for the people who live there - and better for London too.It is vital that we get the economy back into strong - and sustainable - growth.  We can do it.  We must do it. But that is only the first of our ambitions for the course of this Parliament.  The Manifesto that won the Election set out a full programme for five years.  Now we\u2019re going to put it into action.Ladies and gentlemen, the year 2000 is less than a hundred months away.  I want Britain\u2019s example, its ingenuity, its decency and principle to be in the forefront as we cross that threshold. In all we do, we must speak to the instincts of the British people.  For 300 years, the Conservative Party has reflected those instincts in a way that no other political party has ever been able to match.  So let\u2019s go out, go out and tell the people about the things we\u2019ll be working for, and fighting for, in the next four years of Conservative Government.We\u2019ll be fighting for better public service.  For services that put the parents, the patients, and the passengers first. Fighting bloody-minded and petty bureaucracy wherever we find it.  That\u2019s what the Citizen\u2019s Charter is about.We\u2019ll be fighting for good local government, closer to local people.  That\u2019s why in Wales it\u2019s set to be goodbye to the likes of Clwyd and Gwent and welcome back to Pembrokeshire and Anglesey.  In Scotland, the Scottish Secretary will be consulting the public on change - but I rather suspect it could be an Ian Lang farewell to monstrosities like Strathclyde.In England we will give everyone the chance to put their views on the future of councils like Cleveland or Avon.  I can\u2019t predict the outcome.  But can you imagine Len Hutton walking out to bat for Humberside?We\u2019ll be fighting for better health and social services.  For a Health Service run by local people in patients\u2019 interests.  For more GP fund-holders and more of our successful hospital trusts.  We want better care for the elderly and vulnerable in the home and the community - wherever they choose to be. And we must make sure local councils respect the wishes of those who do go into homes.  People in their last years are entitled to as much choice and dignity as anyone else.  Not less choice and no dignity.And we have all been deeply shocked at the reports of scandals in some social service departments.  It\u2019s terrible when children are involved.  That\u2019s why we are going to set up regular independent inspection of social work in every council.  We will not let vulnerable people and children be put at risk.We\u2019ll be fighting to strengthen the rights of ordinary trade union members.  They must have freedom to join the union of their choice - and fairness in union ballots and finances.  And, under the Citizen\u2019s Charter, we\u2019re going to give you - all of you - a new right.   To take direct action in the courts against those who disrupt public services through unlawful strikes.And we\u2019ve already blown the whistle on one of the last bastions of the closed shop - student unions. The days in which they march and demonstrate at the taxpayer\u2019s expense are numbered.When it comes to education, my critics say I\u2019m \u2018old-fashioned.\u2019  Old-fashioned?  Reading and writing?  Spelling and sums?  Great literature - and standard English grammar?  Old fashioned?  Tests and tables?  British history?  A proper grounding in science?  Discipline and self-respect?  Old-fashioned?Well, if I\u2019m old-fashioned, so be it.  So are the vast majority of Britain\u2019s parents.  And I have this message for the progressives who are trying to change the exams.  English examinations should be about literature, not soap opera.  And I promise you this.  There\u2019ll be no GCSEs in \u2018Eldorado.\u2019 I also want reform of teacher training.  Let us return to basic subject teaching, not courses in the theory of education.  Primary teachers should learn how to teach children to read, not waste their time on the politics of gender, race and class.I don\u2019t know if you feel as I do, but I think it is intolerable that children should spend years in school and then leave unable to read or add up.  It is a terrible waste of young lives.  We want high standards, sound learning, diversity and choice in all our schools.  But, in some - particularly in those inner cities - Isaac Newton would not have learned to count, and William Wordsworth would never have learned to write. We cannot abandon the children in schools like these.  And we will not.  So if local authorities cannot do the job, then we will give the job to others.  In the place of the local authority which has failed, new Education Associations will be set up to run and revive these schools.  Governments have always shied away from it.  But I am not prepared to do so any longer.Yes, it will mean another colossal row with the educational establishment.  I look forward to that.  It\u2019s a row worth having.  A row where we will have the vast majority of parents - and the vast majority of good, committed teachers - squarely on our side.  They believe what we believe - that children must come first.There was a time when Britain was a watchword for good behaviour across the world.  I want to restore that good name.  People are horrified when they see mindless vandalism; old people attacked by young thugs; drunken louts on the rampage, blackening Britain\u2019s reputation abroad. Not only horrified, they\u2019re ashamed.To excuse crime may seem understanding. But it\u2019s wrong.  Sympathy doesn\u2019t curb crime.  If society wants to protect itself it must condemn crime, not condone it.  We must create a climate in which people know the difference between \u2018right\u2019 and \u2018wrong\u2019 and \u2018yours\u2019 and \u2018mine.\u2019  We must spell out the truth.  Crime wrecks lives, spreads fear, corrupts society.  It is the fault of the individual, and no one else.We are cracking down hard on crime - particularly violence. And that includes - as I promised you last year that it would - tough sentences for those who cause death by dangerous or drunken driving.  Nothing can excuse those who kill in this way.  We are taking action.  And I hope the courts will respond.There\u2019s another problem we are dealing with - the illegal occupation of land by so-called \u2018new age travellers.\u2019  You will have seen the pictures on television or in the newspapers; if you live in the West Country and Wales you may have seen it on your own doorstep.  Farmers powerless. Crops ruined and livestock killed by people who say they commune with nature, but have no respect for it when it belongs to others.New age travellers?  Not in this age.  Not in any age.They say that we don\u2019t understand them. Well, I\u2019m sorry - but if rejecting materialism means destroying the property of others, then I don\u2019t understand.  If \u2018doing your own thing\u2019 means exploiting the social security system and sponging off others, then I don\u2019t want to understand.  If alternative values mean a selfish and lawless disregard for others, then I won\u2019t understand.  Let others speak for these new age travellers.  We will speak for their victims.The things I care most about are the long-term things - stability and security at home and in Europe; rebuilding standards in education; the long-term strength - economic and moral - of our nation. Preserving Britain\u2019s pride and purpose and belief in itself.  That\u2019s what I care about.  That\u2019s what I stand for.Isn\u2019t that what we\u2019re all about together in this Party?  That\u2019s what our forebears worked for when they built it, when they sent its roots down deep - right into the very heart and marrow of Britain.  That\u2019s why we\u2019re all in this Party together - you and I.That\u2019s why I fought so hard in the Election to keep our country one.  For me that is the highest and greatest of causes - to defend the unity of the United Kingdom, and all that binds our nation together. For unless we stay united, unless we stand together, as a Party and as a nation, this country will never prevail.  There is not a man or a woman in this hall, or listening outside, who doesn\u2019t know in their heart that is true. So let\u2019s be confident at home and in Europe.  Let\u2019s not turn away and say: \u2018It\u2019s all too difficult.\u2019  Let\u2019s not hang back because we don\u2019t believe our voice will be heard.  Right across Europe, now, in this critical hour, people are looking and listening to us and to what we have to say.It won\u2019t always be easy.  It won\u2019t always be comfortable.  But in all we do, there is one thing I will never forget.  This is our country.  What we do, we do for Britain.  What we do, we do for the future of our children and for generations yet unborn.  For their prosperity and their security - and never for short-term political advantage. Let us have faith, and courage, and pride.  Britain\u2019s interests will come first - for me, and this Party.  First.  Last.  Always.

aVMadam President, as I walked through the Winter Gardens during Conference Week, I passed the bookstalls and what do I see, I see memoirs - memoirs to the left of me, memoirs to the right of me, memoirs in front of me, volley, volley and thunder. Madam President, let me say right away I\u2019m not about to write my memoirs, not for a long time.There\u2019s a job to be done, a job of service to this nation, and I believe in service. There\u2019s a job to be done, a job I was elected to do and I propose to go on doing it. Madam President, there\u2019s one aspect of the memoirs that I may write in future that you needn\u2019t wait for. I can tell you now, straight away, precisely what I think of my Cabinet.Do you think any of them look worried? Apprehensive? Touch concerned? They needn\u2019t be, they\u2019re a first-class team, they\u2019re steady under fire, they\u2019re united and they\u2019re serving Britain superbly.  And isn\u2019t it good to see Michael back?  Did you see those exercises? I dare say they\u2019re going to enliven quite a few Cabinet meetings in the futureMadam President, I\u2019ve been coming to this conference on and off for about 30 years. It\u2019s a very great event in the political calendar, but it\u2019s something else as well. It\u2019s a family gathering and like all families, from time to time, we have our squabbles. So, today, before I turn to other matters, I want to say something to you, specifically as leader of the Conservative Party. Our party has served our country in Government more often and better than any other democratic political party in the world. We\u2019ve done so because we\u2019re the broadest based political party this country has ever seen. Our support comes from all classes, all income groups and all parts of the United Kingdom. Madam President, I know our party. It can bear many things - unpopularity, deep controversy, setbacks; we\u2019ve seen it all before, but there\u2019s one thing that demoralises our workers and that breaks apart our support in the country and that is disunity.We\u2019ve always known where it leads and so, in this private gathering we have today, we might as well state it plainly. Disunity leads to opposition. Not just opposition in Westminster, but in the European Parliament and in town halls and county halls up and down this country. Of course we won\u2019t agree on every single aspect of policy. No one expects that. We\u2019re a democratic party with a whole range of lively ideas. But I think you\u2019ll agree with me upon this - people look to us for common sense and for competence and we have a responsibility to you and to the people who put us in Parliament to show those qualities day after day. And that means we have to have our agreements in public and our disagreements in private.And if agreement is impossible, and sometimes on great issues it is difficult, if not impossible, then I believe I have the right, as leader of this party, to hear of that disagreement in private and not on television, in interviews, outside the House of Commons.Madam President, the last year has shown how hard every part of our party can fight for what it believes in. Let the next year show that we can channel all that energy together in a common effort against our opponents and for the policies we care about.This week, an unusual week, this week we had two conferences for the price of one. First, there\u2019s the one we\u2019ve been at. And then there\u2019s the one we read about.You know, I\u2019m not absolutely sure that everyone\u2019s caught up completely with the current mood of our party, so I\u2019m going to ask you three questions and I want to hear the answers loud and clear so that no one can doubt where you stand. They\u2019re very simple questions and very straightforward.Aren\u2019t you fed up with people running our country down?Aren\u2019t you fed up with people writing our party off?When people ask, Will the Conservatives win next time?\u2019 what do you say?I didn\u2019t quite catch that.Yes. Yes. And yes again. And you don\u2019t need shorthand to get that down.You see, Madam President, this is a family gathering, just as I said. But now I want to reach out a little further to speak not just to you, but to those outside this hall who may be listening. I want to share some thoughts with you and see if they strike a chord with your own experience. I think that many people, particularly those of you who are older, see things around you in the streets and on your television screens which are profoundly disturbing. We live in a world that sometimes seems to be changing too fast for comfort. Old certainties crumbling. Traditional values falling away. People are bewildered. Week after week, month after month, they see a tax on the very pillars of our society - the Church, the law, even the Monarchy, as if 41 years of dedicated service was not enough. And people ask, where\u2019s it going? Why has it happened? And above all, how can we stop it?Let me tell you what I believe. For two generations, too many people have been belittling the things that made this country. We\u2019ve allowed things to happen that we should never have tolerated. We have listened too often and too long to people whose ideas are light years away from common sense.In housing, in the \u201950s and \u201960s, we pulled down the terraces, destroyed whole communities and replaced them with tower blocks and we built walkways that have become rat runs for muggers. That was the fashionable opinion, fashionable but wrong. In our schools we did away with traditional subjects - grammar, spelling, tables and also with the old ways of teaching them. Fashionable, but wrong. Some said the family was out of date, far better rely on the council and social workers than family and friends. I passionately believe that was wrong. Others told us that every criminal needed treatment, not punishment Criminal behaviour was society\u2019s fault, not the individual\u2019s. Fashionable, but wrong, wrong, wrong.Madam President, on all these things, received opinion, with the wisdom of hindsight, received opinion was wrong. And now, we must have the courage to stand up and say so and I believe that millions and millions of people are longing to hear it.Do you know, the truth is, much as things have changed on the surface, underneath we\u2019re still the same people. The old values - neighbourliness, decency, courtesy - they\u2019re still alive, they\u2019re still the best of Britain. They haven\u2019t changed, and yet somehow people feel embarrassed by them. Madam President, we shouldn\u2019t be. It is time to return to those old core values, time to get back to basics, to self-discipline and respect for the law, to consideration for others, to accepting responsibility for yourself and your family and not shuffling off on other people and the state.Madam President, I believe that what this country needs is not less Conservatism, it\u2019s more Conservatism of the traditional kind that made us join this party.This week, this week we\u2019ve made a start. Now we must see it through. It\u2019s time for this party to return to its roots. Madam President, our economic roots are clear. We\u2019re the party of Adam Smiths, not John Smith.And Adam Smith was the apostle of free markets and that is why we regard the present world trade talks as so important. At meeting after meeting, we have battled to keep those trade talks alive against difficulty after difficulty, because nothing will do more for growth, nothing will do more for jobs, nothing will do more for confidence in our future, than agreement in those trade talks. But if other governments don\u2019t play their part, if they hold back, if they won\u2019t face up to their domestic difficulties, then those talks could collapse and the dangers of that happening are devastating. They could unlock protectionism, poverty and unemployment on a scale that we have not seen since the 1930s. A great deal is at stake. And because a great deal is at stake, I don\u2019t believe we ought to be mealy-mouthed about the dangers. Today, on this issue, is not a time for holding back. So let me say to some of our European colleagues, \u2018You\u2019re playing with fires.\u2019 Or, to put it more bluntly, \u2018Get your tractors off our lawn.\u2019People accuse us of being the business party. Well, you bet we are. We\u2019re for small business and we\u2019re for large business. We\u2019re for more business, not less business. When business booms, Britain booms, so we\u2019re for private enterprise and we\u2019re proud of it.Over the last three years, the whole country has sweated and slogged and suffered to turn this economy around. Now, steadily, it\u2019s happening. Recovery is underway. That\u2019s the message from British business. The economy\u2019s growing. You may not see it yet, but it clearly is growing and it will show. And as the economy grows, the family budget will follow, so people have every reason to begin to start feeling better again. Inflation\u2019s down. Interest rates are down. Exports are up. Productivity\u2019s up. Retail sales are up. Manufacturing output is up. And the number of people in work is up. Madam President, it\u2019s the opportunity cocktail we\u2019ve been wanting for years and it gives this country a head start on prosperity for the rest of this decade.So, let\u2019s try and build up that confidence, instead of forever seeing it knocked down. Why don\u2019t we try something different? Why don\u2019t we tell people about Britain\u2019s successes? And let me tell you about them, in the strictest confidence, so they\u2019re sure to leak out.Who says we can\u2019t make things in this country? Manufacturing industry is one of our great national assets.Three weeks ago - sometimes it seems longer - three weeks ago, I was in Japan, the industrial wonder of the world, and there with me were British manufacturers, selling solutions to problems that Japan hadn\u2019t solved. Successful British firms, international leaders in their own fields, firms at the leading edge of technology, selling successfully to the world technology leader. Two days later, I was in Malaysia and we came back with £1 billion worth of orders for British companies. They didn\u2019t buy British to do our companies a favour. They did it because we made what they wanted and we made it better in this country than anyone else in the world.Fourteen years ago, Britain was going nowhere. Now it\u2019s going everywhere and selling everywhere. We\u2019re making goods, making profits, making waves, right across the world. But despite that, despite the growth we\u2019ve had there and the growth to come there, I must warn you, it\u2019s still going to be tough, and everyone in business here today, or everyone who listens to what I say today, knows how hard they have to compete.At present, Europe, our biggest market, is stuck deep in recession. It\u2019s held back by social costs it can\u2019t afford. It\u2019s losing markets to Japan and to America and to the Pacific Basin. And that, Madam President, that, amongst other reasons, is why I refuse to accept the Social Chapter. It\u2019s not a chapter of rights, it\u2019s a charter for unemployment and we don\u2019t want it here.What we do want is more of our best brains going into manufacturing industry. Let\u2019s see them give politics, the City, journalism a miss and go into manufacturing industry where their skills can be so badly needed.And let\u2019s see our great manufacturing centres humming with activity as we move towards the millennium. Let\u2019s turn British inventions into British industries, British factories and British jobs. Let them make pounds for us, not dollars, marks, and yen for other people. Ministers are told, whenever they go abroad, part of your job these days is to open the door for British business. We\u2019re backing exports with cheaper credit, more Government muscle and a new breed of diplomat - people who know as much about exports as they do about etiquette.At home, at home we\u2019re taking the ridiculous burden of red tape off business and off citizen alike. And I can tell you, in the next session of Parliament, there will be a big deregulation bill to show how seriously we take that.Here\u2019s a good old British maxim you can all remember: if the price is right and the goods are good enough, then sell abroad and buy at home. That\u2019s the way to make sure that British industry continues to boom.But there are other things we need to do for industry. Industry isn\u2019t asking us for handouts and special help. It\u2019s asking us, as the Government, to play our part in creating the right economic environment for industry, to let loose its own energies and compete on a level basis with the rest of the world. So here, Madam President, is another ambitious target for our country: not months but years and years and years of sustained growth without the curse of inflation. That is at the heart of our economic policy for the \u201990s. It\u2019s a prize for which British Governments have struggled for 30 odd years, and yet now it\u2019s within reach and we are not going to throw it away.Just remember, only three years ago, inflation was over 10%. Now it\u2019s under 2% and it must be kept low. Inflation is in check but it\u2019s never in checkmate. Back in the \u201970s, soaring prices destroyed savings. We all remember that. We all want to make sure it never happens again. But to do that, to make sure it never happens again and destroys businesses and livelihoods and savings, sometimes we may have to hold back our ambitions for tax and spending.Madam President, let me get one thing entirely clear. Our views on tax are different from those of the other parties. What the Conservative Party is aiming for is a Government that lives within its income and without your income. Other parties tax because they want to. We tax only because we have to. So, come rain or shine, taxes will always be lower under us than any other kind of government.But success has another vital ingredient: getting public finances back under control. At the moment, largely because of the recession with the great collapse in income that that created, we have a huge gap between what Britain spends and the tax we take in. We have to narrow that gap. It is true Government has spent more over the last two years. We had to; to help the weak and protect the vulnerable through the recession. And that, Madam President, is an important part of Conservatism as well.But now Britain\u2019s recovering, so we have to cut the deficit. We all agree on that, but it\u2019s no good agreeing on the principle unless you take the action, and it\u2019s no use people urging us to take the action unless they are prepared to back us when we have taken it, for it may often be difficult.There are tough choices ahead and we must make them, and we will make them because it is in the interest of our country to make them and we have that responsibility.Of course, people\u2019s opinions will differ. Some say tax more, some say tax less, some say spend more, some say spend less but stay out of my backyard. All that\u2019s perfectly okay for the Opposition, but it won\u2019t do for the Government party. We can\u2019t have a lobby against every difficult decision. Decisions are what government is for and we have to take them.So, once the debate is over, once Ken Clarke has announced our budget proposals, we Conservatives must work together and take that message to every single part of the country. But there is one thing I can tell you that you can take with it: high income tax is no part of this party\u2019s programme.It never has been and, as far as I\u2019m concerned, it never will be.Madam President, high on every Conservative list is raising standards in our schools. That\u2019s why John Patten\u2019s first concern is with what parents think and what our children need. There are tens of thousands of excellent teachers up and down the country and I\u2019m proud to pay tribute to all they do on behalf of our children. But there is bad teaching as well and many parents and many pupils know that only too well. Our children must be taught what they need to know. That\u2019s why we need a national curriculum. It\u2019s why we need national testing. Not just for the sake of it, but to find out what our children have learnt and what they have failed to learn. And when we know what they\u2019ve failed to learn, we can put it right. But without this testing, we fail those children because we never learn what they haven\u2019t understood at an early stage in their school career.The principle of tests is not negotiable. We don\u2019t need reams and reams of complex papers that take hours for teachers to handle. What we do need is those simple pencil and paper tests that this party has always asked for, and that is what John Patten is going to deliver for us. Because unless we teach a child to read, to write and to add up, then we hobble that child for the rest of his life.Take John Prescott. For the audience at Brighton last week, his speech was a religious experience, mainly because it passes all understanding.But push him to one side. I saw a letter recently from over 500 university teachers of English. And they say in their letter that it\u2019s disastrous and harmful to teach standard English, great literature and Shakespeare in our schools. Apparently, teaching Shakespeare threatens to reduce a living language to a dead one. They say, and believe it or not this is a quote, they say, \u2018It would do serious damage to the moral and social development of our children and to the cultural life of society as a whole, and all who are concerned with such matters should oppose in the strongest possible terms.\u2019What claptrap.Well, I\u2019ll answer them in words perhaps they might approve of. Me and my party ain\u2019t gonna take what them on the Left says is okay, right.Madam President, over the past few months, in meetings with party workers, many of them I think will be here today. I\u2019ve made it clear in private that the attack on crime would be the centrepiece of next year\u2019s legislation. On Wednesday, after one of the best conference debates I have ever heard, Michael Howard delivered the first instalment. Lord Archer, if I may call him that, made it clear how much we\u2019ll have the support of the whole country in that programme. But don\u2019t let\u2019s pretend that we\u2019ve been idle over the last 14 years; we haven\u2019t. We\u2019ve increased sentences, built more prisons, spent more, recruited more police, and those police have served us magnificently. And no other party would have done as much.But we know now, it was not enough. In many parts of the country, crime figures have risen remorselessly. Crimes once confined to the cities have spread out into the rural areas, bringing alarm where alarm was never before. And that is the reason for our new approach. We have tried being understanding. We have tried persuasion. Madam President, it hasn\u2019t worked.I know criminals are a problem in a cell but they\u2019re much more of a problem on the street. And policy must be dictated by the needs of justice, not by the number of prison places we happen to have available on any given day. If someone belongs in prison, then that is where they should be and that\u2019s why we\u2019re building more prisons. Better the guilty behind bars than the innocent penned in at home.Let me tell you how I see things. We need tougher rules on bail, and no bail for the worst offenders. An end to the right to silence, as Michael Howard announced earlier this week. And more information for the police from DNA testing. We\u2019re going to use science to help catch the criminal and not let silence protect the criminal. Here, too, it\u2019s back to basics. For some, punishment seems to be a dirty word. Well, you\u2019ll find it in my dictionary and I strongly suspect that it\u2019s in yours.Some time ago, I said we should condemn a little more and understand a little less. And I meant that for this reason: if we let young people at an early age think crime is a normal part of growing up, if we let them off with a caution, a caution and a caution, it is small wonder if they feel there is no peer pressure turning them to law and order, and they turn to bigger crime later. And if we extend those parameters of leniency so far, we betray our children, for we do not give them the values that we expect them to live up to when they become an adult part of our society.There\u2019s one other issue in the range of measures that Michael announced in his remarkable speech the other day that didn\u2019t find room for it, for there was, even for the Home Secretary, a limited amount of time at this conference. But it\u2019s an issue upon which I feel very strongly, and I can tell you today that we plan a big crackdown on the loathsome trade in pornography that offends so many people in this country.There will be new powers of arrest and search, new powers to seize videos and other material, and something I personally particularly support - a new offence to make the possession of child pornography a crime that can lead to imprisonment. Yes, Madam President, it\u2019s tough. And so it should be. There\u2019s no place in a civilised society for that sort of exploitation of our children.But don\u2019t let us delude ourselves. Fighting crime is not just a matter for the police or for the Government. We can legislate, we can provide the resources. We can do all that and the police can perform miracles on the resources they have. But Governments can\u2019t make people good. That is for parents, for churches, for schools, for every single citizen.Like many people in this hall today, as a boy I knew people who had nothing, who expected nothing. They didn\u2019t commit crime because they did have something. They had values, dignity, pride, respect for their neighbours and, above all, respect of the old. And in the long-term battle against crime, that respect needs building every bit as much as Michael Howard\u2019s new prisons.Madam President, let me make it clear beyond a doubt. I simply do not accept that crime can be excused, and under this Government, I give you my word, it never will be.Madam President, from the serious to the less serious: our opponents. Our opponents can\u2019t string two policies together, but they can cook up a scare. And of course there\u2019s always a ready market for scares. Every day I\u2019m told what I think that I don\u2019t think, what I\u2019ve done that I haven\u2019t done, what I\u2019m planning that I\u2019m not planning. Hearing the news day after day is a voyage of discovery for me.Voyage of discovery for me, but very unsettling for many others, many of them elderly, more of them not very rich, and most of them very worried., So, let me offer some reassurance - not rumour, fact. Next time Labour and the Liberals say we\u2019re going to charge for visits to the doctor, you can tell them confidently, No, we\u2019re not. Next time they say we\u2019re going to charge for stays in hospital, tell them, No, we\u2019re not. And when they say we\u2019re going to introduce prescription charges for pensioners, you get right out on the doorsteps and tell them, No, we\u2019re not.They say we\u2019re going to force older people to go to the bank, not the post office, to collect their pensions. Well, really. I have 500 square miles of Huntingdonshire in my constituency and heaven knows how many rural post offices. I know their value to local village life, I know their value to the community. I know how much pensioners rely on them and that\u2019s why I promise you they\u2019ll be able to go on picking up their pensions at the post office.So go out and knock all that nonsense on the head. And yes, I know the concerns - nobody could possibly have missed them - the concerns that people have about their fuel bills. They believe they\u2019re going to face massive rises. They aren\u2019t. And the most vulnerable fear they\u2019re going to be left without compensation. They aren\u2019t. Kenneth Clarke made that clear yesterday and I\u2019m happy to repeat it today.This nation owes a huge debt to its pensioners. It\u2019s something this Conservative Party will never forget. So, it\u2019s our duty to keep our country a place in which they feel both safe and secure. So when you hear people saying this, that or the other, don\u2019t always swallow it wholesale. Remember, in the immortal words of Sporting Life in Porgy & Bess, \u2018It ain\u2019t necessarily so.\u2019Madam President, scares take me naturally to the Labour Party. I\u2019m not going to be savage about Labour. I think the people of this country would welcome an end to badmouthing between politicians. So, as a man damned every Sunday for his moderation, I think I shall stick to my own civil instincts. But that doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t have a bit of fun.Did you hear John Smith\u2019s speech last week? He\u2019s a good man, is John, but Lord doesn\u2019t he go on about it? He rather reminds me of a Scottish Buddha, the very essence of immobility with a faint smile of perfect self-contentment upon his face. And the Buddha has watched his Shadow Chancellor, Gordon Brown, Labour\u2019s gift to melancholia, he\u2019s watched him run from not sure about taxes, to no more taxes, to lots and lots more taxes in just six weeks, and there\u2019s a long time before the next election. And the Buddha said nothing. The Buddha has let his Northern Ireland spokesman plan a united Ireland and the Buddha said nothing. The Buddha has let his education spokesman say, Stop tests, cover up school results and scrap A Levels, and what did he say? The Buddha said nothing. One hears that the only sign the Buddha ever gives is a slight shake of the head, if anyone proposes a new idea.Madam President, we saw something rather remarkable in Brighton last week. They called it a famous victory. Famous victory? I would call it John Smith\u2019s political Munich. Here it is, composite - I beg his pardon - composite 55 and 56. Let me read you the victory roll: the trade unions will now only make 70% of policy and choose one third of the leader. Which one third is unclear? Perhaps they don\u2019t think it matters. After all, they\u2019ve long had the bit above the neck. What we have out of last week is a minor reduction in union influence in the Labour Party and the promise of a huge increase in union power in Britain, if there were a Labour Government.One small step for the Buddha, one giant step leap for the brudders.Whatever the trade unions ask for, they got. And what they asked for was unconditional surrender. Remember what Mr Smith said: The country needs strong unions today, as never before. Madam President, after all we fought for over the last 14 years, I think this conference would beg to differ with that judgment.Madam President, there\u2019s another strange party in British politics. It gives a different answer to the same question in Cornwall or London, in Ryedale or Eastbourne, on Monday or Tuesday. They\u2019re against VAT on fuel in the morning, and for a carbon tax in the afternoon. But they are consistent about two things: the first of them is tax. They are the other high tax party - income tax, local income tax, carbon tax, regional tax, Scottish tax, Welsh tax and, given half a chance, Euro tax as well. If they thought it would raise money, they\u2019d produce revenue from syntax and tin tacks.And the second thing they\u2019re consistent about is federalism. Centralism in Europe. The Liberal Party is a federal party. Don\u2019t take my word for it, this is their conference agenda. The autumn, it says, the autumn conference of the federal party - that is the Liberals in their own words. And look what they called for in this conference for a federal Europe - turn to page 99, though I would not recommend to you pages 1 to 98... This is what they called for on page 99. They called for sensible application of the social protocol and they had an amendment: \u2018delete sensible\u2019 was the amendment.I agree. Sensible stands out like a sore thumb in every Liberal conference. But their leaders are fanatics for federalism. They have been out of government for so long, they have forgotten how to take decisions. The only decision they can take is that they want someone else to take the decisions for us in this country. Next June, we will have European elections in Britain. Let me say to all our candidates who are present, and everyone here who will work in that campaign, that will be a national campaign. We are going to fight those elections on a clear and distinct British Conservative manifesto for the future of Europe.Madam President, I have risked and sacrificed more than most for what I passionately believe in: a strong Britain playing a leading role in a strong and growing Europe, a wider Europe, a free trade Europe, a less intrusive Europe, our vision of an independent, confident Britain, giving leadership with our partners in the European Community. And in our elections, in this country next year, we will be the only mainstream party that is not prepared to move towards a centralised Europe and take that message to every doorstep in the country.And tell them this too, tell them that any vote against us, for whatever party - Labour, Liberal, makes no difference - any vote against us for whatever party would be seen in every capital in the Community as a signal that the British people want a centralised Europe. We know they don\u2019t. You know they don\u2019t. They know they don\u2019t. We must make sure the people of Britain vote to show the rest of Europe that we don\u2019t.The Liberal leader says, rather nervously I thought, that the guns are turning on him. Too right they are, and not before time. Let the Liberals loose and the prospect of a federal Europe could be a reality again. In this country, they are federalism\u2019s fifth column. Away with them next June in the elections. Madam President, before I leave the Liberal leader, I want to say a word about his posturing on Bosnia. I find it distasteful. No, no words suffice for the sheer dreadfulness of Bosnia.The violence that has torn apart what used to be Yugoslavia has deep and bloody roots. They go back to the Middle Ages and beyond. People there have suffered great wrongs and unimaginable cruelties. We have given, as we always will, help, food, medicine, technical aid. We have sent British troops with humanitarian aid; the first country to do so. And those troops have saved literally hundreds of thousands of lives, men, women, children, who would now be dead from cold and starvation, are still alive, thanks to the activities, the skill and the bravery of those troops we sent to Bosnia.Madam President, right at the start of this war, I said that I was not prepared to put British troops into combat to hold the various sides apart. It\u2019s my responsibility, my responsibility as the Queen\u2019s first minister, to advise when soldiers should be sent to fight and to risk being killed. It\u2019s all very well to call from the sidelines for a huge military commitment to Bosnia, but I listen with respect to the views of the senior professional soldiers and airmen. They know the depth of the problem. They know what we would be asking their men to do. They know that while the threat of air strikes is a good deterrent, you cannot finally settle a guerrilla war by bombing. They know that. We saw it in Iraq after the biggest Armada of bombing for week after week after week. It was not until we sent in ground troops that Saddam Hussein finally lost. And those senior servicemen warn me against trying to separate three sides, three sides that hate each other, in a cruel civil war, in some of the wildest hill and forest country in Europe.There is another form of intervention which we may have to contemplate. Intervention not to impose a settlement on parties at war, but to implement a negotiated peace. Right now, alas, the peace prospects are thin and speculative. Too speculative to risk the life of a private in the Cheshire\u2019s or the Prince of Wales\u2019 Own. The negotiators will go on trying. I earnestly hope they will succeed but I shall not ask a British private to risk leaving his mother without a son and his wife without a husband unless there is a real settlement. Unless there is a real will by the people of Bosnia to stop fighting, not some ploy to suck outsiders in and then start the war again. I have never been in doubt about Bosnia. Though one cannot always speak one\u2019s mind plainly, I have understood that to intervene is to risk an intolerable number of British dead. A war is easily started. The boys are always going to be back for Christmas, but wars, particularly wars in the Balkans, have other ideas.So, let me make it clear. I leave the talk of a quick away-day outing for the commandoes with everything sorted out in a couple of weeks to the commentators and to the royal corps of columnists. Yugoslavia is tragic. I consider all the options but I must think first of the lives of British soldiers. And I will not put them at risk for the sake of talking big and striking attitudes. I will not rush into war. Emotion says yes, logic says no. I say no.Madam President, an unstable Yugoslavia is one thing. An unstable Russia would be quite another. So, let me say a few words about the events of the past week. We should be under no illusions about the real motives of the rebels in the Russian parliament. They were out for blood, the blood of democrats and reformers and, had they won, the consequences for Russia and for the rest of the world would not have borne thinking about. Yesterday morning, Boris Yeltsin told me that the courts would now deal with his opponents. Madam President, that is not how they wanted to deal with him.The Russian people have twice voted for President Yeltsin and for reform. Now he plans further elections, free elections, not rigged Communist elections. He invited me, yesterday, to send British observers to ensure those elections were fair. I agreed and promised that we would certainly do so. Those elections in December will be the surest test that democratic reform remains on track. We backed Boris Yeltsin against the 1991 coup. We were the first to do so. We backed him last weekend and I promise you this: we shall go on backing reform in Russia in the months ahead.When we speak of the threat of violence, there is one other place that is never far from our minds. Each day, each day this week, while we\u2019ve been gathered here in Blackpool, thousands of young men and women risk their lives in the Army and in the security services in Northern Ireland. They stand in the defence of democracy and of the rule of law. Under a Conservative Government, they will continue to have all the support that they need.Northern Ireland is part of our democracy. We are not going to bargain away the people\u2019s democratic rights, or any part of them, in order to appease those who seek to rule by bullet or by bomb. To do so, to do so would betray the people and, in particular, those of every party, many of them brave, who take a part in constitutional politics in Northern Ireland. So, no Government that I lead will negotiate with those who perpetrate or those who support the use of violence. There is only one message for them to send. We have finished with violence for good. Madam President, we are and we will remain the Conservative and Unionist Party.At the heart of our philosophy is an abiding belief in the right of the people of Northern Ireland to determine their own future. Unlike the Labour Party, we are not in the business of securing the break-up of the United Kingdom. For us, the union and all it means it immensely important. In all parts of the United Kingdom, including Northern Ireland, the union has the decisive support of those who live there. So I give this assurance to the brave and resilient people of Northern Ireland: for our part, we will always back your democratic wishes.Madam President, before I sit down, I want to congratulate all of you in the hall, all of you who are the backbone and the strength of our party, for your cool, your warmth and, yes, your resilience during a remarkable and, how shall I put it, most diverting week in Blackpool.Throughout the 1980s, the political energy of this country came from the Conservatives. That energy must go on through the \u201990s and not only go on, but grow and develop, driven not just by those in Government but by you who work on our behalf for our philosophy, for our party, in each and every part of the United Kingdom. And if you feel, as I do, refreshed and recharged by our work in Blackpool this week, then go home and help us restore the fortunes of our party, through hard work and a passionate belief that what we Conservatives stand for is more true, more deep, more enduring, more in touch with the basic instincts of the nation we love, than all the words of all the other political parties rolled together. We stand for self-reliance, for decency and for respect for others, for wages that stay in the pay packet and don\u2019t drain away in tax. We stand for money that keeps it value, for a country united around those old, commonsense British values that should never have been pushed aside.The message from this conference is clear and simple: we must go back to basics. We want our children to be taught the best, our public services to give the best, our British industry to be the best, and the Conservative Party will lead the country back to those basics right across the board. Sound money, free trade, traditional teaching, respect for the family and respect for the law. And, above all, we will lead a new campaign to defeat the cancer that is crime.Carry out that message. Reach out, not only to those who already think as we do, but to all those with no special party allegiance who care for what we care for and who love this country as we do, for the same reasons we do. Do that. The fight goes on, the waverers will return, and yes, a fifth victory will be ours.And one final word. Thank you, thank you for something that has been quite fantastic: your loyalty to this party and your loyalty to me.

aVMr. President, the political landscape has changed in the last few years, and it's changed again in the last few months. The language of politics is now Conservative language. With every speech and every copied aspiration, the Labour Party finally admit how wrong they have been for so long, and how right we have been. So forget the hype. It's we who've changed the whole thrust of politics and moved it in our direction. We have won the battle of ideas, and it is an astonishing triumph. When the Labour Party consider what has happened, they may realise what they've done, because what they've done is to study our instincts and our attitudes and then go away and market test them. And when they've done that they've discovered what we told them long ago: that they are the hopes and dreams of the typical Briton. It's a huge compliment to this party and we should accept it gratefully. But it's one thing for the Labour Party to commit grand larceny on our language. It's one thing for them to say what market research has told them that people would like to hear. But it's quite another to deliver it. They have some hard questions to answer. If you talk of full employment, then you should say what you mean. And then you should explain how that could possibly square with the minimum wage and the Social Chapter, which sound comforting but are deadly to jobs. And if you talk of low tax and low spending, does that mean supporting Tory tax cuts and Tory expenditure reductions? As to that we shall see before the writ of this parliament is run. If you preach about community, then you shouldn't grow politically fat on the politics of envy - and didn't Blackpool reek of it last week? And if you're going to attack over-mighty government and bureaucracy, then you shouldn't promise Scottish and Welsh parliaments with more bureaucrats and more taxation. And if you do, you should answer the question: Will Scottish Members of Parliament be permitted to vote on matters in England that English Members of Parliament would not be permitted to vote on in Scotland? And if Labour plan a Scottish Parliament, will they plan also to reduce the number of Scottish MPs in the House of Commons at Westminster, or will they gerrymander the Commons to boost their own political chances? Mr. President, these are deep waters. So let Labour be the party of devolution. We are the party of Union, the party of the United Kingdom. Mr. President, I've relished this debate. These are great issues, but they are our issues, this is our ground, and upon this there is a battle to be fought that this party will undoubtedly win. So I have this advice for you: don't waste time on the past - it's gone. Out there, up and down the country, people are concerned about the future, not the past. That is where the political debate should be, and that is where I intend to take it in the months and years ahead. In politics, if you expect the unbelievable, then you'll never be surprised. It is probable that at the next election, the government and the alternative government will both be talking Tory language. But there is a difference: only one will mean it. Buying Tory policies from Labour is like buying the Rolex on the street corner. It may bear the name, but you know that it isn't real. Our task is to promote the real thing, and expose the counterfeit. We hear talk of a new Labour Party. A new Labour Party. These aren't people without a past, lovable little extra-terrestrials beamed down for the duration. Mr. President, since 1979, we've beaten the old Labour Party, the very old Labour Party, the redesigned Labour Party and the new model Labour Party. And as for this new, "biologically improved" Labour Party, it may wash blander, but I would give it a shelf life of under three years. Mr. President, at Blackpool, Labour filched two of the principles on which we fought the last general election: opportunity and responsibility. But wasn't it interesting that they left out two others: personal choice and private ownership. They're vital to us. So socialism may be a bit out in Islington just now, but Conservatism isn't off my agenda. As they so often invent what we think, let me tell them clearly what we stand for: we believe in free markets, we believe in private ownership. It doesn't go against the grain for us to say so. It's not a new Conservatism that we've just discovered, it's one of the oldest principles of our party and we believe in it passionately. And because we've believed in it, millions of families up and down the land now have savings of their own: Granny bonds, TESSAs, PEPs, the hundreds of billions of pounds in the banks and building societies. It is our philosophy that has given people that choice and that security. That is the message that we must carry forward. Our opponents present ownership as if it was something selfish, self-centred, perhaps even greedy. Some people are all of these things, but most are not. People who have earned well, people who have saved, people who have inherited the fruits of a parent's lifetime's work are not the "undeserving rich". No, Mr. Brown, they are deserving workers. How does Clause IV put it - "by hand or by brain". So let me hammer the point home ever more clearly: we are the party of savings, of ownership, of property, of personal independence. We offer people choice: the liberty to grow, and yes, the liberty to make their own mistakes. We admire success in life, and we will never, never, never resent it in other people. We try to remove government from the everyday lives of people. We believe that every family should be entitled to enrich their own private corner of life, and then pass it on to their children without over-mighty taxation. That, Mr. President, is what Conservatism is about, and there is only one party in this land that truly believes it. Mr. President, I know when people hear the word "economy", the spirits droop. They think they're in for a lecture on the PSBR, GDP, and all the rest of it. Well, you're normally right, but not today. I just want to say today that the word "economy" should lift the spirits and not depress them, because the great cries of lasting growth with low inflation, which we have sought for the whole of my adult lifetime, is now within our grasp. Whisper it gently, but we are now doing well as a country. For most people, it isn't their everyday experience, not yet. But it will be, and I'll tell you why. Britain is making more, selling more, exporting more. This time we have built a recovery to last, built on firm foundations, on export and investment. Month after month after month, exports from Britain have broken the record set the month before, and they did so again just last week. These islands of ours are exporting cameras to Japan - you did hear me right, cameras to Japan; computers to Germany; cars to America; clothing to Hong Kong, and Cosmetics to France. We know what we were told. We were told unemployment would go on rising to five million. It's been falling for the best part of two years, and Michael Portillo announced another fall earlier this week. We were told we wouldn't get interest rates down, but we have; that we couldn't hit low inflation, but we have. These are the very things that bring security, make jobs safe, improve living standards and strengthen this country's influence right across the world. What is the prize that lies ahead? Let me tell you what it could be. In 1954, in Blackpool, "Rab" Butler was speaking to this conference. Suddenly he said something quite extraordinary. He said that living standards could double in this country in 25 years. People scoffed, but he was right. For the country as a whole they did double in 25 years. So let us have the courage to look forward once again. If we are able to keep inflation down, as we must, and control public spending, as we must, what does that mean for our people? It means stronger growth, improving the services we care about - education, health, the police service; it means more money in people's pockets and more free choice for those people. Britain has changed. It may not have been noticed but it has changed. Not for 30 years has this economy grown so much faster than prices. So let us bang the drum and say so. It's time to put the marker down, but as Ken Clarke told you yesterday, we need to stick at it, and for this reason neither Ken nor I, ever again, want to go through the boom-bust cycle that causes so much pain and so many lost hopes for so many people up and down this country. And that is why in some ways we are a bit puritanical. That's why we are so determined to control public spending, improve competitiveness, cut regulation, and let private enterprise build public wealth. That's why we'll be prudent about what we spend, cut taxes where we can, and above all build up the long-term health and strength of our industry and of our economy. Mr. President, it's time for this country to set our sights high again. What "Rab" Butler saw was prophetic and positive. Let me echo it today. Because of what has been achieved, with the right determination, with the right policies, we have the chance once again to double our living standards in the next 25 years, and that is something that everyone in this country can feel good about and feel good today. Mr. President, I want to talk about education. How many people in this world are fulfilled, really fulfilled? How many do the jobs that they might do? How many have had their minds stretched and extended? "Not enough" is the answer. Not as many by hundreds of thousands as should have. That's why education matters so much to me. I'm just burned enough to know a little about that. I left my chance late, so I did a lot of my schooling while off for a year with a shattered leg, in the company of Trollope, and Jane Austen, and Adam Smith, and a lot of dull but terribly useful books on banking. Better companions one never had, until now. But I was lucky. Not everyone is. It's my personal ambition that everyone should have the same chance to rise to the top on merit. Never mind where they come from, what their parents income is, what their religion is, or what their colour is. These are irrelevant, and please God they will always remain irrelevant to the people of this country. What matters to me is that they have the same chance. Good schools can be a lifeline out of poverty, the ladder to a better life. That's what our changes are all about: the curriculum, the testing, the league tables, the inspection, the new parental choice, the challenge to the old council school monopoly, the emphasis on better vocational education, and the creation of new universities. Mr. President, it is not reform for its' own sake, it is reform to deliver higher standards for all our children. Bad teaching fails children. They may get through if they come from families with a social edge, a sophisticated home and the good books that go with it, but bad schooling falls most heavily on pupils who have none of these things - children from homes without a book in the house, from blaring day-long television homes. Mr. President, we are a national party, and these children are as much our responsibilities as are the higher climbers. If the school ladder's all abstract theory and holds out no rungs of letters, facts and numbers, who loses? The children lose. The people who need our protection lose. The people easily defeated lose. The people who live at the bottom of the heap who deserve a chance to get off it lose, and it's just plain wrong. And that is why I want teaching in the weaker schools to be levered up, because if it is, someone will get off the bottom of the heap, and if it isn't that is where they will stay, probably for the rest of their lives. I will never accept that. I've no time for those who are complacent and oppose improvement, and all too often they are the high priests of the politically correct. They are the people who can afford the good things in life, who chortle away about our emphasis on basic standards and the three 'R's, and then move to a different catchment area, with better schools for their own children. They're people who have in their own homes the books that they say other people's children aren't up to reading. They are the people I cannot take, the kind of people who have clambered up the ladder and then seem ever ready to kick it away from other people. Education's there to lift the eyes, broaden the horizon, distinguish between the great and the trite, the right and the wrong. It's there to unlock the gate to a better life, and by and large teachers deliver this. They have a hell of a job, but they can make the difference for children between apathy and despair, and seeing the remote but inviting light upwards and out. Teachers that do their work well, for heaven's sake, teachers that do their work well, are the prime route out of the class trap. I care enough about teachers to give bad teachers a bad time, and I care about children enough to oppose sloppy, experimental teaching that ignores common sense. Up and down the country, dedicated teachers have worked hard to put our reforms in place. They haven't always liked every aspect of them; so we've listened. Sometimes they have been right and we have changed our minds. Many teachers feel there's been too much paperwork. I agree with them, and there still is. That's why we've been working with them on slimming down the National Curriculum. We've now finished that job, and it's been dramatically cut, and we're now out to reduce much of the other paperwork that schools have to deal with. Teachers should be marking homework, they shouldn't be doing it, and we're determined that is how it will be. After the curriculum changes of recent years, teachers deserve stability, to be able to get on with their jobs without any more upheavals. So today I promise them this: there will be no further significant changes for the next five years. And there's another area in which we must give teachers our full support. I'm disturbed by some of the stories I hear - too many stories to ignore - about violent attacks on teachers and false allegations against them. The teachers' unions are concerned about these issues and so are we. In this area, the unions deserve our support and the unions will get our support. But education involves fun as well as facts. Schools are friendlier, less forbidding places than once they used to be, and I think that's good. But they seem to have lost something. I don't regard sport, especially team sport, as a trivial add-on to education. It's part of the British instinct, it's part of our character. Sport is fun, and it deserves a proper place in the lives of all our children. Of course it can't supersede Maths and English, though how I longed for it to do so when I was at school! But it must take its proper place alongside them. We are therefore changing the National Curriculum to put competitive games back at the heart of school life. Sport will be played by children in every school, from five to sixteen, and more time must be devoted to team games. Many schools already offer at least two hours a week for sport and physical education. That should be the minimum, and I hope schools will offer more. Schools should establish links with local clubs and national sports bodies to help do this. They must open up their facilities outside school hours, and harness the willing help that I know is out there. There are sports coaches, parents and other volunteers by the hundreds and hundreds and hundreds who will willingly come in outside school hours to help our youngsters have a better grounding in sport, and all it means, for the rest of their lives. So while we're about it, I don't want councils selling off school playing fields they may need. I want those playing fields kept, and I want those playing fields used. Mr. President, there are many views about nursery education. My view is quite clear: I am in favour of it. The picture's improving. Over half our three and four-year-olds go to nursery school. Nine out of ten have been to a playgroup or nursery school before they're five. I think it's time to accelerate this trend. So I've asked Gillian Shepherd to work up proposals to provide places for all four-year-olds whose parents wish them to take it up. This is a long-term proposal, but we intend that this new provision will begin to come on-stream during the lifetime of this parliament. This won't be an easy exercise. We must consult parents and practitioners to get it right, because any additional publically-funded provision must be of high quality, it must promote diversity and parental choice, and it must be carefully targeted in a way that expands and does not crowd out the private and voluntary provision that we have at present. Since we are making a lasting change to pre-school opportunities, we will have to phase in the introduction of this extra provision, but what I am doing today is giving you a cast-iron commitment that it will happen, and I'm giving you that commitment now so that Gill Shephard can start consulting on it next week. Mr. President, I intend now to dispose of one of the most insidious lies in British politics. In life, some of our deepest convictions are formed by experience. Book-learning is vital, but life-learning runs deeper. When I was a boy, my father was elderly and sick, and my mother was frail. Their life wasn't comfortable; they needed treatment regularly. They got it from the National Health Service. They had no money to pay, but they weren't asked for any. I saw then, not only how well they were treated by the National Health Service, but the security of mind it gave them to know that it would always be available. I have never forgotten it. Now let me tell you a later story. Two weeks ago when Boris Yeltsin was at Chequers, we went for a walk. There was some comment afterwards that I was using a walking-stick. Naturally if I was using a walking-stick there must be an ulterior motive - was this my bid for the rural vote? Well, no, actually. I was using a walking-stick because I injured my leg badly in a car accident thirty years ago. For a while, that many years ago, I thought I might use it. It was saved by treatment on the National Health Service. I have never forgotten that either. Against that background, is it likely that I would damage the National Health Service or privatise it? Believing as I do that the greatest nightmare for millions is that one day, however prosperous they are today, that one day they may be old, sick, poor and uncared for, is it likely that I would take away from them the security of mind that was of such value to my parents? Mr. President, I can tell you, not while I live and breathe would I take that away. Let me say something else about the Health Service: It is the National Health Service, it doesn't belong to any one political party. The Labour Party, even today, take credit for setting up the NHS. I wouldn't take that away from them - it's one of the few bits of their past they don't currently seem willing to repudiate. But who has been in government for most of the fifty years since the Health Service was established? We have. It is we, the Conservative Party, who have been in government for most of those fifty years. It is we, the Conservative Party, who have cherished the National Health Service, and built it up year after year after year after year. Mr. President, it's our Service too. But there is one difference between us and Labour. We don't use it as a political football for party ends. Mr. President, we just build it up. I wonder how many of you know how many huge new hospital projects have been built since 1980 - you know, that period during which it's said we have been running the National Health Service down? How many? None? Five? Ten? Twenty? A hundred? More than that? Surely not. In fact yes. The actual figure is over seven hundred big projects, each costing more than a million pounds and some of them many tens of millions for the one project. And I'm not talking about car parks and offices, I'm talking about patient facilities - new hospitals, operating theatres, pharmacies, maternity units and the like - all within the National Health Service, seven hundred of them since 1980, and I saw the latest bulletin here today: a new day surgery unit in the Royal Bournemouth Hospital just down the road. But there's more. Consider it, perhaps, as it is: one multi-million pound National Health Service project every eight days the Conservative Party have been in government, throughout its fifteen years. That's not words, it's reality, and go out and tell it because it's our Service too. So I have a message for Labour's Health Spokesman, "Junket" Blunkett. Mr. President, when I became Prime Minister, I asked for a fresh look at the criminal justice system: the way we prevent crime, the way we police our streets, and the way we punish the criminal, and I did so because I felt that concern had shifted too much towards the criminal and too far from the victim. Why is there so much crime? The cheap, thought-free answer is to blame the so-called "acquisitive 80s", but that's just party political posturing; the roots are deeper than that. It is a long-term trend: sadly too many people feel less respect for their neighbours and for their neighbours property than once they did. And yes, I believe we have fostered too easy, too casual a response to crime by too great a tolerance of crime over many years. There have been too many voices excusing crime, explaining crime, and justifying crime. We think that's wrong. That's why we've increased penalties for rape, violence against children, firearms offences, drug-related crime and crimes committed on bail. And so that we can not be said by our opponents to have ignored what our opponents call our "friends in the city", let me say we have also increased sentences for financial crime. For a whole range of crimes, then, we have toughened sentences, and judges are now using them. For the first time in years, a rising proportion of convicted criminals are being sent to prison. I take no pleasure in that, but everyone has the chance to stay within the law, and that is the point. If we are to change the climate against crime, then the offender and the offender's chums must know they will not be able to swagger out of court, untouched, immune and boasting about getting off scot-free. I believe such firmness is right, and I believe it is necessary. Prison should be decent, but it should be spartan. No-one wants to alienate and harden attitudes, but prison is there to punish and not to pander. I fear that is not always the case, and where it is not, Michael [Howard] and I are agreed, it will have to change. But don't let us fool ourselves. Punishment alone will not do the trick. We have to change attitudes, improve policing, and support the innovative methods of Chief Constables. We are now developing much more targeted approaches to crime - new approaches; we're investing in more effective crime prevention. We must make streets safe for the law-abiding and dangerous for the criminal, and that is why we're putting yet more money into closed-circuit television. It's been a huge success, not only in big cities like Newcastle, but in smaller places like King's Lynn as well. We're going after drug dealers and drug trafficking, putting together the most comprehensive campaign against drug use ever launched in this country, and we will be announcing the details of this next week. And we are putting modern science at the disposal of the police. As Michael Howard told you yesterday, we're giving them wider powers to take DNA samples from people they suspect of crime, and that will help target sex offenders against women and children, and as a result help make this country just a little bit safer for millions and millions of people. The powers in the Criminal Justice Bill are needed, and I can tell conference this: we will never be deterred by the disgraceful riots like those we saw in London last weekend. And the sooner the Labour leadership disowns those Labour MPs involved in organising and speaking at this event, the sooner we may be prepared to take seriously some of their strictures on crime. And I can tell you how I feel about that episode: I think there's something profoundly sick with people who organise a demonstration which turns into a riot, and then criticize and attack the police who are only there to protect the public from the results of that riot. Mr. President, we hear enough bad news about crime. Let me tell you some good news. In Manchester crime fell by 12% in the last year; by 12% too in my own county of Cambridgeshire; in North Wales by 10%. What does that tell us? Not to relax, never. It doesn't tell us to be complacent. But it does tell us we can fight back successfully. If you can target burglary and cut it in London and Warwickshire then you can do it elsewhere. Mr. President, it will take a national effort to beat crime, it will take time, and it must involve everyone, but we are determined to succeed and we have made a beginning. Many of the changes I've been talking about have come about in the last year or so, and I believe that people who have spent that time criticising my good colleague Michael Howard would have been far better off supporting him during that year. Mr. President, a generation ago it was said that Britain had lost an empire but not yet found a role. It may or may not have been true then, but it surely isn't true today, because economically and militarily Britain remains in the top league - a member of the permanent five of the United Nations, a leading member of NATO, of the European Union, and of a Commonwealth that covers one-third of all the people on earth, a member of the Group of Seven of the worlds' most powerful economies and one of only five significant nuclear powers in the world, and we have too as a priceless asset, perhaps the finest professional armed forces anywhere. That is Britain today, stripped of the masking-tape so often placed above it. So let's recognise what we are, look with confidence at the new world, and go out and put our own distinctive British mark on it. The changes taking place around the world are truly awesome. I'm not sentimental about them - I know how fragile they are. Two months ago I was in Warsaw, where the first bombs fell in 1939, fifty years on from the heroic uprising in the Warsaw ghetto. It was good to be there. That August evening, we met in a free Poland, whose President was Lech Walesa, a shipyard worker who helped to change history. And taking his hand in friendship were the leaders of a democratic Russia and a united Germany. Poland's past enemies were there as friends; hope had flowered and the world had changed. A month later I flew to Berlin, where allied forces were leaving after half a century. That day, our troops marched away from Berlin with that professionalism and that patience which is the special preserve of the British soldier. For nearly fifty years, they had stood guard for peace and freedom at the gates of Berlin; now they were no longer needed; the world had changed. Three weeks ago, I was in South Africa. When Harold Macmillan spoke there of the "wind of change", it was to an all-white audience and a South Africa that was soon to leave the Commonwealth. But I spoke to a parliament freely elected by all South Africans, and that great country is back in the Commonwealth, back where it belongs. And what a tribute that is, to the statesmanship and the vision of Nelson Mandela and F.W. De Klerk. Finally, Mr. President, I flew from South Africa back to Chequers. There Boris Yeltzin was my guest, and the President of Russia and the British Prime Minister shared a country house weekend, a walk in the English countryside, and a pint of beer in a British pub. Four snapshots of change, historic days, when the impossible becomes not just possible but an everyday reality. Now the cold war is over, but while the threat was there, there were appeasers and accomodaters in plenty - but not in our party. We can say it with pride: We never heard their voices in this hall. As in the past, so in the future. Whatever uncertainties may lie ahead, this nation can trust that instinct for security that is a defining characteristic of the Conservative Party. Mr. President, the challenge now is to catch the tide of events that have flown in recent years so very strongly in our favour, to draw the nations of eastern Europe - historic, vivid nation states: Poland, Hungary, the Czech lands, and others - back into the European camera, to make democratic Russia an ally and not a threat, to help the democracies in the third world escape the excessive debt that cripples their development - and time after time it has been British initiatives that have led the way in achieving this, to use our age-old links with Africa to help prepare that troubled continent for a better future. These are historic roles; historic roles for which Britain and the Conservative Party are marked out by history and by experience. We will use that experience. We will use it also to carve out the right position for Britain in the right sort of Europe. There are extraordinary enthusiasms - hopes, fears, apprehensions - on both sides of the European argument, but I made our general position clear with my speech at Leiden. I believe it carries with it the overwhelming majority of this country, and that is the basis on which I will negotiate in 1996. And if I am not satisfied, I will do as I have done in the past: I will just say "No" to changes that will harm Britain. But I hope I will be able to secure an agreement that we can accept, for that is in the best interests of Britain. Across the world, the last four years have been turbulent. The years ahead may well be turbulent as well. We will be cautious, pragmatic and safe, but the world remains uncertain and unstable. If anything the end of the cold war has made regional wars more likely and not less likely. We cannot safely assume that it will be a safe world. Only this week we have seen how quickly a crisis can blow up in the Middle East, but who better to send there and act for Britain than Douglas Hurd, our own Foreign Secretary. Mr. President, we have interests the world over. Isolationism is a luxury that Britain cannot afford, and there is a growing need for regional peace deals - we are very good at them; the defence of British interests does not always lie on British soil. So we will continue to play a leading role, as we have always done, through the United Nations. Mr. President, the main point's clear: while we have Conservative government, Britain will have a sure and stable defence, the best equipment, the best weapons, the best trained troops that we are able to provide. Last week showed again how distinctive that position of ours truly is. In opposition it doesn't matter that Labour voted to scrap Trident - in Government it would. In opposition it doesn't matter that the first place Labour would look for cuts would be another defence review - in Government it would. So let me mark out the clear ground, so that no-one serving our country in uniform is in any doubt. Three months ago, we confirmed our frontline would have an extra three thousand troops, and placed five thousand million pounds worth of orders and tenders for modern and effective equipment for the army, the navy and the air force. That, Mr. President, made implicit what I will now make explicit: the big upheavals in our armed forces are over. They deserve the best from us and they will get it. Let me say something about Northern Ireland, and the momentous events through which we are living. For the past 25 years, Northern Ireland has faced the daily horror of murder and brutality, kneecapping and beatings, organised racketeering and viciousness to fund terrorism for political ends. No morning has dawned that might not contain an atrocity: a father who didn't return home, a woman or child indiscriminately bombed, a policeman or soldier killed by a hidden sniper. That evil has spread, from time to time, to mainland Britain: the Brighton Bomb, ten years ago this very day, that some of you will be remembering so vividly and so painfully. We still miss those who were lost and think of those who were injured. It was intended to murder a cabinet, but it ended up hardening the resolve of an indomitable Prime Minister. We remember the murders of Airey Neave and of Ian Gow, the bombs in the city and at Downing Street, the agony of Warrington, and the heart-rending memories of Tim Parry and Jonathan Ball who will never know the future that should have been theirs. What did those two little boys ever know of political disputes? In all this time, these long twenty-five years, the extraordinary people of Northern Ireland have carried on with their lives. Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom. All the people of Northern Ireland need to know that a search for a solution to their problems is right at the top of the British government's agenda, and I solemnly give them that promise. We have made progress. It was the Downing Street Declaration that set out the principles that will continue to guide us. It helped isolate the IRA and push them to their ceasefire. As Jim Molyneaux put it, "It was significant", he said, "when the IRA started to murder pensioners, children, mothers and fathers and so it was bound to be significant when they stopped. The most significant part of all has been the victory of ordinary people over the terrorists", and how right Jim Molyneaux was. And yesterday, yesterday the loyalist paramilitaries announced that they too were stopping violence. Another victory for ordinary people, brave people, in Northern Ireland. Today, for the first time in a quarter of a century, the people of Ulster have woken up to peace. Our determination must be to make that peace permanent. To fasten down what is unfolding needs clear reasoning and cold calculation. Many people will urge me to hurry. I understand their enthusiasm. I will not tarry one day longer than I judge is necessary. But I will take it in my own time. The responsibility for Northern Ireland is the responsibility of the British Government. I am used to being urged to hurry. I have had such advice daily since the Downing Street declaration. But if I had listened, we would not today where we are, with the guns stilled and the bombs stopped and Northern Ireland on its way to a better future. So other people can call for speed if they wish, but I must ask the hard questions and I must make the right judgements at the right time, and to the best of my ability, I will. Things are changing; the profile of street security has lessened on military advice, men and women are no longer searched when they enter hotels and large stores; but let me give this assurance: for as long as is necessary, as many policemen and troops as are necessary will stay on duty in Northern Ireland to protect all the people of Northern Ireland. We have made a beginning, but not yet an end. Every day that violence is absent brings more hope. Progress may not be easy, there will be setbacks, there may be disappointments - people who are suspicious, who block progress. All this probably lies ahead. But there is, I am sure, a way through. If you will something, you can make it happen, and the will for peace in Northern Ireland is very strong. So Paddy Mayhew and his team, who have done so well, will press ahead with the political talks with the constitutional parties. We intend to complete a framework document with the Irish Government. We hope to restore local accountability and local democracy to Northern Ireland; to seek an agreement, an agreement that is acceptable to the people of Northern Ireland, and we shall test their view in a referendum as a cast-iron safeguard of our intentions. I know the size of the task ahead. I've no illusions about its difficulty, or the past record of many of the people with whom we are dealing. But we cannot let history freeze us into inaction. There is a chance, a window for peace. We will enter it if we can do so with honour and with consent. In the words of the old testament, which is common to both traditions in Northern Ireland, "There is a time to love and a time to hate, a time of war and a time of peace." The people of Northern Ireland are sick of war. It is for them that we must build a time of peace. Mr. President, it's a cliche' today that every leader must have "the vision thing". We're told he must map out, in dramatic form, new direction. I don't disparage "the vision thing", but alongside "the vision thing" I must tell you I remain rather attached to "the action thing", to "the practical thing", to the "how on earth do you deliver these promises thing". By all means listen to a politician when he tells you what he plans, but ask him too "How will you do it?". Take it from me, the devil, the very devil, can be in the detail. I don't disparage the mapping of direction, or sometimes, new direction. I hope I've sketched out some today, but I must tell you, there is sometimes merit in the old direction. Change for the sake of change should never appeal to any Conservative. In a world sometimes of bewildering change, this party must stand for continuity and stability, for home and for health. And we must build this for the long term, for our children and for our grand-children. It is the young people out there, it is they who will make the world in which we grow old. They will make the decisions. They may decide in their time to strike out along new pathways, but it is for us in our time to build for them a stronger foundation so they may have that choice. And today my message to you is that Britain is growing stronger: we are beginning to see the fruit of all the things we've battled and striven for throughout these difficult last four years. You know, running the country isn't like walking down the road. You have to hold fast to your core beliefs, whatever the short-term pressures may be; see the right things through to their finish, whatever the risks may be. To govern is to be engaged in a hundred themes, a thousand roots, and the everyday visions, sometimes conflicting, of literally millions upon millions of people. No windy rhetoric, no facile phrases, no pious cliche', no shallow simplification, no mock-honest, mock-familiar adman speak, can conceal or should be permitted to conceal the infinite complexity of government. Take care nobody tries to conceal that from you. Take care not to confuse travesty with truth. Never assume that because an idea is easily communicated that it must be right. Take care not to confuse oratory with practical concern. Look for the achievements of government not always in bold plans or crude conflicts, but sometimes in mended fences too, and sometimes in the accretion of small steps whose pattern takes time to become clear. In this difficult world, our interests are daily at stake. The time is ripe for grown-up politics. The glib phrases, the soundbites, the ritual conflicts, all these may be the daily stuff of life for the upper 1,000 in politics, but to fifty million other people in this country they are utterly irrelevant and my interests must be with them. It is said that actions speak louder than words. I hope so, for in the end, and when it comes to a choice I shall bend my energies always to work, not talk. My trade has never been in adjectives; I shall be patient. I shall be realistic. I shall ask for patience and realism in others, and I promise you this: I shall put my trust in results. Thank you.

aVToday is Friday the Thirteenth. Remember it. This is the day I\u2019m going to tell you how we\u2019ll win the next election. And if anyone is superstitious, they shouldn\u2019t be. This is Margaret Thatcher\u2019s 70th birthday, and she won three elections in a row. So the omens are good. Many happy returns to Maggie today, and it\u2019ll be many happy returns for us at the Election. We\u2019ve won four and we\u2019re going for five.All elections are important. But the next is a watershed. Because whoever wins will inherit the strongest economy for decades. We built that economy. It wasn\u2019t easy. And I don\u2019t know about you, but I\u2019m not in the mood to hand it over to Labour to wreck. So, Mr. Chairman, we\u2019re going to mount the fight of our lives. And when the time comes, we\u2019re going to deliver the win of our lives.LeadershipBut first a bit of housekeeping. As you know, in June I resigned as Leader of our Party and called a leadership election. I did so because speculation was drowning out everything we were trying to do.  How could you argue our case on the doorstep with that sort of thing going on? Well of course, you couldn\u2019t. It had to end - whatever the risk. I might have lost. If I had, I would still have been at this Conference. Still offering my full support to the Party - I believe is best able to govern this country. But I won. And today, face to face, I\u2019d like to thank you for your support when the going was rough. Thank you, too, to my campaign team, led so ably by Robert Cranborne. And there\u2019s someone else who has always been there when the stakes were high. She\u2019s here today too. Of course - I mean Norma.LabourBut that was yesterday. Today, we meet united, healed, renewed - and thirsting for the real fight: with Labour. Last week the Labour leader predicted that we\u2019d wave the Union Jack. Of course, this Party has never waved any other flag - and we never will. To win, Labour must persuade people this country is on its knees. Clapped out. Beaten up. They shouldn\u2019t find that too difficult. That\u2019s the way it always is - under Labour. But they know it isn\u2019t true under the Conservatives. And the world knows it isn\u2019t true. The world knows the only way our country would match their description would be if they were running it. I don\u2019t question Labour\u2019s patriotism. But it\u2019s a funny patriotism to rubbish our achievements - how shall I put it? - before breakfast, before lunch, before tea and before dinner, and then get up and do it again before breakfast - on the Today programme. I don\u2019t doubt Labour\u2019s good intentions: the road to hell is paved with them.They say they want to help businesses, so they\u2019ll clobber them with the Social Chapter. They say they want to help the unemployed, so they\u2019ll destroy jobs with a minimum wages. They say they want to treat the unions fairly, so they\u2019ll give them privileges even Michael Foot didn\u2019t dream of in the 1970s. I think Labour has been the reading 1984, the book that introduced \u2018Doublethink.\u2019 You remember - doublethink - the trick of holding two contradictory beliefs at the same time and accepting both.It was the brain-child of another public school educated Socialist. His name was George Orwell. But actually it wasn\u2019t. That was his pen name. His real name was Eric. His surname? You\u2019ve guessed it. It was Blair. Eric Blair. He changed his name. I can\u2019t say the same thing about my opposite number. He\u2019s changed everything else. His politics. His principles. His philosophy. But - to the best of my belief he hasn\u2019t changed his name. At least not when I got up to speak. But he\u2019s abandoned so much, so fast, you never know.The Liberal Democrats support all Labour\u2019s nonsense. But they\u2019re neither here nor there. Because as we saw the other day, they\u2019re the only party in British political history that has had its entire battle plans wiped clean off the media by a goldfish.The Great Divide - Us versus ThemMr. Chairman, around the world, people now believe Britain is winning. But don\u2019t let\u2019s fool ourselves. I\u2019m looking to the future. There\u2019s still a lot to be done. The new millennium will bring longer, fuller lives. Shifts in world power. More and more competition. Changes in technology, fast and furious. And, even with growing wealth, new welfare problems. That is the millennium challenge. We have to respond to it. Explain to people the opportunities within their reach. Tell them what can - and cannot be done - and what the price will be. By telling them, I mean really telling them. I don\u2019t mean them by trivialising issues for instant media consumption.I believe the public will respond to the plain truth. I believe they\u2019re as sick as I am of politics by sound-bite, by nudge and wink. No wonder people are turned off politics. The way some politicians conduct the debate would disgrace a nursery. There are only two ways to the future. There\u2019s Labour\u2019s way. And there\u2019s ours. Scratch beneath Labour\u2019s rhetoric and you see the reality. Prescott, Beckett, Blunkett, Dobson, Cook. They believe a socialist state can do it all. If that were true, the past 50 years would have been quite different. Cradle to grave socialism? I always thought that a rather constrained way to go through life. But the State can\u2019t do it all - and, what\u2019s more, the State shouldn\u2019t do it all. Beat Labour one more time, and we\u2019ve beaten socialism for good.Our way - the Conservative way - is very different. We believe the Government should choose what Government should do - and do it better. Beyond that we should help individuals shape their own future. Help them, but not nanny them. Conservatism is choice. Choice is liberty. Blazon it on your mind. We should offer choice whenever we can. But if there\u2019s one thing in our Tory tradition that has inspired me, it\u2019s our historic recognition that not everyone is thrusting and confident and fit. Many are not, and they deserve protection. With a Conservative Government they will always get it. Individual rights will be defended. Ownership will be encouraged. And, above all, we will stand for - and will protect - one United Kingdom, unbroken and undivided.The Enterprise Centre of EuropeWe Tories often talk of business and the need for success. It\u2019s worth remembering why. It\u2019s quite simple. If business makes profit, it provides jobs and pays taxes. And those people with jobs pay taxes too. Taxes pay for our teachers, our nurses and our public services. So we must make business more successful.We are in Europe - and rightly so. It\u2019s the richest home market in the world. Half our trade goes there. But half does not.  And both halves are equally important. That\u2019s why Malcolm Rifkind will actively pursue the vision of Atlantic Free Trade - refreshing our vital links with the Americas.If we\u2019re to compete with America, Japan and the Pacific Basin, we must be the unrivalled Enterprise Centre of Europe. Let me spell out precisely what that means. It means high spending and high taxes are no longer an option. The state spends too much of our national wealth. We must get that share below 40 per cent - and keep it there. If the State spends too much, it taxes too much. In the recession, we had to put taxes up to protect the vulnerable. Now the recession is over, as soon as prudent, we must get taxes down again. And - be in no doubt - I don\u2019t only mean income tax.I mean the taxes that damage investment and stultify wealth creation. I mean inheritance tax. I mean capital gains tax. We must cut them, and then - when affordable - we should abolish them. We receive more investment into Britain than any other European Country. This very day, The Queen will open Samsung\u2019s massive new development in the North East. Fujitsu, Daewoo, Nissan, Black and Decker, NEC, Siemens, have all decided their future is here. You don\u2019t hear Labour talk of this. Of course not. These companies didn\u2019t invest in a socialist Britain. They set up here because it\u2019s a Conservative Britain. And they\u2019ll only be followed by others if we keep Britain Conservative.Labour say they know how to run a market economy. I asked Humphrey the cat about that. It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve seen him move so fast. It took all the resources of the Royal Army Medical College to get him over the shock.Labour have stood in the way of everything we\u2019ve done.Where were they when we cut inflation? When we faced down union power? When we fed life back into the corpse of so many nationalised industries? Humphrey could answer the question. Humphrey knows. Like Macavity, Labour wasn\u2019t there. They were the advocates of the easy options and they opposed every tough decision we took. Interest rates up? Disgraceful said Labour. Interest rates down? Not enough, said Labour. Interest rates the same? The Chancellor must act, says Labour. Always, always, always the easy option. So when they criticise us, just remind them of this. If we\u2019d followed their advice, we\u2019d have been in Carey Street.Unemployment has been coming down for two and a half years. But it\u2019s still far too high. The best route to more jobs is more small businesses.  We are the Party of small business. When I was a small boy, my bread and butter was paid for by my father\u2019s small business. He made garden ornaments 40 years ago and some fashionable people find that very funny. I don\u2019t.  I see the proud, stubborn, independent old man who ran that firm and taught me to love my country, fight for my own and spit in the eye of malign fate. I know the knockers and sneerers who may never have taken a risk in their comfortable lives aren\u2019t fit to wipe the boots of the risk-takers of Britain.When my father\u2019s business failed because his health failed, I saw the price the small businessman may have to pay. I know the sacrifice they make for the dreams they have. They don\u2019t know whether they\u2019ll succeed. But they work as hard as they can. That\u2019s why, as Ian Lang told you, we\u2019ve set up the biggest consultation with business ever seen in this country to find out what more we can credibly do to help them. Frankly, Mr. Chairman, I think they\u2019re heroes.I know one thing: we mustn\u2019t pile burdens on business. So let me say this to our friends and partners in Europe. Don\u2019t ask me to sign the Social Chapter. I won\u2019t do it. I don\u2019t look for popularity abroad - I prefer to protect jobs right here. Don\u2019t misunderstand me. I\u2019m for Europe, not against it.  And I intend to argue for policies that will help it succeed.Pressure to stop arguing and go with the European consensus is strong. It\u2019s difficult to set rational argument against the last movement of Beethoven\u2019s Ninth. We must be sympathetic, but we must stand our corner. We must ask our partners to understand our thinking and we must understand theirs. Against the background of the traumas Europe suffered over the past 60 years - war, dictatorship, civil war, military occupation - it\u2019s not surprising to me that they look towards European unity as a guarantor of political stability. Of their decision never to go to war with one another again.Only twenty years ago, Greece, Spain and Portugal - new partners in Europe - were ruled by men in dark glasses and epaulettes. Now these countries are secure in the European Union. In a few years\u2019 time - thanks in large part to British policy - they will be joined by Czechs, Poles, Hungarians and others, now liberated from Communist dictatorship. They are knocking on the door to entry and we want to tie them in to the democratic family of nations. Because it\u2019s in our British interest: a further guarantee that our children and grandchildren will never face the conflicts that cost the lives of so many of our fathers and grandfathers.Unoccupied, undefeated, the war left Britain with a very different perspective from the rest of Europe. If we want to persuade our partners that their policies for Europe are wrong - as I believe many of them to be - we must use our imagination to understand their feelings and their motives.We entered Europe for prosperity. For co-operation. For a louder voice on that great continent. But we did not enter it for a new tier of Government. We did not enter it for Socialism through the back door. And we did not enter it for a federal Europe. It wouldn\u2019t work for us. Our partners must understand that it\u2019s politically and constitutionally unacceptable. But that\u2019s what Labour would agree to and I believe they are profoundly wrong. We will advance our arguments firmly and courteously in Britain and in Europe. For Britain for Europe. But underneath the rational argument we should not be misunderstood. If others go federalist, Conservative Britain will not.Welfare SpendingMr. Chairman, providing quality care for those most in need is a strong part of the Tory tradition. Shaftesbury and Disraeli were doing it when socialism was just a distant nightmare in most people\u2019s minds.We are proud of our free National Health Service. We have fought to make it the best in the world in the next century. We have put more resources into health, not just once, but year after year. And we are modernising it, so that it remains the best in the world. But, Mr. Chairman, we are succeeding. People are living longer. And that success in health creates new challenges for our welfare system. The easy way out is to load the bills onto future generations - issuing blank cheques for our children to pick up.In other words, living on tick, I wasn\u2019t brought up to do that. And I don\u2019t think that it\u2019s right for the country. We have already done more than anywhere else in Europe to build up massive pension funds. But because we live longer, we need to develop similar approaches to long term care - encourage new forms of savings, new kinds of insurance, more flexible use of pensions. That\u2019s the next step forward in our welfare system, and one we are examining right now.We don\u2019t have all the answers yet. But it is important that people know we\u2019re addressing their long-term problems. It\u2019s a huge challenge but it\u2019s one we can\u2019t duck and one we must get right. And it\u2019s one that will only be met by recognising the money we spend has first to be earned through an enterprise economy.It\u2019s a strong Tory tradition that you and I look after ourselves and our families before we turn to others to pay our bills. That\u2019s why we need to target our welfare spending on those who need it. I don\u2019t need anyone to tell me that the welfare system matters. I know what it\u2019s like when the money for the week runs out by Thursday. But welfare should offer people a ladder back to the pride of self-reliance, not a trap for the poor.That\u2019s why we\u2019re designing a welfare system for the twenty-first century. Targeting benefits. Reforming pensions. And helping people from welfare back into work. But not tolerating those on welfare who won\u2019t work. From next autumn, everyone who is unemployed will need to undertake a contract for work. A contract that makes it absolutely clear that they have obligations to accept paid work when it is available. Mr Chairman, we\u2019ll continue to shape a welfare system that is generous to those in need. We can do no other. But it must be one that also reflects the basic Tory instincts of rewarding prudence, thrift and family responsibility.EducationEducation affects not just careers, but people\u2019s whole lives. That\u2019s why, when I became Prime Minister, I put education at the top of my agenda. I haven\u2019t changed, but education has. Since then we\u2019ve introduced regular tests, made school inspection more rigorous, given parents more choice and information. Today, three times as many young people become students as in 1979. Last year I told this Conference that we would make nursery education available to all 4-year-olds. We\u2019re doing just that with vouchers: to put power and choice where it belongs, not in the hands of bureaucrats. But in the hands of parents, choice, choice, choice. And all opposed by Labour. I still want to widen choice in education. Some years ago, we set up the Assisted Places Schemes. It helps children from low-income homes to go to our best private schools. It\u2019s been a great success. But Labour hate it. That\u2019s true to form - they always claim to want to help people, but in return they demand that people know their place. And in Labour\u2019s view there is no place for children of low income families in private schools. So they want to abolish the scheme outright. Labour\u2019s message to them is: no choice for the poor.One of the schools that offers places to pupils on this scheme is in Edinburgh. It\u2019s one of Scotland\u2019s most famous private schools: Fettes. Quite a lot of famous politicians went to Fettes, including Iain Macleod. Iain Macleod was a One Nation Tory, and wouldn\u2019t he have been proud to see pupils of poor families at his old school - sent there by a One Nation Government. So I\u2019m going to give more children that opportunity. We\u2019re going to double the Assisted Places scheme.But I want to widen choice still further. So if parents want specialist schools, we should let them have them. And if they want religious schools, we should let them have them, too. This isn\u2019t a dogma. It isn\u2019t elitist. It\u2019s based on the belief that children are first and foremost the responsibility of parents, and they know what is best for their children. We also want excellence in education, so I believe we should let good schools expand. Bad schools should be closed. Of course, closing bad schools means a row. But it\u2019s the right row to have, and Gillian Shepherd is prepared to have it.Not every child can benefit from the Assisted Places Scheme or private education. Real choice will come when every state school offers the highest standards - when every state school prizes discipline, when every state school puts learning before political correctness. Gillian is going to work with every good head and teacher to deliver that.Many parents believe they\u2019ve found a way to higher standards already. They\u2019ve chosen for their schools to become independent, self-governing schools - what we call grant maintained. These schools are in the state sector. Run by the Head and the Governors. They get their money from government to spend as they think fit. Their results have been outstanding. That\u2019s why I want to enable all schools to become grant-maintained. But Labour want to destroy them - wipe out their freedoms and take away their budgets. These schools became self-governing after a ballot of parents. Parents chose independence. Labour want to wreck them without a ballot. Labour hate independence. So, parents at the next election - choice or no choice. That\u2019s the choice.VE/VJThis year we have all remembered with gratitude the sacrifice our predecessors made for our forbears. VE Day and VJ Day were very special. Most of you would have attended some of the events or watched the remarkable television coverage. I was there. I found it immensely moving. The sense of pride was tangible. But, Mr. Chairman, unlike others, I didn\u2019t hear people on VJ Day shouting out party political propaganda. For me, it was a day in which a free people paid tribute to those who kept them free.Back in June you will remember the huge commemoration which took place in Hyde Park. Let me tell you a story of that day. At the entrance to one stand was an elderly man trying to get in. He had no ticket so the security guard was about to turn him away. But as luck would have it, a brigadier was passing by. Not any old brigadier, but one of the organisers of VE Day. He saw something pinned to the chest of this elderly man. Not all of us would have known what it was. But the brigadier did. It was the highest award for gallantry in our armed forces: the Victoria Cross. The elderly man was immediately given a seat of honour on the platform.Later that day, I had the privilege of meeting him - and the other Victoria and George Cross holders. I learned that they receive a small annual payment. It was £100 a year. A figure set 40 years ago, before many years of inflation. It has never changed. It seemed to me that, in this year of all years, it should be changed. So to show that this country has not forgotten the bravest of the brave, it will be changed. From August this year, that payment will be up-rated to its original value. It will increase from one hundred pounds a year to one thousand three hundred pounds a year.Northern IrelandIn the last year, life has changed in Northern Ireland. I want to make those changes permanent. To see the next generation there growing up in prosperity and peace. Patience, determination and fairness have carried us a long way. No one has shown these qualities more consistently than Paddy Mayhew and Michael Ancram - Northern Ireland has been well served by them. But we\u2019re not there yet. There are still some who, in one breath, say they\u2019ve given up violence for good and in the next warn that it could return. It needn\u2019t, and it won\u2019t, unless they themselves pick up the gun. But if it is to last, it must be a just peace. One that is fair to all sides. And a peace that is constructed away from the shadow of the gun. However long it takes, building this peace in this part of our United Kingdom will continue to stand at the top of our priorities.Britain in the WorldMr. Chairman, Britain has big interests in the world. We are the only nation at the hub of the European Union, the Commonwealth, NATO and the United Nations. We are a nuclear power and a member of the Permanent Five of the Security Council. Our armed forces are today serving in more than forty countries, including Bosnia. I sent troops there in 1992. Not everyone approved, but I believe it was right. They went to the Balkans for two reasons: to protect men, women and children from starvation, rape and genocide, and to prevent a full-scale war at the crossroads of Europe. They have succeeded superbly, often at great risk to themselves. We can be proud of what they have achieved. It now seems possible we may soon have an uneasy peace. I hope so. But our role will not end there. Help will be needed to monitor the peace and we will play our part in this. International influence creates international obligations - and we will meet them.The ConstitutionMr. Chairman, we can only continue to be a big player abroad if we remain one United Kingdom at home. We recognise that Scotland and Wales are Nations in their own right. Of course, if they insist, they could ultimately go their own way. We could not properly stop them. At the moment there is a clamour for constitutional change as many see the Westminster Parliament as a long way away. Some say we would be more popular if we bent to this clamour, if in Wales we set up Labour\u2019s expensive talking shop, or in Scotland we said: \u2018OK. You want your own tax raising Parliament - you can have it. Don\u2019t blame us when it all goes wrong.\u2019But that is not our way. We are the Conservative and Unionist Party. I will not trade easy votes today for constitutional chaos tomorrow. We are sensitive to people\u2019s concerns in Scotland. So we are looking at more ways of giving people more say over decisions affecting their day to day lives. But it\u2019s my duty to warn of the effect of Labour\u2019s plans for the constitution. Labour are proposing changes to our Constitution for their own party political advantage. In Scotland they are running scared of the SNP, so they have promised to impose a tax raising Parliament in their first right year.In Wales they are not so worried about Plaid Cymru, so Wales would just get an Assembly. And in England they can\u2019t make up their minds, so there they might - or might not - impose regional assemblies. There is no demand for these in England. Labour only promise them in an attempt which fails to justify the over-representation of Scottish Labour MPs at Westminster. It is straightforward gerrymandering, and we might as well say so.In Scotland, the new Parliament would raise income taxes. I hope Scotland realises what this means. People in Scotland, uniquely, will pay higher income tax on the same income than people in England or Wales or Northern Ireland. To start with, a tartan tax of an extra £6 a week for the average family. Let me ask you a question. If you were a businessman, wanting to invest and create jobs, where would you invest in? Scotland, where you\u2019ll have to pay higher wages to compensate for higher taxes, or somewhere else? You know the answer to that. The Tartan Tax will do two things: it will pay for more bureaucrats and more politicians, and it will begin the decline of Scottish prosperity. Neither of them are in the interests of Scotland.All that is only the start. Conflict with the Westminster parliament would be inevitable. And then the siren voices of the separatists will foment mischief and demand an independent Scotland cut adrift from the UK. These are not distant problems. These are Labour\u2019s plans for the first year of a Labour government. Mr. Chairman, opinion polls tell us the Scottish people are not fond of the Government at the moment. But I\u2019m fond of them and they are being deceived by Labour. Labour\u2019s plans are an immediate threat to Scotland and a threat to the United Kingdom. We will continue to look for ways to improve the Government of Scotland. That is our duty. But we will resist these damaging plans with all our strength. That too, is our duty, and the Conservative and Unionist Party will fulfil it.Law and OrderMr. Chairman, as I go round the country I talk to people about crime. What they want is to feel safe - at home and on the street. In the past two and a half years, recorded crime has fallen. Well and good. Now we must make sure that the fear of crime starts to fall, too.People want crime reduced and criminals caught and convicted. And so do I. So today, let me add to what Michael Howard told you yesterday. We\u2019re going to step up the fight against crime. To hit it harder and harder and harder. Organised crime is big business on an international scale. And at its centre is drugs. When I see the sheer evil of the drugs trade, I am devoid of sympathy for the men around the world who run it. They live lives of comfort, often of outward respectability, while they pour poison into the veins of millions. Today, no parent, however safe and prosperous their home, can be entirely easy in their mind that their children won\u2019t be offered drugs. And that is true in some of our market towns as well as our big cities. Two weeks ago, here in Blackpool, a 17 year-old died having taken drugs. That boy\u2019s whole future was snuffed out for profit. Let me tell you what we shall do.First, there can be no question of lifting our border controls. We are an island and we need them. Those controls are vital. They are not negotiable. And they are staying.Secondly, our tradition has always been to have local police forces. But local forces alone aren\u2019t equipped for this sort of crime. So for the first time ever, we\u2019re discussing with the police the establishment of a national squad. This will have one mission: to take on organised crime in this country and break it. The police will lead on this. They will have the support of the new National Criminal Intelligence Service, working with Customs, MI6 and GCHQ.But all our available skills are not yet involved in this battle. For many years, the Security Service has protected us against espionage and terrorism. But they can\u2019t help the police because it is illegal for them to do so. I think that\u2019s absurd. And in an age when our children are more likely to be killed by a drug dealer than by an enemy missile, I think it\u2019s indefensible. So this autumn, we will change the law. It\u2019s time to let the Security Service into the battle for the public and against organised crime.Day by day, we are making more use of modern science against crime.  We are already using Closed Circuit Television in public places across the country. This has been hugely successful. More cameras mean less crime. So, over the next three years, we will add 10,000 more cameras in town centres, shopping malls and public places in every part of the country. They will improve security for the shopkeeper and safety for the shoppers. But the most effective eyes are the policeman\u2019s eyes. I want to make every street safe.Since 1979, we have recruited an extra 16,000 policemen - 500 in the last year alone. That\u2019s helpful. But not enough. I want to send an unmistakeable message to every criminal that there are going to be still more police on the streets. So let us tell Chief Constables now so they can plan ahead. So, Chief Constables, begin to plan. Because in the overall arithmetic of this year\u2019s public expenditure settlement we have found the resources over the next three years to put not 500, but an extra 5,000 police officers on the beat. Mr. Chairman, I said we intended to intensify the fight against crime and - I mean it - the criminal.Mr. Chairman, after four terms, why a fifth? Because in a shifting world only we will build a safe future for our people and heal the scars of the past. Because we are building a more secure economy as the enterprise centre of Europe. Because we are reforming public service to make it more accountable to the public who pay for it. Because we stand for choice and excellence in education, and are in the midst of the biggest revolution since Rab Butler. Because we will retain the old rock-solid guarantee of the health service that care will be free at the point of delivery, and where improvement is necessary it won\u2019t be treated as a sacred cow. Because defence and security of the realm and the safety of our streets are paramount concerns of our Party.We Conservatives are: for the individual, not the state; for choice, not direction; for ownership, not dependence; for liberty, not control.These are the enduring things, the cornerstones of our beliefs. We have worked for them, cared for them, fought for them.PerorationWe are building the greatest success for this nation that we have known in our lifetime. We will not surrender them to a light-weight alternative. We carry the scars of battle, yes, but they\u2019re honourable scars. We know no other Party can win the battles for Britain that lie ahead. So when you go home refreshed and uplifted, I hope, by our Conference remember these things, and ask the people on the doorstep: Would taxes be higher or lower under Labour? Would inflation be higher or lower under Labour? Would there be more or less choice under Labour? Would our defence be more secure under Labour?You and I only have to ask the question to know the answer. We stand for a wise and kindly way of life that is rooted in our history. Our hopes for our country are not tired. Our ambitions are not dimmed. Our message to our fellow countrymen is clear. Millions have still to make up their minds. The choice is theirs. Our Nation\u2019s Future is at stake - and we stand ready to serve.

aVWorking for Election VictoryThis has been the week the Tory family came together - to renew the family contract with the British nation. Through the week, colleague after colleague has set out fresh, detailed, new policy for the future. There have been some marvellous speeches. It is been 21 years since Michael Heseltine first got a standing ovation at this conference; and no one has sat down since.The well-being of our country is more important than any political party. And the well-being of the Conservative Party is more important than any member of it. So the lesson is clear. Everyone in the Conservative Party should work - and if I know them, will work - heart and soul, irrespective of personal interests, to secure the re-election of a Conservative government.The Character of the Conservative PartyOver the last two or three years there has been attempt after attempt by our opponents to sully the reputation of our Party. I know this Party. No doubt it is not perfect - nor is everyone in it. But I grew up in it. And that campaign will not succeed, because this Party as a whole is straight and honourable and true and - like you I am proud to be a member of it.Unlike Labour, we are not ashamed of our past. Unlike Labour, we have not abandoned our principles. Unlike Labour, we have not had to reinvent ourselves. We are proud of what we have achieved, because we have changed Britain - for the better.When I became Prime Minister, I set out to make Britain a low inflation economy. I knew what a fight it would be. But we went for it. We took the flak - no weakening, heads down. We did what we always do when we are challenged: we came out fighting.As a result, we have had the longest run of low inflation this country has seen for a generation. I want to thank my colleagues - and you, my party - for standing with me through that battle. Between us, we have transformed the prospects for our country. And we did it with raw political gut.We set out to create jobs. And we are succeeding. Unemployment is lower here than in any comparable country in Europe. In Britain it is falling. In Europe it is not.Last year, this year, and next year we are set to have higher growth here, in our country, than any big country in Europe. Curiously enough, the Labour leader did not mention these successes in his flight of fancy last week. Pages missing, perhaps? He just said the country was falling apart. Inflation down, mortgages down, unemployment down - some fall.Of course there was a time when this country was falling apart. It was when we had a Labour Government. So I have got some friendly advice for Mr. Blair. If you knock your country, you will never lead it.The plain truth is, I am the first Prime Minister for generations who can say \u2018We are the most competitive economy in Europe.\u2019 And I intend to be the Prime Minister who builds on that success after we have won the next General Election.At that Election there is a central question. It is this: who can be trusted with the future? Labour try to persuade people it is them. \u2018We are different,\u2019 they say. \u2018We have changed our name. Rely on us - you know we have always been wrong in the past.\u2019 Well, that is candid - if a touch eccentric.The trouble is, they are wrong in the present as well. And it simply will not do for Mr. Blair to say: \u2018Look, I am not a Socialist anymore. Now can I be Prime Minister, please?\u2019 Sorry, Tony. Job\u2019s taken. And anyway, it is too big a task for your first real job.Mr. Blair\u2019s handlers are trying to spread the tale that he is a very fierce dog indeed, but also that he is quite harmless. Another eccentric message: \u2018Fierce dog - no teeth!\u2019By the way, have you noticed how the less a politician has to say, the more over-heated the language in which he says it? When every aim becomes \u2018a crusade\u2019; every hope \u2018a dream\u2019; every priority \u2018a passion\u2019- then it is time to duck for cover.And when the whole show is laced with words like \u2018tragedy\u2019, \u2018catastrophe\u2019, \u2018triumph\u2019 and \u2018destiny,\u2019 terms with real meaning, but which, ransacked for political advantage, degrade the message. Then I think of Ralph Waldo Emerson: \u2018the louder he talked of his honour, the faster we counted our spoons.\u2019Our BeliefsI came into politics to open doors, not shut them. They were opened for me. I was born in the war. My father was 66. My mother was - how shall I put it - surprised.We were like millions of others - not well off, but comfortable, until financially the roof fell in. Nothing special about that. But for us, it changed our life. My mother coped - as women do. I left school at 16, because an extra £5 a week mattered. I learnt something from that experience. In the game of life, we Tories should even up the rules; and give people opportunity and choice, to open up an avenue of hope in their lives.And by \u2018people\u2019 I do not mean \u2018some people\u2019. I mean everyone. Opportunity for all. It is in the bloodstream of our party. It was Shaftesbury who gave an education to thousands of children from poor homes; it was Disraeli who gave many working men the freedom to vote. It was Salisbury who brought free education within the reach of almost every family in England. All Tories. And it was Margaret Thatcher - another Tory, as you may know, who sold council houses and public industries, giving people a real stake in this country.Giving people opportunity marks the great divide in British politics. In its heart, Old Labour, New Labour, any old Labour still believe that government knows best. I do not. But then, I am a Conservative. I believe we should give families opportunity and choice and a wider, warmer view of life. Our belief in choice is the driving force of our policy it is not a political ploy; for me it is the core of what I believe in.EducationI start with education. There are millions of children in our country, all unique, everyone an original, with different skills, different talents, different needs. Should each child with all his or her originality be made to fit into a regimented education system? Or should we design an education system to fit the originality of the child? Well, of course we should.Our task is to provide a rich choice of schools and colleges, giving the best to every child and demanding the best of every child.Who should choose the right schools for those children? The Government? The bureaucrat in Whitehall? The councillor in the Town Hall? Or the parents, who love and care for those children? Of course it is the parents. Wherever possible, they should choose.We are improving that choice every year, and we intend to widen it further. So, I make this promise: If parents want more grant-maintained schools they shall have them; more specialist schools we will provide them; more selection they will have it. Why should government say \u2018no\u2019 if parents think it is right for their children? And if parents want grammar schools in every town, so do I - and they shall have them.We grammar school boys and girls - Gillian - believe in choice for parents. That means parents should not face a choice between one bad school and another. What kind of choice is that? I will tell you. It is the kind of choice you get in Islington unless you move out of the borough. We are going to change that. That is why this autumn, as Gill Shepherd told you, we will turn today\u2019s promises into tomorrow\u2019s reality with a flagship Education Bill.We want high standards in every school. It is why we set up the National Curriculum. It is why we insist on tests. Without tests, how can you know what a child has not learned? And how can parents be sure how well their children - or their school - are doing?When we insisted on giving that information to parents, John Prescott called it \u2018political propaganda.\u2019 Just pause and think about that for a moment - it tells you a lot. Information to parents about their children, and the Deputy Leader of New Labour calls it \u2018political propaganda.\u2019 If education is a passion for Labour, it is a passion that dare not speak its results.SportLast year, at this conference, I told you of my determination to restore sport, and particularly team sport, to the heart of school life.It is natural and healthy for young people at school to have their sporting heroes and heroines: sportsmen and women whom they can choose as role models. So, with the enthusiastic help of the Sports Councils, I am going to set up a team of Sporting Ambassadors widely drawn from the best role models in sports, our leading athletes, past and present, who will visit schools and talk to pupils, teaching staff, school governors and parents, to enthuse and inspire and encourage.To work up the scheme, I have asked that legendary England cricketer that man for all seasons, Sir Colin Cowdrey, to chair a small committee whose members will be drawn from the elite of the sporting and academic worlds. Colin is here today and I want you to thank him for agreeing to do this.His committee will announce their conclusions by Christmas, and I intend that the scheme will be up and running in schools in the coming academic year.Colin scored nearly 8,000 runs for England. Now he is going to inspire nearly 8 million boys and girls who might want to play compete and represent their country. I want them to enjoy sport. And they will enjoy it more if they play to win. Take it from me - winning is fun.The FamilyThere are those who believe in the self before everyone, grab what you can school of thought. They may find opportunity for all an odd philosophy. But it is ours. And for the last seventeen years we have followed it.We have cut direct tax, given more and more people the opportunity to save, to own shares, own pensions, own homes. More than ever before, we have given families more independence and more freedom to choose. As a result, millions have become owners of homes, savings, shares and pensions. But not enough yet.In our next five years, we will seek new opportunities - an opportunity-owning democracy. We will help more people save and build security for retirement. We will help people who need care keep more of those savings.We are aiming for the least possible tax to give the greatest possible choice. As we can afford it, we will move to a 20p basic rate for all. That is our priority. We know that cutting taxes is not government giving anything back to people. It is the government taking away less of people\u2019s own money. That is why low taxes are right.We do not want to soak the taxpayer. Labour often say they want to soak the rich. But they are the only party in history who also regularly manage to soak the poor.Sometimes no taxes are right. So, to encourage wealth creation for the future, we will reduce and then abolish Capital Gains Tax. Many people in our country build up savings long after they have enough for their own needs. One reason they do that is to pass on the fruits of their life\u2019s work to their children and grandchildren. This is a powerful human emotion. So, over time, our next target is to remove the burden of inheritance tax, building wealth for the many, not the few.WelfarePeople treasure independence, their own independence. The State is the last option, not the first. The more independence, the less reliance. The less reliance, the more we can help those in real need.There are many demands we must meet: health, as science provides more treatment; social services, as we improve care. We have always accepted this responsibility. But as we accept responsibility, so must people accept responsibility themselves.Dependency must be about needs, not culture. I cannot stand the welfare cheats. I will tell you why. They deprive those in real need. We are determined that taxpayers\u2019 money goes where it is needed.Our task is to build a welfare system for the 21st century: a system for a self-help society not a help-yourself society. And one way of building independence is to get more people back to work. We are now doing that on a scale that is the envy of Europe - partly because we refuse to make political gestures that cost jobs. That is why I say \u2018No\u2019 to the minimum wage and \u2018No\u2019 to the Social Chapter. The minimum wage is the wage of the dole queue. It is not a wage at all. How can you talk of a Social Chapter that makes it more difficult for people to find work. That is why I say they are no-go areas for jobs and no-go areas for us.It is business - not government - that creates jobs. But government can help the unemployed. Last year I announced our plans to develop a Contract for Work. This week we Tories took a big step forward with the start of our new Job Seeker\u2019s Allowance. We do not want to pay people to stay on the dole. We do want to help them get back into work. So first, we are going to help those who have been out of work the longest. They are the people for whom the barriers to opportunity are highest.First, we give them help to find a job, and if that does not succeed, they will be offered work on a community project. For many it is just the motivation they need. But it also shows up those who do not want to work. I think that is right. So, over the next year, we will be extending the scheme to towns and cities across the country. This is part of building a welfare system we can afford. One that goes with the grain of the British nation - fair to those in need, and fair to those who pay the bills.HealthEvery year, someone writes to The Times to say he has heard the first cuckoo of spring. And every year at the Labour Conference, some cuckoo distorts our commitment to the NHS.Our NHS is unique. In this country, when you are ill, we take your temperature. In other countries, they take your credit card. While I am in Downing Street, that will never happen here.That does not mean the National Health Service should not change. It must. If it were fossilised, it would decline. I saw that clearly the other day when Norma and I visited a doctor\u2019s surgery in Glossop, actually. The family doctor is the gateway to the Health Service. More people see their doctor than anyone else. This was a fund-holding practice, part of our reforms and, in its own small way, an example of the quiet revolution of the NHS. Waiting lists had been slashed. People no longer had to trek to the district hospital. More services were available: osteopathy, acupuncture, Alexander technique, counselling, nursing, physiotherapy and occupational therapy posts had been created; community care had been improved. More money was being spent on patients, not paperwork.This is Tory policy working for the patient. Now, this practice is one of the very best. But that excellent service could be the future everywhere. Our task is to make it so.This autumn, Stephen Dorrell will introduce a Bill to do just that, giving family doctors greater freedom to develop local services in their surgeries, creating a new generation of cottage hospitals all over Britain. But that is only half of it. In the autumn, Stephen will set out our ambitious plans to build the National Health Service for the 21st Century.And Labour\u2019s vision? Stuck in the past and stuck in the mud as usual. They plan to end fund-holding. What ideological madness. Do you know what that would mean? I learnt in Glossop. It would mean that those new clinical posts, new nurses, new physiotherapists, the new occupational therapist - all those would go. New Labour, no new services.But, in the NHS, we must always try to improve our services. Before the end of this year, we will unveil new plans to help mentally ill people, followed by new plans to reform social care for children, disabled people and the elderly. These will be more practical Tory measures.Looking a little further ahead, I still hear too many stories of politically correct absurdities that prevent children being adopted by loving couples who would give them a good home. If that is happening, we should stop it.For over seventeen years, through thick and thin, we Conservatives have found extra money for the NHS. It has become a habit. So today, I give you a Health Service Guarantee. Our Manifesto will pledge that the NHS will get more, over and above inflation, year, on year, on year, on year, on year, through the next Conservative Government.Law and OrderEarlier this week, Michael Howard set out our new plans to fight crime. But there is two things I would like to add.First, in a few weeks, we will publish new plans to deal with younger offenders. They are a real problem. We must spot school-age children turning to crime and stop them in their tracks early on. One theme of our plans will be to make them repair the hurt they have done. And we will have some new ideas.Let me tell you of our plans for young tearaways who are out of control. We only want them in institutions if it is really necessary. But if they do not deserve that punishment - severe for young people - they must not think they can offend and get away with it. Over the last year, we have been testing an electronic way of tagging offenders so we can confine them to their homes, and know that that curfew is being kept.It has worked. We think it will work on younger offenders as well, so we will try that too. If we know a young trouble-maker is out there, night after night, disturbing the peace and committing crimes, we will make sure the courts have the power to order him to stay put. At home off the streets. And the tag around his ankle that cannot be removed will raise the alert the moment he tries to go out.If he cannot go out on Friday and Saturday nights with his mates, it might cool him down a bit. If he cannot watch his football team on Saturday, let me say it plain. That is his fault; not mine, not yours - his. And it is time the buck stopped where the responsibility lies. No one will miss the hooligan on the terrace. He might just learn the lesson, and that will help him as well as us.Northern IrelandEarlier this week, the IRA once again spat their hate at the British nation. Many good people tell me I should not bother with Northern Ireland. \u2018No votes in it,\u2019 they say. Maybe not. But there are lives in it. And that is why I bother.I do not believe Northern Ireland will leave the United Kingdom, nor do I wish it to. But I know that there can only be a peace in Northern Ireland if all its citizens, Catholic and Protestant alike, feel their traditions have a welcome place in the United Kingdom. And there will only be peace of mind if we remove the causes that have given rise to so much conflict.This is a political task, grindingly hard, I know. But that is what the multi-party talks are for. Progress has been slow painfully slow. But progress has been made. And there is no other show in town.Bombs will not bring Sinn Fein into the talks. All they mean is that Sinn Fein has slammed the door on themselves.I applaud the way the Loyalists have maintained their ceasefire in the face of the IRA\u2019s provocation. Their political leaders have gained in influence and standing as a result. I urge them to stand firm and not to throw away what they have achieved.The IRA\u2019s latest betrayal of Northern Ireland means the demand for decommissioning of illegal arms is justified ever more clearly. We must have decommissioning in parallel with the talks. And so that there is no hiding place for those arms, missiles and explosives, Paddy Mayhew will introduce legislation into Parliament this autumn to set out how they can be taken out of circulation.I want those weapons off the street. And I want to remove the false excuses peddled by the men of violence for keeping their weapons. Let us expose these men to the world for what they are.I also want to make government in Northern Ireland more accountable and give MPs more responsibility. We have already given the Scottish and Welsh members greater ability to question Ministers. This autumn, I shall do the same for Northern Ireland. MPs from there should be able to question the Ministers and scrutinise Government policies directly in the Grand Committee, meeting sometimes in Northern Ireland. I will consult the parties about how best to achieve that.The IRA has always believed that Britain can be deflected by terrorism. They have always been wrong. And they are wrong now. No one will take Sinn Fein seriously ever again until they show a serious commitment to end violence for good. I believe in the politics of reason - backed by strong law enforcement. I know in the end it will prevail. And I promise the people of Northern Ireland this: for as long as there is a political breath in my body, I will fight for a secure way of life in Northern Ireland and for a settlement fair to all.Europe and the Wider WorldEarlier this week, Ian Lang, Malcolm Rifkind and Ken Clarke set out exciting new possibilities for Britain as a global trading nation with interests around the world.We have links and influence on every continent. We have given birth to a whole family of nations. I never forget that as I contemplate our future role in Europe.The sharpest element of the European debate is the possibility of a Single European Currency. We Conservatives are in grown-up politics. We know that where Britain\u2019s national interest is at stake, Britain\u2019s national voice must be heard. Over recent days, in articles, interviews and in this conference hall on Wednesday, I spelt out why we must play a full part in that debate.Europe is changing. The only thing that is certain is that it will not he the same in the future. In a few years, Europe will have twenty-six or twenty-seven members. They will be wildly different. Many of them will never match the economic performance of the larger European nations.How do we cope with this? We believe Europe must become more flexible and responsive. That the only realistic future is as a partnership of nations, not a United States of Europe.But some of our partners do see the future of Europe as ever-closer political as well as economic integration. We do not believe this is practical, nor, to be frank, desirable. It is not the Europe we joined and it is not a Europe we can accept.This debate about the future direction of Europe is one of the most critical we have ever engaged in. We need to argue it fiercely but fairly. Europe is at a watershed. Britain is a great nation. Of course, we must be in Europe. But we are in Europe to help shape it, not to be shaped by it.Our NationA buccaneering spirit, gritty resolve, give and take, a conviction that everyone is entitled to the same dignity, courtesy, and esteem because of what they are, not who they are - these are some of the values we all share. That is what makes us a nation. Down the centuries, they have moulded our democracy.It is not a concept of government copied across the world because it is the oldest. It is because it is the best. We treasure it. That is why we must hold on to it. The Union, Parliament, our voting system - it is naïve to think that radical change would be easy or risk-free. And it is revealing to look at Labour\u2019s plans. Their priority would be to gerrymander the British constitution.They are avid for more parliaments, more assemblies, more regional assemblies. Their policy is in chaos. On Scottish referenda, they change sides more often than a windscreen wiper. What a message. \u2018Vote Labour for more politicians, more bureaucrats, more taxes, more regulations, more tampering, more meddling, more authoritarianism.\u2019If this is the New Gospel, give me the old religion. In less than 1,000 days, Labour would vandalise nearly 1,000 years of British history.Once again, they show their true colours. Labour are the Party of the State. We are the Party of the Nation.

aVLife has changed a little since I last spoke to you at Bournemouth: changed for you and for me. Five months ago, we lost the election. Like you, I wish events had been kinder to us but - on this occasion - it was not to be. So, today, my first task is to thank the British nation for the trust they placed in Conservative governments over 18 years.This year they made a different choice and as democrats we respect their decision - but as politicians we must work to change it at the first available opportunity.It\u2019s no great secret how I feel about this Party. It\u2019s the Party I grew up with, that fashioned the chances I had in life, that is full of people who share my hopes and values. To everyone who works in our constituencies in good days and bad - I\u2019d like to say \u2018thank you.\u2019 \u2018Thank you\u2019 on behalf of our Party and \u2018thank you\u2019 for all the warmth and support you have always given to Norma and to me.On my first day as Prime Minister, I set out an ambition to build a \u2018nation at ease with itself.\u2019As I look around today, at the growing confidence of our Nation, at the glittering economic prospects, at the rising growth, the strong trading position, the low inflation, the falling unemployment, the low interest rates, the strong pound, the increasing number of young people in higher education, the rising level of savings and record personal well-being, then I sometimes wonder if we did not build better than we knew.  If there is a New Britain, we built it.So when the Government boasts about the economy - it\u2019s our economy. When they boast of falling unemployment - it\u2019s our fall in unemployment.And - now I think about it - isn\u2019t it odd.  Those unemployment figures John Prescott said were \u2018fiddled\u2019 are now a triumph for New Labour as they march to the New Jerusalem. Or - as it\u2019s probably now called - the People\u2019s new, New Jerusalem.Our election defeat was not your defeat. Perhaps it was mine. Perhaps divided views - expressed without restraint - in the Parliamentary Party made our positions impossible. Perhaps it was the weariness of 18 years in government. Perhaps the democratic instinct of our Nation simply sensed it was time for a change. Probably it was some of all of these things.Rather than brood over it, we must accept our defeat as gracefully as we can; we should not waste time in pointless recrimination; we should work in the towns and the cities and the villages and begin to build for the future and the next Conservative Government.BallotA few moments ago, we heard that you have endorsed William Hague\u2019s election as Leader and the need for reform of the Party by a massive majority in a far larger vote than anyone expected.William is right.  We need reform - but we don\u2019t need to re-write every policy. Or change our name. Or deny our past. Or betray the philosophy that built us up. But neither can we leave things as they are.It\u2019s a simple choice: reform the Party, back William Hague, re-discover the art of working together, fight every seat for every vote - or fight one another and lose elections.I know my choice. I\u2019m backing William. I\u2019m backing him because he\u2019s an able man of talent and integrity with a tough job ahead.It\u2019s difficult being the leader of a newly defeated Party. For a while, people won\u2019t wish to listen to what we have to say.  But that will pass. The tide will turn and - as the local election results are already suggesting - perhaps more speedily than anyone imagines.  If anyone is fearful of our future, they should have heard Jane and Munish a few moments ago, for that is the future of the Conservative Party.In the meantime, we must use the time wisely. Party reform - yes. But we must also look at the things we left undone or uncompleted. Education reforms; market reforms; how to make better health care available; a fresh look at reviving local government - a big job there; more welfare reform; the people being left behind as prosperity grows.We now have the luxury of time to think anew - and we should use it to build up policies that the broad mass of the British people will know are right - and feel comfortable with.I propose to give William Hague the unqualified support - in public and in private - that he has a right to expect from his predecessor. If I should disagree with William, I\u2019ll do it in private, not on College Green, not on the media, not in anonymous briefings to the Press that breed suspicion and distrust. And I\u2019m backing reform because never again must we be constitutionally powerless to deal with people whose behaviour is damaging the Party as a whole.The Prime Minister said last week this was \u2018the giving age.\u2019 Well, he should know. Because we\u2019ve given him a glowing inheritance.  Not just the economy - excellent though it is. We gave him the route map to the settlement in Northern Ireland that I long to see. We gave him the \u2018opt out\u2019 from a single currency that - now the information is to hand - he should use without delay and say: \u2018the economic case is not yet right: we will not be joining in 1999.\u2019 And we gave him a lottery that - even after they\u2019ve raided it - is still helping charities, schools, village clubs, arts and sport at local level on a truly massive scale.It\u2019s good to give. And we should remind people what we gave.I\u2019m confident about our future: ignore the pessimists - we can beat Labour.  Never forget, their swollen majority is made up from far, far fewer votes than we polled in 1992.  Our history might have been different if our votes had delivered Labour\u2019s sort of majority in 1992.As I end, I\u2019d like to say something else about the Party.  Remember what we are. Remember that our Party has served its country in government more often and longer and better than any democratic party in the whole history of western politics.As we\u2019ve seen, even such a party can be beaten at the polls. But the Conservative family can only be defeated from within.At the end of this week, there\u2019s one strong message that I long to hear from this Conference:We are the Conservative Party.We exist to serve a nation that is Conservative by instinct.We will be back.

aVThey said we\u2019d be disheartened. But they hadn\u2019t reckoned with the heart, spirit and resilience of the people who\u2019ve travelled to Bournemouth this week. They said we\u2019d run out of ideas. But they hadn\u2019t bargained for our lively debates on health, education and the constitution which have shown our readiness to start the new thinking for the future. They said we\u2019d lost our vitality. You tell Ann Widdecombe we\u2019ve lost our vitality. On second thoughts, you\u2019d better not.They said there\u2019d be no surprises. Ted and Margaret came on to the platform for our debate on Europe and found instant agreement: they both hated those chairs. I\u2019ll be totally candid with you: it hasn\u2019t all been plain sailing since the election. I never expected it would be after such a heavy defeat. We\u2019ve made real, substantial progress this last year. But I have never once pretended to you that the road ahead for our Party was anything but long and difficult. One of our successful council candidates summed it up the other week when she said to me: \u2018the old hostility to us on the doorsteps has gone but we\u2019ve still got to create the enthusiasm in its place.\u2019 And she was right. We\u2019ve changed our Party to make it the most open and democratic in Britain, and I want to pay tribute to the tireless work of Cecil Parkinson in seeing those reforms through. But now the best and most lasting thanks which we can all give to Cecil is to bring thousands more new members into our reformed Party.We\u2019ve set out with clarity and certainty enduring values which guide us, but now we must get on with communicating those values to the British people. You know the best thing about my job? Wednesdays, 3 p.m. Prime Minister\u2019s Questions. The most disappointing thing about my job? Prime Minister\u2019s answers. One of our new MPs did a study of Prime Minister\u2019s Questions. In the last year the Prime Minister has been plain wrong 44 times; failed to answer the question another 44 times; and on seven occasions said he\u2019d write a letter because he hadn\u2019t got a clue. 95 times in a year. That\u2019s twice a week he doesn\u2019t answer the question, and he only turns up once a week.What a shameful example of the contempt which this Government has for our Parliament and to the millions of voters who elected representatives to hold the Prime Minister to account. We\u2019re winning the battle in Parliament. But now we\u2019ve got to take that battle out to the country. There will be four steps to victory. None of them easy, but all of them within our reach. We\u2019ve already taken the first step. In this May\u2019s elections in London and around the rest of the country we gained 250 seats.The next step is next May\u2019s local elections. This time we will win council seats and take control of councils. And we\u2019re going to win them from Labour and Liberal councillors who have betrayed their local communities with high taxes, poor services, and gross mismanagement.The third step will be in Scotland and Wales. We are not going to leave the battleground to nationalist parties who want to destroy our country and a Labour Party which has played into their hands. We are going to invest the time and the energy and the resources to make sure the Conservative voice is heard in Edinburgh and Cardiff. We are a Party of the whole United Kingdom.The fourth step will be the European Elections. We\u2019re going to elect Conservative MEPs who will stand up for the Europe we believe in and for our country, instead of Liberal and Labour MEPs who would sell our interests short. You have chosen our outstanding candidates for the European Parliament. From their Chairman, Edward McMillan-Scott, to new young candidates like Teresa Villiers and Andrew Reid, who you have heard from this week. We owe it to all our candidates to get behind them next June.But before we even come to these elections, there is another battle we must win. Later this month we will have the report from the so-called independent commission on electoral reform, The Jenkins Commission. It\u2019s a rigged commission; it will be a rigged report. It is going to propose a plan to gerrymander our voting system and take away from the British people their basic democratic power to choose their government. And when that report comes out, I expect every member of this Party, every Member of Parliament - and I mean every Member - and every candidate in every election, to fight it with all the energy and determination they can muster. If you want to know what is at stake, just look at New Zealand. They abandoned our system in favour of PR. It took them two months to form a government. And they ended up with two parties who swore they would never work with each other. In other words, the one government that not a single voter had wanted.So we are going to make common cause with people in other parties, with businesses, with trade unions and pressure groups, and we are going to fight in favour of a system which has served Britain well against the worst possible concoction of voting methods cobbled together over too many bottles of claret. Mind you, recent rumours suggest that the Prime Minister doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s going to do on PR. The rumours have upset some people. I spotted this letter in a newspaper last week, \u2018Dear Agony Aunt, I\u2019ve been involved with a married man called Tony for 18 months now. He said personal relationships, or PR as I call it, were high on his life\u2019s agenda; although, looking back, he always winked at his friends when he said it. But recently he hasn\u2019t written, he hasn\u2019t called. No flowers. No chocolates. He goes off to the seaside without me and he\u2019s been horrible about me in front of all his friends. Now I\u2019m terribly confused not a new experience for me - and I wonder if I should trust this man? Are we really going to have a relationship, or were my friends right all along? Yours, Heartbroken of Yeovil.\u2019 The Agony Aunt replies, again in complete confidence. \u2018Dear Paddy, I\u2019m sorry to have to tell you that you\u2019ve been taken in by this man. But take heart. You\u2019re not alone. Many others have been taken in too. Paddy, it\u2019s time to go away and get a life. You\u2019ll be much happier hanging out with little groups of chums, just like you\u2019ve always done. Yours, Agony Aunt.\u2019Now all that means we have a lot of battles to fight. And to win those battles we have to get three things clear. One, we must be clear about what it is to be a Conservative. Two, we need to be clear why we are different from a Labour Government that is using our language but reversing our most successful policies. Three, we have to be clear about the things we are going to stand for in the future. That is what this speech is about. Through the long, proud history of the Conservative Party runs a golden thread. That thread stretches out through the decades, linking each one of us to the great men and women who have led this Party. It is that we are a Party which draws its inspiration from the character of the British people; it is that we cherish the precious traditions and freedoms of our island home; it is that we found our programme on the experiences of the people, not the abstract theories of purists and ideologues.When Pitt and Wilberforce pleaded with the House of Commons to abolish slavery, it is because Tories love justice and freedom as the British people love justice and freedom. When Disraeli told the crowds gathered in Manchester\u2019s Free Trade Hall that constitutional stability is the only parent of personal liberty and political right, it is because Conservatives value tradition and continuity as the British people value tradition and continuity. When Salisbury and Joe Chamberlain came together to advance the Empire and defend the Union, it is because Conservatives are unionists as the British people are unionists. When Winston Churchill led this country in war rather than submit to the will of tyrants, it is because Conservatives show resolve and courage as the British people show resolve and courage. And when this country was laid low with a failing economy, held hostage by union barons, and we turned that economy into one of the most dynamic and successful in the world, it is because Conservatives like Margaret Thatcher possess enterprise and determination as the British people possess enterprise and determination. And then there is Northern Ireland. When we welcomed David Trimble to this Conference and wished him well with his daunting responsibilities, it is because Conservatives like John Major are dedicated to peace and democracy as the British people are dedicated to peace and democracy.Our character is the character of the people. Our beliefs: the beliefs of the people. Our purpose: the defence, the advancement, the elevation of the people. Our history is that of a Party that trusts the people. It is a strange paradox that this instinctive quality of Conservatives, this belief in the value of experience over theory, this feeling of confidence in being British has been our most potent weapon in the battle of ideas. Look at the battles of the last 20 years. We fought the ideas of state control and intervention with a British belief in enterprise and freedom. And we won. We fought the defeatism over trades union power with a British optimism and refusal to be defeated. And we won. We fought the economics of the madhouse with British common sense. And we won. We fought the pacifists and the unilateral disarmers with a British sense of our world responsibilities. And no thanks to you, Tony Blair or Gordon Brown or Margaret Beckett or Jack Straw or Robin Cook - we won that battle too.When I hear Tony Blair talk of these achievements I realise that he respects them, that he fears them, that he would like to take credit for them. But that he doesn\u2019t understand them. He thinks we won just by publishing pamphlets, so he publishes his own. He thinks we won just by holding seminars, so he holds his own. He thinks we were ideologues, so he tries to invent his own ideology, the Third Way. It is true that without the academics and the think tanks, the Conservative Party\u2019s common sense revolution would not have been all that it was. But without an instinctive understanding of the character of the British people, it would not have happened at all.Our way is not the first way or the second way or the third way - it is the only way for us. It is the British way.There are those commentators and politicians who do not like it when I say that the Conservative Party is going to listen. The message of our history is that unless we listen, we cannot hope to lead. It is my profoundest belief that if the Conservative Party is not in touch with the identity and values of the British people, then it cannot be authentically Conservative. What are the opponents of listening afraid of? We have nothing to be afraid of, for when we listen to Britain, we are listening to the defenders of liberty and freedom. When we listen to Britain, we are listening to the friends of tradition and continuity. When we listen to Britain, we are listening to the upholders of moral and social responsibility. When we listen to Britain, we are listening to those who every day show the strength of their compassion and responsibility to others. When we listen to Britain, we are listening to patriots, to true internationalists, to a vigorous, courageous and independent people. I know that when we listen to the people of Britain, we have nothing to be afraid of.The Conservative Party has always been able to rely on the British people. Now we must make sure that the British people can once again rely on the Conservative Party. For Britain needs the Conservative Party today, needs it now, more than ever. For instead of a Government following the British Way, we have a Government searching for the Third Way.Tony Blair knows he is in favour of the Third Way, if only he could work out what it is. I hope he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a new idea. In the 1930s an ambitious politician abandoned Old Labour and formed what he called the New Party. He used the term \u2018the third way\u2019 to describe what he said was his position \u2018in the centre of politics.\u2019 His name? Oswald Mosley. Not a happy precedent. In the Cold War, President Nasser and Marshal Tito found a way to avoid taking sides and being everyone\u2019s friend. What did they call their approach? The Third Way. And 800 years ago St Thomas Aquinas came up with an original name for his philosophy: the Third Way. He described it in terms New Labour would have felt quite comfortable with. \u2018It is, he said, \u2018A thing that need not be, once was not, and if everything need not be, once upon a time there was nothing.\u2019 The thinking of Tony Blair in the language of John Prescott.For New Labour, the Third Way means having it every way. You can be in favour of freer markets and more government intervention. You can talk about personal responsibility and pursue nanny state policies that erode personal responsibility. You can say you support the family and then demolish the last recognition of marriage from the tax system. You can call for trade union powers to be curbed and steadily extend the power trade unions have. You can promise to devolve power and run the most centralising, authoritarian government. You can say you love the pound and do everything possible to abolish it at the earliest opportunity.Handy thing, this Third Way, isn\u2019t it? Tony Blair answers the charge that he believes in nothing by saying that, on the contrary, he believes in everything. I say that to believe in nothing and to believe in everything is exactly the same thing. That\u2019s why, before the election, it was a good idea to ban tobacco sponsorship, and after the election it was not a good idea to ban it for Formula One. That\u2019s why, before the election, they said they wouldn\u2019t interfere with PEPs and TESSAs, and after the election they interfered with PEPs and TESSAs. That\u2019s why, before the election, they said they wouldn\u2019t introduce tuition fees, and after the election they introduced tuition fees. That\u2019s why, before the election, they said that hospital waiting lists would go down, and after the election hospital waiting lists went up. That\u2019s why, before the election, they said they\u2019d control public spending, and after the election they lost control of public spending. That\u2019s why, before the election, they said they wouldn\u2019t raise taxes, and after the election they raised taxes seventeen times. That\u2019s why, before the election, they said they would deal with young offenders more quickly, and after the election they deal with young offenders more slowly. That\u2019s why, before the election, they said they\u2019d be an open government, and went on about high standards, and, after the election they treat Parliament and the public with arrogance, secrecy, cronyism and contempt. That\u2019s why, before the election, they went on about offshore trusts, and after the election appointed as Minister for off-shore trusts a man with off-shore trusts who influences his off-shore trusts. That\u2019s why, before the election, they said they\u2019d be a People\u2019s Government and talked about the People\u2019s this and the People\u2019s that, as if we were all going to China, when all we\u2019ve seen since the election is overpaid advisers, overseas junkets and over-promoted cronies all paid for by the People\u2019s money.That\u2019s what happens when you believe in everything and believe in nothing. It would be funny if we weren\u2019t talking about people\u2019s jobs and people\u2019s prosperity and people\u2019s freedom. At the election Labour boasted that things could only get better. Now they talk about hard choices because they know things can only get worse. It is not their fault if there is a downturn in the world economy; but it is their fault if they pursue policies that mean those problems are going to be hitting Britain harder. One job lost every ten minutes while this Government presides over our economy. And the search is on for somebody else to blame: the managers, the workers, the investors, the Russians, the Malaysians. The only thing Labour Ministers are certain about is that they\u2019re not to blame. Nothing to do with them. Forget the high interest rates, high pound, loose public spending, extra employment laws, new union powers and damaging European regulations. Nothing whatsoever to do with them.In July, Gordon Brown announced his spending spree and his forecasts for the economy. We all knew those forecasts were wrong. Most economists knew they were wrong. Francis Maude told the Chancellor they were wrong. I asked Tony Blair at Prime Minister\u2019s Questions whether he accepted that the forecasts were wrong. \u2018No,\u2019 he said with supreme complacency. See what I mean about those answers - 96 now and still counting. This week we discover they are completely wrong. Grim, but wholly predictable news for families and businesses throughout the country. So don\u2019t tell me there\u2019s no difference between the two Parties on economic policy. There is every difference.What we have seen in the last year-and-a-half amounts to a major reversal of the economic policy of the last Government. We are close to a jobs crisis in this country. Agriculture is already in recession, British farming faces its worst crisis for more than half a century, yet Labour Ministers have closed their ears to the countryside. We shall never forget that the food we eat and the landscape we enjoy depend on a thriving rural economy. We shall speak up, as we always have, for British agriculture and the British farmer. Manufacturing industry is on the brink of recession. Foreign investment is draining out of the country. No amount of scripted sympathy and mock concern from the Government is going to lessen the impact on families around Britain this winter. At a time of great difficulty for businesses and jobs, this Government plans extra burdens, extra regulations and extra costs. This is exactly the wrong policy at exactly the wrong time.What we need is action. First, the Government should announce a moratorium on any measures likely to increase business costs. That doesn\u2019t just mean statutory union recognition and the minimum wage, it means getting to grips with their family tax credit plan with all its extra bureaucracy. Second, they should urgently rethink the New Deal. Help should not be concentrated on those people likely to find work anyway but on areas and people worst hit by big job losses. Third, the Chancellor should make an emergency statement as soon as the Commons returns. Since he\u2019s been reckless enough to announce his spending without knowing his revenue, he must immediately come to the Commons to tell us how he is going to reconcile the two. Interest rates have come down today by a quarter of a percent, and that\u2019s welcome. But rates will stay higher and do so longer than necessary because of Labour\u2019s mistakes on tax, spending and regulation. I don\u2019t blame Eddie George, but I do blame Gordon Brown. And without such a Jobs Crisis Package, the Government will be responsible for yet more lost jobs and factory closures.It won\u2019t be enough to produce another gimmick. This Government is very good at gimmicks. Take the Millennium Computer Bug, a huge potential problem for every business in the country. The Prime Minister\u2019s answer? A great fanfare. Bright lights. Flash backdrop. Packed press conference. 20,000 specially trained \u2018bug busters.\u2019 Super bug busters. Doesn\u2019t it sound good? How\u2019s he getting on? Six months closer to the Millennium and he\u2019s appointed 26 of them. New Labour says it\u2019s preparing Britain for the new Millennium and they\u2019re not even ready for the first day of it.What about Welfare Reform? One of the most important issues facing our country. Remember how Harriet Harman was going to sort it out? Remember Harriet Harman? Remember the Welfare Roadshows that were going to travel round the country, persuading everyone of the need to make urgent reforms to the welfare state? What happened to those roadshows? Did one come down your way? Hands up anyone who\u2019s actually seen one. The roadshows never got beyond Lambeth Bridge. You\u2019re more likely to have seen Elvis shopping in a local supermarket than caught sight of one of Labour\u2019s roadshows. And with the roadshows went any serious commitment by this Government to cut welfare bills, reduce dependency and reform our welfare state.The short ministerial career of Frank Field is a parable of New Labour. For a whole year, the Prime Minister traded on the reputation of the only man of principle in his Government; and when that man had the courage to resign rather than sell out his principles, the whole House of Commons sat and listened to his resignation speech \u2013 everyone, that is, except Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, who went creeping and crawling out of the Chamber. That was when we really needed a bug buster. That is what happens when you believe in everything and you believe in nothing.But if you want to believe in everything and to believe in nothing, you need to find some allies with experience. Enter the Liberals. For too long our Party has ignored the Liberals at a local level. We\u2019re not going to ignore them anymore. We\u2019re going to attack Liberal councils which are failing their local communities with high tax bills, poor services and wasted money. We\u2019ve always said voting Liberal is a wasted vote. And as anyone who lives under a Liberal Council will tell you, a vote for the Liberals is never so wasted as when the Liberals win. New Labour and the Liberals: the Third Way and the Third Rate. Our way is the British Way.The British Way is about smaller Government and bigger citizens. I was 16 years old when I first addressed a Conservative Party Conference. I sometimes think I\u2019ll be 116 years old before people stop reminding me of it. When I was 16 I had all that hair, but now I\u2019ve lost some of it. I had a rather nice jacket with wide lapels, and I\u2019ve lost that too. Thanks, Ffion. And I also had an abiding belief in freedom, and that\u2019s something I\u2019ll never, ever lose. While I may be as embarrassed as anybody is when looking at an old photo, I can always be proud of what I believed in. If I was Tony Blair and someone had a picture of me as a grown man wearing a CND badge and calling for unilateral nuclear disarmament, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever show my face in public again. I spoke of my belief in freedom when I was just 16, because a belief in freedom is in the bones of British people. We bridle against interference, bureaucracy and petty rules. We value our personal freedom and each one of us talks of the sanctity of our home as if it were the finest castle. We demand that power is always limited, law always restrained, authority always checked. It is because of these instincts that Conservatives want, in Chris Patten\u2019s striking phrase, \u2018smaller Government and bigger citizens.\u2019New Labour is making Government both bigger and bossier. Few decisions have been more ludicrous than banning beef on the bone. Since Labour took office it is now possible to go into a restaurant and be told that the starter has been banned, the main course is under investigation and the cheese has been impounded by Department of Health officials. In this Government we see all the instincts of the nanny state. Don\u2019t eat beef, don\u2019t drink, don\u2019t stay up late, don\u2019t drive, and if you do have to drive don\u2019t park. I thought this was supposed to be a free country.All this nonsense provides us with a great opportunity. We have always been seen as the Party of economic liberty. In the face of this Government\u2019s attitudes we must make sure we are seen as the Party of personal liberty too. For the British Way is to keep Government in its proper place - as the servant, not the master. It is to keep taxes as low as possible, keep regulation to a minimum, make sure Government minds its own business so that people can get on with minding their own. That\u2019s why the Conservative way is the British way. The British Way is also about safeguarding the independent institutions which alone nurture freedom and responsibility.We are more than a nation of shopkeepers. We are also a nation of volunteers, of hobbyists, of sports fans, of churchgoers, of carers, of hundreds of thousands of charities and associations and societies. We Conservatives draw on a long and rich tradition of voluntary work and public service. Now we are going to be the champions of the local school, champions of the local hospital, champions of the voluntary group and of the charity. We must show that we have listened to Britain and that we are the people who can be trusted best with our public services. We have a lot of work to do - on health. The NHS doesn\u2019t belong to the Labour Party, it belongs to the people of Britain. We are proud of what our Party has done to look after the NHS in fifty years. But let\u2019s be honest. One of the reasons we lost the General Election is that people thought the Conservative Party didn\u2019t care about the NHS. We cannot allow this damaging attack to go unanswered.The NHS is part of the British Way. Free at the point of use, it belongs to rich and poor alike. But to say that we are true friends of the NHS is not enough. We have got to help this country engage in a mature debate about the NHS. The Labour Party, with its simplistic rhetoric and dishonest promises and cruelly raised expectations, is already letting people down. And that gives us another great opportunity. Of course there are real challenges. Medical technology advancing at a staggering pace. New treatments and new medicines emerging every month. And we will be straight with the British people. We shall certainly stand for generous public funding. But we will also stand for a future in which the people at the frontline of health care have the freedom to take their own decisions. A future when local GPs and local hospitals are embedded in strong local communities. A future where the Berlin Wall between the public and private sectors is torn down.A Conservative future for the NHS. So let\u2019s go and fight for it. We\u2019ve got a lot of work to do on education. I was lucky enough to go to WathupomDeame Comprehensive, where dedicated teachers opened the door to a world of opportunities for me. I want to open the same door to the thousands of young people who are still denied the good teaching and high standards which ought to be their birthright in a civilised society. We made a start in Government.But in his excellent speech on Wednesday, David Willetts got it right. In the post-war era, all politicians, including Conservatives, came to believe that we could put everything right by adding more and more regulations into a system planned from Whitehall. It must be clear by now that in education, as in anything else, this simply will not work. New Labour hasn\u2019t understood this. All they offer is more and more central control over what teachers teach, over how they teach, over the way schools are run, over the amount of homework that is set. They even seem to know when every child in the country should go to bed. Here\u2019s another opportunity for us. For we must develop policies which set all our teachers free. Policies which give power back to parents. Policies which give all children the high standards of teaching they deserve. Labour\u2019s going to be the Party of political control. We\u2019re going to be the Party of school freedom.Labour\u2019s going to fail on public services. They are going to let down the massive expectations they have aroused. And we are going to grasp the opportunity this gives us. We are going to be the true Party of public services. For the British Way is not uniformity. Not state monopoly. Not central control and direction. No, the British Way is about the creativity that comes from independence, it is about the diversity that comes from freedom, it is about the efficiency that comes from choice.That\u2019s why the Conservative way is the British Way. The British Way is to be on the side of people who try to do the right thing. People who save, who work hard, who try to be independent of the state, who obey the law and pay their taxes, people who are good citizens and who find that the system is not on their side. They\u2019re the kind of people I grew up with in Rotherham. They\u2019re hard-working families whose parents go out and try their best to find jobs because they don\u2019t want to accept hand-outs from the benefits office; hard-working families in which children are taught to respect values like self-discipline, honesty, self-reliance, good manners and respect for other people. They don\u2019t want to see the Labour Government abandoning welfare reform, increasing dependency, making it more expensive to work and putting up welfare bills by £40 billion in the next three years alone. They want to see people who do the right thing rewarded and not undermined. And they look to our Party to support them. We must come forward with real welfare reform - welfare reform that ends the culture of dependency that pervades too many of our inner cities; welfare reform that encourages families to stay together and doesn\u2019t discriminate against marriage; welfare reform that helps people off benefit and into real jobs. Strong and stable family life is the cornerstone of a healthy society, and let me make clear to you today that we shall develop policies on welfare reform, which strengthen family responsibility and support for the institution of marriage.And it\u2019s not just the hard-working family who doesn\u2019t get the support they deserve. It\u2019s the honest citizen, like the many I meet in my constituency surgeries who see a crime and do the right thing by reporting it, and who are then treated appallingly by the criminal justice system. They hear nothing for months; then they are summoned to court to give evidence only to find the case is adjourned; finally, they get to court and are told to wait around for hours in the same room as the person they are giving evidence against. And all because they did the right thing. My constituents and honest citizens like them don\u2019t want to see a Labour Government presiding over longer and longer court delays. They look to our Party to support them and to make sure the courts make a distinction between who\u2019s on trial and who isn\u2019t.And then there\u2019s the small businessman, like my father before he retired, who works long hours to build up a profitable business and, instead of getting encouragement from Government for doing the right thing, finds he spends his life as an unofficial tax collector, filling in VAT forms and complying with an endless stream of regulation and red tape. He looks to the Conservative Party to set him free, to let him get on with doing the right thing and creating wealth and jobs for our society. These people who do the right thing rarely get the support they deserve from any Government. That makes them angry, and it makes me angry too.But what makes them feel not just angry but resentful is when they see people who do the wrong thing put on pedestals and rewarded. What kind of society are we living in when we see terrorist murderers getting thousands of pounds compensation from taxpayers because their cells were searched by prison officers uncovering their plan to escape? It sickens me to read again and again about someone defending their own property who ends up being charged when the criminal gets away scot-free. It offends against a very deep British instinct. The sense of fair play.I want the Conservative Party to be the Party of fairness. The Party which understands that when British people speak of fairness, they are speaking of something which is a million miles away from the so-called fairness of envious egalitarians and bureaucratic busybodies. I want the Conservative Party to be the Party that stands up for people who do the right thing. I want the Conservative Party to be the Party which rewards honesty, decency and diligence. I want the Conservative Party to be the Party which can distinguish between right and wrong. That is the British Way. And the Conservative way is the British Way.The British way is about understanding that freedom and democracy can only exist if they are protected by a constitution which upholds the rule of law, which holds Government accountable to the people and which maintains the integrity of the United Kingdom. Those are the principles in which the British people believe, which Labour\u2019s policies threaten and which the Conservative Party will fight to defend. It is difficult to overestimate the incoherence and confusion of Labour\u2019s constitutional plans. They have now introduced so many voting systems that if you were born in Scotland, live in Wales, work in London and want to vote in the European elections, you need Peter Lilley\u2019s brain to work out how to do it. But this Party has to understand that it will not be enough for us simply to campaign against change. Let me make it clear. We will not become an English Nationalist Party. We are a Party of the United Kingdom.We are not going to be English nationalists, but we are going to see that the voters of England are fairly represented. I do not believe that the people of Bournemouth will long accept that Scottish MPs should vote to decide on health, or schools in Bournemouth, when their MPs have no say over such matters in Banff & Buchan. For the first time we will have to become the advocates of major constitutional change. It may be a change in the voting rights of Scottish MPs, it may be an English Parliament in some form. Labour have undermined the stability of the United Kingdom. We have to restore its balance. And we\u2019re going to stop Labour turning the House of Lords into a giant quango. We\u2019re not opposed to change in principle. But would it really be better to replace a Chamber partly chosen by the Almighty with a Chamber entirely chosen by the Prime Minister? I can still tell the difference. We are happy to consider the merits of changes to the Upper House alongside the merits of the existing system.But we\u2019re not going to go along with changes that would leave Parliament weaker, the Government of the day more powerful, the House of Lords neutered and legislation rubber-stamped by Tony\u2019s cronies. The British Way is to take pride in our traditions, to value stability, to resist ill-thought-through and unnecessary change. But it is also the British Way to do what has to be done to preserve democracy and ensure that Government is accountable to the people. That\u2019s why the Conservative way is the British Way. The British Way is to take pride in our nation\u2019s history and in the achievements of the British people through the centuries. But the best traditions of this country look to the world beyond our shores not with suspicion or resentment, but with a buccaneering spirit of enterprise, self-confidence and adventure.So our national interests, our security, our trade mean that we can never be indifferent to, or aloof from, what happens in the rest of the world. Britain faces a massive challenge across the globe. We must maintain in good repair our relations with the United States. Our armed forces may soon be involved in action in Kosovo. We face volatile opinions about Britain in our traditional friends in the Middle East and elsewhere. These are important issues and whatever we do, we must not look inwards to Britain; we must look outwards to the wider world. Europe is part of that world. And British people know that our geography and history mean that the interests of the United Kingdom are intertwined with those of the other nations of Europe.Twice this century, in the trenches of the Somme, on the beaches of Normandy, our young soldiers sacrificed their lives to defend the freedom of our country and to liberate Europe from tyranny. I pay tribute to that generation of politicians, Ted Heath\u2019s generation, who worked tirelessly to heal a divided continent, who built NATO and the European Union, and who did so in order to spare my generation the destruction and slaughter which they had experienced. But half a century on, Europe has changed. The vision of a closely integrated federal Europe, which inspired good and honourable men in the aftermath of war, does not meet the needs of our continent today.We have a great opportunity. Our policy on the single currency is settled. Now that policy must become part of a positive and distinctively Conservative agenda for Europe, an agenda for a new generation. We need to reduce the shamefully high levels of unemployment in the EU by freeing Europe\u2019s businesses from red tape and social costs. We need to create a true common market and work for free trade with the wider world. We need to strengthen the new democracies of Central and Eastern Europe by welcoming them as full members of the European Union. For you do not measure European unity by the height of the barriers raised against the rest of the world. You do not build a sense of common purpose by taking power away from national parliaments. You do not build a Europe for a new generation by giving power to remote and unaccountable institutions in Brussels or Frankfurt.The British Way is to be in Europe, but not run by Europe. That\u2019s why the Conservative way is the British Way. In each generation, the left of this country regroups. It leaves behind its old errors and disastrous programmes and adopts new ones. Different each time, but each time an attempt to make Britain something that it isn\u2019t, to make Britain somewhere else. And so in each generation, the Conservative Party faces a new challenge: How to safeguard and advance the basic character, values and institutions of our country in the face of yet another new left. The challenge has rarely been more difficult than it is this time. But I think it has never been so important. For New Labour threatens so much that is important in this country. It threatens our freedom, our democracy, our prosperity, our independence. It has persuaded so many people who love these things to let down their guard and to stand by while this assault on the character of our country goes on.Well, we\u2019re not going to stand idly by. We\u2019re going to fight for the British Way. We are going to change our Party. We are going to listen to Britain. We are going to make sure that we are in touch with the basic instincts of the British people. We are going to be in touch with a Britain that values its freedom and is beginning to resent the way that New Labour is becoming bossier by the day. We are going to be in touch with a Britain that wants decent public services and is beginning to realise that New Labour\u2019s way will not work. We are going to be in touch with a Britain that has a deep sense of fair play and will quickly realise that Labour do not understand it. We are going to be in touch with a Britain that values its stability and democracy and will be horrified when it realises how New Labour has undermined them. We are going to be in touch with a Britain that wants to be in Europe but not run by Europe.The time has come for us to do what the British people expect us to do, and take on this Government. The time has come for us to take off the gloves and punch our weight. The time has come for us to be all that we know we can be. The Conservative Party has shaped British politics for the whole of the twentieth century and you have given me the privilege of leading us into the twenty first century. Be assured we have no intention of being satisfied with reading that history. We have every intention of continuing to write it. Together that is what we shall do.

aVIn March, our Spring Party Conference met in Reading. Today, the unclaimed cars in Reading Station car park are painful testimony to the loss and distress we all feel in the wake of the awful Paddington tragedy. None of us can fully understand the grief and pain of the families of the victims; but as we watch the terrible scenes from the crash site, each one of us remembers the last journey we made by train, for many of us only days ago, and we shudder at how fragile life can be. We need to find out what went so disastrously wrong. And we need to find out fast. We welcome the swift decision to hold an inquiry. But the inquiry itself must be swift too. It must not drag on for years and years, or lose its way in bureaucratic procedure. We need clear answers and long-term solutions. On this we will give the Government every support as it carries out its work. And we salute, as we have done so often in similar circumstances, the courage and professionalism of our police and emergency services, and we praise the staff of the hospitals who continue to care for the injured. The national grief following this disaster will be intense and lasting.In every family, we know that even in the midst of tragedy we have to look to the future. This week we have looked to the future with new confidence. For here in Blackpool we have had the best Conservative Conference for years. The best Conference because we\u2019ve heard brilliant speeches from the new fresh talent of an outstanding Shadow Cabinet and frontbench. The best Conference because I think we\u2019ve all been struck by how many younger members have sparkled here this week. The best Conference because everyone who saw our parade of new councillors and MPs knows that this Party is back winning elections again.We\u2019ve launched our Common Sense Revolution. We\u2019ve set out our five Common Sense Guarantees. I can announce today that we are adding a sixth guarantee The Blackpool Guarantee. We\u2019re coming back to Blackpool every other year. Long after the Labour Party has become too snobbish to go almost anywhere in the country, we\u2019re coming back to Blackpool. I\u2019ve enjoyed this Conference tremendously because of your enthusiasm and because, as ever, I\u2019ve had the terrific support and companionship of my wife, Ffion.The whole Conference has been a great contrast to what we saw last week. I sympathise with the Prescotts. Last week they took the car because of what the seaside air did to their hair. I don\u2019t blame them. Look what it did to mine. I don\u2019t mind. As someone said to me last month in Wigan: \u2018Don\u2019t worry Mr Hague. It\u2019s not what\u2019s on your head that counts. It\u2019s what in your head.\u2019The Labour Party Conference in Bournemouth was all about staying in power however they can and distorting the past. Our Conference has been about serving the people and preparing for the future. What annoys me most about today\u2019s Labour politicians is not their beliefs - they\u2019re entitled to those - but their sheer, unadulterated hypocrisy. They say one thing and they do another. They send their children to schools they want to abolish for others. They are driven in cars 250 yards to give speeches telling other people not to drive their own. They tell other people not to have second homes when they\u2019ve got three themselves. They make their lip-trembling proclamation that the class war is over while the very same day they boo 14-year-old girls because they come from a private school.We\u2019re having a Common Sense Revolution, so let\u2019s have some common sense language about Labour: it\u2019s high time this bunch of hypocrites stopped preaching to others what they don\u2019t practice themselves. Last year Tony Blair promised a Year of Delivery. If only he\u2019d told us to expect a year of hollow rhetoric, empty gestures and meaningless slogans, for once he\u2019d have told the truth. Now we must offer the people of this country not just an alternative to the arrogance and complacency and hypocrisy of New Labour, but our own fresh ideas.Conservative Governments achieved so much. But there\u2019s so much more to be done. For as a country we\u2019re spending millions more on our schools and hospitals, and they don\u2019t seem to be getting any better. We\u2019re paying more and more tax, but no one can understand where the money\u2019s all going to. We hear endless stories of new anti-crime initiatives, yet crime is going up. We have more and more politicians, and they are trusted less and less. Let\u2019s get it clear: Vast regional bureaucracies and European political superstructures are not the solution. They are the problem. As I travel around our country to schools and factories and high streets, I listen to a common sense so far removed from how people think in Whitehall that it\u2019s no wonder people have lost faith in politics.But this common sense has for too long been ignored. People don\u2019t want to be told that what they know to be right, can\u2019t work. The people of this country want and deserve straight talk. The people of this country want a government that turns their common sense solutions into government policy. When I sit in the House of Commons and hear Labour Ministers talking about this or that new piece of regulation, I think to myself: it\u2019s time they listened to the small businessman I met in Nottingham last month, who said to me: \u2018At this rate, we are going to have one man working in this country and 55 million checking up on him.\u2019 Britain needs a Common Sense Revolution.When minor operations are carried out to meet political targets while people die waiting for their heart bypass, Britain needs a Common Sense Revolution. When local councils spend more money looking after bogus asylum seekers than after old people in homes, Britain needs a Common Sense Revolution. When twelve-year-old girls are giving birth while the last recognition of marriage in the tax system is being abolished, Britain needs a Common Sense Revolution. When a householder who uses reasonable force against a burglar ends up in court while the burglar goes free, Britain needs a Common Sense Revolution. When terrorist murderers go free in their hundreds without surrendering one ounce of Semtex or a single gun, Britain needs a Common Sense Revolution.When the best schools in the country face abolition simply because they are the best, when 2,000 new regulations on business are passed in two years, when we import food of a quality we would not permit to be produced at home, when the Territorial Army is decimated while our Armed Forces are stretched to the limit, when more layers of government are added to an over-governed society, when we have a Prime Minster who is trying abolish our currency and end our independence as a country, we all know Britain needs a Common Sense Revolution. And when the Government of Britain is the most two-faced, interfering, over-regulating, bossy, intolerant, arrogant and crony-run in our history, there is no doubt Britain needs a Common Sense Revolution.Before the election, Tony Blair claimed to be so admiring of Conservative success. He implied he would be like Margaret Thatcher. He pledged to be against higher taxes; to be tough on crime; to think the unthinkable on welfare; to fight for Britain\u2019s interests in Europe. This was their great deception. This was the Great Labour Lie. When Tony Blair told the country he\u2019d \u2018no plans to increase tax at all,\u2019 was he telling the truth? Well, was he? Or when he wrote to anxious parents \u2018A Labour Government will not close your grammar schools. That is my personal guarantee,\u2019 was he telling the truth? When Tony Blair wrote in the Sun newspaper before the election about \u2018my love for the Pound\u2019 and how he felt so emotional about the Queen\u2019s head on a £10 note, was he telling the truth? When can you be absolutely, 100 per cent, cast-iron sure that a Labour promise is going to be broken? The moment Tony Blair puts it in his own handwriting. If he was Pinocchio, he\u2019d have a nose bigger than Concorde.Sometimes you have to laugh at it. To the Evening Standard he is the city slicker; to Country Life, he is the rural boy at heart. And my favourite. According to Labour\u2019s own magazine, \u2018Tony\u2019s favourite food is fish and chips. He gets a takeaway from his local chippie whenever he is at home in his constituency\u2019; but when The Islington Cook Book asked him the same question, he said his favourite food was \u2018fresh fettuccini garnished with an exotic sauce of olive oil, sun-dried tomatoes and capers.\u2019 I read in the papers the other day: Downing Street sources confirm Tony Blair thinks he\u2019s \u2018a Napoleon Bonaparte figure\u2019 who\u2019s taken \u2018near-total control of the levers of political power.\u2019 Well maybe it\u2019s not a bad comparison. Napoleon thought he was Emperor; he tried to submerge Britain in a single European state; and he obviously wanted to abolish the pound; he even invaded Tuscany several summers in a row. He thought he was invincible, but he was finished off by a plain-speaking Conservative who went on to become Prime Minister.How do we defeat the Great Labour Lie? By fighting a campaign based on common sense, clear convictions and a united Party. We know because we fought such a campaign in the European Elections four months ago and won the biggest swing to the Opposition in any election since 1918. The lowest Labour share of the vote since Michael Foot. And wasn\u2019t the Prime Minister\u2019s reaction to defeat so revealing? Did he listen for one single second to the message from the voters? No. Not for one second. He came out and called us extremists - as if wanting to keep control of our your own currency is extreme. He said we were fanatics, as if it\u2019s fanatical to speak up for the great majority of British people who want to be in Europe not run by Europe.The people I meet in the cities and towns and villages of our country have a straightforward desire to live in an independent country with their own currency. I\u2019ve got news for Tony Blair. These people are not extreme. They\u2019re not fanatics. They\u2019ve got more sense in their gut instincts than in all the collective wisdom of this Government and their fellow travellers. Now our task is to speak up with the same common sense and clarity and conviction on all the other great issues facing our country.Some people won\u2019t like it. Our friends in the Guardian newspaper describe the Common Sense Revolution as \u2018bristling with extreme ideas ranging through tougher welfare rules, tougher prison sentences, less state administration and lower taxes.\u2019 If newspapers regard tougher welfare rules, tougher prison sentences, less administration and lower taxes as \u2018extreme,\u2019 then it\u2019s not just the Government that needs a Common Sense Revolution.It is time to make the case for that revolution. So let us begin. Let\u2019s have a Common Sense Revolution for pensioners like Barbara Fitzjohn. 78 years old. Proud of her country. Lives alone in a one-bedroom flat in Hall Green, Birmingham. Scared to leave her home after dark. Terrified because she saw somebody get mugged and no one stopped to help. Muggings, car thefts, graffiti, drug-taking and burglary. They\u2019re so common that no one feels completely safe anymore. Labour said they\u2019d be tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime. Their first sound-bite. Now we know it was the beginning of the Great Labour Lie. Crime is up. Prisoners are released early. Police numbers go down as Labour rhetoric goes up.I say keep criminals in prison longer; make sure the sentence served in prison is the sentence given in court; lock away with life sentences drug dealers who sell to children; make every prisoner do a full working day; help our police get out from behind their desks and onto our streets; stop turning a blind eye to the graffiti and vandalism and truancy - go to war on crime like no government has ever dared before. In the next Conservative Government, when Ann Widdecombe is Home Secretary, I want every criminal in the land to look like Labour Ministers do when she gets up to speak - absolutely scared witless.These are my instincts. They are the instincts of the people of this country. They\u2019ve been ignored for too long. It\u2019s common sense. Making it happen would be a revolution. You and I are going to make it happen. Let\u2019s have a Common Sense Revolution for responsible people like Barbara Evans. 89 years old. Lives in a residential care home in Vauxhall. Through her life set aside money for her retirement. Now everything she\u2019s saved could disappear in residential care bills.Labour said they\u2019d do something and they\u2019ve done nothing. Another part of the Great Labour Lie. Labour\u2019s idea of a savings policy is to grease up to Geoffrey Robinson, get him to buy you a half-a-million pound house, sell it for three quarters of a million, keep the change. Easy. Everything Labour has done, from their pensions tax to abolishing PEPs and TESSAs to discriminating against savings in income tax, makes it harder for people to save.I say it\u2019s time the government stopped fleecing people who put aside money for the future. I say it\u2019s time to help people who help themselves by cutting the starting rate of tax on savings in half and protecting people who\u2019ve saved for their long term care, so that we don\u2019t let another generation have their home and assets eaten up. It\u2019s common sense. Making it happen would be a revolution. You and I are going to make it happen. Let\u2019s have a Common Sense Revolution for farmers like John Harrison. Works every day of the year including Christmas day. Made just £5,000 last year with a wife and family to support. Driven to despair by a Labour Britain where the thing that grows fastest is red tape. Labour claimed to be the friend of farming. But it\u2019s just another instalment of the Great Labour Lie.I say stop importing food that does not meet the animal welfare and hygiene standards which we expect here at home. Insist food on the shelves labelled British is actually grown in Britain. And make a bonfire of rules and regulations - starting with the totally pointless ban on beef-on-bone.And while we\u2019re at it, let\u2019s force every Whitehall Department to cut its red tape. And let\u2019s cut the size of Whitehall itself. Since Labour took office the cost of paying \u2018political advisers\u2019 has risen by £2 million, the cost of all elected representatives in the country by £120 million, the cost of running Government departments by one thousand million pounds. That\u2019s the cost of over 40,000 teachers\u2019 salaries or a third of a million hip operations.I make you this promise: I\u2019ll reduce the size of the Cabinet, cut the number of ministers, reduce the size of the House of Commons, campaign for a European Parliament of 100 fewer members, halve the number of political advisers to ministers and abolish all of Labour\u2019s regional agencies and assemblies. And, what\u2019s more, I\u2019m going to enjoy it. Now that would be a Common Sense Revolution.Let\u2019s have a Common Sense Revolution for people like Jim Macabe. Grandfather. Husband. NHS patient. Told to wait nearly a year just to see a consultant. So desperate he\u2019s going to spend his hard-earned savings on going private. Wouldn\u2019t it make sense if patients like Jim Macabe got treated on the basis of medical need instead of political priorities set by Government Ministers fiddling the figures?We offer a Patient\u2019s Guarantee. Every NHS patient with an urgent condition will be guaranteed a waiting time based on their need for treatment. If the NHS can\u2019t do it in time, the state will pay for a private operation. That means far shorter waiting times for life-saving operations like heart bypasses. They won\u2019t take their place at the back of the queue. It\u2019s just common sense. It\u2019s been welcomed by the medical profession. Making it happen would be a revolution. You and I are going to make it happenLet\u2019s have a Common Sense Revolution for the Begbie family. Their eleven-year-old daughter Heather was excelling at school on an Assisted Place. Before the election Tony Blair wrote promising she\u2019d \u2018continue to receive support until the end of her education.\u2019 This year he broke that promise and Heather now faces leaving her school. It\u2019s clear now that when Tony Blair wrote to people like Heather Begbie saying he was committed to excellence in education, it was all part of the Great Labour Lie. They seem to think that destroying the best schools somehow improves education for everybody.Well I say you don\u2019t improve schools with difficulties by suppressing the work of outstanding schools; you cannot raise the average by destroying the best. \u2018The class war is over,\u2019 says Tony Blair. Tell that to thousands of vindictive, mean-spirited, class-obsessed Labour Party activists who at this moment are trying to destroy the best state schools in the country and are doing so at the behest of the Labour Leadership.Each year as Secretary of State for Wales, I looked at the exam results of every school in Wales. If any school showed a dramatic improvement, I asked what had changed at that school since the year before. The answer was always the same - the head teacher. All my experience is that standards in a classroom don\u2019t go up because of Whitehall diktats; they go up because of the actions of parents and governors and head teachers.We offer parents and children a revolution in our state education. We\u2019re going to turn every state-run school in the country into a Free School. We\u2019re going to give head teachers and governors the complete freedom to run their own schools, manage their own budget, employ the best teachers and set their pay, and control their own admissions policy. And we\u2019re going to give every parent this Parent\u2019s Guarantee: if you don\u2019t think your child\u2019s free school meets minimum standards, and enough of your fellow parents agree, then you can sack the whole school management. That\u2019s real parent power; that\u2019s the way to drive up standards. We will give schools the power to discipline they need, and we\u2019re going to deal with truants with this simple rule: any school pupil on the streets during school hours without written permission will be stopped by the police and sent back to school where they belong. It\u2019s common sense.Education does not end at school or even at university. It goes on through our lives. We\u2019re going to help working women who take a career break to look after their children, by cutting away the barriers that make it difficult for them to get a job again We will set up Family Scholarships that will give these mothers the professional training and refresher courses they need to get back to work. Free Schools. Real power to teachers and head teachers. A Parent\u2019s Guarantee. Tough Discipline. Higher standards. It\u2019s common sense. Making it happen would be a revolution. You and I are going to make it happen.Let\u2019s have a Common Sense Revolution for millions of hard-working families in this country who pay too much tax. All Labour Governments raise taxes. It\u2019s just that this Labour Government is sneakier and stealthier about it. They tax your savings, your house, your petrol, your pension, your marriage and your mortgage. All those taxes followed by last week\u2019s speech. They passed round the collection plate even before the sermon. It\u2019s time we had much more open and honest and transparent tax system.So our Tax Guarantee is this: the next Conservative Government will bring down the total of all taxes taken together as a share of the nation\u2019s income. They\u2019ll be no place to hide tax increases. They\u2019ll be no stealth taxes. Guaranteed. And as we cut tax, the people we will to try to help will include the people who save and who give to charity; the people who aren\u2019t rich but who, like thousands of teachers and policemen, find themselves paying the top rate of income tax; the people who want to have the freedom to use the car which they\u2019ve earned and saved for. And we will introduce an explicit recognition of marriage back into the tax and benefit system.But we all know that the only way the nation can afford to do this, and to invest in education and healthcare, is by real reform of the welfare state. Labour promised to be truly radical on welfare. Tony Blair vowed to cut social security spending as a proportion of the nation\u2019s income. But that was the greatest part of the Great Labour Lie. Social security bills have soared. Dependency has increased. Despondency has set in. We\u2019re going to liberate people from the culture of welfare dependency with a Common Sense Revolution. It\u2019s time to insist that those who can work, must work.I guarantee taxpayers that any unemployed person who can work, and who is offered a job, either takes that job or loses their unemployment benefits. We have to create a culture in this country where if you can work, you do work. We\u2019re going to transform our Jobcentres so that they get paid by results. I say Jobcentres are not there to pay people benefits for doing nothing. They are there to get people into work. Our Common Sense Revolution is straightforward good sense.We will match our military capability and our military commitments, and we will restore the role of our Territorial Army. We will save our road hauliers by forcing foreign lorries who use our roads to pay a levy, and then use that money to cut road tax. They do it in Denmark and Holland. I shall do it in Britain too. We will require two-thirds of all new development to be built on brown-field sites so that we rejuvenate our towns and cities, not bulldoze over our countryside. We will protect our fishermen and conserve our fish stocks by returning British fishing waters to local or national control. We champion all these people and their causes because our Party has always been at its best when it champions the instincts of the British people. When, in Randolph Churchill\u2019s famous phrase, we trust the people.In Bournemouth last week Tony Blair declared war on the forces of Conservatism. I am proud of the forces of Conservatism. I am proud of what they have achieved this century. Winston Churchill and the British people, hand in hand, as we stood alone and saved the people of Europe from tyranny. Rab Butler and the British people, hand in hand, as we extended free education and brought opportunity to millions of children. Harold Macmillan and the British people, hand in hand, as we brought prosperity to the cold grey post-war era. Margaret Thatcher and John Major and the British people, hand in hand, as we fought union power, and won the cold war, and restored the dignity and freedom of this nation.It is the forces of Conservatism which, in a dangerous century beset by socialism, communism and national socialism, have left our country at the end of that century free and proud and strong. The Conservative Party and the British people, hand in hand, that\u2019s how we\u2019ll build our Common Sense Revolution. Hand in hand against the patronising elite who think its small-minded to believe in our country, and the chattering classes who think it\u2019s intolerant to be tough on law and order, and the progressive intellectuals who think that caring is spending other people\u2019s money. And in the 1980s, it was the forces of Conservatism which stood up to the unions and defended our country while Tony Blair was voting against every trade union law and campaigning for unilateral nuclear disarmament.What a speech that was last week in Bournemouth. The speech of a politician for whom the truth has ceased to matter. I do not know which is more worrying. That our Prime Minister actually believes that Conservatives caused the assassination of Martin Luther King, or that he is prepared to read out whatever offensive rubbish is put in front of him. But it wasn\u2019t the insults to past and present Conservative voters that was most extraordinary about that speech. It was what that speech revealed about who the Prime Minister really is.At times, listening to Tony Blair was like listening to a recording of Conservative slogans from the last twenty years: \u2018Set the people free\u2019 - a long-familiar Tory message. So \u2018set the people free,\u2019 says Tony Blair last week. \u2018Opportunity for all\u2019 the theme of our Conference a few years ago. So \u2018opportunity for all\u2019 cries Tony Blair a few years later. \u2018One Nation\u2019 perhaps the most famous Conservative phrase ever. Tony Blair\u2019s favourite phrase? \u2018One Nation.\u2019 You wait. Soon he\u2019ll tell us all his policies are common sense. A common sense revolution.If all we had needed to govern the country was someone who repeated everything we\u2019d said before, we could have bought a parrot. For this man\u2019s whole political approach has been to parrot the language of Conservatives; to pretend that he understood what Margaret Thatcher had achieved and why Michael Foot and Neil Kinnock were so wrong. This is the Great Labour Lie.Last week Tony Blair showed that he has never understood the real achievements of Conservative Governments. He knows the slogans, but he doesn\u2019t have a clue what they mean. A Prime Minster who has the brass neck to stand before his Party Conference vowing to set the people free while at the same time centralising power, increasing taxes and undermining personal responsibility, can only be the perpetrator of the Great Labour Lie himself. He even claimed that \u2018the establishment\u2019 was holding the country back. He\u2019s a forty-something, public school educated, barrister from Islington, with a two hundred seat majority in the House of Commons. Who does he think is the establishment? The man is a fraud.Anyone who so misunderstands or so wilfully distorts who we are as a people or where we come from as a nation cannot possibly know where we should go to next as a people and as a nation. For this was the speech of a man who is embarrassed about where he came from, and the country he lives in, and the century he was born in and the Party he leads. Most of all it was the speech of a man who is embarrassed by the opinions of the people who elected him. Embarrassed by their patriotism and their fierce independence and their pride in Britain. He thinks patriotism is uncool and independence is out of date and pride is undignified. He wants to take on the forces of Conservatism.The forces of Conservatism that trust the common sense instincts of the people of Britain rather than ignore them. The forces of Conservatism that speak for all those who believe we should build on the traditions and institutions and success of our country rather than destroy them. The forces of Conservatism that will be keeping our nation free and proud and independent long after he and his cronies are written off by history as people without principle, purpose, belief or conviction. For when I spoke to you in this hall two years ago, I said that New Labour would bring first fascination, then admiration, then disillusionment and finally contempt. At that stage the admiration was running high; now the disillusionment is beginning; and mark my words, they are not so far away from contempt.And so once again it is the Conservative Party that is hand in hand with the British people as we start a new century. For we believe in our country. We believe in a free and independent nation. We believe in the United Kingdom. We believe in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. We hope and pray for real and permanent peace in Northern Ireland. We continue to support the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. We give credit to the Government for continuing the painstaking work so bravely commenced by John Major. But I renew my warning, made many times this year, that eighteen months after that Agreement, the apparatus of terror is still intact, the violence continues, and not one gun or bomb has been dismantled or given up. I say that until that changes, no more terrorist murderers should be released from jail.The Leader of the Liberal Party, Charles Kennedy, says that I\u2019m irresponsible for saying this. He thinks opposition politicians shouldn\u2019t speak out on these vital matters. I say that when murderers are being released onto our streets in direct contravention of the assurances given to the people of Northern Ireland and the Agreement itself, it is the absolute duty of the Leader of the Opposition to raise his voice in protest. God save us from the spineless crawling to the Government of Liberal politicians. We believe in the strength of the Union and our four nations in one nation. That means making the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly work. But it also means that voters of England must be properly represented in the British constitution.I say that issues that only affect England should be voted on only by English MPs. We cannot go on for ever with a situation where the MPs for Lancashire cannot vote on anything happening in Glasgow, but the MPs for Glasgow can vote on everything happening here in Lancashire. So central to our Common Sense Revolution will be this: English votes on English laws.And we believe in the independence of Britain. For a crucial moment has arrived. A battle of ideas has commenced over the value of nation in the modem world. Tony Blair has joined this battle on the side of those who have no use for the independence of nation. But the forces of Conservatism will stand where they have always stood. We will stand for the nation. For Conservatives believe in nation. Conservatives believe in nation because nations allow democracy founded on a common political culture, and Conservatives believe in democracy. Conservatives believe in nation because nations allow justice and fairness to be defended as part of a shared moral understanding, and Conservatives believe in justice and fairness. Conservatives believe in nation because nations depend on tradition and protect tradition, and Conservatives believe in the value of tradition.When Conservatives defend nation, we are accused of defending everything that is small and narrow and petty in life. I believe that, on the contrary, when Conservatives defend nation we are defending so much that is great and large and generous in life. So Conservatives believe in nation and we will defend nation. Now we must join battle to defeat new, pervasive, foolish ideas which threaten our country. There is the foolish idea that the nation cannot survive in the modem world. I think the people who advance this idea are simply wrong about the future. I look around me and I see the coming age of the small unit and the individual on the internet, an age when young people are just as ready to jump on a plane to Thailand as to Greece, or send emails to California as quickly as they send them to Calais.To young people the idea of spending the next generation building a centralised political state in Western Europe is an idea left behind by history. This is the age of the small and flexible nation state seizing worldwide opportunities. And there is the foolish idea that a single European state is inevitable and that we will miss out on great opportunities if we don\u2019t go along with it. Above all else, Conservatives will resist this miserable defeatist creed. For if we can resist it then Britain will be ideally placed to seize the opportunities of the modern world. We are the lucky inheritors of a country with unique advantages in the world: a unique relationship with Europe, unique relationships too with America and with the Commonwealth. We have the huge advantages of our language, of our open and democratic traditions, of our political stability and our history of trade and diplomacy across the globe. We have the finest armed forces in the world, deployed all over the globe.As the world economy becomes more intensely competitive, as businesses have to adapt more quickly to shifts in trade, the growth of e-commerce and the rise of new markets, it must make sense for we, the British, to widen, extend and capitalise on our advantages rather than give them away. It must make sense not to adopt the rules and regulations of other countries, but to get rid of more of our own. It must make sense not to adopt the high-taxes of our neighbours, but to widen the gap between our taxes and theirs. It must make sense not to turn Europe into a fortress against the future, but to build a Europe that reaches out to Eastern Europe and the rest of the world. It must make sense not to turn our back on the continent, but to exploit the opportunities of Britain\u2019s membership of the European Union and the Single Market. But it must also make sense not to drive for ever closer political union, but to create a flexible and open European Union of nation states. When we\u2019re in government, the next new EU Treaty must contain a flexibility clause, or else I tell you there will be no new Treaty. It must make sense to be in Europe, not run by Europe. And it must make sense, too, not to feel guilty about having a national currency, but to use to the full the freedom that comes from having our own.That is why it is so important at the next election to elect a Government committed to keeping the pound, and that is our Sterling Guarantee. The Liberals want to scrap the pound as soon as possible. Tony Blair wants to scrap it too, if he ever has the courage to say so. I intend to go on saying the pure unadulterated truth: I say the economic case for the Euro on its performance is utterly unconvincing; I say the implications of the Euro for our right to govern ourselves could be immense; I say the advantages for us of keeping the pound could be enormous. I say we are the fifth largest economy in the world and we can make a success of our own currency if we wish to do so. And I say to the people of Britain that the only way to save the Pound is to vote Conservative at the next election.Yes, a battle of ideas has commenced over the value of nation in the modem world. This Party will not be found wanting. This country has such great strengths. Our traditions. Our institutions. Our values. The instincts of our people. The Conservative Party trusts in these things and we will protect these things. We always have and we always will. That\u2019s what our Common Sense Revolution is all about.That\u2019s why I got involved in politics in the first place. I just want people at least to be able to do the basic things in life. To keep more of what they earn and save; to be left in peace to get on with their lives; to be able to drive their car they worked so hard to get without being despised or penalised; to be protected from theft and violence; to expect decent services in return for all that money they pay in tax; to be allowed to live in a free and independent nation. These things don\u2019t seem to me to be too much to ask. Yet in every generation there come those who think they\u2019ve got a better idea, who think Government is better at spending money than those who earned it, and better at managing public services than those who work in them and use them, and better at determining the future of this country than those who live in it. That\u2019s why we need the Common Sense Revolution.This week we have only just begun. We will have to be prepared for boldness and imagination as great as anything that this Party has shown before. Don\u2019t tell me that it\u2019s difficult, because I know that; or that it has risks, because that is inevitable; or that it will be controversial, because I relish it. Let us instead hold up our heads and say: these are our beliefs. This is where we stand. This is our Common Sense Revolution.And so I say to the people of Britain: if you believe that our country is unique in the world but is in danger of losing its identity; if you believe that Britain is a place where you should be rewarded for doing the right thing, hut now you are penalised for it; if you believe in Britain as a healthy democracy, but that the standards of democracy are now being tarnished and diminished; if you believe in Britain as a country where the law is enforced and respected, but that now it is not respected enough; if you believe in Britain as a country that will work with its neighbours but never submit to being governed by anyone else; if you believe in an independent Britain, then come with me, and I will give you back your country.

aVThis has been the best, the most upbeat and the most successful Conservative Conference in years.  This week the people of Britain look to us to see if we are ready to be a Government.  And with the policies we have presented and the purpose we have demonstrated, we have shown beyond doubt that we are ready for Government.  This week the people of Britain look to us to see if we have the right team to run the country.  And with brilliant platform speeches we have shown beyond doubt that this Shadow Cabinet, with its breadth of vision and its depth of talent, is the best team for Britain.The breadth of vision to help hard working families; and depth of talent too.  Didn\u2019t Michael Portillo make a fantastic speech and show what a brilliant Chancellor of the Exchequer he\u2019ll be?  The breadth of vision to preserve our independence in a flexible Europe; and the depth of talent.  After years of Robin Cook, wouldn\u2019t it be great to have a real Foreign Secretary like Francis Maude?  The breadth of vision to rejuvenate our inner cities, set our schools free, help our pensioners and improve the NHS; and the depth of talent with people like Michael Ancram, Archie Norman, Theresa May, David Willetts and Dr. Liam Fox ready to take up the challenge of government.  The breadth of vision to win the war against crime, and the depth of talent that would give us a great crime-fighting Home Secretary in Ann Widdecombe. Our Conference has looked like a Conference for the future.  Labour\u2019s looked like a Conference from the past.  After all the years of trying to control the trade unions, it was back to beer and sandwiches in Brighton last week.  Tony Blair likes beer and sandwiches without the beer.  I like it without the sandwiches.  Come to think of it, I like it without the unions.And throughout this week, we have shown the British people beyond doubt that we can win the next general election.  Thanks to the Deputy Prime Minister, we now know when that election is planned to be.  Last week that political titan was asked a trick question: has Labour\u2019s disastrous performance changed your plans for an election in six months\u2019 time? John Prescott innocently replied: \u2018no it hasn\u2019t.\u2019  But even without John Prescott helping us out, we\u2019re ready for that election whenever Tony Blair now dares to call it.  We\u2019re ready for it next autumn, we\u2019re ready for it next May, we\u2019re ready for it now.  Go on Tony, call it now.We all remember the armchair critics who told us after the last election that we could not recover.  Don\u2019t even bother, they said, for we have entered a new world in which Tony Blair can do no wrong and New Labour will rule forever.  But New Labour was not a philosophy, it was a fashion.  And nothing is more unfashionable than a fashion that\u2019s out of fashion. We saw them last week, divided, arrogant and out of touch.  What a bunch they are \u2013 this soap opera of a government.  In last week\u2019s episode of the Neighbours from Hell: Robin has fallen out with Peter.  Peter won\u2019t talk to Geoffrey any more.  Geoffrey won\u2019t lend his holiday home to Tony.  Mo has been sent to Coventry.  Clare doesn\u2019t like the tent run by Tony\u2019s crony.  Tony\u2019s crony blames Chris and Peter. Tony rows with Gordon.  Peter won\u2019t speak to Gordon.  And Gordon won\u2019t speak to anyone at all.Last week in Brighton the security was so tight it was Wednesday before they stabbed each other in the back.No Ministers in recent times have lost touch so rapidly with the people who elected them.When an angry pensioner sent a cheque for 75p to Gordon Brown, he cashed it.When Baroness Jay was asked if she understood the desperate crisis in farming, she said she knew all about it because she \u2018had a little cottage in the country.\u2019Cocooned in Whitehall they have retreated into a world where they never have to make do with a failing school, or witness a crime, or pay for a tank of petrol.It is fundamental to their decline that they have betrayed and forgotten the real people of this country.  And it is fundamental to our recovery that we have become the champions of the common sense instincts of the people of our country.And it is you, the people of this country, who do wait for hospital treatment, and do see crime on your street, and do pay for your tank of petrol, that I have in my mind as we fight the next election - it\u2019s you that I\u2019m in it for.For all the people who can\u2019t afford to pay more in tax to a Government that squanders their money \u2013 I\u2019m in it for you.For all the people who want classrooms where teachers can apply reasonable discipline to children without fear of ending up in court \u2013 I\u2019m in it for you.For all the people who despair at the neglect and poverty and waste of human talent in our inner cities and want to do something about it \u2013 I\u2019m in it for you.For all the people who think it\u2019s a scandal when a patient\u2019s throat cancer operation is cancelled four times because of political targets \u2013 I\u2019m in it for you. For all the people who think that the law should be on the side of the house-owner and not the house-breaker \u2013 I\u2019m in it for you.For all the people who can see that our asylum system is in chaos and want political leaders with the courage to get up and say so \u2013 I\u2019m in it for you.For all the people who believe that we shouldn\u2019t be handing over more of the rights and powers of this country \u2013 I\u2019m in it for you.For all the people who want to keep the Pound \u2013 I\u2019m in it for you.For all the people who are sick of the spin and the waste and the lies and the cronies and the sycophants, sick of the arrogance and the high-handedness, sick of the contempt for our traditions and for our Parliament, sick of a Chancellor too out of touch to listen and of a Prime Minister too arrogant to apologise, for all those people \u2013 we are all in it for you.For all the people who really hoped that they had elected a Government that would deliver on its promises and have been so bitterly disappointed \u2013 we are in it for you.These are people who look to us to give them back their country.  And we will not let them down.When Tony Blair declared war on the forces of Conservatism, he declared war on all these people.  Last year, in his Conference speech, he said defeating the forces of Conservatism was his great mission for the twenty first century.  Last week, nine months into the twenty-first century, he didn\u2019t mention the forces of Conservatism at all.We really do have a Prime Minister who is prepared to say whatever will please his audience without the slightest consistent thought or principle entering his head.But just because he\u2019s stopped talking about the forces of Conservatism, it hasn\u2019t made us go away.  Just because he\u2019s paranoid about the forces of Conservatism doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019re not out to get him.  Because what will bring this Government down is its arrogant contempt for the views of real people.You know the precise moment when everyone started to see through New Labour?  Midnight.  December 31st last year.  You probably all had a good time on New Year\u2019s Eve.  Ffion and I, we went to the Dome.  What did Tony Blair tell us about the Dome? \u2018I\u2019m absolutely sure that this is going to be a startling and exhilarating success\u2026 it will be the most famous new building in the world in the year 2000.\u2019  Well he wasn\u2019t wrong about that.  And then there was John Prescott: \u2018if we can\u2019t make the Dome work, we\u2019re not much of a Government.\u2019  Whatever would we do without him? Tony Blair told us that the Dome would be \u2018the first paragraph of Labour\u2019s next Election Manifesto.\u2019  What a good idea.  In fact, such a good idea that I thought I\u2019d help him out by drafting it for him: \u2018Our New Labour Government, by wasting vast sums of money on something shiny and glitzy on the outside, empty and meaningless on the inside, with no understanding of our history, no vision of our future, and with so much hype followed by complete and utter failure, have successfully built the perfect monument to the way we have governed Britain for the last four years.\u2019There it is, the Dome: the first paragraph of their Manifesto and the last word about their Government.For the real lesson is even more serious than the failure of the Dome.  It is that the Prime Minister, who now admits that Governments can\u2019t run visitor attractions, still thinks that Governments know best how to interfere in every classroom, manage every hospital ward, regulate every business and spend everyone\u2019s money. You\u2019ve seen how New Labour said the Dome was going to be a success, and poured your money into it, put their cronies in charge, denied there was a problem, and how at the end it was the people of this country who had to pick up the bill.  That is New Labour.  That\u2019s what they\u2019re doing to our schools.  That\u2019s what they\u2019re doing to our hospitals.  That\u2019s what they\u2019re doing to our police force.  With the Dome it\u2019s taken nine months to see that these interfering busybodies didn\u2019t know what they were doing.  Don\u2019t give them five more years to prove that they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re doing with our schools and our hospitals and our police.Peter Mandelson said recently: something\u2019s gone seriously wrong with this Labour Government, but what is it? Shall we tell him?Tax is rising faster than anywhere in the developed world.  Hospital waiting lists are up 87,000.  Secondary school class sizes are bigger.  Welfare bills are soaring. Crime is rising after years of falling.  The transport system is at a standstill.  Petrol taxes are the highest in Europe.  Red tape is prolific. Waste is endemic.  The bureaucracy is bloated.  Political correctness is rampant.  The countryside is in crisis.  The cities are neglected.  Our independence as a nation is being given away and the Prime Minister is spending millions of pounds trying to con us all into abolishing the Pound when we all want to keep it. That\u2019s what\u2019s wrong with this Government.Three years ago at this Conference I made a prediction.  I said: \u2018New Labour have certainly changed politics for the time being.  Their politics without conscience brought fascination to begin with.  Then admiration.  But next it will bring disillusion.  Finally it will bring contempt.\u2019  We remember the fascination. We endured the admiration. We have seen the disillusion and now, like millions of our fellow citizens, we feel the contempt. In his speech last week, Tony Blair announced again:  \u2018I will act.\u2019  Well, of course he will.  It\u2019s all been an act.  It\u2019s only ever been an act.  He\u2019s the biggest actor in town.  But no amount of acting can save him from the truth spelt out in one of those famous Downing Street memos:  \u2018TB\u2019 \u2013 a clever disguise \u2013 \u2018is not believed to be real.  He lacks conviction, he is all spin and presentation, he just says things to please people, not because he believes them.\u2019TB spent thousands of pounds getting that advice.  WH could have told him it for nothing.The only person in the country still stuck in the fascination stage with New Labour is the Leader of the Liberals.  But of course we\u2019ve witnessed the four stages of the Liberal Party too.  Irrelevance, irrelevance, irrelevance, and irrelevance.So people now look to us.  They\u2019ve seen through the Labour Party and its Leader.  Millions are coming to know that not only has Labour failed to deliver, but that they are never going to deliver. This week, and in the coming weeks, people want to know what the alternative will be.  They look to us.  They want to know if we\u2019re ready.  They want to know what drives us, what motivates us, what we would be like in office.  They want to know where we come from and where we\u2019re going to.  And they want to know what motivates me.Come with me to the Rother Valley, to the heart of South Yorkshire.  See Rotherham, the industrial town I was born in.  Visit Wath Comprehensive, the school that gave me a chance in life.  Come and meet the people I grew up with.  Children of proud mothers who struggled with small budgets, who relied on the local health service, and who hoped for a better life for their sons and their daughters.  Children of fathers who worked hard in mines and on farms and in steel works, who never knew the security of owning a home or saving for a pension, who had no choice but to live from one week\u2019s pay packet to the next.  Those children I grew up with have families of their own now.  Many are better off than their parents.  They own their own home and they\u2019re saving for a pension.  Their jobs are in supermarkets, in high street banks, in telephone call centres; they\u2019re nurses and teachers and self-employed builders.  And the girls in my class are now juggling with all the competing pressures of being good mothers and holding down a good job.  But these people, the children I grew up with in South Yorkshire, want the same things as their parents did.  They want security and stability for themselves and their families.  They want a better life for their own children.   Don\u2019t think that because they holiday in Tenerife and not Tuscany that they don\u2019t have aspirations for a better life.Don\u2019t think that because they\u2019ve moved to Ilkley and not Islington that their voice can be ignored.The people I grew up with, and millions like them, are the mainstream of our country.  They are the people who motivate me.And I know that they have almost given up on any politician from any political party standing up for them. For they see their modest incomes eaten away by more taxes every time they fill up their car or tear open their pay slip, and they wonder if any politician knows what its like to raise three children on a family budget that just won\u2019t stretch any further. They see young thugs walking free from our courts, and they wonder if any politician knows what it\u2019s like to live on a council estate where the criminals take control after dark.  They see the independence of the country they love cast aside, and they wonder if any politician shares their patriotism and their pride in being British.These people, the people I grew up with, the mainstream people of this country, are the people who motivate me. And these are the people we will govern for.  We will govern for hard-working families.  We will govern for people of every community and background.  We will govern for the mainstream that New Labour has ignored.  We will govern for all the people.For when New Labour say to us that we\u2019re only appealing to core Conservative voters when we talk about crime and asylum and tax and Europe, I say to them that they have completely lost touch with the hard-working families of this country.I say to hard-working families everywhere: I know that you are looking at our Party and judging whether we are ready for government.You know that we are tough on crime, and I tell you this: no government in recent times has been as tough on criminals as we will be.You know that we want to reduce taxes, and no government in recent times has been as committed to cutting taxes as we will be.You know that we believe in Britain, and no party will stand up for the rights and independence of our country with as much resolve and fortitude as we will.You know all this, but I want you to hear something else you may not know.The Conservative Party in Government will direct its energies to improving the schools that are the most hopeless, to bringing life to inner city areas that are the most bleak, to helping pensioners that are the least well off, to tackling drug problems that scar the least fortunate, to addressing family break down in the most dislocated communities, and to improving the health care for those most dependent on the NHS.And it is because we are ready to do all these things that the message coming loud and clear from this Conference is that we are ready for government.There are some who say there is a contradiction between traditional Conservative issues and winning new Tory audiences, between tolerance and mutual respect for all people and championing the mainstream values of the country. There is no contradiction.  I say being tough on crime, believing in lower taxes and the robust defence of our nation\u2019s independence are not in contradiction with wanting better schools and hospitals and thriving inner cities; they are an essential part of achieving all those things.  I say defeating political correctness and refusing simply to accept every demand from every pressure group is not in contradiction with respecting the differences between individuals; on the contrary, the championing of mainstream values is the championing of tolerance, mutual respect and the rich diversity of our country.   Only by trusting the instincts and the individuals and the institutions and the independence of the people of this country can we hope to seize the opportunity that this Government is so tragically squandering.That\u2019s why we\u2019re going to lead a Common Sense Revolution.  That\u2019s why we\u2019re going to govern for the hard working, hard pressed, decent law abiding people of this country and bring an end to the rule of the small out-of-touch New Labour clique that thinks it is so much better than the rest of us.  We\u2019re going to govern for the families who\u2019ve earned every penny they\u2019ve got and need every penny they earn and want a Government that will cut taxes.Three weeks ago we experienced something in this country we hadn\u2019t seen for more than 20 years. The pumps ran out of petrol, the shops ran out of bread, and the country came to a standstill. Labour governments - don\u2019t you just love \u2019em?Tony Blair and his Government say we mustn\u2019t give in to pickets.What a nice little lecture from the same Labour politicians who led the seamen\u2019s strike and encouraged the miners\u2019 strike and supported the secondary pickets.If he\u2019d really been listening, he\u2019d never have introduced his stealth taxes and he\u2019d never have had blockades and he\u2019d never have had the vast majority of the people of this country join in a taxpayers\u2019 revolt.Well if they don\u2019t understand the taxpayers\u2019 revolt, we do. If he\u2019s not in sympathy with it, we are. And if he won\u2019t cut taxes, we will.This Government has contempt for those who want low taxes. They think that wanting lower taxes is selfish and greedy.Wanting to pay less tax isn\u2019t greedy. The truck driver who told me how he had to work day and night and sleep in his cab just to feed a family he scarcely got to see wasn\u2019t being greedy.  He was just desperate and angry to see that hard earned money he\u2019d scraped together disappear in stealth taxes.And I tell him now that the Conservative Party understands the life he\u2019s living and we see his desperation and we share his anger and we will govern for him.Wanting to pay less tax isn\u2019t greedy. The young software consultant that I met who shook his head as he talked of his plans to move abroad because of the stealth taxes he now faces wasn\u2019t being greedy.  He just can\u2019t understand how this country can ever succeed if he\u2019s being taxed out of work in an era when business can go anywhere in the world and we need innovators so badly.And I tell him now that the Conservative Party can see the damage being done to the economic future of our country and we see our talent going abroad and we share his belief that our country cannot afford it and we will govern for him.Wanting to pay less tax isn\u2019t greedy. The countless hard-working families whom I meet everywhere I go who talk of how difficult they find it to save money and keep their families together and live on just one income while bringing up children aren\u2019t being greedy.  They just feel betrayed by a Government that promised no tax increases at all.And I tell them now that the Conservative Party understands their sense of betrayal and we know how difficult high taxes have made their lives and we are on their side \u2013 and we will govern for them.All these people are looking to the Conservatives now and they want to know what we\u2019re going to do for them.We know what we\u2019re going to do for them.We\u2019re going to cut fuel tax. Three pence off a litre of petrol. Three pence off a litre of diesel.We\u2019re going to restore a married couples\u2019 allowance \u2013 because I believe marriage is the bedrock of a secure and stable society.We\u2019re going to bring an end to the era of stealth taxes and start cutting the taxes paid by hard pressed families.And we know how we\u2019re going to pay for it too.We\u2019re going to make sure billions of pounds in surplus taxes raised by Gordon Brown goes back to taxpayers who earned it.We\u2019re going to reform the welfare system so that we stop losing billions of pounds in fraud and so that those who can work must workWe\u2019re going to stop wasting money on worthless Government schemes that are only designed to win headlines for Tony Blair.We\u2019re going to reduce the number of Ministers, cut the size of the House of Commons, halve the number of political advisers and cut the whole size of Whitehall, so that there aren\u2019t so many politicians going around dreaming up expensive meddling schemes to interfere in everybody else\u2019s lives.Tony Blair may think his made-up numbers about Tory cuts will win him back a few votes. He couldn\u2019t be more wrong. People don\u2019t believe the phoney statistics and falsehoods he tells about his own policies and so they certainly won\u2019t believe the phoney statistics and falsehoods he tells about ours.The British people know we can have lower taxes and better public services if we spend wisely. They know it can be done.And we\u2019re going to do it.For we\u2019re ready to govern for all the people.We\u2019re going to govern for the parents who want their children to get the best chance in life, who want a Government that will deliver on education.Last week I visited the largest comprehensive school in Birmingham. And the reporters said to me, \u2018There\u2019s a grammar school nearby, why didn\u2019t you visit that?\u2019  And I said, \u2018I\u2019ve visited grammar schools and they do a superb job. But our task now is to raise standards for that vast majority of parents and pupils who haven\u2019t got a grammar school to choose from.\u2019  So I\u2019ve been going to the inner city schools and talking to the pupils and the parents and the teachers.I\u2019ve been hearing the pupils talk about their hopes and their dreams and how determined they are to better themselves; parents talk of how they want the right to choose the best schools for their children but feel that choice is denied to them; teachers talk of how frustrated they are to spend so much time filling in forms and how difficult they find it keeping discipline when the Government tries to stop them excluding troublemakers; head teachers talk of the money that gets wasted on bureaucracy when it could be spent improving our schools.It\u2019s time someone listened to these people.  The Conservative Party is listening to these people and I am determined that we will govern for them.All these people are looking to the Conservatives now and they want to know what we\u2019re going to do for them.We know what we\u2019re going to do for them.We\u2019re going to take the money that\u2019s spent by politicians and bureaucrats and let the schools spend it instead. £540 for every pupil.We\u2019re going to endow our universities and set them free to be the best in the world.We\u2019re going to create Free Schools that can determine their own ethos and decide their own admissions policy and set their own pay policy.We\u2019re going to have tougher discipline in our schools because we\u2019re going to end the ridiculous situation where schools are penalised by the Government when they exclude pupils and are forced by politicians to take back those who disrupt classrooms. This is a policy that undermines discipline and makes teachers lives impossible and it\u2019s going to stop.The British people know these things can be done.And we\u2019re going to do them.For we\u2019re ready to govern for all the people.We\u2019re going to govern for the people who rely on the state pension and the National Health Service and think everyone should share in the growing prosperity of our country.The Government seems confused at why pensioners are angry. But the reason is simple.Pensioners don\u2019t like being treated with contempt by people like the Chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party who said they were all \u2018racists.\u2019  They don\u2019t like being talked down to by people like Peter Mandelson who said that they\u2019re not worth bothering with because they\u2019re not \u2018aspirational.\u2019I reject this language.  Our pensioners should be treated with dignity and respect.And they don\u2019t like being treated as charity cases by a Chancellor of the Exchequer who prefers to go on handing out means-tested benefits and one-off gimmicks because he thinks he knows best.Labour has not governed for them. We will govern for them.All these people are looking to the Conservatives now and they want to know what we\u2019re going to do for them.We know what we\u2019re going to do for them.We\u2019re going to take Gordon Brown\u2019s gimmicks and the administrative costs wasted on them and put that money back into the basic state pension. £5.50 more a week for every pensioner, £10 for an older pensioner couple.We\u2019re going to match Labour penny for penny on the NHS and sweep away Labour\u2019s dogmatic opposition to private provision.We\u2019re going to make sure every penny is spent on clinical priorities rather than the political priorities of Labour politicians.We\u2019re going to give every young person in the country the chance to have a pension of their own far greater than the current state pension.The British people know these things can be done.And we\u2019re going to do them.For we\u2019re ready to govern for all the people.We\u2019re going to govern for the law abiding people of this country who have sometimes felt there wasn\u2019t a politician left prepared to champion their common sense values and instincts.It\u2019s time we halted the march of political correctness. Can you believe that Birmingham\u2019s Labour Council decided to rename Christmas \u2018the Winterval\u2019?Can you believe that Education Ministers supported a ban on musical chairs because they think the game encourages aggression?Can you believe that they used Number 10 Downing Street to hold a summit on how many thin and fat people should appear on television?I want all these people who despair of this politically correct idiocy to know that we\u2019re going to govern for them.I want all the parents who think schools should respect their values and don\u2019t want Section 28 abolished to know that we\u2019re going to govern for them.I want all the people who are angry at the way our asylum system is in chaos and just want enforcement of the rules \u2013 I want them to know that we\u2019re going to govern for them.But nothing angers or frustrates the law abiding people of this country more than the failure of this Government to get a grip on rising crime.Like the group of black teenagers I met in a Lambeth comprehensive four months ago.  We got around a table in their classroom, and do you know what they said to me?  \u2018The police have got their hands tied and they\u2019ve lost it.  Crime is rising and we\u2019re most likely to be the victims.\u2019  These people are looking to the Conservatives now and they want to know what we\u2019re going to do for them.We know what we\u2019re going to do for them.We\u2019re going to restore Labour\u2019s cuts in our police force.And we\u2019re going to stop tying their hands with red tape and politically correct nonsense.  We\u2019re going to have less PC and more PCs.We\u2019re going to have no more of Labour\u2019s early release schemes for rapists and burglars and muggers.We\u2019re going to overhaul the law to make sure that it is on the side of the people defending their homes instead of the criminals breaking into those homes.We\u2019re going to step up the war against drugs, not surrender to the drug dealers.We\u2019re going to make sure that prisoners don\u2019t idle around in their cells but do a full working day.We are going to give full force to the common sense instincts of the British people and we\u2019re going to win the war against crime. The British people know these things can be done.And we\u2019re going to do it.For we\u2019re ready to govern for all the people.And we\u2019re ready to govern for all parts of the country.Earlier this year, I went to inner city housing estates in London and the north of England.  I saw there how too many of their schools are failing, there aren\u2019t enough jobs available, the shops have gone, and the sprawling tower blocks are rabbit-warrens for crime.   It\u2019s the same story in many of our cities.The people who live on these council estates have never looked to the Conservative Party for support, but I believe passionately that we still have a duty to help them.We are going to reclaim their streets from the drug dealers and car thieves.We are going to bulldoze the worst of the concrete tower blocks and ensure that there are new low rise homes where the criminals won\u2019t be welcome.And by bringing life back to our inner cities, we will ease the relentless pressure of the developers on our countryside.Only the most out of touch, metropolitan elite could regard the attack on our rural life and the desperate plight of our farmers as a source of amusement.  Yet, in speech after speech, and joke after joke in Brighton last week, New Labour poked fun at the anger and hardship of the people of the countryside.  This Government thinks it is attacking only a small rural minority.  In fact it is attacking the values of tolerance and respect, the values of the mainstream majority.Rural people look to the Conservative Party to represent them and stand up for their way of life \u2013 and we will not let them down. For we are ready to govern for all parts of the country \u2013 and by country I mean the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. But a Conservative Government will only be able to do all of these things, and govern for all the people, if we still have a country left to govern at all.  For this Labour Government is taking us down the road to a European super-state.Britain is uniquely placed to take advantage of the opportunities of the twenty-first century.  We have a unique relationship with the United States, a unique relationship with Europe and a unique relationship with the Commonwealth.  Our language is the global language of the new economy.  It seems to me to be blindingly obvious and basic common sense that with so many opportunities opening before us, we should not hesitate to make the most of being British. And the advantages of independence seem to have been blindingly obvious to the Danes too.  The result of the Danish referendum last week has once and for all demolished Labour\u2019s bogus arguments and scare tactics.  In a Europe where so many decisions are taken by bureaucratic elites, we should be celebrating the fact that at least in one country the people have spoken.  It now gives us a renewed opportunity to press the case for a different kind of Europe.Now we must champion the cause of a flexible, free trading, low tax, lightly regulated Europe.  A Europe that goes with the grain of the new global economy, in which nations combine in different combinations for different purposes to different extents.We will be the champions of that flexible Europe.  And we will be the champions of Britain\u2019s right to govern itself.  For we believe in being in Europe, not run by Europe.So we will write into the law of our land the powers and rights that we hold today and which we will pass to the next generation, so that no stroke of a pen from Brussels, or retrospective court judgement, can take those rights away.And we will champion the common sense instincts of young people who know that the idea of creating artificial, centralised supra-national super-states is an idea left behind in the twentieth century as they plan their lives in the twenty-first.  They too believe passionately that we should be making the most of being British.  So I say to them, whatever else you might have thought about the Conservative Party and what we\u2019ve done for Britain, it is only by coming with us that you can make sure that there will still be a Britain.Making the most of being British means that if taxes are lower in Britain than elsewhere in Europe, we should be making them lower still to ensure that we keep our competitive advantages.Making the most of being British means that if our regulations are lighter than in Europe they should be lighter still for British businesses.And making the most of being British means that if other countries give up their currencies and take on the job of applying one set of rules to every economy across Europe, we should say: good luck, we wish them well, but we will keep our Pound.At the coming election, we will be the only Party committed to keeping the Pound, just as we will be the only Party committed to common sense on the countryside and on our inner cities, on crime, on education, on pensions, on health and on tax.As we approach this election, conscious of our responsibility to provide a new government, clear in our principles for which only we can stand, resolved in our purpose to serve the people of our country, we know who we are and what we promise to be.I don\u2019t promise the earth.I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll solve every problem.I don\u2019t think we\u2019ll avoid every mistake.I won\u2019t try to start new fads or fashions.I won\u2019t claim to be creating a new era. I just want to govern with the common sense instincts of the people of this country.I just want to govern with the common sense instincts of a proud people who believe in Britain.In place of squandered opportunity and high taxation, the determination to seize the opportunity of a new economy.In place of dogmatic interference and Whitehall knows best, the certain belief in the freedom of people to make their own choices about their schools and hospitals.In place of political correctness and the noise of the pressure group, the quiet trust in the tolerance and mutual respect of the British people.In place of fear on our streets and the menace of drugs, the absolute conviction that the war against crime can be won.In place of the cringing surrender of our rights as a country, the confident assertion of our right to be a nation.I just want to govern with the common sense instincts of a people that believes in Britain and its values and institutions.I just want to bring to a people so deeply disillusioned by its Government,A Party that understands their concerns.A Party that shares their values.A Government that believes in our country.A Conservative Government, ready to govern for all the people.

aVFour weeks ago 28 short days, men whose hearts were shrouded in hate and whose minds were in the grip of a twisted ideology, drove three aircraft into three buildings. The result: 7,000 human beings are dead - Catholics and Protestants, Hindus, Muslims and Jews - they have all found a unity in death, and their death has united us all. Families across the world now mourn. We mourn with them. What can it be like to have watched the unfolding tragedy and then go home to find your husband saying farewell on the answer-phone? What words can adequately describe the selfless determination of those who went to save lives or to comfort the victims and ended up as victims themselves? We say to the families whose tragedy we witnessed, we do not pretend to know the depths of your despair, but your nobility helps us in our determination to act.Our hearts, our thoughts and our prayers are with you wherever you are. The men responsible for the outrages in America must pay for their evil. So we stand in full support of our American friends in this war against terrorism. This is not about revenge - it is about justice, it is about doing what is right. This war against terrorism is our war. The cold, callous and merciless attacks in America were the work of terrorists who knew no moral limits. They have struck before, they will strike again - we are right to strike at them. We cannot secure peace by standing aside from war. We cannot end danger by putting safety before our friends. We cannot conquer fear, by fearing to act ourselves.ConfirmationThe terrorists who attacked America also have us in their sights. Not because of what we in Britain have done, but because of what we and America stand for. Britain and the United States have become the enemy because we are beacons of democracy and champions of freedom. We are homes to people of all faiths and none. We are countries in which every individual can find fulfilment in their own way. For bin Laden and his fanatics, the very nature of liberal democracy is an affront.NATO and AmericaWhen civilisation is attacked, civilised nations must spring to each other\u2019s defence. That is why NATO remains the cornerstone of our security. I don\u2019t know about you, but I felt reassured when NATO backed this action. Invoking collective security is the most powerful statement a friend and ally can make. But it takes more than words. It requires means and the political will to use them. NATO has both, that is what has made it so effective over more than half a century. Nothing must be done to undermine its purpose or diminish its capability. And that is what is so dangerous about the plan for a European Army.We must never allow political ambitions to stand in the way of our national defence. International coalitions have their place and international approval is useful too. But our mission should shape the coalition, not the other way around. Diplomacy must be for a purpose and our purpose is to dismantle the apparatus of terror.There are those who say we must not give America blank cheques, that we must speak to them as candid friends, that we must position ourselves to limit, to cavil and to carp. I have to ask what jaundiced view of America animates such people. The response of President Bush and the American people to a grievous assault has been dignified, restrained and measured. Who are these people to patronise a great nation in its grief?Middle EastPerhaps, some people say, a changed approach to a troubled region or a review of American foreign policy would deflect the terrorists\u2019 wrath. I have to ask them if they truly appreciate the nature of the threat we face. Two years ago, the terrorists responsible for the atrocities in America were planning their massacres. At that time, hopes for a settlement in the Middle East were high. And America was the sponsor of that process.The terrorists did not target a policy, but a people. Their quarrel is not with the course set by a democracy, but with democracy itself. They are fanatics who view compromise and negotiation as weakness. They are an enemy against whom we must deploy all our reserves of strength. They are the enemy we must defeat.Armed ForcesThat\u2019s why the moral, political and financial support we give our armed forces is so vital. Let us pause to remember that as we meet here the men and women of our armed forces, across the world, are now risking their lives. They do it, as they always do, with unparalleled professionalism, courage and distinction. We owe our armed forces a debt we can never repay. But there is one thing we can do. We can show a clarity, a direction and a singleness of purpose which will not diminish over time.My father\u2019s generation risked their lives so that we could grow up in freedom. Sixty years ago, a close friend of my fathers summed up their attitude like this: \u2018I shall go to war believing I am fighting against oppression and devilry, but I expect I shall die because we should never have tolerated the ineptitude of gutless politicians for so long.\u2019 Thirty four years later, as a nervous, worried soldier on patrol in Northern Ireland, I looked up and I saw a poster calling for an end to violence. It read \u2018Seven years is enough.\u2019Two generations, the same lesson: that the price of freedom is eternal vigilance. Successive generations of terrorists have believed that the resolve of the West to act is weak. No matter what the atrocity, the West will lose interest, its resolve will fade and they can get on with planning the next outrage. We must show the terrorists they are wrong.Cold warThe illusion that the fall of the Berlin Wall ended threats to our way of life can no longer be sustained. We must accept that we still live in a dangerous world, and wishing won\u2019t make it otherwise. On September 11th we received a wakeup call. It showed the depravity and the wicked intent of bin Laden and those who would follow in his path.There are those who say that because they struck with passenger jets loaded with fuel, it is pointless to defend ourselves against weapons yet more lethal. But who now can doubt that if these terrorists had the means they would use nuclear, biological or chemical weapons? Against such weapons we are all but defenceless. And against such people, fanatics without fear or reason, we must defend ourselves at every level. For the threat can come in many forms: the suicide bomber, the terrorist network armed with Sarin gas or anthrax, the rogue state with its ballistic missiles armed with nuclear warheads. That is why I have called for the strengthening of our home defences. That\u2019s why I have urged support for US plans to build a missile defence shield that would protect us too. New threats require new thinking. We must never again be unprepared.IslamBin Laden\u2019s terrorists sought to draw Islam into fundamental conflict with the non-Islamic world. They must not be allowed to succeed. Muslim nations Jordan, Central Asian states, Gulf states, Saudi Arabia - even Pakistan, which stands on the very edge of the conflict - have rallied round the cause of defeating terrorism. The security of their world is at stake as well as ours. These governments have shown great courage and we must stand by our proven friends. So let me say again, the enemy is not Islam. It never has been. We will defend religious freedom as vigorously as the other freedoms we hold dear. We do this because that is what we stand for as a nation. Bin Laden claims to speak for Islam, but he cannot. His is a cynical and suicidal cult dedicated to the destruction of civilisations and lives, irrespective of their faith. This is a man who sends young acolytes to die for his own pathological purpose, while he himself skulks in caves. This is a man who prefers martyrdom at a distance.Human rightsWe must hold on to our respect for civil liberties - it is, after all, what marks out our open society from the tyranny of the men of violence. But in many areas of our life, we shall also have to find a new balance between human rights and human safety. The Human Rights Act passed two years ago is proving an obstacle to protecting the lives of British citizens. When we cannot deport those who threaten the life of a British Prime Minister and promote terrorism from the safety of our own country; when we cannot refuse entry to terrorist suspects on the grounds of national security; when we cannot even extradite people accused of violence against America to the United States - then it is time to change the law.Terrorism and crimeProtecting our nation means we must understand the links between international terrorism and organised crime. Drugs such as heroin and cocaine which blight the lives of so many of the young and vulnerable in our towns and cities. They are produced, distributed and smuggled into this country by terrorist networks. The Taliban buy the weapons which kill their own people with the profits from heroin which kills our own children. The Colombian terror groups fund their murderous activities with the cocaine which destroys the lives of their citizens and ours.Criminality sustains terror networks across the globe. Its reach is felt from the World Trade Centre to the street corners of Moss Side, Brixton and Belfast. Within our own nation, the IRA and so-called loyalist paramilitaries continue to make millions through their criminal rackets - drug running, petrol smuggling, and extortion. They inflict savage beatings, shootings and mutilations on people in their own communities. We cannot be indifferent to the suffering of those, many of them our poorest, who are the victims of these criminal gangs. We cannot afford to be neutral in the war on terror - for it threatens the security and lives of our citizens daily. We shall not rest until there is an end to terror in the United Kingdom. That means tackling the mafia sub-culture that sustains it. And it means all the arms still held by Northern Ireland\u2019s paramilitaries being put permanently beyond use - once and for all. Otherwise there can be no place for the representatives of terrorists in the Government of Northern Ireland.Insecurity at homeBut it\u2019s not just these threats that disturb our peace of mind today. Different worries, growing fast in recent years, make our society more fearful of the future. That\u2019s true, of course, for some groups above all: farmers and fishermen with their livelihoods extinguished; road hauliers driven into bankruptcy by higher taxes; people looking forward to retirement who have seen the value of their savings tumble. And over the years there has been a strange paradox at work. As we have grown more prosperous as a nation, it sometimes seems that we have lost some of certainties that made us feel comfortable and safe in our own surroundings. Streets in our towns that we\u2019ve known all our lives are now places that we fear. Standards of civility that were once the norm have given way to selfishness and aggression. The sight of police officers on our streets has become so rare that on many of our estates older people are afraid to venture out. Our citizens have the right to effective protection.Quality of life and public servicesAs Conservatives we are fiercely proud of our country, but we also know that much has gone wrong. Whether it is the air we breathe, the public transport we take to work, or the countryside we live in, there is a growing sense of unease that our quality of life is diminishing. In our country, the sick cannot get the treatment they need. In many of our inner cities the young do not receive the education they deserve. I call that shaming. We are the fourth richest country on earth. We should be providing public services that match those of our European neighbours, not those of the Third World.Why are people less likely to survive cancer in this country than in France or Germany? Why are schools failing here when children across Europe achieve so much more? Why do I get cases in my surgery of parents feeling so trapped by the lack of discipline and standards in their local schools that some feel forced to teach their children at home? Why did my constituent, waiting a year for a heart bypass operation, turn round as he was leaving my surgery, shrug his shoulders and say: You know they\u2019ve promised things will get better in a couple of years - problem is, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve got a couple of months. No wonder the French health minister describes the British Health Service as intolerable.The sad fact is this: a generation ago, Britain was the sick man of Europe. Today Britain is the last place in Europe any man or woman would want to fall sick. Our European neighbours simply enjoy better hospitals and schools, because they put the needs of their people before the demands of dogma. If we are to live up to the demands of a new century, we must do the same. This is our greatest mission at home over the coming years: to assemble the coalition of charities and churches, the public and private sectors that will deliver results. We will bring an open mind to the task of reforming public services but we will also bring the best of British innovation, enterprise and energy to our task. Not for us the ideological baggage, the special favours for those who pay the political bills. For the Conservatives it is just the determination to succeed.We know from our own experiences that people are no longer willing to put up with public services politicians are inclined to hand out. We are long past the age when everyone was willing to queue passively for treatment in a hospital corridor the way they queued at the baker\u2019s during the War. The gentleman in Whitehall no longer knows best, and yet Labour still act as though they know better than we do. It isn\u2019t managers who treat illness, but doctors and nurses taking account of patients\u2019 needs. It is not bureaucrats who will educate our children, but teachers working with parents.To improve health and education in this country, your first thought must be for patients and parents. But that\u2019s not the Labour way. Their first thought is to preserve the existing system and their first instinct is to protect vested interests. There can be no progress without innovation, and no innovation without difference. Standards will rise faster in some areas than others. If you won\u2019t allow one foot to move in front of the other, you will stay standing still. So we will examine all the models available to us from all over the world and draw on expert opinion in this country. I have instructed the Shadow Cabinet to visit other countries, to see why it is that their public services are so much better than ours. And I\u2019ve told them to consult those who run our public services as well as those who rely on them.Who could fail to have been moved by what Frances Howard said yesterday? She said that discipline in our classrooms has collapsed to the point where it is almost impossible to teach. We will find ways to achieve the high standards in our schools and in our medical care which a hard-working, self-respecting country deserves.Economic stabilityImprovements in public services depend upon the health of our economy to pay for them. And the health of our economy depends on three factors:There is an old saying that \u2018a rising tide floats all ships\u2019. During its first term of office, the Government has relied on the rising tide of the global economy. The Chancellor has increased taxes, but, for many people, increasing income has made that less noticeable. And as the Chancellor has taxed more, he has spent more, and then more still. But it would be wrong to assume the tide always rises. Our economy is set for turbulent times ahead, and is in a weaker condition to withstand them than it was five years ago. Public spending has been allowed to run ahead of growth. Regulation has eaten away at the strength of our industries. Now more risk is being added to an already uncertain economy.We have been told that the course is now set for entry into the Euro. As a Party, we will oppose that. Whenever the referendum comes, we will fight to keep the Pound. And the clarity of our position means we can concentrate on the crisis in our hospitals, the failure in our schools and the crime on our streets, while others talk about a timetable for scrapping the Pound.As a nation we should be ready to weather difficult times together. But we must remember that our future would have been safer were it not for the hubris of believing that boom and bust had been abolished. Humility becomes us all. We will renew our policies with one aim in mind: we must deliver real solutions to real problems.Once before, a generation ago, we were faced with the task of turning Britain around. Then the challenges were mainly economic and industrial. In the 1980s and 1990s, we tamed the power of the unions and unleashed the latent spirit of enterprise within our nation. Time has moved on. Now we face a different set of challenges: to tackle insecurity, improve economic stability and bring first class public services to our people.These real problems face everyone in this country, wherever they live and wherever they come from. They confront us as parents or patients, as people who live in towns or cities or the countryside, whether we are young or old. They curb our ambitions, limit our dreams and add to our anxieties. They affect our friends and our families. They make for common concerns among complete strangers.As a Conservative, I am proud of what our Party has done for this country. As a British citizen, I am still prouder of what this country has done for the world. As the years go by, the mission of a Party, just like the destiny of a nation, changes. But we face change, and we lead others through change, on the foundations of values and beliefs which do not change.Let me give you just one instance of what I mean. And, being a politician, I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s drawn from my own experience. I was brought up in a family where public service wasn\u2019t just a shorthand for the public sector: it was a way of life. Life in the Forces left an indelible imprint on my childhood, so much so that I too became a soldier. I don\u2019t want to idealise Army life. But it was a life where loyalty, duty and honour counted. Later I went into industry and later still, for a time, I was unemployed. No one who\u2019s endured that worry while bringing up a family can possibly forget it. Eventually, after several years in publishing, I became a Member of Parliament. That too, frankly, had its ups and downs! And, in a sense, I found I\u2019d come full circle. Because being an MP was just an extension of that idea of public service which is such a defining feature of our nation\u2019s life.We all have our own stories, our own experiences of service. To those who ask what kind of people we actually are, I say: Go and find out who\u2019s volunteering for the local charity. Search out the people who put their hand in their pockets for good causes, without asking for praise or courting publicity. Look out for the quiet family who are striving to make ends meet and care for a disabled or sick relative. As likely as not, you\u2019ll discover a Conservative.We know that women, ethnic minorities and people of different lifestyles must have greater opportunity within our Party. And I shall do everything I can to give this effect. Not because I am interested in ensuring that the Conservative Party is politically correct, but because I want us to be politically effective. That means drawing on the widest possible pool of talent, recruiting and promoting on the basis of merit.And that is also why I will be intolerant of anyone who is intolerant of others. For me the essence of a Conservative is something beyond such talk of quotas and categories. At the heart of my Conservatism is a desire - one which is consuming, and unending - to serve the nation as a whole. To serve by defending our institutions and upholding our traditions. To serve by extending the benefits of a free and prosperous life to every corner of the land. To serve, above all, by making Britain a place where all our citizens feel proud to belong, a place we love, and one which we want our children and our grandchildren to love, as passionately as we do.Today, this country is engaged in a ferocious conflict, a struggle for civilisation itself. We should remember why we are fighting, what we believe, and who we are. Let\u2019s keep faith with ourselves and our ideals. Let\u2019s keep faith with freedom.

aVBetween now and the next General Election, we have to persuade millions of people up and down the country that this Conservative Party is fit for Government. That this Conservative Party is fit to govern this great country of ours.People say that we as politicians do not live in the real world. We don\u2019t deal with the problems that they face on a day to day basis. That we spend more time lecturing than we do listening, but most of all that we make promises that we know we cannot keep.This is the sound of a people tired of politics and crying out for change.And that is our challenge.That is my challenge.To listen to what they are telling us and to deliver.And by deliver, I don\u2019t mean going out and saying \u2018just trust me.\u2019That\u2019s not enough\u2026 and it does not work.If we as politicians do not show the people of Britain that we trust them to lead their own lives, then they will never again trust us.Trust them to choose their schools and hospitals, trust them to look after their families and trust them to run their businesses. Trust them.That is the message I will take to the people of Britain, every minute of every hour of every day until we take on this Government head to head at the next General Election.Conservatives in a time of changeA generation ago, the Conservative Party took tough and often unpopular decisions. We laid the foundations for the prosperity that many enjoy today and now we face a new generation of challenges.Millions more people own their own homes, but they fear to walk down their own street.We have more money \u2013 but we have less time for the things in life that are most important.Almost everyone here knows someone whose child is struggling with drug addiction.Our streets \u2013 once the safest in the world \u2013 are now dirty and dangerous.Britain has a successful economy. And yet our society seems more troubled than ever.We must first understand the way life in Britain is lived today, and not the way it was lived twenty years ago.We cannot remain the only part of Britain untouched by the changes that we ourselves unleashed.Yes, it is right to be proud of the past, but it is wrong to try and live in the past.This country has moved on, and so must we.Being honest with ourselvesOur great achievement in the 1980s was to give people the power to fulfil their own economic ambitions.We made people financially better off, but money isn\u2019t everything, and in other ways, the quality of their lives declined.The challenges changed, but we did not change to meet those challenges.That is precisely what Theresa May said on Monday. What an excellent speech.All of us here want to remember the good things we did - and there were many - but beyond this hall people too often remember the hurt we caused and the anger they felt.Well I say this to you: Never again.Never again can we take the people of Britain for granted.Until people see that our Party has learned the lessons of 1997, we will go on getting the result of 1997.The Party that I lead will live in the present and prepare for the future.So to those who want to re-fight the battles of the past, and to those who want to live in the past, I simply say this: You stay in the past; we are moving on.LabourFive years ago, Tony Blair managed to catch the national mood.People felt he had changed his party.Then he promised to transform Britain.Remember what we had to endure?Cool Britannia? The Third Way? The Millennium Dome?He promised so much, to so many.How sad it has all come to so little.Last week, Tony Blair spent most of his speech asking a lot of questions.But just as he does every week at Prime Ministers Questions he then refused to answer any of them. Well I have some questions for him:Why are our hospitals so crowded?Why are our streets so dangerous?Why are our schools so troubled?Why is our countryside so neglected?And the most important question of all:Who does Tony Blair think has been running this country for the past five years?Public service failureAnd in those five years our public services have deteriorated.Today our schools, our hospitals, and our criminal justice system are barely adequate at best - and truly shocking at worst.The quality of everyone\u2019s life is suffering as a result. But it is those for whom our public services are a lifeline \u2013 the poorest and the most vulnerable in our society \u2013 who are suffering the most.We live in an era of prosperity and employment, but one fact remains as true today as it was a generation ago:Britain isn\u2019t working.It is not the fault of those employed in our public services. They are the neglected heroes of British life.Think of the exhausted nurse working long hours in unacceptable conditions dealing with angry and often confused patients.The demoralised policeman trying to catch arrogant and aggressive criminals without adequate support.And the over-worked teacher at an understaffed school comforting students who have just lost their place at university.They are not to blame.And if more money were simply the answer, Britain would have some of the best public services in the world. Sadly we do not.Today the Government is spending money more quickly than the nation can earn it.Taxes are rising for those who can least afford it: for people on fixed incomes and for small firms who are the job-creating and wealth-creating engines of our economy.The plea is always for more time and more money, but too often new money is used simply to cover up for the failure of the money this Government has already spent.And as Michael Howard made clear on Tuesday, our public services are suffering from the same problems that afflicted our economy a generation ago.Now, as then, policies are dreamt up in No. 10 and imposed across the country.Now, as then, too many decisions are taken too far away from the people who provide services and the people who use them.It is time to take that power and give back to these who run our public services and those who rely on them.It is time to start trusting people.Because it is only by trusting people that we can begin to make Britain work again.Policy RenewalIn the last twelve months, we\u2019ve travelled the world. We\u2019ve talked to patients and parents, doctors and teachers, police officers and hundreds of other professionals, both here and abroad.We\u2019ve taken the time to understand the problems, to study what works here in Britain and in other countries and to develop solutions.The result has been our policy document published today. It sets out our immediate priorities and the approach we intend to take.With important elections coming up for the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly, our parties there will decide exactly how to translate our principles into Conservative policies.But our direction is clear.There have been no short cuts.No gimmicks.No clever wheezes.Just hard work.Work that doesn\u2019t always grab the headlines.But work that has unearthed the real problems that face the people of Britain today.Real problems that start when people are too young to know anything better.Real problems that start in our schools.EducationA society unable to educate its young doesn\u2019t deserve to call itself civilised. But in many parts of Britain today, the state of education is a scandal.The \u2018learning gap\u2019 between our inner cities and the rest of the country is growing wider every day.Too many schools are suffering from a breakdown in authority, a lack of teachers and poor results and too many children are paying the price.Thousands of young lives are being written off before they\u2019ve scarcely begun.These are the children Labour has left behind.I want those children who are stuck in schools that are failing in our inner cities to have a way out. I want their parents to be able to do what others have done for their children. I want them to be able to choose excellence.The Conservatives will give them that chance.This means breaking with the dogma that says because the state pays for education, it must also run every single school in the land.In Holland, in Sweden and in Denmark they\u2019ve already broken with dogma. And that is what we must do here.So Damian Green has announced this week our plans to give parents real control over how and where their children are educated.Popular schools will be allowed to grow to take on more pupils.But far too many children are locked into failing schools.So we will help parents and other groups establish a new generation of independent schools funded by the state.We will give state scholarships to pupils starting in our inner cities. That way parents can educate their children in schools that are paid for by the state but not run by the state.And my aim is nothing less than to make sure no child is left behind.HealthAnd if we can do that for parents and pupils, why on earth can\u2019t we do it for patients? Just like the pupils in failing inner city schools, the people who suffer most from the crisis in the NHS are the people who can least afford to do so. They are the old, the chronically sick, mothers and young children.They can\u2019t do what a quarter of million people a year do now.  They can\u2019t use their life savings for treatment outside the NHS because they have no life savings.These are the patients Labour has left behind.As Liam Fox pointed out, these people have just as much right to excellence and just as much right to be treated quickly as anyone else.We need to give them a helping hand.The Conservatives will give them that chance.This means recognising that you cannot deliver twenty-first century healthcare using a 1940s system.No other country puts the demands of its health service before the needs of its patients.So we will maintain the commitment of the NHS to provide comprehensive care on the basis of need. But we will go further than that.We will help those who have already contributed to the NHS but who are unable to get their treatment in the NHS on time.And we will give all patients greater choice about how they are treated and by whom.My aim is nothing less than to make sure that no patient is left behind. CrimeBut it is not only schools and hospitals where Labour has failed the people of Britain.Today our streets and our homes feel less safe than they did even a decade ago.Parents are unable to let their children out to play, women are frightened to walk alone after dark and the elderly are frightened even to go out at all.Rising crime hits defenceless people the hardest.These are the victims that Labour has left behind.I want to reclaim the streets for the young and the old and for all the decent people of Britain.And that is what the Conservatives will do.In Mayor Giuliani\u2019s New York, crime dropped by two-thirds in ten years because police response times were forced down to two minutes and people could see officers on patrol catching criminals.In today\u2019s Britain, for every 40 crimes committed, only one results in someone receiving a criminal record. That is not good enough. We must bring Giuliani-style policing to every city in this country.As Oliver Letwin says, crime is not a single act - it is a conveyor belt stretching right back to a child\u2019s early years at home. And we need to give young people every opportunity to opt out of a life of crime and to opt back into society.So we will help parents with problem children provide the framework of discipline and affection that every child needs and deserves.And we will deal with persistent young offenders by giving more purposeful and longer sentences.We are also determined to break the link between crime and hard drugs.That\u2019s why we have pledged a ten-fold increase in the number of drug treatment places in this country.Young crack and heroin addicts will face a stark choice: accept rehabilitation and rescue your own lives, or face prison where you can no longer blight the lives of others.Rewarding responsibilityAs Conservatives, we believe in freedom, but we also believe in society. It is our sense of responsibility that makes social beings out of free individuals.But Gordon Brown is doing his best to undermine responsibility.His policies have trapped nearly half the people in this country on income-related benefits, including the pensioners he has taxed into dependency.People are penalised for working harder and saving harder.These are the families Labour has left behind.The Conservatives will give these families a chance.We will give people the flexibility to save when they can, to draw on funds when they need to and to save again later in their lives \u2013 all without losing support from the taxpayer.The lifetime savings account announced by David Willetts this week will be the biggest boost to responsibility that we can give this country.However old you are, whatever you earn, we will reward everyone in this country who works hard and who saves hard.But we will do more.A generation ago, Conservatives gave council tenants the right to buy their own homes.  Some two million people became property owners and gained control over their own lives.As David Davis made clear this week, home ownership still remains the ultimate dream of most social tenants today.Helping them realise that dream means giving them a helping hand.So the Conservatives will again make that dream a reality and extend it to a new generation.The right to buy is back.But it\u2019s no good having your own house if you lose it through ill health in old age. All over this country, people who have worked hard, saved hard and bought their own homes find that they might as well not have bothered.If they need long-term care, the state seizes their homes and their life savings without offering them any alternative.This has got to stop. We need to give people a helping hand. That\u2019s why we will find a way of enabling people to insure against the loss of their homes and savings if they have to go into care. And while we are at it, we are going to abolish that ridiculous annuity rule.We will offer security to the generation who built and defended this country we live in today.They deserve more than our gratitude - they deserve their dignity.Society and the familyAs Conservatives, we realise that care, compassion and security are central to all our lives. And the place we find them first is in our families.But today many families are increasingly fragile.This Government seems oblivious to the importance of family in supporting people, no matter who they are or what they do.They have undermined the family in our tax and benefit system.They have undermined the authority of parents in our schools.The more we can help families to flourish, the richer our society is.No one in society gets stronger by making families weaker.We are never more fulfilled than when we join together to make the community in which we live a society of which we can be proud.But the key to success in anything we do together is the energy, imagination and commitment that comes from having the freedom to set priorities within our own community.I know from my own experience that one volunteer is worth a dozen conscripts.In every charitable, voluntary and community group across the country you\u2019ll find Conservatives showing compassion \u2013 without ever feeling that their hearts have to be stitched onto their sleeves.We should be proud of that because we are playing our part in making our vision of a decent society a reality every day.A politics that is honestThe strength of the Conservative Party has always been that we bring to politics the experience of lives lived outside politics.I\u2019ve worked with British people from every part of these islands and from every kind of background, first in the Army and then in private business.I\u2019ve known danger and I\u2019ve tasted disappointment.I was made redundant in the tough times of the last recession and I had to start all over again.Try being told you\u2019ve just lost your job. Try telling people they\u2019ve just lost theirs. I\u2019ve been through both and it puts the world of politics completely into perspective.So when I was told I had no future in Parliament because of my determination to keep Britain\u2019s independence as a nation state and because of my determination to keep the Pound, I did not waver.Those who do not know me yet, will come to understand this:When I say a thing, I mean it.When I set myself a task, I do it.When I settle on a course, I stick to it.Do not underestimate the determination of a quiet man.I will continue to do what I believe to be right.I am not here to waste my time or yours going through the motions of opposition for the next three years.I am here because I believe that decent people can make a difference.IraqThere are times when the needs of our country are more important than the demands of party politics.The situation in Iraq is one such time.I have been warning of the danger of the Iraqi weapons of mass destruction for the last five years. I am glad that the Prime Minister has now come to the same conclusion.No one should ever contemplate war without thinking of the ultimate price that individual servicemen and their families might be called on to pay.But there can be only one calculation we should be making. Is it right to move against Iraq\u2019s arsenal now. The answer has to be yes.Those who genuinely seek evidence in support of potential military action in Iraq will find there is plenty of it; those who oppose intervention at all costs will never find enough.We cannot wait until we have irrefutable proof that Saddam has nuclear, biological and chemical weapons targeted on the British people.Because we already have proof that he is the kind of man who would use them.With nuclear weapons, Saddam and his terrorist cohorts would hold us and the world to ransom \u2013 ushering in a new dark age of global insecurity.We must take action now before it\u2019s too late.We must have a clear UN resolution that spells out to Iraq a clear timetable for ridding itself of its weapons, and the clear consequences if it fails to do so.Saddam must be left in no doubt: disarm or we will disarm you.This Party of all parties has never flinched in times of international crisis. The Party I lead will not do so now.Some of you may not like this, but let me be clear.I will not play political games with our national security.I will always put our country first.And that means living up to all our international responsibilities, Prime Minister, not just in Iraq but, as Michael Ancram says, in Zimbabwe and Gibraltar too.ConclusionMy friends, if a week is a long time in politics, then a year sometimes seems like a lifetime.I know you have been waiting impatiently for us to come forward with fresh ideas that would set our Party on a new course.Now we have begun to fulfil those expectations and through your enthusiasm you have shown that we are moving in the right direction.This will be remembered as the week when the Conservatives began the slow, hard road back to power.So the next time you are asked what Conservatives stand for these days, tell them this from me:We believe that when people are given the power to choose they choose to do the best for themselves and their families.We believe that just because the state funds our public services it doesn\u2019t need to run our public services.We believe that the privileges of the few must be turned into the opportunities for the many.Above all we believe that to build a better society you must trust people.Not governments.Our principles must be for a purpose.And that purpose is simple. To make Britain a better place than it is today.I love my country.For me, this is the greatest country on earth, and the tolerance, the decency and the strength of the British people are worth fighting for.That is why I am here.That is why we are all here.To build a Britain that respects decency.A Britain that values compassion.A Britain worthy of all its people.This week we have rediscovered the courage of our convictions.So go out there and tell the world \u2026 the Conservatives are back.

aVTwo years ago, I stood for the leadership of this Party. We\u2019d just lost a second general election. We\u2019d seen a good man resign and we\u2019d gone through a lengthy leadership contest. Labour were 20 points ahead in the polls. Let\u2019s face it: we were being written off. I knew that unless we could define what we stood for, unless we could find policies that would benefit everyone in our country, no one would even listen to us. Well, today, I have delivered. I stand before you with the most radical policy agenda of any party aspiring to Government since 1979.They said we couldn\u2019t win the elections in May. And we did. We are the largest and fastest growing party of local government. We\u2019ve the largest and fastest growing political youth organisation in the country. My mission is to take the Conservative Party back to government. I won\u2019t allow anything or anyone to get in my way. We must destroy this double-dealing, deceitful, incompetent, shallow, inefficient, ineffective, corrupt, mendacious, fraudulent, shameful, lying government once and for all. I say to everyone here today: You either want my mission. Or you want Tony Blair. There is no third way. To those who doubt and to those who deliberate, I say this: Don\u2019t work for Tony Blair. Get on board. Or get out of our way. For we have got work to do. And to the Prime Minister I say this: The quiet man is here to stay and he\u2019s turning up the volume. Government - never there when you need it, always there when you don\u2019t.The Conservative Party has always stood for hard-working, law-abiding people. And we stand for them again today. On their side against the most dishonest and incompetent government of modern times. A government that\u2019s never there when people need it, but always there when they don\u2019t. Think about everyday life. You struggle to get to work because the traffic\u2019s jammed. Where did all that extra petrol tax go? More and more of your day is spent dealing with government\u2019s petty regulations. They waste your time, they wear you down. You work longer, too - to make up for the extra tax you\u2019re now paying. You get home late - to find your daughter\u2019s been bullied at school. You know it\u2019s not the teachers\u2019 fault. The Government won\u2019t let them exclude the bullies. They\u2019re the same gang that stole your son\u2019s mobile last week. The police don\u2019t have enough officers to catch the culprits. So they offer a crime number instead, as if that\u2019s good enough. And then Gran\u2019s on the phone. Her operation\u2019s been cancelled again. It seems the doctor says he must give priority to other patients to meet Tony Blair\u2019s targets. Gran doesn\u2019t count.Government - always there when you don\u2019t need it. With its extra taxes and bureaucracy. Never there when you do. Never there in the fight against crime. Never there to give you and your family the schools and hospitals that you have paid for.Blair must go. You don\u2019t expect the earth, just a fair deal. But in Labour\u2019s Britain, Government is on people\u2019s backs, but never on their side. Tony Blair\u2019s in your face when you don\u2019t need hassle.Out of the country when you need help. Labour isn\u2019t working... again. People have seen through Labour, and they\u2019ve seen through Tony Blair, too. He said he had no plans to increase taxes then increased them sixty times. He promised to be fair but plundered the lifetime savings of people preparing for retirement. He pledged to be tough on crime - but gun crime has doubled. Do you remember he said he\u2019d be whiter than white? Or do you most remember Eccelestone? Geoffrey Robinson? Mandelson\u2019s home loan? Mittalgate? The Hinduja affair? Mandelson - again! Scandal after scandal. Scandals that revealed this government\u2019s dark side.But these were just a curtain-raiser for this Prime Minister\u2019s blackest act. This government used Dr. David Kelly as a pawn in its battle with the BBC. His death was first and foremost a tragedy for those who loved him, but it shamed our country. It shamed our whole political system. Immediately after Dr. Kelly\u2019s death, Tony Blair said he\u2019d had nothing to do with his public naming. That was a lie.Tony Blair chaired the meetings that made the fatal decisions. He is responsible. He should do the decent thing and he should resign.But, of course, he won\u2019t. He won\u2019t do the decent thing. He never does. He won\u2019t even tell you the truth. Six years after Tony Blair entered Downing Street - people no longer believe a word he says anymore.And his promises of \u2018jam tomorrow\u2019 are least believed of all. The day when we drive Mr. Blair out of office cannot come soon enough, and that day is fast approaching. When you next feel a hand on your shoulder, Mr. Blair, it won\u2019t be that hand of history... It will be grip of the British people dragging you from office.Tough on tax, tough on the causes of taxBeing a taxpayer has become the hardest job in Britain. At the heart of the Conservative Party\u2019s fair deal will be a fair deal for taxpayers.Across the world, our competitors are cutting taxes because tax cuts create jobs, wealth and growth. But in Britain the tax burden is rising. And it\u2019s rising fast. Mr. Blair promised the British people that he had \u2018no plans to increase taxes at all.\u2019 No plans? Tax on mortgages. Tax on pensions. Tax on house buying. Tax on petrol. Tax on marriage. Tax on self-employment. Tax on cars. Tax on health insurance. A 70% increase in council tax. An £8bn National Insurance hike, a tax on jobs.Mr. Blair has taken money from people struggling to make ends meet and poured it into schemes that will never work. Labour\u2019s waste of taxpayers\u2019 money is a crime. A crime that hurts pensioners and low paid workers most of all. For some families, Labour\u2019s tax rises mean no holiday this year. The children\u2019s clothes must last even longer. Millions have to work extra hours to make ends meet.Labour has raised taxes but not improved Britain\u2019s public services. The Conservative mission is to reform public services and to be a lower tax government than Labour. We\u2019ll he tough on tax and tough on the causes of tax!The greatest cause of increasing tax is increasing waste. 70% of taxpayers think Labour wastes their money. And they\u2019re 100% right. This Labour Government will never give taxpayers value for money. But Conservatives will.In local government, Conservatives already deliver better services for less tax. As Michael Howard said yesterday in his excellent speech, Conservatives believe in low taxes. We will always be a lower tax government than Labour. And yes... We plan to cut taxes.We are fortunate to have Michael leading our Treasury team. Michael, I understand that relations are not so rosy in the red corner. I\u2019ve heard that the only colour Carole Caplin won\u2019t allow in Number Ten is brown.Gordon Brown is the biggest tax raiser in British history. But Charlie Kennedy wants to raise them even further, except on wines and spirits, of course. The Lib Dems want a local income tax, a regional income tax, and a new 50% tax band. They pretend to be reasonable but they\u2019re not. They don\u2019t want to give convicted paedophiles, rapists and murderers tougher sentences, they want to give them the right to vote. It\u2019s madness - utter madness.In fact, I\u2019ve just heard that the Lib Dems are being investigated by trading standards. On all ballot papers they\u2019ll have to have an asterisk after their party name: Warning: contains nuts.We all in this hall know that the Liberal Democrats are no joke. Their campaign book instructed them to \u2018be wicked, stir endlessly, act shamelessly.\u2019 And that\u2019s exactly what they do. They promise things they know they\u2019ll never have to deliver. They are not a fit party for government and we are going after them.Fair deal policiesConservatives are the only real alternative to Labour. Only we will properly reform public services. Only we will give choice to parents and patients. Let me be clear what I mean by choice. Choice in public services means peace of mind. It means you won\u2019t be stuck with second rate services.It means there\u2019ll be an alternative school or hospital if you need it. Under Labour, only the wealthy can buy choice. Conservatives will give every parent and every patient that choice. No child left behind in a failing school - because our Better Schools Passport will give every parent the power to get their child into the right school. The Patient\u2019s Passport will give every patient the right to the treatment they need anywhere in the NHS, and if they have to go outside the NHS, we\u2019ll help them.Students won\u2019t leave university saddled with a £30,000 debt. We\u2019ll scrap Labour\u2019s tuition fees and we\u2019ll stop top-up fees, too. Violent crime and disorder have rocketed under this Government. And the asylum system is a disaster spiralling out of control. While Tony Blair travels the world, the world is travelling here. As Oliver Letwin has pledged, under the Conservatives there\u2019ll be 80,000 fewer asylum seekers - and 40,000 more police officers. That\u2019s twelve more police forces the size of the Lancashire Constabulary.Labour wants to end the right to buy. John \u2018three homes\u2019 Prescott wants to take the right-to-buy away from other people. Well we\u2019re not afraid to fight you on that one, John. And I tell you this - this time the punch is coming from the right! Conservatives will always support the right of people to own their homes. And we\u2019ll extend the right-to-buy to one million housing association tenants. And we\u2019ll use the proceeds to end the outrage of children having to grow up in temporary accommodation. The right to buy is back.All of Labour\u2019s policies take power away from people. Labour always say, \u2018trust us.\u2019 Conservatives will be different. We\u2019ll trust you. With these and other policies, I am ready to fight this Labour Government. Policies that will make lives better. Policies that are Conservative through and through. Policies that will win votes.A fair deal for pensionersOur Party is sometimes accused of being an old Party. I think, by the way, it\u2019s meant as an insult! Well, when I became an MP, my father told me: always respect pensioners. And remember, these are the people who put us here. Who gave us the freedom to be who we are. They deserve decency and respect. They\u2019re not getting it. Gordon Brown has forced an extra million pensioners onto the means test. Two out of every three pensioners are now on social security. For many people the means test has made it unprofitable to save for retirement. More means testing, more tax, less savings. What a mess.So we will raise the basic state pension, in line with earnings, to ensure that future generations of pensioners never have to go begging for social security. The abolition of the means test is supported by the savings industry. It\u2019s supported by millions of pensioners. And it\u2019s supported by me. Most important of all, it\u2019s the right thing to do.EuropeLove of this country flows from one generation to the next, but Labour wants Britain to be something that it\u2019s not. They are embarrassed by our island character. Perhaps that\u2019s why Mr. Blair would risk Britain\u2019s prosperity by scrapping the pound. Every European government that has given its people a referendum on the Euro has seen them reject it. That\u2019s why Tony Blair doesn\u2019t have the guts to hold a referendum, he knows what we all know he would lose. So we may have frightened him off holding a referendum on the Euro for now. But we are now faced with an even graver danger. A threat to our very nationhood. The Euro would take away our power to decide our economic policy. But the European constitution would take away our power to decide who governs Britain.Think about it. Our country: no longer able to control immigration. No longer able to choose its allies. No longer able to use British soldiers to defend our interests abroad. Unelected Commissioners would have the final say in almost every government department - affecting every aspect of our daily lives. Yesterday the Conservative Party launched a nationwide campaign. In every constituency in Britain, Conservative associations will be collecting signatures for a petition to Parliament. That petition will demand that the British people have the final say on the constitution in a referendum. Mr. Blair, the powers you hold are not yours forever. You hold them in trust. In trust from the British people. Powers not yours to give away.If the Government does not give the British people a say on the new constitution, that will not be the last word on the matter. Make no mistake - I will fight with all my strength to defend the British people\u2019s right to govern themselves. And I put the government on notice. Michael Ancram and I will lead the campaign across the nation to fight for a referendum. We will fight at next year\u2019s vital European elections. We will fight in Parliament. We will fight at the general election. And I promise you: I will fight, fight and fight again to save the country that I love.Europe and the worldConservatives want to build a New Europe. Not a single state with its own currency and constitution, but a Europe of sovereign, enterprising nations. A New Europe, focused on today\u2019s problems, not the problems faced and overcome by Europe\u2019s founders. Fighting debt, disease and terrorism, environmental destruction and poverty. In the post September 11th world, global poverty is a challenge to our security. The poor countries of today may become the rogue nations of tomorrow.Everyone on earth has the God given right to live in a free country - protected by the rule of law. That\u2019s one of the reasons why I supported the war in Iraq. I know some say the war was wrong. And I respect their opinion. But I believe the world is better off today because Saddam Hussein is no longer running Iraq. I\u2019m not going to twist or turn with the prevailing wind. I won\u2019t play games with the defence of Britain. We\u2019ll leave that for the Liberal Democrats. Conservatives will never undermine our armed forces. We\u2019ll always back them.BlairWorldFor Mr. Blair, politics is everywhere and everything. So, during the next election don\u2019t he surprised when Labour play dirty. A Prime Minister that lies about his own record won\u2019t hesitate to lie about us. A government machine willing to smear the Paddington train crash survivors and Dr. Kelly won\u2019t think twice about smearing me. A political party prepared to use the tragedy of September 11th to bury bad news will do everything it can to hide the scale of its own failure.Did you see Tony Blair\u2019s performance in Bournemouth last week? Did you? Did you hear that speech?You know, I sometimes wonder if that guy lives in the same world as the rest of us. You see, in BlairWorld, things can only get better. In BlairWorld, crime is down. In BlairWorld, taxes are low. In BlairWorld, the trains run on time. Last week he ended his speech with an air of omnipotence. \u2018Let it be done,\u2019 he commanded. You see, in BlairWorld, Tony thinks he\u2019s god. But people don\u2019t live in BlairWorld. They live in the real world. Bedevilled by the daily hurt and failures of your government, Mr. Blair.Last week in BlairWorld, Tony boasted about winning against crime. On the same day, in the real world, a brave woman in Nottingham was shot dead defending her daughter from robbers. Last week in BlairWorld, Tony claimed that the economy was strong. On the same day, in the real world, 550 workers at Britain\u2019s oldest commercial shipbuilders were made redundant. Last week in BlairWorld, Tony talked tough on asylum. On the same day, in the real world, bogus asylum seekers escaped from one of his pathetic detention centres when they should have been deported months ago. Tony Blair\u2019s alright for the telly but he\u2019s all wrong for the country. In the real world he\u2019s failing Britain. And everybody knows it. Gordon Brown knows it. He\u2019s even started to smile.The IDS cardI know what I believe, I know what I value. This card sets out my beliefs. I believe in hard work. In rewarding people who play by the rules. In small government. I believe in punishing criminals. In trusting nurses, teachers, police officers. I believe in a low tax economy. I believe we all have a special duty of care for the most vulnerable people in our country - children, pensioners and the poor. And, most of all, I believe in the sovereign right of the British people to govern themselves. This card sets out my priorities for government. The priorities of the great team I\u2019m proud to lead.Theresa, our Chairman, and the front bench teams in the Commons and the Lords. Thank you all. In our first term in Government, our policies will deliver a fair deal for everyone - no one held back and no one left behind. Fundamental to my Conservatism is this double commitment: a belief in aspiration and a belief in security for all.Conservatives will always back the high achievers, the entrepreneurs. Life\u2019s gold medallists. From their endeavour, all of society can progress. Conservatives want individuals and families to fulfil their potential and we trust them to build a society that respects everyone.I\u2019m appalled at the waste of talent - the depth of untapped potential - within today\u2019s Britain. Talent and potential that the challenges of our time desperately need. But which are suffocated by a government that steals the oxygen from other living institutions.Only when government steps back will people and communities be free to build something better. You see, I\u2019m proud to be a Conservative. Proud of our achievements. Proud of our ambitions. Proud of the Conservative way. Because it works for all the British people.Let me tell you why I\u2019m in politics. It\u2019s certainly not for the newspapers headlines we get. It\u2019s for the people in the film we just saw and the millions just like them. Jim Doherty is one of the most remarkable people I\u2019ve ever met. He runs a family support group in Glasgow\u2019s Gallowgate. He told me: \u2018We have already lost so many of our children to drugs. The battle were fighting now is to save our grandchildren.\u2019 Jim looked me in the eye, and said: \u2018Don\u2019t promise the earth. Just give me something to hold on to. Just give me hope. We\u2019ll do the rest.\u2019 Jim, David, Janis, Frank, and Ita, you have my word. I won\u2019t let you down.Conservatives must win the next Election. Not for ourselves, but for the hardworking, law-abiding people of Britain. Government\u2019s on their backs when they don\u2019t need help, never on their side when they do. Over the last few days, many of you have said to me: \u2018I bet your job\u2019s tough.\u2019 No. Well, actually, yes, it is tough. But it\u2019s not as tough as seeing your children destroyed by drugs. Not as tough as having a child with special needs and seeing their school closed. Not as tough as watching the business you\u2019ve built up by your own hard work shut down by Labour\u2019s taxes. I\u2019ve got to be tough for these people.Listen. Listen.You can hear, steady as a heartbeat, the hurt and anger of the people of this country. This Labour government cannot hear them above the racket of its own spin and the rattle of its own demise. But I\u2019ve heard them, I\u2019ve heard their anger. Anger about the children on your street, mugged on the way home from school. Anger about your child, her hope destroyed by drugs. Anger for your mother, in agony because her operation has been cancelled again. Anger at the way your pension savings have been eaten away.These are the people I am in politics for. These are the people who brought me here. These are the people who sustain me. The most remarkable, determined, compassionate and tolerant people on the face of the earth. They are the British people. They are why I am here. They are why you are here.Everyone in Britain deserves a fair deal. We must be on their side.Our mission, our duty, is to bring them hope.To fight for them.To be strong for them.To be here for them.And, together, we must win for them.

aVI was born and grew up in South Wales. As you may have heard, we\u2019ve just been left off the new EU map. I know people in Brussels feel strongly about Neil Kinnock, but I really do think that is going too far. I was lucky enough to go to a very good grammar school. The first political meeting I ever went to was during a general election campaign. It was held by the local Labour Member of Parliament - a great man of his day, the Deputy Leader of the Labour Party. I asked him why Labour wanted to abolish grammar schools. And he replied: \u2018We don\u2019t want to abolish grammar schools. We want to make all schools grammar schools.\u2019 It was my first experience of a politician\u2019s answer. I don\u2019t believe in that kind of talk. I\u2019m going to give it to you straight.Rebuilding trustPoliticians - all politicians - have made promises they have failed to keep. In 1992, we promised to cut taxes year on year. But we put them up.  In 1997, Labour said there would be no tax increases at all. They put them up. Not once, not twice but sixty-six times. Sixty-six broken promises. And people have been let down on Europe too.In the 1970s, Britain joined a common market. That\u2019s what the British people voted for. But it soon became clear our European partners wanted more. They wanted to build a country called Europe. The British people were told: \u2018Don\u2019t worry. France and Germany don\u2019t really want a country called Europe. They\u2019re coming our way.\u2019 But they haven\u2019t come our way. Power has gone from Britain to Brussels. And that\u2019s not what the British people voted for. Let\u2019s face facts. What has happened on tax and on Europe has damaged people\u2019s faith in politics. So it\u2019s hardly surprising that people don\u2019t trust politicians today.AccountabilityIn the real world, if you say you\u2019re going to do something, you do it. And if you screw up, you can lose your job. It\u2019s called accountability. Remember that word - accountability. But politicians seem to live in a different world. A world where promises are dropped just as casually as they\u2019re made. A world where the figures are fiddled. A world where there are no penalties for failure. What people want from their politicians is: Accountability. Responsibility. And a little humility. The very opposite of what we\u2019ve had from Tony Blair. Politicians don\u2019t have all the solutions. They should stop pretending they do. So I won\u2019t pretend I can solve every problem, right every wrong or cure every ill. I\u2019ll leave that to the Liberal Democrats.We will only promise what we can deliver. What we start, we will follow through. And we will give people clear measures against which we can be judged. That\u2019s why we\u2019re setting out a clear Timetable for Action. What we\u2019ll do, when we\u2019ll do it. Specific times, specific dates. It will put us on the line in a way that no government has ever been before. There will be no wiggle room. Everyone will be able to hold us to account. No dodgy facts and figures We\u2019ll have no place to hide. Accountability.I choose my cabinet because I expect them to deliver. And if they don\u2019t, I\u2019ll replace them with people who will. When you ask for peoples votes, you have a responsibility to them. Casting a vote shouldn\u2019t be a mechanical choice between the lesser of two evils. It should be an opportunity to tell the world what sort of country you want. That\u2019s why politicians have a duty to respond to people\u2019s dreams and help make them a reality. It\u2019s not a crime to want a better school for your child, better healthcare for your mother, and a better life for your family. But it is criminal when politicians hold out these promises without a detailed, deliverable plan. People are fed up with talk. They want action.Talk not actionTony Blair has been all talk. He gets swept away with his rhetoric and his dreams. He\u2019s told us about the Euro being our \u2018destiny.\u2019 Well, you know, most people don\u2019t actually want a date with destiny. They just want a date with a dentist. Tony Blair has promised so much, but he has delivered so little. That\u2019s why people have come to think the problems we face are just like the British weather - something you moan about but cannot change. But we can get a grip on these problems. Where there is cynicism, we can bring hope. I\u2019m not going to promise you a fantasy land, but I do want to take you to a foreign land. In France, they don\u2019t have waiting lists. In Sweden, parents can choose the school they want. And in New York, it\u2019s now criminals who walk in fear, not the public.I want Britain to be the country that is the envy of the world. And I know that this is the party that can make it happen. Because we instinctively trust the generosity, the initiative and the common sense of the British people.Action on crimeAnd the first problem I\u2019ll get a grip on is crime. The gloves will come off. What Giuliani did in New York, what Ray Mallon did in Middlesbrough, we\u2019ll do for the whole of Britain. A war on crime.Three weeks ago, on a Saturday night, I went out on the streets of Brixton with people from local churches. I saw the problems their community is up against. In two hours we didn\u2019t meet a single policeman. Not one. This was inner city London, just before midnight, on a Saturday night. No wonder people feel the police have become distant and remote. The problem is that the police are handcuffed by paperwork. They now have to spend almost as much time at the station as they do out on the streets. And now this Government is making it worse. The police will now have to fill in a form every time they stop someone. Not stop and search, just stop someone. It takes seven minutes to complete that form. Just think about it. If a police officer stops half a dozen unruly youngsters, he\u2019ll have to spend the best part of an hour filling in forms.I don\u2019t want police filling in forms - I want them on the streets doing their job. People are fed up that when the police do catch criminals the punishment never seems to fit the crime. Under a new Labour law, shoplifters will only get a fixed penalty fine and no criminal record. Theft is now no worse than parking on a yellow line. I promise you I\u2019m not making this up. And five years ago, Labour introduced an early release scheme. Since then 3,600 crimes - including rape - have been committed by criminals let out of prison early. Every one of those crimes could have been prevented. All this has to change.We need a government that will stand up for the silent, law abiding majority who play by the rules and pay their dues. A government that will put their rights first. This is what David Davis will do. Day One, that form police officers will have to fill in every time they stop someone that form will go into the appropriate filing tray. The bin. Week One, Labour\u2019s early release scheme that will go. Month One, we\u2019ll start to recruit 5,000 more police officers a year. And we\u2019ll do something else. Career criminals and dangerous offenders should be in prison, not roaming our streets. So we will build more prisons.Action on drugsEveryone knows that drugs are at the root of a lot of crime. There can be few families not touched by the blight or worry of drugs. It\u2019s every parent\u2019s worst nightmare. I want to give hope and practical support to those families. Many addicts fall into crime to feed their habits. If they\u2019re caught, I think they should be given a choice. Prison or treatment. So we\u2019ll increase the number of rehab places tenfold from 2,000 to 20,000. We must give families the chance to win back their children from drugs. Life is far too precious to be written off.Action on school disciplineDrugs are a symptom of a wider problem. As a society, we\u2019ve blurred the distinction between right and wrong. We\u2019ve tolerated a slow but relentless decline in personal responsibility. Too many people now believe that they are no longer responsible for their actions. It\u2019s always someone else\u2019s fault. And while we\u2019ve let responsibility decline, we\u2019ve allowed \u2018rights\u2019 to proliferate. You hear it all the time: \u2018I\u2019ve got my rights.\u2019 The verbal equivalent of two fingers to authority. The Human Rights Act has tipped the balance of justice away from the victim in favour of the troublemaker. That\u2019s why we\u2019re reviewing it. And if it can\u2019t be reformed, we\u2019ll get rid of it.We have also undermined discipline in schools. Too often teachers find their authority challenged when they discipline children. But teachers know their pupils. They know their names and they understand their character what they are good at and what they find difficult. And we should trust them to exercise their common sense and judgement. So on day one, Tim Collins will start to give head teachers control over their classrooms. They\u2019ll have the final say on expulsions. Disruptive pupils won\u2019t be able to wreck other children\u2019s education.Action on schools and hospitalsHard-working families want to restore respect and decent values. But they also want value for money for the taxes they pay. Billions of pounds of their money have been spent on education. But much of it has been wasted on bureaucracy. Twelve pages of government paperwork land on head teachers\u2019 desks every single day of the school year. And what do we have to show for it? A third of all eleven year olds still cannot write properly.Billions of pounds of taxpayers\u2019 money have been spent on the NHS. And what have we got to show for that? Bureaucrats, people waiting in pain for operations, dirty hospitals. More people die every year from hospital infections than are killed on Britain\u2019s roads. That\u2019s more than a statistic. It\u2019s a tragedy for thousands of families, including mine. Two years ago my mother-in-law died from a hospital acquired infection. Yes she was old. Yes she was frail. But she still enjoyed life. She need not have died.Britain needs a Government that will give hard-working families value for the taxes they pay. And what greater value can there be than the dedication of those who work in our schools and hospitals? Look at the astonishing devotion to duty of our doctors and nurses. Their motives are the highest, their skills immense, their energy an inspiration. Think of the commitment of our teachers. Teaching is a noble profession. Teachers simply want the satisfaction, the sheer joy of inspiring the next generation, and of passing on that most precious commodity: knowledge. Is it too much to ask that we trust their judgement, their experience and their expertise? Let\u2019s set them free to follow their vocation, and give of their best. So in week one, Andrew Lansley and Tim Collins will start to scrap Whitehall targets for hospitals and schools. Teachers will run our schools. And doctors and nurses will run our hospitals. We\u2019ll trust patients and parents too - so they can choose the hospital and school which best suits them and their family. No one should have to shut up and just take what they\u2019re given.Conservatives will give everyone the kind of choice in health and education that today only money can buy. That\u2019s what I call social justice. There are people in Britain who have to wait months for operations on the NHS. Not far from where they live, other more fortunate people only have to wait weeks. We\u2019ve all paid for the NHS. It\u2019s our NHS. So why shouldn\u2019t you be able to go to the hospitals that can treat you more quickly? With the Conservatives, you will. We\u2019ll also give more choice to parents. Parents know better than anyone what is best for their children. If we want selection, if we want school uniforms, if we want schools that excel at sport, as parents we should be able to choose them. That is the way to give parents the good local schools we all want. But giving parents and patients choice, and giving professionals more control, means cutting back on the pen pushers who run too much of our lives. On day one, Oliver Letwin will freeze civil service recruitment. And I\u2019ll do my bit too.In Downing Street there\u2019s something called the Prime Minister\u2019s Delivery Unit. Yes, the Prime Minister\u2019s Delivery Unit. Now there\u2019s a contradiction in terms. That Delivery Unit was recently advertising for jobs. Job Title: Joint Action Leaders. Joint Action Leaders. What on earth does that mean? What do these people actually do? I\u2019ve got the ad here - let me read it to you. Applicants \u2018need a track record of diagnosing, analysing and developing workable solutions to key blockages to public service delivery.\u2019 Well, that\u2019s clear then. It\u2019s DynoRod in Downing Street. And for key blockages, read Gordon Brown. These Joint Action Leaders are paid £70,000 a year each, much more than an experienced midwife gets in a real delivery unit bringing babies into the world. In week one of a Conservative Government, I will order the closure of the Downing Street Delivery Unit. It may not be the biggest waste of money in Whitehall, but it sums up what\u2019s going wrong. Tony Blair\u2019s got a Delivery Unit but there\u2019s no delivery. I won\u2019t have a Delivery Unit, but I will deliver.Action on pensionsI will deliver for pensioners. If you want to know about a family, look at how they treat their older relatives. And if you want to know about a country, look how it cares for older people. It\u2019s a scandal that this Government took the best pensions system in Europe and turned it into one of the worst. Can you imagine what it feels like to have saved for your retirement only to find that the money you\u2019ve put aside isn\u2019t there? That the value of your pension has been destroyed by Gordon Brown\u2019s stealth taxes? How are pensioners on fixed incomes meant to cope with an ever-increasing Council Tax? And what a way to treat people who have worked hard and saved all their lives to make them fill in a twelve page means test form to get what they are due. I want to live in a country where we honour our older generations, cherish their wisdom and care for their needs. A country where they can live out their days in security and with dignity. Respected. Protected.To those who have given so much, we must surely give more. That is why in our first month David Willetts will take steps to restore the link between pensions and earnings. There\u2019ll be an extra £7 a week if you live on your own, and an extra £11 a week for a couple. We need a Government which gives pensioners back their dignity. That\u2019s what most people want. But only a Conservative Government will deliver it. So my message to you is simple. If you want to give pensioners back their dignity, whatever party you are from, come and join us.Action on taxBut pensioners are not the only ones who have been let down. Everyone\u2019s been let down by Labour on tax. I want to help those who want to get on in life. The family with a new baby who need a bigger home. The couple who both work, but still don\u2019t seem able to make ends meet. Today they are all paying the price of a government that is taxing too much. Young couples, wanting to buy their first home, face hundreds of pounds of Stamp Duty. The poorest households shoulder the highest burden. And teachers, doctors and policemen now pay top rate Income Tax. People who bought their council houses in the 1980s are now being clobbered by Inheritance Tax. This is all wrong. It\u2019s unfair.And there\u2019s more trouble ahead. Whatever the uncertainty about Tony Blair\u2019s future, one thing is certain. If Labour were to win again, we\u2019d have Blair\u2019s third term tax rises. And they\u2019d be painful indeed. Council Tax for the typical family of £2,000 a year. Conservatives will stop Blair\u2019s third term tax rises dead in their tracks. We\u2019ll get a grip on public spending. We\u2019ll save billions of pounds by cutting government waste. And that will help to put us back on the path to lower taxes.People work hard for their money and they deserve to keep more of it. Families know better than any government can how best to spend their money. So be in no doubt. When I can, I will cut taxes. This week we have set out the taxes we have in our sights, the taxes I want to make fairer, simpler, lower. But I\u2019m not like Tony Blair, I\u2019m not going to make promises I can\u2019t keep. I don\u2019t want you to leave this hall today with a false prospectus. We must be honest with the British people. It\u2019s that word again - accountability.Action on EuropeI want to be accountable on Europe, too. On day one, we will set the date for the referendum on the Constitution. So if the election is next May, we will hold that referendum before we meet again next October. Europe isn\u2019t working properly today and the Constitution will only make matters worse. The European Union is spewing out too many regulations. It\u2019s holding our economy back. We cannot go on like this. It is a recipe for certain economic decline. We need a new approach to Europe. Let me explain why.The British people don\u2019t want to be part of a European super-state. But other European governments are determined to press ahead with ever closer integration. Britain has tried to stop them. So all we get are arguments and bust-ups. Everyone feels frustrated. It\u2019s not a terribly clever policy. This is what I will do. Some of our European partners want to integrate further. I\u2019ll say to them - fine. Britain will no longer try and stop you. But we must have something in return. We want to bring powers back from Brussels to Britain.It is not enough to say No to the European Constitution - though a Conservative Government will. It is not enough to say No to the Euro - though a Conservative Government will. It\u2019s time we went further. We want out of the social chapter, which is a threat to British jobs. We want out of the common fisheries policy, which is destroying communities. And we want more British aid to be distributed from London and less from Brussels. It\u2019s time to bring powers back to Britain. There\u2019s a word for it - accountability. That\u2019s what most people want. But only a Conservative Government can deliver it. So my message to you is simple. If you want to bring powers back from Brussels to Britain, whatever party you\u2019re from, come and join us.Action on immigrationThe British people are open, generous and compassionate. We have a proud tradition of giving refuge to people fleeing persecution, and welcoming families who want to settle here and work. We have a long tradition of firm but fair immigration controls. But today, immigration is chaotic and out of control. Four out of five failed asylum seekers are never removed from the country. And government officials have granted work permits which they knew to be fraudulent. All this rankles with people. They feel their tolerance and fairness are being abused. And they are increasingly concerned about the impact of immigration on our public services - our schools, hospitals and transport. But that\u2019s hardly surprising.Immigration has doubled under Labour. And we have a Home Secretary who believes that there is \u2018no obvious upper limit to legal immigration.\u2019 I think we\u2019ve reached a turning point. We cannot allow unlimited immigration to Britain to continue. We need a Government that gets a grip on this shambles. A government which helps genuine refugees. A government that gives priority to families who want to come here, work hard and make a positive contribution to our country. So in week one, Michael Ancram will signal Britain\u2019s intention to pull out of the 1951 UN Refugee Convention. We want asylum cases to be decided more quickly and more fairly. We want to allow genuine refugees to get to the front of the queue. That\u2019s what I call fair. And in month one, we\u2019ll set out plans to enable Parliament to put an annual limit on the number of people who come to Britain. No Conservative Home Secretary will ever say \u2018there is no obvious limit to legal immigration.\u2019Dangerous worldWhen the Cold War ended, we all hoped that our children and grandchildren would grow up in a safer world. That hope was shattered on September 11th 2001. Our world changed. Taking a plane, going on the Tube - all these things suddenly carried a new risk. Meanwhile, we face the spread of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. How do we confront this sense of insecurity? How do we tackle these threats? First, people need to be told the truth about the threats we face. And if we consider the threat to our freedom and our interests merit military action, we should not flinch.Every day, British servicemen and women face great danger in Iraq. The way they carry out their duties does Britain proud, and makes Britain proud. I believe it was right to go to war, that\u2019s a controversial view. Many people would prefer me to say something else. But that is how I see it. And I owe it to you to tell you how I see it. The world is a better place without Saddam Hussein. Saddam had provoked two wars in the Gulf. He had used chemical weapons against other nations and against his own people. No one knew if and when he would get his hands on more weapons of mass destruction. So I think it was right to go to war. But I also think its right to tell the truth.In the run-up to the war, Tony Blair did not tell the truth. He did not give a truthful account of the intelligence he received. He did not behave as a British Prime Minister should. Tony Blair has said that mistakes were made. He has said he accepts responsibility. But it is not a question of responsibility. It is a question of credibility. I hope that we will not face another war. But the world is a very dangerous place, and you can never be sure. What if this Prime Minister asks people to trust him again? Could the British people trust him a second time? Conservative beliefsIf you want people to trust you, you must trust them. Of course, I don\u2019t believe that we are right about everything and Labour politicians are wrong about everything. Neither party has a monopoly on virtue. But I do believe that there are times in our history when Conservative ideas are more relevant to the challenges Britain faces. And we have reached one of those times today. I am a Conservative because I believe that if people are given a choice, they will make the right decision for themselves and their families. I am a Conservative because I understand that families are better at spending their hard earned cash than governments are. I am a Conservative because I want people to be big, and the State to be small. I am a Conservative because I know that government should be accountable to the people, not people to the government. And I am a Conservative because I have an inherent belief in fair play.No one should be over-mighty - not the trade unions, not the State, not corporations, not the European Union, not even the Prime Minister. We want to live in a society where people have the freedom to get on in life and get on with their lives, safe in the knowledge that government will provide them with security. Freedom and security: two timeless Conservative ambitions. This is what makes me a Conservative. And I believe it\u2019s what makes all of you Conservatives.So when people ask you on the doorstep, \u2018I can\u2019t stand Tony Blair, but why should I vote for you lot?\u2019 Here are ten words to remember. School discipline. More police. Cleaner hospitals. Lower taxes. Controlled immigration.Ten words to address the problems that are worrying people today. Remember those words. And remember one more: accountability. Don\u2019t forget to tell them. We won\u2019t just make a difference, we\u2019ll be different. We\u2019ll be accountable to them. We\u2019ll do what we say. There\u2019ll be less talk, more action. Optimistic about our people\u2019s future? Yes. Ambitious for Britain? Certainly. But always utterly practical. Ours is a philosophy that is rooted in reality. And it delivers. Britain is the best country in the world. It delivers for our country. We all love our country. But everything I have and everything I am I owe to this country.I was born in July 1941, two weeks after Hitler invaded Russia. Those were very dark days. In the next four years, millions of people were killed. Many lost their lives on the battlefield, at sea and in the air. Many lost their lives in cities blitzed from the air. And many lost their lives in the concentration camps set up by one of the cruellest tyrannies the world has ever known. My grandmother was one of those killed in the concentration camps. If it hadn\u2019t been for Winston Churchill, and if it hadn\u2019t been for Britain, I would have been one of them too. That\u2019s why when I say I owe everything I am to this country, I really do mean it. I owe my life to it.My father told me Britain was the best country in the world. I think it was. And I think it still is. But I know we could be doing so much better. And it\u2019s because I think I can help make things better that I am standing before you today. Put simply, I\u2019m here so I can give back to Britain a tiny fraction of what Britain has given to me.

aVI was always taught that it doesn\u2019t matter what you do in life, as long as you do it to the best of your ability. And that is what I have always endeavoured to do. When I became leader, I knew we had a hard slog ahead of us. But I was determined to give it my all. Not just for my Party - but for my country. Because I wanted to give back to Britain a tiny bit of what Britain has given to me. We were disciplined. We were united. And, yes, we did make progress.For the first time in twenty two years, we came out of an election with many more MPs than we had when we went into it. We won more votes than Labour in England. And we made crucial issues like school discipline, respect and immigration the most important in British politics. But at the end of the day we didn\u2019t win - and let\u2019s be honest with each other: we didn\u2019t even come close to winning. My best turned out to be not good enough.A year ago, I stood before you and stressed the importance of accountability. In the real world, I said, if you say you\u2019re going to do something, you do it. And if you screw up, you risk losing your job. But politicians, I said, seem to live in a different world: a world where promises are dropped just as casually as they\u2019re made; a world where figures are fiddled; a world where there don\u2019t seem to be any penalties for failure.I promised that Conservatives would be different; that we would be accountable; and that if people didn\u2019t deliver, they\u2019d be out. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m standing down. It\u2019s about keeping your promises, it\u2019s called accountability. And looking at the Liberal Democrats and Labour, there\u2019s something to be said for going and being asked to stay, rather than staying and being asked to go. My successor has a clear and simple task: to regain for our Party the trust and respect of the British people. After this week, I know we can do it. But it will take a lot of hard work.If anyone here today thinks that we can just sit tight and wait for the pendulum to swing back to the Conservatives - think again. Of course this is a great party: the longest-standing, most successful party in the history of democracy. Of course we should be proud of what Conservatives have achieved. It was a Conservative, Wilberforce, who led the fight against the slave trade. It was a Conservative, Shaftesbury, who led the fight against child labour. It was a Conservative, Churchill, who led the fight against fascism. It was a Conservative, Margaret Thatcher, who helped win the Cold War, brought home ownership within reach of the majority and freed Britain from socialism. We Conservatives changed Britain and we changed her for the better. But no party, however much it has achieved in the past, is entitled to power in the future. No party has a God-given right to govern. There is no \u2018natural party of government.\u2019 The right to govern is a privilege we have to earn. And we will only earn it if we are clear, confident and consistent about what it means to be a Conservative.When you are in opposition, it\u2019s hard to prove that you mean what you say - that you will deliver what you promise. You cannot change the world. You haven\u2019t the power to do so. But you can show, by how you act and by what you say, that you are competent to govern. Competence is built on discipline. Of course we need discussion and debate. But let\u2019s not be offensive about each other. Let\u2019s not run down our Party. Let\u2019s show we can elect a new leader without bitterness and backbiting. And then let\u2019s unite behind that new leader not just for a year or two, but for a whole Parliament, even when the going gets tough. Unity and discipline are essential. And I promise you this. Whoever you choose to succeed me I shall support to the utmost of my ability. And I expect each and every one of you, and each and every one of our Members of Parliament, to do the same.This week we\u2019ve heard a lot about change. And, yes, we must change. We must not be obsessed by talking about ourselves, to ourselves, at Westminster. We must engage with the vast majority of people who often - quite rightly - see Westminster as a remote and distant place, unconnected to the real world. These people don\u2019t think that our country is on its knees - far from it. They like the buzz and excitement of our culture, our diversity, our individuality. They are deeply proud of Britain. You saw that when we won the Ashes, a win that brought thousands of people out onto the streets of London, just weeks after terrorists had attacked the Capital. And they\u2019re excited about the Olympics coming to London, and what a tribute that success was to a Conservative, Seb Coe, and his team. These people have high hopes for Britain. They see a glass half full. They\u2019re looking to the future, confident that Britain\u2019s best days lie ahead, and so must we.In 1979, we won more support among young people than in the electorate overall. Not by trying to be hip and cool, but by showing that we understood young people\u2019s aspirations. They wanted a Britain where they would have more freedom, more opportunity and more power to better themselves, their families and their communities. And now think about this: at the next general election, people born in 1990 will be able to vote for the first time. They were born in the last months of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s Premiership. They were born after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Their youth has been shaped by the internet and the iPod, by cheap flights and mobile phones. It has been overshadowed by the destruction of the Twin Towers and the bombings in London, Bali and Madrid. And it\u2019s been fired up by impatience for action on climate change and desperate poverty in Africa. So we must talk about what matters to them in today\u2019s world - their world, the world as it is, not the world as it was.Of course, we must hold true to Conservative values: the timeless values, rooted in human nature, values of personal responsibility, free enterprise, fair play and a sense of nationhood. But we must apply them to the challenges that Britain faces today: challenges to our values, our security and our society. How is it that when the vast majority of people play by the rules, communities across Britain are terrorised by an unruly minority who have no respect for their neighbours? Why do we, as a society, allow that minority to flout authority and get away with it - again and again? The scales of justice have tipped too far in favour of the rights of the individual at the expense of responsibility to the community. And it\u2019s that obsession with individual rights that is at the heart of the breakdown of respect in our society. When a schoolboy arsonist has his exclusion from school overturned on the basis that it denied him a \u2018right to education\u2019 you have to wonder what kind of world it is that were living in. The truth is, that political correctness turbo - charged by the Human Rights Act - is undermining a very precious British value: the value of fair play. Fairness really matters to people. It matters to me.Anyone who\u2019s had children knows that one of the first arguments they ever make is \u2018that\u2019s not fair.\u2019 Yet for far too long those of us on the right of politics have shied away from talking about fairness. Often we\u2019ve just seemed to shrug our shoulders and say \u2018well, life isn\u2019t fair.\u2019 That\u2019s true. We are born with different abilities and aptitudes. As I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve noticed, Sandra was always more likely to succeed as a model than me. But people are entitled to expect that their Government will treat them fairly. We are one country, one nation and we should all he bound by the same rules. Special rules for special interest groups breed anger and division. They blur the distinction between right and wrong. And they give the impression that some people are above the law.No one should be over-powerful: not ministers; not trade unions; not corporations; not the European Union. Wherever we see bullying by the over-mighty, we must stand up to it. Wherever we see one group flicking two fingers to the law, we must fight back. We must never forget that our duty is to stand up for those who do the right thing. It is our responsibility to protect their freedoms - whoever they are, wherever they live, whatever their background. And today those freedoms are threatened by terrorists. We face a choice in how we address this threat. Some say that immediate withdrawal from Iraq or a fair settlement for the Palestinians would deprive the terrorists of their recruiting sergeant. Few are keener than I am to see a secure Israel living beside a genuinely viable Palestinian State - or for Iraq to be able to maintain its own security.But let\u2019s not delude ourselves. The terrorist goal is not an end to Western involvement in Iraq or the creation of a Palestinian State. It is the destruction of Western society and democracy, which they believe are fundamentally corrupt and weak. So if we respond with weakness or equivocation it will only encourage the terrorists further. Let\u2019s start by confidently speaking up for democracy and Western values: freedom of speech, the rule of law, free elections and the equality of women. And let\u2019s take the practical steps needed to defend those values.We\u2019re an island. We\u2019re the fourth richest nation in the world. So our Government has the means to secure our borders. It just lacks the competence. That\u2019s why our immigration system is in such a shambles. We need to know who is coming into and leaving our country - that means controlling immigration. To me, that is a statement of the blindingly obvious. It\u2019s not about shoring up some core vote. It\u2019s about protecting our country. And no one - not Tony Blair, not Charles Kennedy, not the media nor anyone else - should stop us from saying so.To protect our country we need laws that are robust and effective. So we\u2019ve given our support in principle to many of the Government\u2019s proposals. But we will scrutinise each and every one of them in minute detail. Some of the new powers are far-reaching. So we have a simple test. No law should undermine the basic freedoms which we are seeking to defend. And we will not be reassured by Labour promises that they will be used with common sense.Why? Because last week in Brighton, a man, an eighty two year old man, was detained using anti-terror legislation because he dared to disagree with the Foreign Secretary. Legislation that very same Foreign Secretary had promised \u2018would not threaten in any way the right to demonstrate peacefully.\u2019 That should never have happened and should never be allowed to happen again. If we are to have new laws against terrorism, we must make sure that they are used against their real targets, not against innocent people who represent no terrorist threat at all.I\u2019m sometimes asked if I had made it to Number 10, what is the one thing I would like to have achieved. Well, when I applied to university a very long time ago, I wrote an essay called \u2018Why I am an Angry Young Man.\u2019 I saw Britain then as a country too stratified, too hidebound, where people tended to be judged on their background, not on merit. I saw a country in which too few people were able to make the best of their lives. And I knew then that it was the Conservatives who were best placed to change things. And I know that\u2019s still true today.So had I become Prime Minister, my ambition would have been for everyone - whatever their background or the colour of their skin - to have the chance to make the most of their talents and abilities, to climb as high as their ambitions can take them, to live the British Dream. I hope that dream will not be forgotten. Conservatism must once again become the language of hope: hope for those who live in poverty in our inner cities, hope for the immigrants who come here and settle, hope for all those communities left behind and forgotten.We have probably four years to the next general election. And we have made progress in the last two. Just look at our fifty-four newly elected MPs and you\u2019ll see that our Party has a bright and promising future. But we still have a long way to go. It will be hard - picking yourself up after defeat always is. We\u2019ll need stamina and comradeship. We\u2019ll need to show respect for each other, as well as for our opponents. We\u2019ll not always agree, but when we differ we must do so as friends, not as foes. We must build afresh acting with humility and in the knowledge that our Party has to earn the privilege of government.This is the last time I shall address you from a Conference platform. We go back, you and I - a long way. I became an active member of our Party when I was at Cambridge nearly fifty years ago. It was here in Blackpool in 1970 that I first addressed this Conference. It took me a long time to find a seat - I was keener on the idea than some of you were. But I\u2019ve been a Member of Parliament for twenty-two years. It took me a long time to become your leader, but I am profoundly grateful for the privilege of having led you. I love this Party, a party which has given so much to our country for so long and which will do so again in the future. I am intensely and immensely proud of this Party, and proud of you.Britain deserves better than she has today and it is your duty to provide it. So as you leave this conference my message, my last message to you, is this: Hold your heads up high. Be strong and of good courage. Unite behind a new leader. And then fight to build a better Britain. Go for it.

aVIt\u2019s a huge honour to be standing before you as leader of the Conservative Party. And first of all I want to thank you for the support you\u2019ve given me in the past ten months. It\u2019s been a time of great change. I\u2019m already on my second leader of the Liberal Democrats. Before long I\u2019ll be on to my second Labour Prime Minister. Soon I\u2019ll be the longest-serving leader of a major British political party. I wanted this job for a very simple reason. I love this country. I have great ambitions for our future. And I want the Party I love\u2026 \u2026to serve the country I love\u2026 \u2026in helping Britain be the best that it can. We need to change in order to have that chance. You cannot shape the future if you\u2019re stuck in the past. You knew that. And that\u2019s why you voted for change. I believe we can all be proud of what we\u2019ve achieved these past ten months. People looking at us with new interest. 25,000 new members. And in our first electoral test, in the local elections, we won forty per cent of the vote. Let\u2019s hear it for our fantastic local councillors who worked so hard and won so well. Tony Blair says it\u2019s all style and no substance. In fact he wrote me a letter about it. Dear Kettle\u2026 You\u2019re black. Signed, Pot. What a nerve that man has got. In the whole of the last year, there is only one substantial thing that the Labour Party has achieved for our country. Their education reforms. Right now, across the country, trust schools are being prepared with greater freedoms to teach children the way teachers and parents want. The only reason \u2013 the only reason - that\u2019s happening is because the Conservative Party did the right thing and took the legislation through the House of Commons. I\u2019m proud of that \u2013 proud of us, for putting the future of our children before party politics. Another sign of our changing fortunes is the impressive array of speakers who have come to join us at our conference this year. SENATOR McCAIN And I\u2019d like to pay a special tribute to one in particular. He\u2019s a man who knows about leadership. He\u2019s endured hardship that\u2019s unimaginable to many of us here. And he\u2019s fought battles for principles that we all admire. Who knows what the future may hold? But John, I for one would be proud to see you \u2013 a great American and a great friend to Britain - as leader of the free world. COLLEAGUES I\u2019d also like to pay tribute to my colleagues who have spoken already today. A year ago, David Davis and I were rivals. Today we\u2019re partners. He has given me the most fantastic support over these past ten months. Ideas, energy, advice. He has not only helped bring this Party together\u2026 \u2026he has helped take our Party in the right direction, and I want to thank him for all he\u2019s done. And I\u2019m proud to work with another man who is a brave politician, a wise counsellor and a great Conservative. A man who would be a Foreign Secretary that this country could be truly proud of: William Hague. Then there\u2019s Francis. I know Francis likes to pretend that everything is doom and gloom. He\u2019s always talking about the mountain we have to climb. He\u2019s so gloomy, he makes Gordon Brown look like a ray of sunshine. But Francis, you\u2019re doing a great job. LABOUR SPLITS AND BACKSTABBING Of course Francis has long told us to avoid the point-scoring and name-calling that can give politics such a bad name. He\u2019s right. But we didn\u2019t bargain on the Labour Party. First Gordon said he could never trust Tony again, then Tony called Gordon a blackmailer. Charles said Gordon was stupid, then John popped up and said no, Tony was stupid. Charles called Gordon a deluded control freak. And a member of the Cabinet said \u201cit would be an absolute effing disaster\u201d if Gordon got to No.10. That was just the husbands. When I look at these Labour ministers I ask myself how much time they\u2019re worrying about their own jobs\u2026 \u2026and how much time they\u2019re worrying about NHS, about crime, about our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. You only have to ask the question to know what the answer is. And there are months more of it still to come. Months of infighting, instability, indecision, jockeying for position\u2026 They said it would be a \u201cstable and orderly transition.\u201d Yeah, right. Like they said \u201c24 hours to save the NHS\u201d, \u201ceducation education education.\u201d These are the things they should be fighting for, but they\u2019re too busy fighting each other. OUR RESPONSIBILITY So we have a great responsibility. To set out a clear, united and credible alternative. With some elections, you just know the result before a single vote has been cast. We were never going to win in 1997. People wanted change. I remember it well. I fought Stafford. And Stafford fought back. Labour were never going to win in 1983 when they offered Michael Foot as Prime Minister. Other elections are wide open. And the next election will be one of those. But we will not win, nor deserve to win, without a clear purpose and a proper plan. We must learn from Labour\u2019s big mistake. When Tony Blair won his first election, he had only one clear purpose: to win a second term. Even now he says that the only legacy \u2013 the only legacy - that really matters to him is Labour winning a fourth term. Back in 1997, he had no proper plan. No real understanding of how to make change happen. He had good intentions. But he hadn\u2019t worked out how to deliver them. So New Labour went round and round in circles. They abolished grant maintained schools - and now they\u2019re trying to recreate them. They reversed our NHS reforms - and now they\u2019re trying to bring them back. Road building \u2013 cancelled, then reinstated. They wasted time, wasted money, wasted the country\u2019s goodwill. Only now, after nine years, does Tony Blair seem clear about his purpose. Well I\u2019m sorry Mr Blair. That\u2019s nine years too late. THIS WEEK We won\u2019t make the same mistake. On Wednesday, the last day of our conference, I want to talk in detail about the important issues we face as a nation \u2013 and what our response will be. But today, on this first day of our conference, I\u2019d like to set the scene for our discussions this week. I want to explain how we will arrive at the next election knowing exactly what we want to do, and how we\u2019re going to do it. My argument is based on a simple analogy. Getting ready for the responsibility of government is like building a house together. Think of it in three stages. First you prepare the ground. Then you lay the foundations. And then, finally, brick by brick, you build your house. PREPARING THE GROUND These last ten months, we have been preparing the ground. Our Party\u2019s history tells us the ground on which political success is built. It is the centre ground. Not the bog of political compromise. Not the ideological wilderness, out on the fringes of debate. But the solid ground where people are. The centre ground is where you find the concerns, the hopes and the dreams of most people and families in this country. In 1979, they wanted a government to tame the unions, rescue our economy and restore Britain\u2019s pride. Margaret Thatcher offered precisely that alternative. And this Party can forever take pride in her magnificent achievements. Today, people want different things. The priorities are different. Safer streets. Schools that teach. A better quality of life. Better treatment for carers. That\u2019s what people are talking about today. But for too long, we were having a different conversation. Instead of talking about the things that most people care about, we talked about what we cared about most. While parents worried about childcare, getting the kids to school, balancing work and family life - we were banging on about Europe. As they worried about standards in thousands of secondary schools, we obsessed about a handful more grammar schools. As rising expectations demanded a better NHS for everyone, we put our faith in opt-outs for a few. While people wanted, more than anything, stability and low mortgage rates, the first thing we talked about was tax cuts. For years, this country wanted \u2013 desperately needed - a sensible centre-right party to sort things out in a sensible way. Well, that\u2019s what we are today. In these past ten months we have moved back to the ground on which this Party\u2019s success has always been built. The centre ground of British politics. And that is where we will stay. LAYING THE FOUNDATIONS \u2013 SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY But preparing the ground is just the first stage. Now we must show what we will build there. A strong government needs strong foundations. And I want us to lay those foundations this week. That\u2019s not about individual policies. It is about a vision of the Britain we want to see. A Britain where we do not just ask what government can do. We ask what people can do, what society can do. A Britain where we stop thinking you can pass laws to make people good. And start realising that we are all in this together. Social responsibility \u2013 that is the essence of liberal Conservatism. That is the idea I want us to explain this week. That is what we stand for. That is what we\u2019re fighting for. That is the Britain we want to build. Take fighting crime. It is not just a state responsibility. It is a social responsibility. Let\u2019s not pretend that all we need is tough talk and tough laws to bring safety to our streets. Of course the state must play its part. That\u2019s why we\u2019re developing a programme of radical police reform. That\u2019s why we want to build more prisons and reform the ones we\u2019ve got, so they help reduce re-offending instead of encouraging it. And that\u2019s why we\u2019ll invest in drug rehabilitation, so we help addicts get clean and stay clean, instead of living a life of crime to feed their habit. But that is not the end of the story. It is just the start. We need parents to bring up their children with the right values. We need schools to be places of discipline and order. We need to stand up for civilised values in public places. We need to design crime out of the housing estates of the future. We\u2019ve got to stop selling alcohol to children. We need the music industry to understand that profiting from violent and homophobic words and images is morally wrong and socially unacceptable. But more than this, we need people, families, communities, businesses to step up to the plate and understand that it\u2019s not just about stopping the bad things\u2026 \u2026it\u2019s about actively doing the good things. Not waiting for the state to do it all, but taking responsibility, making a difference, saying loudly and proudly: this is my country, this is my community: I will play my part. That is social responsibility. That is our idea. So I want us to be the champions of a new spirit of social responsibility in this land. A new spirit of social responsibility that will succeed for Britain where Labour\u2019s outdated state responsibility has failed. LABOUR\u2019S APPROACH Think of any issue - not just crime - and then think of Labour\u2019s response. This Government\u2019s way of doing things \u2013 the old way of doing things - is so familiar, and so depressing. Ministers hold a summit. They announce an eye-catching initiative. A five-year plan. Gordon Brown generously finds the money for it. The money gets a headline, but no-one knows what to do with it. So they create a unit in the Cabinet Office. A task force is set up. Regional co-ordinators are appointed. Gordon Brown sets them targets \u2013 after all, it is his money. Pilot schemes are launched. The pilot schemes are rolled out across the country. They are evaluated. Then revised, re-organised and re-launched. And then finally, once the reality dawns that the only people to benefit are the lawyers, accountants and consultants of Labour\u2019s quango army\u2026 \u2026with a pathetic whimper \u2013 but no hint of an apology \u2013 the whole thing is just abandoned. We\u2019ve seen too much of this in the past nine years. Headline after headline but absolutely no follow-through. It is a story of ignorance, incompetence, arrogance. A story of wasted billions - and disappointed millions. Somewhere out there, there is a place where Blair and Brown will never go. It\u2019s dark. It\u2019s depressing. It\u2019s haunted by the failures of nine years of centralisation, gimmick and spin. It is the graveyard of initiatives, where you\u2019ll find the e-University that died a death, the drugs czar that came and went\u2026 \u2026the Individual Learning Accounts that collapsed in fraud and waste, the tax credits that were paid and reclaimed\u2026 \u2026the Connexions service that flopped, the Strategic Health Authorities that were dropped\u2026 \u2026the marching of yobs to the hole in the wall; the night courts that never happened at all. And still they keep coming, those hubristic monuments to big government, the living dead that walk the well-trodden path from Downing Street and the Treasury to New Labour\u2019s graveyard of initiatives. The NHS computer: delayed, disorganised, a £20 billion shambles. Forced police mergers: the direct opposite of the community policing we need. And then the perfect example. ID cards. When a half-way competent government would be protecting our security by controlling our borders\u2026 \u2026these Labour ministers are pressing ahead with their vast white elephant, their plastic poll tax, twenty Millennium Domes rolled into one giant catastrophe in the making. They\u2019ve given up trying to find a good reason for it. Last week Tony Blair said that ID cards would help control immigration, when new immigrants won\u2019t even have them. Does he even know what\u2019s going on in his Government? ID cards are wrong, they\u2019re a waste of money, and we will abolish them. These last nine years have been the story of a Government which instinctively believes, whatever it says, that everything is the state\u2019s responsibility. We believe in social responsibility. Because there is such a thing as society, it\u2019s just not the same thing as the state. THE BRITAIN WE WANT TO SEE So let us define this week the kind of Britain we want to see. And let us show how our idea \u2013 social responsibility\u2026 \u2026not Labour\u2019s idea \u2013 state responsibility\u2026 \u2026is the right response to the challenges Britain faces. GLOBALISATION, WELL-BEING, THE ENVIRONMENT We know that in the age of globalisation, in the face of fast-moving economic change, people want their government to provide security. We know that the end of the traditional 9 to 5 job can make life tough for families, and people look to their government for answers. And we know that in the race against time to tackle climate change and protect the environment, people expect their government to show leadership. On all these challenges, Labour\u2019s first response is to regulate business, hoping to offer protection. It may sound attractive. But there are unintended consequences. Well-intentioned regulation can make us less secure in the age of globalisation. Less able to provide the jobs, wealth and opportunity on which well-being depends. It can undermine the competitiveness of our companies, so it\u2019s harder for them to invest in the new, green technologies of the future. So our response, based on our philosophy of social responsibility, is to say to business: Yes you should look after your workers, yes you should look after your community, yes you should look after our environment. And we must stand up to big business when it\u2019s in the interests of Britain and the wider world. So next week our MEPs will vote to strengthen proposals to make companies replace dangerous chemicals with safe ones. But where Labour are casual about increasing regulation, we will be careful. We will ask: Are we making it easier to start a business? Easier to employ someone? Is the overall burden of regulation going down? Will the regulation that\u2019s being put forward lead to real changes in behaviour, or just time-wasting and box-ticking? If only we had a government that was asking these questions today. We want companies to create their own solutions to social and environmental challenges, because those are the solutions most likely to last. So in a Conservative Britain, corporate responsibility will provide the best long-term answer to economic insecurity, well-being in the workplace, and environmental care. It is the same approach when you look at the other great challenges we face. PUBLIC SERVICES We know that in an age of amazing technological advance, instant information exchange, and empowered consumers who don\u2019t have the deference of previous generations\u2026 \u2026people expect more from our health service and our schools. And government has to respond to that. Labour\u2019s response is the culture of targets, directives and central control, aimed at raising standards in our public services. They mean well. But the unintended consequence is to make these services less responsive to the people who use them, dashing expectations not meeting them. So our response, based on our philosophy of social responsibility, is to say to our nurses, doctors, teachers: Yes you should meet higher standards, yes you should give your patients and your pupils more. But we\u2019re not going to tell you how to do it. You are professionals. We trust in your vocation So in a Conservative Britain, professional responsibility will provide the answer to rising expectations in the NHS and schools. POVERTY AND REGENERATION And just as people will no longer accept second best in public services, we know that in their communities they are fed up with squalor and poverty and crime\u2026 \u2026and they look to their leaders to sort things out. Labour\u2019s response has been a massive expansion of central government into local communities. The centralised Neighbourhood Renewal Unit, the insensitive Pathfinder programme, prescriptive top-down schemes for regeneration. You can see why Labour have done it. But the unintended consequence is to stifle the very spirit of community self-improvement that they are responding to. Our response, based on our philosophy of social responsibility, is to trust local leaders, not undermine them. So we will hand power and control to local councils and local people who have the solutions to poverty, to crime, to urban decay in their hands. We trust in your knowledge and commitment. So in a Conservative Britain, civic responsibility will provide the answer to improving the quality of life in the communities left behind. CHILDREN And then perhaps the greatest challenge of all. The challenge of bringing up children in a world that often seems fraught with risk and danger. There is nothing that matters more to me than the safety and happiness of my family. Of course it\u2019s right that government should be on parents\u2019 side. But Labour take it way too far. A national database of every child. Making childcare a state monopoly. Slapping ASBOs on children who haven\u2019t even been born. Labour\u2019s intentions may be good. But the unintended consequence is to create a culture of irresponsibility. They may have abandoned Clause 4 and the nationalisation of industry. But they are replacing it with the nationalisation of everyday life. The state can never be everywhere, policing the interactions of our daily lives - and it shouldn\u2019t try. Real change will take years of patient hard work, and we will test every policy by asking: does it enhance parental responsibility? We need to understand that cultural change is worth any number of government initiatives. Who has done more to improve school food, Jamie Oliver, or the Department of Education? Put another way, we need more of Supernanny, less of the nanny state. So in a Conservative Britain, personal responsibility will provide the best answer to the risks and dangers of the modern world. Personal responsibility. Professional responsibility. Corporate responsibility. Civic responsibility. These are the four pillars of our social responsibility. That is the Britain we want to build. A Britain that is more green. More family-friendly. More local control over the things that matter. Less arrogant about politicians\u2019 ability to do it all on their own. But more optimistic about what we can achieve if we all work together. We want an opportunity society, not an overpowering state. BUILDING OUR HOUSE This week, in our debates, we will lay the foundations of the house we are building together. The foundations must come first. How superficial, how insubstantial it would be, for us to make up policies to meet the pressures of the moment. Policy without principle is like a house without foundations. It will not stand the test of time. That is what our Policy Review is all about: getting it right for the long term. OPTIMISM ABOUT BRITAIN\u2019S FUTURE If we do this, we can help achieve so much for this country. In a few years\u2019 time, Britain could wake up to a bright new morning. We have everything to be optimistic about. You could not design a country with better natural advantages than we have. We speak the language of the world. We have links of history and culture with every continent on earth. We have institutions \u2013 our legal system, our armed forces, the BBC, our great universities \u2013 which set the standard that all other countries measure themselves by. Our artists, writers and musicians inspire people the world over. We are inventive, creative, irreverent and daring. In this young century, these old advantages give us the edge we need. CONCLUSION What a prospect for a great Party \u2013 to guide our nation at this time of opportunity. So let us stick to the plan. Let us build - carefully, thoughtfully and patiently, a new house together. Preparing the ground as we move to the centre, meeting the priorities of the modern world. Laying the foundations with our idea - social responsibility. And building on those foundations with the right policies for our long-term future. The nation\u2019s hopes are in our hands. People\u2019s hopes. Your hopes. My hopes. In eight days\u2019 time I will be forty years old. I have so much to look forward to. My young family. They have so much to look forward to. The world I want for them is the world I want for every family and every community. If you want to know what I\u2019m all about, I can explain it one word. That word is optimism. I am optimistic about human nature. That\u2019s why I will trust people to do the right thing. Labour are pessimists. They think that without their guidance, people will do the wrong thing. That\u2019s why they want to regulate and control. So let us show clearly which side we are on. Let optimism beat pessimism. Let sunshine win the day. And let everyone know that the Conservative Party is ready. Ready to serve. Ready to fight. Ready to win.

aVIt\u2019s been a great week. This week we\u2019ve shown we are back in the centre ground of British politics. A stable economy. Fighting crime. Backing the NHS and our state schools. Childcare and flexible working. Improving our environment and quality of life. Those are people\u2019s priorities - those are our priorities today.We\u2019ve seen fantastic new candidates, one third of them women. But it\u2019s not just who we select. It\u2019s what they do. Our new candidates are changing the way we think about politics, not just campaigning and delivering leaflets but making a difference in their community.This week we\u2019ve done that in Bournemouth. Conservatives, converting a disused church into a community centre. That\u2019s our idea - social responsibility - in action. I want to thank everyone who got involved, and in particular the local MP Tobias Ellwood and all his team who worked so hard. We are united and rejuvenated. And as this conference has shown, we are the Party that is open to new ideas and fresh thinking.Real SubstanceOn Sunday, I spoke to you about the changes we\u2019re making in our Party, and why they are so important. Today, I want to talk about what I believe in, and what we need to start doing for our country. And as I do that, I want to deal directly with this issue of substance.Substance is not about producing a ten point plan. It is about deeper things than that. It is about knowing what you believe. It is about a clear idea of the Britain you want to see.For us, that Britain is based on the idea of social responsibility. That means a Britain where instead of always turning to the state for the answers, we turn to each other and ask: what more can we do together to solve this problem? So I don\u2019t think that announcing policies in a rush amounts to substance.Real substance is about taking time to think things through, not trotting out easy answers that people might want to hear. It\u2019s about sticking to your guns. It\u2019s about character, judgment, and consistency. It\u2019s about policy, yes. But it\u2019s about getting it right for the long term. That\u2019s why I asked Oliver Letwin, one of the most intelligent and thoughtful politicians in our country, to lead our Policy Review.Tax Right, let\u2019s talk about tax. Everyone in this hall, me included, knows that a low tax economy is a strong economy. But some people want me to flash up some pie in the sky tax cuts to show what we stand for.Let me tell you straight. That is not substance. And that is not what we stand for.Do you know what I think? I think that when some people talk about substance, what they mean is they want the old policies back. Well they\u2019re not coming back. We\u2019re not going back. We\u2019ve laid it out clearly at this conference. We will not take risks with the economy. We will not make promises we can\u2019t keep.As George Osborne said in that brilliant speech yesterday, we believe in sound money and stability always comes first.EconomyGeorge has also rightly said that we need a broad-based economic policy, not just a tax policy. We need to strengthen our pensions system. Deregulate our employers and wealth-creators. Invest in education, skills, the potential of our people. Build a modern transport system. And we need to do more to promote British trade and investment.In this age of globalisation and fierce international competition from India, China, Brazil, we cannot afford to sit back. We have to fly the flag for British business.NHSAs our economy grows, one of the most important calls on the proceeds of that growth is the NHS. The NHS is vitally important to every family in this country. It certainly is to my family.I believe that the creation of the NHS is one of the greatest achievements of the 20th century.  It is founded on the noble but simple ideal that no person should ever have to worry about their healthcare. But it\u2019s about more than that. The NHS is an expression of our values as a nation. It is a symbol of collective will, of social solidarity. That is why the British people, of all political parties and of none, are so proud of it, and so attached to it.I have always believed this.But when your family relies on the NHS all the time - day after day, night after night - you really know just how precious it is.I know the problems. Turning up at A&E and the children\u2019s one is closed. Waiting for the doctor when you\u2019re desperate with worry. Waiting for the scan that is so desperately needed. It can be incredibly frustrating.But more often than not, it is an inspiration - thanks to the people who work in the NHS. The nurses who do everything to make you comfortable. The doctors who desperately want to get to the truth. And the army of support staff who get forgotten so often but who make such a difference to all of us.For me, it\u2019s not a question of saying the NHS is \u2018safe in my hands.\u2019My family is so often in the hands of the NHS. And I want them to be safe there.Tony Blair once explained his priority in three words: education, education, education. I can do it in three letters. NHS.We will serve and support the National Health Service. We will always support the NHS with the funding it needs. But we will make sure that money is well spent.Health spending has doubled under Labour. But where has all the money gone? Into pointless and contradictory reorganisations. Do you remember \u201824 hours to save the NHS\u2019? It should have been \u201824 ways to reorganise the NHS.\u2019 First they abolished the independent NHS Executive and put the Department of Health in charge. Then they abolished the eight regional NHS offices and created 28 new Strategic Health Authorities. Later they abolished the 28 new Strategic Health Authorities and created ten new regional Strategic Health Authorities. Out went GP fund holding - in came Primary Care Groups. Out went Primary Care Groups - in came Primary Care Trusts. They abolished Health Authorities. Then they created them all over again. Are you still with me?Because I can tell you, the people working in the NHS are utterly bewildered. The other day I read about a public health director who has been in his job for twelve years. Because of all the reorganisations, he\u2019s had to reapply for the job seven times. What a shambolic way to treat people. What a waste of time, what a waste of money.No wonder beds and wards are closing.No wonder that doctors and nurses are so dissatisfied with what\u2019s happening.Politicians have interfered in professional judgements and diminished professional responsibility. I\u2019ve heard it described as the \u2018death of discretion.\u2019 They join the NHS in their twenties, full of idealism and vocation. By their forties, far too many are demoralised. From idealism to demoralisation in half a career. How can we do this to people?The waste of money in the NHS is nothing next to the waste of talent and energy and hope. So I make this commitment to the NHS and all who work in it. No more pointless re-organisations. Yes, change is necessary in the NHS. But the changes we want to make are based on our idea, social responsibility. We want to see far greater professional responsibility in the NHS. And we should remember that the world of healthcare extends far beyond the hospitals and the GP surgeries.As we live longer and our society grows older, these services will play an ever-more important part in our well-being. How do we help carers go on caring? Why can\u2019t we have more occupational therapy, so people can get the adjustments to their house or flat so they can go on living at home longer? Why can\u2019t we recognise that social services isn\u2019t a Cinderella service - for many people, it\u2019s the vital service that helps them enjoy some sort of quality of life.Next week, Andrew Lansley and I launch our national campaign on the NHS. I hope that you are ready. We must get out there on the streets of this country and send this Government a clear message. They have mismanaged the NHS. Stop cutting the NHS and let\u2019s back it with all our hearts and improve it for everyone.Attitude to LabourI back the NHS because I believe in it. Standing up for your beliefs is what real substance is about. But in politics, it\u2019s also about telling the truth.Not everything that Labour have done since 1997 is bad. People don\u2019t want us to turn the clock back.  They want us to improve the bad things, yes. But they also want us to keep the good things. Like Bank of England independence. Like the minimum wage. We\u2019ll keep it and, when we can, we\u2019ll increase it.Where Labour do the right thing, like those education reforms, we\u2019ll back them.That is real substance. Standing up for what you believe. Putting your country first.  That is something that this Party has always deeply understood.Trust in PoliticsAnd let me tell you why it\u2019s so important. Twelve years ago, there was an energetic young party leader. He stood before his party conference for the first time. He said he\u2019d change his party. He made promises about changing the country. Remember him?  I do.And look what happened. People voted for him, but he let them down. So let\u2019s not think that people are going to jump from Labour straight into our arms. This is going to be slow, patient, hard work. We have to show, day by day, week by week, month by month that we deserve our country\u2019s trust.And I\u2019ll tell you something important, something substantial, that we have to change. For too long, the big political decisions in this country have been made in the wrong place. Not round the Cabinet table, where they should be. But on the sofa in Tony Blair\u2019s office. No notes are taken. No one knows who\u2019s accountable. No one takes the blame when things go wrong. That arrogant style of government must come to an end.I will restore the proper processes of government. That means building a strong team, and leading them. I want to be Prime Minister of this country. Not a President. The Price of ProgressThere is another important aspect of earning people\u2019s trust. We must face up to the fact that progress towards our nation\u2019s priorities is never free. There\u2019s always a price to be paid. Pretending that everything is simple and straightforward and can be sorted out with a wave of a minister\u2019s wand\u2026 Making out that anything is possible, everything is easy, it\u2019s all painless\u2026 That is spin.We\u2019ve seen enough of that over these last nine years. We must be different.We must show that we understand the price of progress, and tell people what it is. Not after we get into government, but before. That is real substance.GreenAs you might have gathered by now, I am passionate about our environment. It\u2019s a very personal commitment. I grew up in the countryside. I\u2019ve always loved the outdoors. As you can see if you look around this conference, I\u2019m quite keen on trees.We saw in our debate on Monday the scale of the threat from climate change. I know that we have within us the creativity, the innovation, the technological potential to achieve green growth - sustainable prosperity. The Stern Report will tell us that the tools of success are in our grasp. But it will also say that the price of inaction gets higher every day. So I will not pretend to you that it will be easy. That there will be no pain or sacrifice.If you want to understand climate change, go and see Al Gore\u2019s film, An Inconvenient Truth. Today, I want to tell the British people some uncomfortable truths. There is a price for progress in tackling climate change. Yes of course low-energy light bulbs, hybrid cars - even a windmill on your roof - can make a difference and also save money.But these things are not enough.Government must show leadership by setting the right framework. Binding targets for carbon reduction, year on year. That would create a price for carbon in our economy. What does that mean? It means that things which produce more carbon will get more expensive. Going green is not some fashionable, pain-free option. It will place a responsibility on business. It will place a responsibility on all of us. That is the point. Tackling climate change is our social responsibility - to the next generation. And I\u2019ll tell you something. In politics, it\u2019s much easier to take steps that will be painful if political parties work together, instead of playing it for partisan advantage. That\u2019s what we have offered to do. We have asked Tony Blair to put a Climate Change Bill in the Queen\u2019s Speech. If he does, we\u2019ll back it.So come on Prime Minister. It\u2019s your last few months in office. It\u2019s your last Queen\u2019s Speech. Use it to do something for the environment.HousingBut the environment isn\u2019t the only priority. There are other priorities - and sometimes they compete. Sweeping contradictions under the carpet may make life easy for a while. But it\u2019s not substance. So let us confront a tension that this Party feels very deeply.We are the Party of aspiration and opportunity, always have been; always will be. A profound part of that is owning your own home. That dream is something Conservatives instinctively understand. We also understand the importance of conservation. But if we want new homes, they must be built somewhere.Yes they must be built with care for local communities. Yes they must be built in harmony with existing architecture. And yes they must be built in sympathy with the environment. But let us not pretend there is a pain-free solution to this dilemma that satisfies every vested interest, as well as providing all the new homes we need.We must be on the side of the next generation.If we are to be the Party of aspiration, we must be on the side of aspiration. And that means building more houses and flats for young people. It is our social responsibility.ResponsibilityBefore putting myself forward for this job, I thought about all the responsibility it entails. When I spend time in a school or a hospital, I now think of the ultimate responsibility a Prime Minister has to make sure our public services are properly funded. As Prime Minister, words on the environment will have to turn into action at home and abroad.But there is no greater responsibility for a Prime Minister than protecting the security of our country and sending our armed forces into actionTroopsIn July, I went to Afghanistan to meet our troops. Some of them are just 18 years old. They\u2019ve only been in the army six months. They are fighting a ferocious enemy, day in, day out. Living off ration packs. Boiling hot days. Sleeping in the open. When you think of your own comfortable life at home, it makes you feel incredibly humble.Our mission in Afghanistan is not just a moral responsibility. It is vital to keep Britain safe. A lawless, broken Afghanistan was the cradle for the terrorist attacks of September 11th. Our armed forces are doing important work in Afghanistan and Iraq.So let the message go out from this conference, to the best armed forces in the world. You are fighting in our name and we are proud of what you do.But I want us to send our forces a second message. Responding to the questions that our troops themselves are asking.They\u2019re asking for armoured vehicles that will actually defend them against roadside bombs. They need more helicopters. They\u2019re asking to be able to phone home for more than twenty minutes a week. And they\u2019re asking for decent treatment for their families at home.You know Liam Fox. I know Liam Fox. There is someone with real passion and energy, who would never stop fighting for Britain\u2019s troops to get them all that they need.There is a big RAF base in my constituency. I know it well. I know the houses the forces\u2019 families live in. Some of them aren\u2019t good enough. I know the schools their children go to. Half the school roll changes every year and they don\u2019t have the extra support they need to cope. Meanwhile our servicemen and women pay income tax while they\u2019re fighting overseas.Our forces and their families do so much for us. And we should do more - a lot more - for them.The Threat of TerrorismOur missions in Iraq and Afghanistan remind us of the great dangers of our times. I know that if we win the next election, the moment I walk through the front door of Downing Street I will have the huge responsibility of protecting the British people from terrorism.There are some who still believe that the threat we face today is no different from ones that we have faced before, such as the IRA. They are profoundly mistaken. We are dealing with people who are prepared to do anything, kill any number, and use suicide attacks to further their aims.Defeating them will be a battle of hearts and minds, as well as force.But this threat cannot be negotiated away or appeased - it has to be confronted and overcome.SecurityWhen it comes to our national security, I will always listen to the police and security services, and take their advice with the utmost seriousness.I will never play politics with this issue. What I will do, is my duty. Which is to support the Government when they do the right thing. And hold them to account when they\u2019re getting it wrong.So let me say plainly, I believe that this Government is getting some things wrong. They\u2019re pressing ahead with ID cards that won\u2019t stop dangerous people coming into our country. But they\u2019re not giving us the border controls that just might. They\u2019re bringing in new offences that aren\u2019t being used. But they haven\u2019t changed the law so that wire tap evidence can be used to prosecute terror suspects in court.People who threaten our security should be arrested, charged, put in front of a court, tried and imprisoned. That is the British way.When I ask myself why they haven\u2019t done some of the things they should have, I keep coming back to one thing. The Human Rights Act.I believe that yes, the British people need a clear definition of their rights in this complex world. But I also believe we need a legal framework for those rights that does not hamper the fight against terrorism. That is why we will abolish the Human Rights Act and put a new British Bill of Rights in its place.CrimeProtecting our security is not just about terrorism. People\u2019s daily fear is crime.Gun crime is up, knife crime is up, there is violence and disorder on too many of our streets. But all we get from Labour are endless get-tough headlines and thousands of new criminal offences.They\u2019re not building the prisons. They\u2019re not reforming the police. They\u2019re not cancelling the early release schemes. Those are the things that need to be done.And then, in the final irony, last week Tony Blair attacked me for what I said about hoodies. In that one cheap joke, he gave up on one of the best things he ever said - that we need to be tough on the causes of crime.Everyone in this hall, everyone watching at home, knows that we will only tackle crime if we tackle family breakdown\u2026 if we tackle drug addiction\u2026 if we mend broken lives.So we have a new reality in British politics today. With David Davis as Home Secretary, this Party, the Conservative Party is the only party in Britain that will be tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime.Foreign PolicyAnd we will be tough when it comes to promoting this country\u2019s interests abroad.Last week the Prime Minister criticised me for wanting a foreign policy which was more independent of the White House. I don\u2019t need lessons in the importance of Britain\u2019s relationship with America. My grandfather went ashore in Normandy in June 1944, in a combined Anglo-American operation that liberated Western Europe from the Nazis.I became involved in politics in the 1980s, when Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan defeated the Soviet Union. Unlike some, I never had any doubts about whose side I was on in the Cold War. But now Mr. Blair objects when I say our foreign policy should not simply be unquestioning in our relationship with America.William Hague and I have said we must be steadfast not slavish in how we approach the special relationship. Apparently Tony Blair disagrees. Well if he\u2019s accusing me of wanting to be a British Prime Minister pursuing a British foreign policy, then I plead guilty.Questioning the approach of the US administration, trying to learn the lessons of the past five years, does not make you \u2018anti-American.\u2019 Ask John McCain.I\u2019m not a neo-conservative. I\u2019m a liberal Conservative.Liberal - because I believe in spreading freedom and democracy, and supporting humanitarian intervention. That is why we cannot stand by and watch further genocide in Darfur. But Conservative - because I also recognise the complexities of human nature, and will always be sceptical of grand schemes to remake the world.We need more patience, more humility in the way we engage with the world.CohesionThe same values should guide our approach to building a stronger society at home.The Cantle Report into the riots in our northern cities in 2001 talked about many communities living \u2018parallel lives.\u2019 Communities where people from different ethnic origins never meet, never talk, never go into each others\u2019 homes.Ultimately, it is an emotional connection that binds a country together. Sympathy for people you don\u2019t even know, and who may be very different to you. It is by contact that we overcome our differences - and realise that though our origins and our cultures may vary, we all share common values. The most basic contact comes from talking to each other. So we must make sure that new immigrants learn to speak English. And one of the most important ways we make connections with people is at school.So let me face head-on the question of faith schools. I know that people feel strongly about this issue. So do I. I support faith schools. Many parents want to send their children to them, and trust their judgment. All faiths want them. And let us say, clearly, that Islam is one of the great religions of the world, and that British Muslims make a fantastic contribution to our country.Today, a new generation of Muslim schools is emerging. If these schools are to be British state schools, they must be part of our society, not separate from it.The Cantle Report recommended that faith schools admit a proportion of pupils from other faiths.Only this week the Church of England said it would implement this recommendation in all new church schools it creates, admitting a quarter of pupils from non-Anglican backgrounds. That is a great example of what I mean by social responsibility. The Church deciding to take responsibility for community cohesion. Society - not the state.I believe the time has come for other faith groups to show similar social responsibility. And if we are to bring our society together, then schools - all schools - must teach children that wherever they come from, if they are British citizens, they are inheritors of a British birthright.The foundations of our society: the rule of law, democracy and individual freedom. And every child in our country, wherever they come from, must know and deeply understand what it means to be British. The components of our identity - our institutions, our language and our history.The Conservative Party must address these issues.  Real substance means addressing them openly and frankly.The issues are incredibly complicated. They will need sensitive handling. And I can\u2019t think of anyone better to do it than our Shadow Education Secretary, David Willetts.EducationAlthough we agree with Labour about trust schools, there is still a profound divide between our approach to education and Labour\u2019s. They think equality means treating every child the same. Including kids with learning difficulties in the same classes as the brightest. Forcing schools to accept disruptive pupils, putting up with bad behaviour, no matter the damage it does to the others.We think equality means something else. Individual children have individual needs, individual abilities, and individual interests. Real equality means giving every child the education that is best for them. That should mean more setting and streaming within schools - so each child can develop at the speed that works for them. It should mean clear rules of behaviour - so that our children grow up knowing the difference between right and wrong. And it means saving special schools - so that parents have choice, and children with learning difficulties can receive the care, the education and the attention they need.Social ResponsibilityBuilding a strong society is not just a task for politicians. We are all in this together. We all have a responsibility to each other.Changing Britain for the better is not just about passing laws. We\u2019ve got to be less arrogant about what politicians can achieve. Because it is not the politicians who make the wealth, who build the houses, who heal the sick. It is people. It is society, not just the state. That is why social responsibility will be the foundation for all that we do.When our Party was last in power, our task was to restore economic responsibility - putting individuals and businesses in charge of their own affairs.The task for us today is different.For years, we Conservatives talked about rolling back the state. But that is not an end in itself. Our fundamental aim is to roll forward the frontiers of society.FamilyAnd there is one vital way in which we can do that.The real privilege of my childhood was that my family was loving and close.  Families, to me, are not just the basic unit of society, they\u2019re the best. They are the ultimate source of our society\u2019s strength or weakness. Families matter because almost every social problem that we face comes down to family stability. And so I will set a simple test for each and every one of our policies: does it help families?The first thing to help families with is childcare. This is particularly vital for single parents. Why are so many single parents trapped in poverty? Partly because childcare is so costly and complicated in our country. Those of us who don\u2019t live the life of a single parent - just try and imagine it for a moment. Think about what it\u2019s like when you\u2019re left on your own to look after the kids. If I\u2019m in charge on my own for just a few hours the place looks like a bomb\u2019s hit it. Imagine looking after children all on your own all the time. And trying to get a job, trying to hold down a job with an employer who isn\u2019t understanding about the fact that you might have to disappear at a moment\u2019s notice because there\u2019s no one else in your child\u2019s life, and you are responsible.Britain has got the most expensive childcare in Europe. So we support the Government\u2019s efforts to put more money into childcare. But why are they saying you should only get help if you use formal childcare? What about the grandparents, the friends, the neighbours, who for so many families provide that lifeline by looking after the kids? So let\u2019s trust the parents in the childcare choices that they make.All families do a vital job, and they all need our support. But I also believe that marriage is a great institution, and we should support it. I\u2019m not naïve in thinking that somehow the state can engineer happy families with this policy or that tax break. All I can tell you is what I think. And what I think is this. There\u2019s something special about marriage. It\u2019s not about religion. It\u2019s not about morality. It\u2019s about commitment.When you stand up there, in front of your friends and your family, in front of the world, whether it\u2019s in a church or anywhere else, what you\u2019re doing really means something. Pledging yourself to another means doing something brave and important. You are making a commitment. You are publicly saying: it\u2019s not just about me, me, me anymore. It is about we - together, the two of us - through thick and thin. That really matters.And by the way, it means something whether you\u2019re a man and a woman, a woman and a woman or a man and another man. That\u2019s why we were right to support civil partnerships, and I\u2019m proud of that.Of course not every marriage lasts, and many couples are much better off apart. Women must have an escape route from abusive relationships.Every married couple has rows and difficulties. But if you\u2019ve made that public commitment, it just helps you try harder to work your problems through.We can argue forever about whether favouring marriage means disadvantaging other arrangements. My approach is simple. If marriage rates went up, if divorce rates came down - if more couples stayed together for longer, would our society by better off? My answer is yes.But supporting marriage is not just about money, or tax breaks. It is insulting to the human spirit to believe that a relationship between two people is just about money, or even mainly about money. It isn\u2019t.  So recognising marriage more directly in the tax system is not enough.Flexible working. Family centres. Relationship advice. All of these things matter. Let us as a society and as a culture value and recognise marriage more.ConclusionFamily. Community. Society. The NHS. The environment. Our quality of life. These are the things that matter most to me. These are the things that drive me in politics. And I want us here to be optimistic about their future.Tony Blair said Britain is a young country. He is wrong. This is an old country, with a proud past and a bright future.Look at the forces shaping our world. Technology that can topple dictators. Innovations that can tackle climate change. The prospect of global trade and investment and development that can end the spectre of poverty and heal the divisions between rich and poor.Our generation of politicians must understand these forces, must harness them for progress. We must not be the party that says the world and our country is going to the dogs. We must be the Party that lifts people\u2019s sights and raises their hopes.We are getting ready to serve again. Standing up for what we believe. Reaching out for what we can achieve.Let us be confident as we say, together, here today.The best is yet to come.

aVTwo years ago, I stood on this stage and I gave a speech - a short speech - about why I wanted to lead our Party. Today I want to make a speech about why I want to lead our country. I am afraid it is going to be a bit longer and I haven\u2019t got an autocue and I haven\u2019t got a script, I\u2019ve just got a few notes so it might be a bit messy; but it will be me.You know my favourite conference in all my years of coming wasn\u2019t that one two years ago; it was almost 20 years ago after the Berlin wall had fallen and we met in Bournemouth.When I left school, I travelled through the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc and I will never forget the dull uniformity, the greyness of life under Communism, the lack of choice, the lack of freedom, the lack of expression.And I remember that day in Bournemouth standing at the back of the hall; hairs standing up on the back of my neck as a succession of democratically elected leaders, some of them just out of prison, walked onto that stage and praised Margaret Thatcher and our party for the inspiration she gave on our long march to freedom.And I felt proud that day. I felt proud of our values, I felt proud of our party - proud of the part we had played in helping to forge a movement that brought freedom across our continent.But you know the triumphs of the past are not enough. Every generation of Conservatives has to make the argument all over again for free enterprise, for freedom, for responsibility, for limited government and that\u2019s why I stood here two years ago and said to our party, after three election defeats, that we needed to make changes and we have made those changes.Today just one in 10 of our members of Parliament are women, but almost a third of our candidates are women. I didn\u2019t do that, you did that, and you should be proud of what you\u2019ve done.Over these last two years we\u2019ve campaigned on the environment, not just on climate change, but on cleaning streets and cleaning public places, and we have won elections on the back of that. I didn\u2019t do that, you did that, and you should be proud of what you\u2019ve done.And this party - our party - has campaigned over these last two years in a way we have never done before on our National Health Service - up and down the country to save our services and to praise the people who work in the NHS. I didn\u2019t do that, you did that, and you should be proud of what you have done.But there is something else that our party is doing and has to go on doing. If we are really the One Nation Party, the Party for opportunity for everybody, it\u2019s not enough to just open the door and say \u2018please come in\u2019 - we have to get out amongst Britain\u2019s ethnic minority communities and find the brightest, the best and the most talented and get them in.And that\u2019s why I am proud that I can stand here with the first Muslim woman of a Shadow Cabinet or Cabinet in Sayeeda Warsi, who will be a great talent for our party and our country.And those changes have brought us success. In local elections we have taken Plymouth, we have taken Lincoln, we took Chester, we took the council right here in Blackpool, and as William reminded us in that great speech on Sunday, we are back in the North of England, a force to be reckoned with in every part of our country.And some people say that there is no such thing as friendship in politics, but I can tell you that when you do this job, leading our party, there is no better friend, and there is no better friend of this party, than William Hague.ChangeBut change, real change, isn\u2019t just about winning elections. Real change is about getting ready to govern our country. Real change is about doing what our party has always done, which is to make sure we understand and reflect and meet all the challenges of the modern world, and that is what we are doing. That\u2019s the argument I want to make today.We face a new world in so many different ways, and the old politics is failing and change is required. New World. Old Politics failing. Change is Required. That is what we have got to be about today.And you know, there has been quite a lot of talk of lurching, and I can tell you we are not going to be lurching to the left, we are not going to be lurching to the right. We are just going to provide the good solid leadership that this country needs. We need change for the long term, hope for our country and optimism for the next generation. That is what this week has been about and that\u2019s what I am about.Gordon BrownNow last week, in Bournemouth or Bourne Mouth, we saw the old politics on display. It wasn\u2019t just that we had heard it all before - I mean literally heard it all before. And I think quite a lot of people in America heard it all before as well.There were the GP surgery family-friendly opening hours \u2013 we\u2019ve had that one three times before; eco towns - four times before; competitive sport in our schools - six times before, and no indication about how any of these things are going to be done.But it wasn\u2019t just that, it was the cynicism of it. He told us things that he knows he can\u2019t do: \u2018British jobs for British workers\u2019 is illegal under EU law. \u2018Deporting people for gun and knife crime,\u2019 you can\u2019t do that because of the Human Rights Act. I have to say to our Prime Minister: \u2018If you treat people like fools you don\u2019t deserve to run the country, let alone win an election.\u2019But you know it is more cynical than that. Boy has this guy got a plan. It\u2019s to appeal to that 4% of people in marginal seats. With a dog whistle on immigration there and a word about crime here, wrap yourself up in the flag and talk about Britishness enough times and maybe, just maybe, you can convince enough people that you are on their side. Well I say, God we\u2019ve got to be better than that.You know, what about the 40% of our fellow citizens who have given up on voting? They are just fed up with the whole rat race of politics, the whole merry-go-round. We have got to inspire them that we can bring real change and deal with the things that people care about. People want the politics of belief and that means politics they can really believe in. So today I want to tell you what I believe. I want to tell you what\u2019s wrong with our country and I want to explain what I am going to do to put it right.ResponsibilityWhat do I believe? I am by nature an optimist. I think if we give people more power and control over their lives, I think they\u2019ll take the right decisions, they will grow stronger and society will grow stronger too. I don\u2019t believe in an ever larger state doing more and more, I believe in trying to make people do more themselves for their families and with society as well.And I believe that if we really want to tackle crime, if we really want to make our society stronger, then you have got to make families stronger and society more responsible, and to me that word responsibility really means something. I think over these last 10 years, we have seen responsibility sucked away from people, sucked away from our public servants and taken away from our public services.And it ended with that extraordinary farce of two community support officers standing by a lake after a boy had drowned, feeling that because the rule book said they couldn\u2019t intervene, they shouldn\u2019t. Well, we\u2019ve got to start tearing up the rule books and allowing people common sense, initiative, and responsibility in the jobs that they do.And I believe, as everyone in this hall believes and as most of our fellow countrymen believe, that the first job of any government is to protect against threats old and new. Against crime and war, against terrorism and climate change. That is why we must make our country safer and greener. Now, how do we do these things? Let\u2019s take the first one, give people more freedom and control of their lives.The Internet and ControlWe live in an extraordinary world of change and freedom. The internet is transforming people\u2019s lives. The website MySpace has got 130m members. If it was a country, it would be the tenth biggest country in the world. Facebook, the social networking site, 30m members.People using it to talk with each other and meet people. I had a look the other day. There is a network on Facebook called \u2018David Cameron is a hottie.\u2019 It\u2019s got 74 members. And I looked a little further and there is another network called \u2018Am I the only person who doesn\u2019t like David Cameron?\u2019 and it\u2019s got 379 members - I am sure there is nobody here today. But the point is a serious one.As in our private lives and our work lives, we get more and more control and more power to do what we want. When we look at our democracy, we are still stuck in the dark ages. When it comes to politics we just have to take what we are given and put up with it.EU Treaty ReferendumAnd to me nothing sums this up more than the European Constitution. It\u2019s not just that it\u2019s an issue of trust; we put it in our manifesto that there should be a referendum. Labour put it in their manifesto that there should be a referendum, and it is one of the most blatant breaches of trust in modern politics they won\u2019t give us that referendum.But it actually goes further than that. In a world where we have this freedom and control, are we really saying to people that when it comes to how you are governed, how your country is run, you can\u2019t have a say, it\u2019s nothing to do with you? That\u2019s wrong and that is why we will keep pushing for that referendum, campaign for a No Vote and veto that constitution.And the revolution of freedom and control, of passing power to people shouldn\u2019t stop at Europe - it should go much, much further. But don\u2019t believe anyone who tells you that citizens\u2019 juries are a sign of giving people real power - they are just glorified focus groups where politics ask your opinions and then go ahead and do whatever they wanted to do anyway.Gordon Brown has got a new one, bigger than a citizens\u2019 jury. He wants 1,000 people to come together and come up with six words that sum up Britishness. Well I\u2019ve got six words for him. Stop wasting money on pointless gimmicks.Local GovernmentIn government, we will take this revolution and freedom and control much, much further. I believe it\u2019s time in our big cities for elected mayors, so people have one person to blame if it goes wrong and to praise if it goes right; great civic leadership that we heard from Mike Bloomberg in his great speech on Sunday.I think it\u2019s time with local government to tear up rules and all the ring fencing and the auditing and actually say to our local councils: \u2018It\u2019s your money, spend it as you choose and get judged in the ballot box by people that you serve.\u2019 And while we are at it, it is time to abolish those regional assemblies and pass those powers back to the local councils where the power belongs.EconomyThose are the first modern conservative changes for this new world of freedom. And this new world of freedom is having huge effects on business and our economy. Big business can now locate anywhere in the world, small businesses can find customers anywhere in the world and Britain has some great advantages in this globalised world. Not least because of the changes we made 15 or 20 years ago.There are huge changes taking place in Europe. The Spanish are cutting corporation tax by 5%. Angela Merkel, the Chancellor of Germany, who I met recently, she is cutting it by 9%. President Sarkozy in France is cutting the top rate income tax to make his economy more competitive.And look under the bonnet of the British economy and too many things are going in the wrong direction. 20% of the jobs created are created in the public sector; the private sector is becoming smaller as a percentage of our economy.The decline in manufacturing and manufacturing jobs meaning that we are losing important skills. And I know that business wants to hear from the Conservative Party how we will reduce regulation and reduce taxation to give them more freedom in this new world.And we heard from Alan Duncan how we will introduce regulatory budgets to cut that regulation, and I can tell you that we will get out of the European Social Chapter so we can make those rules in Britain rather than in Brussels.And as we share the proceeds of growth between public spending on the one hand and lower taxes on the other hand, we can give business the lower tax regimes that they need. But here\u2019s the deal. For business and for us, to make sure we have sustainably lower taxes, we need business to help us to cut the bills of social failure.That\u2019s the only way you can keep tax and regulation down in the long term. So we need business to be responsible in the way they market to children, in the way they treat their employees, in the way they encourage family life - all of those things will help us to get tax and regulation down for the long term good of our economy, and that is the modern Conservative change for this new world of freedom.EducationIn this new world of freedom, nothing matters more in terms of opportunity and our economy and our future than education. But too many things are not right in education in Britain. Almost 50% of 11 year olds leaving school are not able to read, write or add up properly.Falling down the European leagues in terms of educational performance. 23,000 young people leaving school without any qualifications whatsoever. We are not doing enough to prepare young people for this world of freedom.I am a father of three children, all of them under five, all of them I want to go through the state sector. I know what schools I want for my children, a school where they turn up and the head teacher knows your name, a school where there is proper discipline so they don\u2019t keep people that behave badly in school and wreck the education for those who want to learn.Schools where they use the tried and tested teaching methods, not some experimental system of letting you discover the world for yourself. Schools where they understand that children are different, that they have different needs.That equality isn\u2019t putting them all in the same class and teaching at the same speed. It\u2019s setting by ability, it\u2019s taking the brightest pupils and stretching them and helping those that are falling behind.And for parents with disabled children, it means not having to fight for a special school and save your special schools, it means special schools are there if you want to choose them for your children.And why aren\u2019t we getting these things? We have a government that 10 years ago said education was the number one priority, that has put billions into the system whose intentions are probably in the right place. Why haven\u2019t we succeeded? If we don\u2019t understand why Labour are failing we won\u2019t succeed ourselves, and I think there are three vital areas we have got to get right.The first is, we need to open up the state monopoly and allow new schools in so we can get the sort of innovation, choice and diversity that there is in the private sector. I want that choice, innovation and diversity in the public sector.The government has got its academy programme. It\u2019s a good programme. But I feel that Gordon Brown is putting his foot on the brake when he should be putting his foot on the accelerator and we should be making it easier for these new schools.So we will say to churches, to voluntary bodies, to private companies, to private schools: come into the state sector, find the parents and the children who have a simple regulatory regime, per capita funding and we can have those new schools so we can really drive up standards.But you know there are lots of parents, and frankly I am one of them, who can\u2019t wait for all those structural changes to make the long term difference in education. They want - I want - action on standards now, and again we have Labour ministers and Labour prime ministers talking about great standards.Ed Balls gave a speech the other day - not the one at the conference, that was dreadful - he gave a speech the other day that I could have given myself about standards, about rigour, about discipline - so why isn\u2019t it happening?I don\u2019t think they\u2019ve ever got to grips with the educational establishment, some of whom still think it\u2019s wrong to say children have got something wrong, because you\u2019ll brand them as failures, who still seem to think that all must win prizes, who still seem to think we have to treat all children the same.So we need to be courageous and strong on standards, to insist that children are taught using synthetic phonics and they learn to read properly. To be clear that a GNVQ is a great exam but it\u2019s not worth four GCSEs. To be absolutely clear that in reforming the exam bodies it is fine to make the QCA independent.It is fine to make the QCA independent, but that won\u2019t help unless the exam bodies are really put under the one group of people that want to make our exam system rigorous and tough and believable for the long term and that\u2019s the customers. That means business, it means the universities, it means the colleges - they want our exam system to be robust for the long term and so do I.School DisciplineBut there is a change we need to make even more quickly and that\u2019s about discipline. I went and taught in a school for a couple of days in the north of England and one teacher said to me: \u2018There is only three words that you have got to focus on,\u2019 and not the ones you might expect \u2013 \u2018behaviour, behaviour, behaviour.\u2019And I stopped a boy as he was running into his GCSE exam and I said, \u2018What\u2019s the problem?\u2019 and he said \u2018Well, I got completely pissed last night, I\u2019ve got a hangover and I\u2019m going to flunk this exam.\u2019And I asked a teacher about him and I was told, well, he\u2019d attacked a teacher before and he trashed a classroom and none of us know why he\u2019s still in this school. So why do we allow this to happen, why don\u2019t we intervene earlier? Take the children out that are causing so much trouble, try and turn their lives around.So let me tell you what we\u2019ll do, we will give head teachers complete command of their school. If they want to have forcible home school contracts which parents have to sign about the behaviour of the children before the children go to school, that\u2019s fine.And no ifs no buts, if a head teacher wants to exclude a pupil because the behaviour is wrecking the education of others, they should be able to do so, the appeals panels have got to go. Those are all Conservative changes for this new world of freedom, as George [Osborne] reminded us in that great speech on Monday, one of the aspirations - hold on a second I don\u2019t want to praise him too much...Housing LadderOne of the aspirations people still have, and rightly so, is the aspiration to own a flat and a home of their own. And all of us, all of the Shadow Cabinet here they can tell the same story of young people who come to our surgeries, they show you their salary, they talk about local house prices and they just say: \u2018I don\u2019t see how I can achieve that dream.\u2019 And George showed how we going to cut stamp duty to show that we\u2019re on their side, and we will help mend the housing ladder and get on their side. This is the party of aspiration and opportunity and George has shown us the way.PensionsAnd just as people want aspiration and opportunity at the beginning of their life, so they deserve opportunity and security in retirement. And Gordon Brown\u2019s worst legacy will be his destruction of Britain\u2019s pension system, and we in this party will never let him forget it.There\u2019s a man in my constituency called John Brooks and he\u2019s got cancer. He spent 40 years working for the same company, paying into his pension fund - it was a blanket factory in Witney. He was told his pension fund was copper-bottomed and guaranteed - the business went bust, the pension scheme went bust and he was left with nothing.There are 125,000 people like him in our country. I raised his case in Parliament and surprise, surprise he was offered some money. And do you know what he did? He said, I won\u2019t take a penny of that money, until you can guarantee that other people nearing retirement in my company get that money too. That is a modern British hero that I am proud to know.So George, your first task when we win the election is to set up a lifeboat fund, and give those 125,000 people the support and the money that they deserve for having been let down so badly by this government.PovertyIn this new world, the winds of change can sometimes be quite harsh, rather than just invigorating. Globalisation will help poorer countries become richer, it will help them close the gap with the richer world, but sometimes globalisation can increase inequalities within a country. And I think we all know that while our economy is getting richer, our society in many ways is getting poorer.And I think we have to recognise in the party that freedom is not enough. That we have to help make families stronger, we have to help make society more responsible. If you talk to a young mother half way up a council block trying to bring up her children, trying to find somewhere safe to play, trying to find a good school. If you just say we\u2019re going to give you more freedom and control, I think you\u2019ll get quite a blank look.And that\u2019s why the second thing that we believe in so strongly - stronger families and a more responsible society - is so vital for the future of our country. And again, the picture isn\u2019t good, the old politics has been failing. Labour\u2019s great passion was tackling poverty, but in many ways it\u2019s been one of their greatest areas of failure.There are five million people in our country of working age who aren\u2019t working. There are a million young people, more than a million who are neither in employment, nor in education, nor in training. And the number is actually higher than 10 years ago.You remember 10 years ago being told how many young people were on the scrap heap, well that scrap heap has actually got higher, and that is a scandal in our country.There are 600,000 people, 600,000 more people, in deep poverty than ten years ago. Again, why have Labour failed and gone on failing? If we don\u2019t understand why, we won\u2019t get it right.They\u2019ve put the money in. We\u2019ve had New Deals and Fair Deals and hand ups and thinking the unthinkable and then going away and thinking again, but it hasn\u2019t worked. Why?I believe it\u2019s because they relied too much on the state organisations that can treat people like statistics rather than like human beings. And ministers are so keen to shout success that they count success as just six weeks in a job. So we get this revolving door of people living a life on benefits and then just a few weeks in work and then back on benefits again.Change - modern Conservative change - is required, so what are we going to do? We should look at the models that have worked elsewhere in the world. In Australia, where they have got private limited companies to run benefits and they have cut unemployment by 50%.In states like Wisconsin in America, where they\u2019ve cut benefit rolls by 80%, and the changes we will make are these: we will say to people that if you are offered a job and it\u2019s a fair job and one that you can do and you refuse it, you shouldn\u2019t get any welfare.And we will ask the charities, the voluntary bodies, the private companies who have such expertise in this area to run these benefit systems for us. Why do I think they are better? I think they show a greater understanding of the personal and emotional needs of people who have been stuck out of work for so long.It has worked in other parts of the world, it can work here. It\u2019s a tough choice, it\u2019s a difficult thing to put through, but we have got to do it.FamiliesYou know the best welfare system of all, it\u2019s called the family. If you think about it, what\u2019s the best organisation at bringing up children, at helping us with the right values, helping us get on with life, looking after us if we are sick of disabled, caring for the elderly? It\u2019s the family.And in this world of unease as well as freedom we need to do more to support the family, and again the old politics are failing. Look at Britain today: one in four children brought up with an absent father, the highest rate of family breakdown in Europe, and I just don\u2019t believe we can walk on by from the evidence that\u2019s in front of us.Children from broken homes have a 70% chance of failing at school, a 40% greater chance of getting into debt, a 35% chance of being unemployed. Single mums do a brilliant job, they do the most difficult job in the world, but I don\u2019t think we can ignore the state of family breakdown in Britain and I think we have to try and do something about it.You know there is a phenomenon in Britain that\u2019s called LATs \u2013 that\u2019s Living Apart Together and there are 2m people who pretend to live apart because the benefits system pays you more to live apart than live together.I met a young man the other day, he came to my office. He had recently been in prison and he was trying to go straight, he had got a job. He\u2019s got a kid already and he\u2019s got another on the way. He is being mentored by someone in my office and the only reason he doesn\u2019t live with the mother of his children is because she would lose benefits if he did.We must be crazy in this country to be using the benefits system to drive people apart rather than bring them together. We\u2019ve got a tax system that doesn\u2019t recognise marriage and we\u2019ve got a benefit system that actually recognises any form of co-habitation, any form of commitment and penalises it.So what will we do to change that?Well, as George has set out, we will end the couple\u2019s penalty in the benefit system, so we don\u2019t penalise couples, we will reward them, and yes I believe we should recognise marriage in the tax system as well.But I don\u2019t just want to give people a tax cut. I want to give people a time increase. Time for many families is the most precious commodity of all - time you can spend at home, time to help with the homework, time you can do things in the house, and that\u2019s why I think it\u2019s time not just for these benefit and tax changes I\u2019ve spoken about, but also to say to all employees in all companies with children that you should have the right to ask for flexible working.Companies that have adopted this have found that they are able to grant the request in the vast majority of cases - they have actually found that productivity has gone up, profits have gone up, staff morale has gone up and keeping staff is easier.I think at the next election we will be able to offer people the strongest family package any party has put together. Yes we will recognise marriage in the tax system, yes we will take the couples penalty out of the tax system and yes we will give people more time, more flexibility, so we can be the party of the family once again.The NHSThe one thing that lots of families rely on more than anything else, my own included, is the NHS, and when I think of the NHS I think of the people in it. I think of the care worker who turns up at our home three nights a week to look after my son and cares for him as if he was her own son.I think of the community nurses who help you fight for all the things you need for your family life. They understand that it\u2019s not just about the child, it\u2019s about the family too. I think about the neurologist who was just desperate to give us a better quality of life and he wouldn\u2019t stop until he found the answer.He got us back into hospital day after day, week after week. It must have played havoc with his figures for throughput and output and patient episodes and all the rest of it, but he just wanted to do the right thing. That\u2019s the spirit of the NHS that I think motivates everyone in our country.But again, why has it gone wrong?Ten years on from a government that said \u201824 hours to save the NHS,\u2019 billions spent and yet morale is so low, some hospitals still threatened with closure, departments shutting down, productivity so poor in the NHS, what\u2019s gone wrong? Again, if we don\u2019t understand why Labour are failing we won\u2019t succeed.I think it\u2019s because the reform has been top-down. Targets imposed from above, endless re-organisation - nine in the last ten years - and an NHS computer costing billions of pounds that many professionals in the NHS can\u2019t really tell you what it\u2019s for, though they are worried its going to take away patient confidentiality, and I think they\u2019ve demoralised the staff in the NHS and questioned their professionalism and their vocation.I will never forget walking on the streets of London, marching with 10,000 junior doctors who felt like they were being treated like cogs in a machine rather than professionals with a vocation to go out and save lives, and I think Labour have got something else badly wrong. They talk about a personalised NHS but they haven\u2019t done anything to deliver it.So what will we do to be different?First of all we\u2019ve got to scrap those top-down targets and trust our professionals in the NHS. Now that doesn\u2019t mean letting go and just giving up on quality - quite the opposite. We\u2019ve got to replace those process targets with measures of outcomes \u2013 that\u2019s what people care about: \u2018How long am I going to survive if I get cancer? What are my chances of a good life if I have a stroke? What are my chances of surviving from heart disease?\u2019What we\u2019ve got to do is make the NHS and doctors answerable to the patient and not to the politicians. And the way we\u2019ll get a really personalised NHS is make the changes that are necessary. Giving people a real choice of GPs, giving GPs control over their budgets and allowing GPs to choose between whatever hospital they like.Public or private or voluntary, not just some limited list. Those are the modern Conservative changes that we will make to our NHS. There is something else our NHS is suffering from and it\u2019s an excess of fads imposed from Whitehall.Those of us representing rural areas remember when we were told the community hospitals had to go and the huge hurt their closure caused. Then we were told, \u2018No, community hospitals are the future and they should stay and we\u2019ll build new ones.\u2019The latest fad comes straight from the new health minister and he says of district general hospitals, that their days are over. Well I think he\u2019s wrong. People in this country, towns and villages and cities, really care about their district general hospital. They want it to be there when they\u2019re ill, they want their children to be born in it, and they want an accident and emergency unit open 24 hours that they don\u2019t have to drive hours to get to. ImmigrationSo if this government goes ahead with the plans to say the district general hospital is over, we will fight them every step of the way between now and the general election. And when it comes to public services and when it comes to this new world of unease, there is another issue that we have to approach and approach sensibly, and it\u2019s the issue of immigration.I think this country has benefited immeasurably from immigration. People who want to come here and work hard and contribute to our country. I think our diverse and multi-racial society is a huge benefit for Britain, but we do have recognise the pressures that can be put on public services, schools and hospitals and housing if immigration in unlimited.And that\u2019s why I think David Davis, in that excellent speech yesterday, set out the steps that we need to take. We do need to say that new EU countries should have transitional controls, and yes there should be an overall limit on economic migration from non-European countries. I want our party, a modern Conservative party, to talk about this issue in a reasonable, humane and sensible way and to take the very sensible measures that are necessary.What I always find with the government is that you get the exact opposite. You get a whole lot of language, often quite inflammatory but they don\u2019t take steps that Britain needs. So let us be the ones that handle this issue in the way that it needs to be for the good of our country and our public services.Terrorism and the Armed ForcesThe other feature of our modern world, of this new world, is the sense of insecurity and danger, particularly in foreign affairs and security. The world that maybe some people dreamt of at the conference back in Bournemouth when it looked as if maybe history would end, that Liberal democracy would triumph, that free market economics would slowly progress and we would have a new world order, that world is not going to happen.We have instead 15,000 nuclear weapons in the former Soviet Union, we have Iran trying to get hold of a nuclear weapon and threatening Israel, we have insurgency in Iraq and the possible impact on the Middle East.We have progress in Africa yes, but countries in the east like Somalia that are failed states, and narco-states in the west like Guinea Bissau, and perhaps most threateningly of all, almost perhaps as many as 4,000 of our fellow citizens have been through terrorist training camps in Afghanistan or in Pakistan, and many will have returned to our country.And yes, we have great plans, great ideas, great proposals for what we want to do in health and education and housing, but anyone who wants to be Prime Minister of this country has to be ready to face those threats and meet them. And I think that people have a right to know how I would react to them.The first thing to say is that when it comes to these issues, we must never put party before country. I have always believed in the Atlantic Alliance and I have always believed in Britain\u2019s independent nuclear deterrent.And when Labour came forward with plans to replace Trident, I am proud of the fact that we marched our members of Parliament through those division lobbies to make sure that vote was won.And when it comes to Iraq, we all want to see more of our troops come home and if the Prime Minister makes the right decisions, if we can guarantee more security in southern Iraq, then we will support him when he acts in the national interest.But I think the key principal that we must apply to these great challenges in our dangerous and insecure world is keeping our defences strong. I have been to Afghanistan twice, and spent a night under canvas in Camp Bastion. I remember sitting in a room with a whole lot of guys from the Worcester and Sherwood Foresters and asking them how many had fired their gun in battle. Every single hand, almost every single hand went up.We need to understand the incredible bravery of what our soldiers are doing in Helmand province. But again, in a world of danger and insecurity, we need to recognise again that the old politics is failing. Yes, we have changed some things since 9/11 but we haven\u2019t changed enough.And our Prime Minister likes to say that nothing in Britain is broken, but I would refer him to a piece of paper which is all about the sacrifices our troops are prepared to make on our behalf - including the ultimate sacrifice - and our duties and obligations to them.It\u2019s called the Military Covenant, and Mr Brown, I believe your government has broken it.There are things we could do - quite small things - that would make a difference. If you sit in the back of a Hercules at Kandahar air base or Bastion as I have done, you will hear soldiers telling you about some of the smaller things. Why don\u2019t we get more contact time with home via telephone and email?Why can\u2019t we have free parcels all year round, not just at Christmas time? Why can\u2019t we have the same system as the Americans, where your leave starts the moment you step foot on American soil, rather than when you actually leave Camp Bastion in the middle of Afghanistan?All we need for these things is just a government that values our military properly, rolls up its sleeves and gets them done. But there are bigger things. We have got to look at the schools they send their children to. Many of them, the children come and go within a year but they don\u2019t get the extra funding that they need.We have got to look at the housing, so much of which is completely sub-standard. And yes, we have got to look at the health care. I know our soldiers want to come home to a great British hospital, and in Birmingham they do.But when you are wounded on a battlefield in Helmand one day and you wake up next day in a hospital, you want to recuperate with your comrades in arms, and that must mean a separate military ward.But there is something else that we need to understand and that is that we will never be able to really improve the welfare of our forces unless we also look at expanding our Army. I am delighted that Liam has made his priority restoring those cuts to the Army, the three battalions that should never have been abolished by this government.But I think that the most important change that we need to make, the most important Conservative principal we need to apply to our foreign and defence policy, is to make sure that we are realistic and not utopian.Yes, we support freedom, yes we support democracy, yes we should try to punch above our weight in the world to achieve these things. But I think that if we have learnt anything over the last five years, it\u2019s that you cannot drop a fully formed democracy out of an aeroplane at 40,000 feet.And I want people to know that if I am a prime minister in one month or one year, my top priority overseas would be Afghanistan. We are doing fantastic work in that country. Our troops are incredibly brave, but my worry is that we could win the military campaign but start to lose the country.How can we win an insurgency when there are seven different military chains of command? How can we rebuild a country when we don\u2019t have one person coordinating the aid between the EU, NATO and the UN? How can we really help a people when the country is still so awash with drugs and has so much corruption?We really need to make this our number one priority. And I tell you why. If we get out of Afghanistan, the Taliban come back into Afghanistan and al Qaeda, and that will mean danger and terrorism on British streets again.But frankly there is no foreign policy and domestic policy any more. There ought to be National Security Policy. And I\u2019m very proud of the fact that in our Shadow Cabinet is Pauline Neville-Jones, who used to run the Joint Intelligence Committee before the days of the dodgy dossier.In those days, civil servants felt that they could stand up for their integrity and tell Ministers when they got it wrong, and that\u2019s what we need to happen again.And when it comes to terrorism, again when the government gets it right we will support them. But I think that there are things that they are getting wrong.They won\u2019t give us proper border controls, but they long to give us ID cards. They trash important civil liberties like jury trial, but they will keep the Human Rights Act that actually hinders our fight against terrorism.And they talk about Britishness, but they won\u2019t ban the group Hizb ut Tahrir, and I think I quote it exactly: \u2018kill the Jews wherever you find them.\u2019 We will do things differently.We will give Britain a proper Border Police Force, and we will scrap the pointless ID cards. We will defend important civil liberties like jury trial but we will replace the Human Rights act.And in a Conservative Britain, Hizb ut Tahrir will be banned.EnvironmentThose are all modern Conservative changes for this new world of insecurity. And when it comes to the new threats, we have to face them directly. New threats like terrorism, and new threats like climate change.It doesn\u2019t matter whether you look at the snows of Kilimanjaro, or the melting Greenland ice sheet, or the fact that closer to home the Thames barrier meant to be lifted once every six years, is now being lifted six times a year.This is a clear and present danger to our country. Some people say it is not popular to talk about green issues. I don\u2019t care. It\u2019s right and it falls to this generation to deal with this issue.Some people say that there is nothing that we can do because China builds a power station every six weeks, and what can we in Britain do? I think they have got it wrong.Look at what\u2019s happening in China. The Gobi desert expanding by 4,000 miles every year. A half of their river water not just not fit to drink, but not fit to use for farming. Hundreds of thousands of people dying from air pollution every year.And how will we be able to encourage China to act unless we act here at home? And again, the old politics is failing. Carbon emissions are up under this government. Green taxes as a share of total taxes are down. And we are failing to give people proper incentives.This party never wants to punish or hold back the aspirations of people who want to get on in life and have a good life. And what we must be is the party of sensible, green leadership, and that is exactly what we are going to stay.CrimeBut undoubtedly the biggest threat that people face in this country is the crime on their streets.Our Prime Minister has said that our society isn\u2019t broken, but when you think of 20 children shot dead on the streets of London, when you think of gun crime doubled, violent crime doubled, a boy on a bike shooting Rhys Jones... I wonder what society the Prime Minister is living in?But let us resolve right here, that we will not pursue the old politics. No more Downing Street summits, get together a packet of measures for the 6 o\u2019clock News, brief them out and then while everyone has reported them they never actually happen and everyone moves onto the next thing. That is not what this party is going to do.Yes, we will make changes to the criminal justice system where necessary. How can it possibly be right that magistrates can only send someone to prison for a few weeks rather than a year? Yes, we need to scrap that early release scheme in prisons - 24,000 released on our streets that David Davis spoke about yesterday.Yes, we will take those steps. But as important, probably more important, is actually to reform the police. I went out on the beat the other day with a police office in mid Wales. Really dedicated public servant who wanted to do the best for his community and he told me a story.He said a mother had come to him and said her son was nicking money out of her wallet. And he said: \u2018Do you know how I had to handle it? I had to explain that I couldn\u2019t just give him a talking to because of all the targets, and the bureaucracy, and the paperwork. I have to take him down to the station, I have to go through all the paperwork, I\u2019ve got to caution him, and then I can turn round and say I have detected a crime, I\u2019ve cleared up a crime and I have solved a crime.\u2019Well, what a ridiculous way to treat the police force.So we will reform the police. We will cut out that paperwork, we will get rid of the performance assessments, get rid of the targets, make them look not up to the Home Office but instead to locally elected mayors or police commissioners, so that they can be accountable to local people and we can have the beat-based, zero-tolerance policing that everyone wants to see in their community.Citizens\u2019 ServiceBut as Iain Duncan Smith said in that great speech yesterday, action on criminal justice, and action on policing - those are just two of the dimensions we need. The third dimension is strengthening our society, strengthening families, strengthening communities. And there is one last thing I just want to mention.If you ask people of my parents\u2019 generation about national service, they tell you often that it was something that brought people together. It didn\u2019t matter whether you were from the north or the south or whether you were rich or poor. It was something we all did together, and it was about serving our community and serving our country and we learnt responsibility. Now I\u2019m not about to suggest a return to national service. Sorry to disappoint you. But I do think this. I think the time has come for national citizens\u2019 service where we say to 16 year olds, we\u2019ve got a compelling programme that\u2019s about the transition from youth to adulthood. That\u2019s about your responsibilities in society. That\u2019s about community service. That will challenge you. I launched this programme at Amir Khan\u2019s gym in Bolton. He is a fantastic man. He doesn\u2019t just want to the best boxer in England or the best boxer in the world, he\u2019s built a gym to bring people off the streets, to give them something to believe in. And I agree with him that this sort of national citizens\u2019 service for 16-year-olds can teach young people the self-respect and the social responsibility that we really need to make our society stronger.BackgroundWell, that\u2019s it. That\u2019s what I believe. Giving people more power and control over their lives. Making society more responsible and families stronger. And making our country greener and safer.I\u2019ve told you what I believe, I\u2019ve told you about the changes I want to make to our economy, to politics, to health, housing, education, the environment. And I\u2019ve told you some of the ways how we would do it. I\u2019ve talked a bit about Labour. Not because they\u2019re bad people with bad intentions but because, as I have said, if we don\u2019t understand why they have failed we won\u2019t succeed.But I\u2019ve said something else, it\u2019s about me. People want to know: are you really up for it? Do you have what it takes? Are you tough enough and strong enough to make those decisions? And I answer unreservedly: yes.That is why I stood here two years ago, that is why I am standing here today. I can\u2019t give you some hard luck story. I\u2019m the son of a magistrate and a stockbroker, but the great privilege of my upbringing wasn\u2019t the wealth, it was the warmth, it was the family.And yes, I went to a fantastic school and I\u2019m not embarrassed about that because I had a great education and I know what a great education means. And knowing what a great education means, means there is a better chance of getting it for all of our children, which is absolutely what I want in this country.Now, my mother the magistrate, she sat on the bench in Newbury. Because of the bypass protesters she had to cope with the likes of Swampy, because of the Greenham Common protest she had to deal with all of those protesters, and she did because she believed in public service, and so do I.General ElectionAnd do you the greatest service that this party can do to our public today, it is to get out and fight for what we believe in and the changes we want to make. Because you know, people in this country after 10 years of Labour really despair that they can get the sort of change they want.They don\u2019t believe it is possible any more and we\u2019ve got to inspire them, we\u2019ve got to say to them, it doesn\u2019t have to be like this. You don\u2019t have to put up with this, you can get it if you really want it, we can get a great NHS, if we make doctors answerable to patients and not to politicians.We can get great schools if we break open the state monopoly and allow new schools in and insist on high standards. We can get safer streets if we strengthen our families and get the police onto our streets, we can get it if we really want it. That\u2019s what we\u2019ve got to do.So, Mr Brown, what\u2019s it going to be? Why don\u2019t you go ahead and call that election? Let the people pass judgement on 10 years of broken promises, let people decide who\u2019s really making the arguments about the future of our country. Let people decide who can make the changes that we really need in our country. Call that election. We will fight. Britain will win.

aVIt's great to be here in the Symphony Hall.But it's even better to know that in this party, everyone: the Shadow Cabinet, the Members of Parliament, the council leaders and all our candidates and colleaguesEveryone is playing the same tune.Today the financial crisis means that all eyes are on the economy and the financial markets and that is absolutely right.As I said yesterday, on this issue, we must put aside our differences and work together with the government in the short-term to ensure financial stability.I am pleased that our proposal to increase the protection for depositors to £50,000 has been taken up.I'm pleased that the European regulators are looking at our proposal to bring stability to the banking system.I repeat: we will not allow what happened in America to happen here, we will work with the government in the short term in order to protect our economy.But as I also said yesterday, that must not stop us telling the truth about the mistakes that have been made.It is our political duty......and if we had a written constitution I would say constitutional duty......to hold the government to account, to explain where they went wrong, and how we would do things differently to rebuild our economy for the long-term.So we must not hold back from being critical of the decisions that over ten years have led us to this point.We need to learn the lessons, and to offer the British people a clear choiceIt is our responsibility to make sense of this crisis for them, and to show them the right way out of it.We started to do that in Birmingham this week.We've had a good conference this week, an optimistic conference - but a sober one.We understand the gravity of the situation our country is in.And our response is measured, proportionate and responsible.The test of a political party is whether it can rise to the challenge of what the country requires and what the times demand.I believe we have passed that test this week and I want to thank George Osborne, William Hague, all my team in the Shadow Cabinet and all of you for making this conference a success.The reality of government is that difficulties come not in neat and predictable order, one by one and at regular intervals.Difficulties come at you from all sides, one on top of the other, and you've got to be able to handle them all.So amidst this financial crisis let us not forget that we are also a nation at war.In Afghanistan today, our armed forces are defending our freedom and our way of life as surely and as bravely as any soldiers in our nation's history.Let us be clear about why they are there: if we fail in our mission, the Taliban will come back.And if the Taliban come back, the terrorist training camps come backThat would mean more terrorists, more bombs and more slaughter on our streets.That is why we back our troops' mission in Afghanistan one hundred per cent.I've been to visit them every year since I've been doing this job.Earlier this month, up the Helmand River in Sangin I met a soldier in the Royal Irish Regiment, Ranger Blaine Miller.He'd just turned eighteen years old.He was the youngest soldier there.He's not much more than a boy and he's there in the forty-five degree heat, fighting a ferocious enemy on the other side of the world.I told him that what he was doing was exceptional.He told me he was just doing his job.Every politician says it's the first duty of government is to protect our country, and of course that's right.But today we are not protecting the people, like Blaine, who protect us - and that is wrong.In Afghanistan, the number of our troops has almost doubled but the number of helicopters has hardly increased at all.American soldiers start their rest and recuperation the day they arrive back home, our troops have to count the days they spend getting home.We've got troops' families living in sub-standard homes; we've got soldiers going into harm's way without the equipment they need......we've got businesses in our country that instead of welcoming people in military uniform and honouring their service choose to turn them away and refuse them service.That is all wrong and we are going to put it right.We are going to stop sending young men to war without the equipment they need, we're going to stop treating our soldiers like second class citizens......we will do all it takes to keep our country safe and we will do all it takes to protect the heroes who risk everything for us.And today there are a particular group of heroes that I have in mind.They fought for us in the slit trenches of Burmathe jungles of Malayaand the freezing cold of the Falklands.Yesterday the courts ruled that gurkhas who want to come and live in Britain should be able to.They risked their lives for us and now we must not turn our backs on them.I say to the government: I know there are difficult questions about pensions and housing but let's find a way to make it workDo not appeal this ruling......let's give those brave gurkha soldiers who defended us the right to come and live in our country.These are times of great anxiety.The financial crisis.The economic downturn.The cost of living.Big social problems.I know how worried people are.They want to know whether our politics, and let's be frank, whether our politicians - are up to it.In the end, that's not really about your policies and your plans.Of course your plans are important......but it's the unexpected and unpredicted events that can dominate a government.So people want to know what values you bring to big situations and big decisions that can crop up on your watch.And people want to know about your character: the way you make decisions; the way that you operate.My values are Conservative values.Many people wrongly believe that the Conservative Party is all about freedom.Of course we care passionately about freedom from oppression and state control.That's why we stood up for Georgia and wasn't it great to have the Georgian Prime Minister with us here, speaking today?But freedom can too easily turn into the idea that we all have the right to do whatever we want, regardless of the effect on others.That is libertarian, not Conservative - and it is certainly not me.For me, the most important word is responsibility.Personal responsibility.Professional responsibility.Civic responsibility.Corporate responsibility.Our responsibility to our family, to our neighbourhood, our country.Our responsibility to behave in a decent and civilised way.To help others.That is what this Party is all about.Every big decision; every big judgment I make: I ask myself some simple questions.Does this encourage responsibility and discourage irresponsibility?Does this make us a more or less responsible society?Social responsibility, not state control.Because we know that we will only be a strong society if we are a responsible society.But when it comes to handling a crisis......when it comes to really making a difference on the big issues......it's not just about your values.There's something else people want to know.When people ask: "will you make a difference?" they're often asking will you - i.e. me - will you make a difference?You can't prove you're ready to be Prime Minister - and it would be arrogant to pretend you can.The best you can do is tell people who you are and the way you work; how you make decisions and then live with them.I'm a forty-one year old father of three who thinks that family is the most important thing there is.For me.For my country.I am deeply patriotic about this country and believe we have both a remarkable history and an incredible future.I believe in the Union of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and I will never do anything to put it at risk.I have a simple view that public service is a good way to channel your energy and try to make a difference.I am not an ideologue.I know that my party can get things wrong, and that other parties sometimes get things right.I hold to some simple principles.That strong defence, the rule of law and sound money are the foundations of good government.But I am also a child of my time.I want a clean environment as well as a safe one.I believe that quality of life matters as much as quantity of money.I recognise that we'll never be truly rich while so much of the world is so poor.I believe in building a strong team - and really trusting them.Their success is to be celebrated - not seen as some kind of threat.Thinking before deciding is good.Not deciding because you don't like the consequences of a decision is bad.Trust your principles, your judgment and your colleagues.Go with your conviction, not calculation.The popular thing may look good for a while.The right thing will be right all the time.Tony Blair used to justify endless short-term initiatives by saying "we live in a 24 hour media world."But this is a country not a television station.A good government thinks for the long term.If we win we will inherit a huge deficit and an economy in a mess.We will need to do difficult and unpopular things for the long term good of the country.I know that.I'm ready for that.And there is a big argument I want to make - about the financial crisis and the economic downturn, yes......but about the other issues facing the country too.It's an argument about experience.To do difficult things for the long-term......or even to get us through the financial crisis in the short term......what matters more than experience is character and judgment, and what you really believe needs to happen to make things right.I believe that to rebuild our economy, it's not more of the same we need, but change.To repair our broken society, it's not more of the same we need, but change.Experience is the excuse of the incumbent over the ages.Experience is what they always say when they try to stop change.In 1979, James Callaghan had been Home Secretary, Foreign Secretary and Chancellor before he became Prime Minister.He had plenty of experience.But thank god we changed him for Margaret Thatcher.Just think about it: if we listened to this argument about experience, we'd never change a government, ever.We'd have Gordon Brown as Prime Minister - for ever.Gordon Brown talks about his economic experience.The problem is, we have actually experienced his experience.We've experienced the massive increase in debt.We have experienced the huge rise in taxes.We experienced the folly of pretending that boom and bust could be ended.This is the argument we will make when the election comes.The risk is not in making a change.The risk is sticking with what you've got and expecting a different result.There is a simple truth for times like this.When you've taken the wrong road, you don't just keep going.You change direction - and that is what we need to do.So let's look at how we got here - and how we're going to get out.At the heart of the financial crisis is a simple fact.The tap marked 'borrowing' was turned on - and it was left running for too long.The debts we built up were too high. Far too high.The authorities - on both sides of the Atlantic - thought it could go on for ever.They thought the days of low inflation and low interest rates could go on for ever.They thought the asset price bubble didn't matter.But it's not just the authorities who were at fault.Many bankers in the City were quite simply irresponsible.They paid themselves vast rewards when it was all going well......and the minute it went wrong, they came running to us to bail them out.There will be a day of reckoning but today is not that day.Today we have to understand the long-term policy mistakes that were made.In this country, Gordon Brown made two big mistakes.His first big mistake - and his worst decision, sowing the seeds of the present financial crisis......was actually contained within his best decision: to make the Bank of England independent.Let me explain.At the same time as giving the Bank of England the power to set interest rates......he took away the Bank of England's power to regulate financial markets......and he took away the Bank of England's power to blow the whistle on the total amount of debt in the economy.He changed the rules of the game, but he took the referee off the pitch.Eddie George, who was the Bank of England Governor at the time, was only given a few hours notice of this massive decision.He feared it would end in tears - and it has.Gordon Brown's second big mistake was on government borrowing.After a prudent start, when he stuck for two years to Conservative spending totals, he turned into a spendaholic.His spending splurge left the government borrowing money in the good times when it should have been saving money.So now that the bad times have hit, there's no money to help.The cupboard is bare.So the question is, how are we going to get through this crisis?How are we going to rebuild our economy for the long term?Now I've studied economics at a great university.I've worked in business alongside great entrepreneurs.And as Gordon Brown never stops reminding people, I've been inside the Treasury during a crisis.But when it comes to handling the situation we're in, none of that matters as much as some simple things I believe to be true.First of all, I believe that government's main economic duty is to ensure sound money and low taxes.Sound money means controlling inflation, keeping spending under control and getting debt down.So we will rein in private borrowing by correcting that big mistake made by Gordon Brown, and restoring the Bank of England's power to limit debt in the economy.That will help give our economy the financial responsibility it needs.But we need fiscal responsibility too.So we will rein in government borrowing.You know what that means.The country needs to know what that means.And it has a lot clearer idea now, thanks to that fantastic speech by George Osborne on Monday, one of the finest speeches made by any Shadow Chancellor.Sound money means saving in the good years so we can borrow in the bad.It means ending Labour's spendaholic culture......it means clamping down on government waste......and it means destroying all those useless quangos and initiatives.So I will be asking all my shadow ministers to review all over again every spending programme to see if it is really necessary, really justifiable in these new economic circumstances.But even that will not be enough.The really big savings will come from reforming inefficient public services, and dealing with the long-term social problems that cause government spending to rise.To help us stick to the right course, we'll have an independent Office of Budget Responsibility.There will be no hiding place, no fiddling the figures - for all governments, forever.It's not experience that will bring about these long-term changes.Experience means you're implicated in the old system that's failed.You can't admit that change is needed, because that would mean admitting you'd got it wrong.We propose a major shake-up in the way the public finances are run......and we have the character and the judgment to scrap the discredited fiscal rules and make this vital long-term change.It's a change that will help us get taxes down.I believe in low taxes - and today, working people are crying out for relief.Like the young couple I met in York three weeks ago, who both work seven days a week and still struggle to make enough to pay the mortgage.But I am a fiscal conservative.So is George Osborne.We do not believe in tax cuts paid for by reckless borrowing.So let me say this to the call centre worker whose mortgage has gone up by four hundred quid a month but his salary's gone down.To the hairdresser who's a single mum doing another job on the side to try and make ends meet and pay for childcare.To the electrician whose fuel bill, rent bill and food bill have all gone up and he's trying to work out which one to pay when the tax bill's gone up too.I know it's your money.I know you want some of it back.And I want to give it to you.It's one of the reasons I'm doing this job.But we will only cut taxes once it's responsible to do so......once we've made government live within its means.The test of whether we're ready for government is not whether we can come up with exciting shadow budgets.It is whether we have the grit and determination to impose discipline on government spending, keep our nerve and say "no" - even in the teeth of hostility and protest.That is the responsible party we are and that is the responsible government I will lead.Sound money; low taxes.Simple beliefs with profound implications.And here's something else I believe about the economy.I believe that people create jobs, not governments.I understand enterprise.I admire entrepreneurs.I should do - I go to bed with one every night.And today, Labour's taxes and regulations are making life impossible for our entrepreneurs.Just this week, the exodus of business from Labour's Britain continued as WPP announced it was moving to Ireland.A man called Steven Ellis Cooper emailed me at the end of last month.You know him, this conference heard his story on Sunday.He's from Worcestershire - and with his wife and two daughters he's been running his business for nearly twenty years.He saw it grow into something he described as "magical", employing five people and contributing to the economy.And then along came Labour.Now he's down to his last employee and he says "I am sat at my desk now in tears as I'm so sad that what I have spent such a long time trying to build up is being so systematically smashed into the floor and the Labour Government are to blame."What an outrageous way for a government to treat someone who's trying to do their best, trying to make a living for their family, trying to create opportunity for others.So here's what we're going to do.We'll start by dealing with the nightmare complexity of our business taxes.We'll get rid of those complex reliefs and allowances and use the savings to cut corporation tax by three pence.But I don't believe that the government's role in the economy is just about tax and spend and sound money and finance.I have never believed in just laissez-faire.I believe the government should play an active part in helping business and industry.So when our economy is overheating in the south east but still needs more investment in the north......the right thing to do is not go ahead with a third runway at Heathrow but instead build a new high speed rail network......linking Birmingham, Manchester, London, Leeds......let's help rebalance Britain's economy.But the problems this country faces go far beyond financial crisis and economic downturn.In the end I want to be judged not just on how well we handle crises, but on two things......how we improve the public institution in this country I care about most, the NHS......and how we fulfil what will be the long-term mission of the next Conservative government: to repair our broken society.Now there is a dangerous argument doing the rounds about how we do that.You may have heard it.I have to tell you, Labour are clutching at it as some sort of intellectual lifeline.It goes like this.In these times of difficulty, we need a bigger state.Not just in a financial and economic sense, but in a social sense too.A Labour minister said something really extraordinary last week.It revealed a huge amount about them.David Miliband said that "unless government is on your side you end up on your own.""On your own" - without the government.I thought it was one of the most arrogant things I've heard a politician say.For Labour there is only the state and the individual, nothing in between.No family to rely on, no friend to depend on, no community to call on.No neighbourhood to grow in, no faith to share in, no charities to work in.No-one but the Minister, nowhere but Whitehall, no such thing as society - just them, and their laws, and their rules, and their arrogance.You cannot run our country like this.It is why, when we look at what's happening to our country, we can see that the problem is not the leader; it's Labour.They end up treating people like children, with a total lack of trust in people's common sense and decency.This attitude, this whole health and safety, human rights act culture, has infected every part of our life.If you're a police officer you now cannot pursue an armed criminal without first filling out a risk assessment form.Teachers can't put a plaster on a child's grazed knee without calling a first aid officer.Even foreign exchanges for studentsyou can't host a school exchange any more without parents going through an Enhanced Criminal Record Bureau Check.No, when times are tough, it's not a bigger state we need: it's better, more efficient government.But even more than that we need a stronger society.That means trusting people.And sharing responsibility.But no-one will ever take lectures from politicians about responsibility unless we put our own house in order.That means sorting out our broken politics.People are sick of it.Sick of the sleaze, sick of the cynicism.Copper-bottomed pensions.Plasma screen TVs on the taxpayer.Expenses and allowances that wouldn't stand for one second in the private sector.This isn't a Conservative problem, a Labour problem or a Liberal Democrat problem.It is a Westminster problem, and we've all got to sort it out.In the end, this is about the judgment to see how important this issue is for the credibility of politics and politicians.And it's about having the character to take on vested interests inside your own party.That's what I have done.The first to say: MPs voting on their pay, open-ended final salary pension schemes, the John Lewis list - they have all got to go.And it's no different in Europe.We've drawn up a hard-hitting code of conduct for our MEPs.With European elections next year, the message to them is simple:If you don't sign, you won't stand.And while we're on this subject, there's one other thing that destroys trust in politics.And that's parties putting things in their manifesto and then doing the complete opposite.Next year in those European elections we will campaign with all our energy for that referendum on the European constitution that Labour promised but never delivered.Taking responsibility is how we will mend our broken politics.And sharing responsibility and giving it back to professionals is how we will improve our public services.Let's be straight about what's happened to our NHS.Money has been poured in but maternity wards and A&E departments are closing.Productivity is down.The nurses and doctors are disillusioned, frustrated, angry and demoralised.I know from personal experience just how brilliant and dedicated the people who work in the NHS are.But they have been terribly, terribly let down.Instead of a serious long-term reform plan for the NHS......working out how we can deliver a free national health service in an age of rising expectations and rising healthcare costs......never mind the rocketing costs of social care......we've had eleven years of superficial, short-term tinkering.Top-down target after top-down target, with another thirty seven targets added last year.Endless bureaucratic re-organisations, some of them contradictory, others abandoned after just a few months.Labour have taken our most treasured national institution, ripped out its soul and replaced it with targets, directives, management consultants and computers.In August, I got a letter from one of my constituents, John Woods.His wife was taken to hospital.She caught MRSA and she died.Some of the incidents described are so dreadful, and so degrading, that I can't read you most of the letter.He says the treatment his wife received "was like something out of a 17th century asylum not a 21st century £90 billion health service."And then, as his wife's life was coming to end, he remembers her "sitting on the edge of her bed in distress and saying 'I never thought it would be like this'."I sent the letter to Alan Johnson, the Health Secretary.This was his reply."A complaints procedure has been established for the NHS to resolve concerns"Each hospital and Primary Care Trust has a Patient Advice and Liaison Service to support people who wish to make a complaint"There is also an Independent Complaints Advocacy Service"If, when Mr Woods has received a response, he remains dissatisfied, it is open to him to approach the Healthcare Commission and seek an independent review of his complaint and local organisation's response"Once the Health Care Commission has investigated the case he can approach the Health Service Ombudsman if he remains dissatisfied."A Healthcare Commission.A Health Service Ombudsman.A Patient Advice and Liaison Service.An Independent Complaints Advocacy Service.Four ways to make a complaint......but not one way for my constituent's wife to die with dignity.We need to change all that.But here is the plain truth.We will not bring about long-term change if we think that all we have to do is stick with what Labour leave us and just pump some more money in.Instead of those targets and directives that interfere with clinical judgments we'll publish the information about what actually happens in the NHS.We'll give patients an informed choice about where to go for their care......so doctors stop answering to Whitehall, and start answering to patients.This way, the health service can at last become exactly that: a service......not a take it or leave it bureaucracy.I'm afraid Labour have had their chance to show they can be trusted with the NHS, and they have failed.We are the party of the NHS in Britain today and under my leadership that is how it's going to stay.But if you want to know what I really hope we will achieve in government.If you want to know where the change will be greatest from what has gone before.It is our plan for social reform.The central task I have set myself and this Party is to be as radical in social reform as Margaret Thatcher was in economic reform.That's how we plan to repair our broken society.I know this is a controversial argument.Some say our society isn't broken.I wonder what world they live in.Leave aside that almost two million children are brought up in households where no one works.Or that there are housing estates in Britain where people have a lower life expectancy than in the Gaza Strip.Just consider the senseless, barbaric violence on our streets.Children killing children.Twenty-seven kids murdered on the streets of London this year.A gun crime every hour.A serious knife crime every half hour.A million victims from alcohol related-attacks.But it's not just the crime; not even the anti-social behaviour.It's the angry, harsh culture of incivility that seems to be all around us.When in one generation we seem to have abandoned the habits of all human history......that in a civilised society, adults have a proper role - a responsibility - to uphold rules and order in the public realm......not just for their own children but for other people's too.Helen Newlove spoke to us yesterday.I can't tell you how much I've been moved by working with Helen over the past year.This woman, whose husband Gary was brutally kicked to death on her own doorstepThis woman, who had to explain to her beautiful children that their father was not coming home from the hospital, not ever, because he had dared to be a good, responsible citizen.Helen Newlove knows our society is broken.But she believes we can repair it - and so do I.The big question is how.And here is where we need some very plain speaking.There are those who say - and there are many in this hall - that what is required is tough punishment, longer sentences and more prison places.And to a degree, they're right.We'll never mend the broken society without a clear barrier between right and wrong, and harsh penalties when you cross the line.But let's recognise, once and for all, that such an approach only deals with the symptoms, picking up the pieces of failure that has gone before.Come with me to Wandsworth prison and meet the inmates.Yes you meet the mugger, the robber and the burglar.But you also meet the boy who can't read and never could.The teenager hooked on heroin.The young man who never knew the love of a father.The middle aged failure where no-one in the family has known what it's like to go out and work for two generations or maybe more.Miss the context, miss the cause, miss the background......and you'll never get the true picture of why crime is so high in our country.There are those who say that all of this - mending the broken society - will require state action, state programmes and state money.And to a degree, they are right too.We are not an anti-state party.In the twentieth century, state-run social programmes had real success in fighting poverty and making our society stronger.Pensions, sickness benefits, state education: I honour those men and women of all parties and none who created these safety nets and springboards.But today, the returns from endless big state intervention are not just diminishing, they are disappearing.That's because too often, state intervention deals with the symptoms of the problem.I want us to be different: to deal with the long-term causes.That will be the test of our character and judgment.First, families.If we sincerely care about children's futures, then all families, however organised, need our help and support.So I don't have some idealised, rose-tinted view of the family.I know families can be imperfect.I get the modern world.But I think that in our modern world, in these times of stress and anxiety......the family is the best welfare system there is.That's why I want to scrap Labour's plans for a new army of untrained outreach workers......so we can have over 4,000 extra health visitors and guarantees of family visits before and after your child is born.To those who say this is some sort of nanny state I say: nonsense.Remember what it was like the first few nights after your first child is born, the worry, the uncertainly, the questions.Health visitors are a lifeline - and I want more of them.It's because I want to strengthen families that I support flexible working.To those who say this is some intolerable burden on business, I say "wrong".Business pays the costs of family breakdown in taxes - and isn't it right that everyone, including business, should play their part in making Britain a more family-friendly country?Do you know what, if we don't change these antiquated business practices then women......half the talent of the country......are just put off from joining the workforce.We will also back marriage in the tax system.To those who saywhy pick out marriage... ...why do you persist in aggravating people who for whatever reason choose not to get married......I say I don't want to aggravate anyone, but I believe in commitment and many of us, me included, will always remember that moment when you say, up there in front of others, it's not just me anymore, it's us, together, and that helps to take you through the tough times......and that's something we should cherish as a society.When families fail, school is the way we can give children a second chance.My passion about this is both political and personal.After the 2005 election, shadow education secretary was the job I asked for in the Shadow Cabinet and Michael Howard kindly let me have it.I'm not sure my reshuffles work quite like that, but there we are.He's a very kind man and was a great leader of our party.But it's personal because I'm the father of three young children - and I worry about finding good schools for them more than anything else.There's nothing quite like that feeling when you watch your children wandering across the playground, school bag in one hand, packed lunch in the other, knowing they're safe, they're happy, they've got a great teacher in a good school.But the straightforward truth is that there aren't enough good schools, particularly secondary schools, particularly in some of our bigger towns and cities.Any government I lead will not go on excusing this failure.That's why Michael Gove has such radical plans to establish 1,000 New Academies, with real freedoms, like grant maintained schools used to have.And that's why, together, we will break open the state monopoly and allow new schools to be set up.And to those who say we cannot wait for structural reform and competition to raise standards I say - yes, you're right, and we will not wait.The election of a Conservative government will bring - and I mean this almost literally - a declaration of war against those parts of the educational establishment who still cling to the cruelty of the 'all must win prizes' philosophy......and the dangerous practice of dumbing down.Listen to this.It's the President of the Spelling Society.He said, and I quote, "people should be able to use whichever spelling they prefer."He's the President of the Spelling Society.Well, he's wrong. And by the way, that's spelt with a 'W.'And then there's the Qualifications and Curriculum Authority.These are the people who are officially supposed to maintain standards in our school system.You pay their wages.And do you know what you get in return?They let a child get marks for writing "F off" as an answer in an exam.As Prime Minister I'd have my own two words for people like that, and yes, one of them does begin with an 'F'.You're fired.If strengthening families is the first line of defence against social breakdown, and school reform is the second - then welfare reform is the full, pitched battle.This problem goes very deep - and dealing with it will be very tough.There are almost five million people in Britain of working age who are out of work and on benefits.That's bad for them. It's bad for our society. And it's bad for our economy.Decades ago, when we had a universal collective culture of respect for work, a system of unconditional benefits was good and right and effective.But if we're going to talk straight we've got to admit something.That culture doesn't exist any more.In fact, worse than that, the benefit system itself encourages a benefit culture, and sends some pretty perverse messages.It's not even that it's picking up the pieces and treating the symptoms, rather than providing a cure.Today, it is actively making the problem worse.So we will end the something for nothing culture.If you don't take a reasonable offer of a job, you lose benefits.Go on doing it, you'll keep losing benefits.Stay on benefits and you'll have to work for them.I spent some time recently sitting with a benefit officer in a Job Centre plus.In came a young couple. She was pregnant. He was the dad.They were out of work and trying to get somewhere to live.The benefit officer didn't really have much choice but to explain that they would be better off if she lived on her own.What on earth are we doing with a system like that?With the money we save by ending the something for nothing welfare culture we will say to that couple in that benefit office:Stay together, bring up your kid, build your family, we're on your side and we will end that couple penalty.In all these ways, and with the inspiring help of Iain Duncan Smith, we have made the modern Conservative Party the party of social justice.The party that says yes: we can build a society where anyone can rise from the bottom to the top with nothing in their way......but only if we put in place radical Conservative school reform to do it.Yes: we can build a society where we end the scandal of child poverty and give every child the decent start they deserve......but only if we have radical Conservative welfare reform to achieve it.This is the big argument in British politics today, an argument through which we show that in this century......as we have shown in the centuries that went before......with Peel, with Shaftesbury, with Disraeli......when the call comes for a politics of dignity and aspiration for the poor and the marginalised, for the people whom David Davis so vividly described as the victims of state failure......when the call comes to expand hope and broaden horizons......it is this Party, the Conservative Party......it is our means, Conservative means......that will achieve those great and noble progressive ends of fighting poverty, extending opportunity, and repairing our broken society.Progressive ends; Conservative means.That is a big argument about the future.That is a big change.And it is because we had the courage to change that we are able to make it.We changed because knew we had to make ourselves relevant to the twenty-first century.You didn't pick more women candidates to try and look good......you did it so we wouldn't lock out talent and fail to come up with the policies that modern families need.You didn't champion green politics as greenwash......but because climate change is devastating our environment......because the energy gap is a real and growing threat to our security......and because $100-a-barrel oil is hitting families every time they fill up their car and pay their heating bills.You didn't take international development seriously because it was fashionable......but because it is a true reflection of the country we live in, a Britain that is outward-looking, internationalist and generous......and because this Party...that has always believed in one nation......must in this century be a Party of one world.This is who we are today and those who say the Tories haven't changed totally underestimate the capacity this Party has always had to pick itself up, turn itself around and make itself relevant to the challenges of the hour.Those who say we haven't changed just show how little they have changed.We are a changed party and we are a united party.We are making progress in the north in the south in the east and in the west.The first Conservative by-election gain from Labour in thirty years.The first Conservative metropolitan council in the North East in thirty four years.And the first Conservative Mayor of London, Boris Johnson.We are a united party, united in spirit and united in purpose.And we know that our task is to take people with us.Rebuilding our battered economy.Renewing our bureaucratised NHS.Repairing our broken society.That is our plan for change.But in these difficult times we promise no new dawns, no overnight transformations.I'm a man with a plan, not a miracle cure.These difficult times need leadership, yes.They need character and judgment.The leadership to unite your party and build a strong team.The character to stick to your guns and not bottle it when times get tough.The judgment to understand the mistakes that have been made and to offer the country change.Leadership, character, judgment.That's what Britain needs at a time like this and that's what this party now offers.I know we are living in difficult times but I am still optimistic because I have faith in human nature...in our remarkable capacity to innovate, to experiment, to overcome obstacles and to find a way through difficulties......whether those problems are created by man or nature.We can and will come through.We always do.Not because of our government.But because of the people of Britain.Because of what you do - because of the work you do, the families you raise, the jobs you create......because of your attitude, your confidence and your determination.So because we are united...Because we have had the courage to change...Because we have the fresh answers to the challenges of our age.I believe we now have the opportunity, and more than that the responsibility, to bring our country together.Together in the face of this financial crisis.Together in determination that we will come through it.Together in the hope, the belief that better times will lie ahead.

aVI want to get straight to the point.We all know how bad things are, massive debt, social breakdown, political disenchantment. But what I want to talk about today is how good things could be.Don\u2019t get me wrong, I have no illusions. If win this election, it is going to be tough. There will have to be cutbacks in public spending, and that will be painful. We will need to confront Britain\u2019s culture of irresponsibility and that will be hard to take for many people. And we will have to tear down Labour\u2019s big government bureaucracy, ripping up its time-wasting, money-draining, responsibility-sapping nonsense.None of this will be easy. We will be tested. I will be tested. I\u2019m ready for that \u2013 and so I believe, are the British people. So yes, there is a steep climb ahead.But I tell you this. The view from the summit will be worth it.AFGHANISTANIf we win the election the first and gravest responsibility I will face is for our troops in Afghanistan and their families at home.I know that.I know about the mothers and the wives, the husbands and the children, counting the minutes between news bulletins, fearing the announcement of the next casualty. I know what they want \u2013 and deserve - from their government. A ruthless, relentless focus on fighting, winning and coming home.That must start at the top. Instead of a revolving door at the Ministry of Defence with a second rate substitute in charge, we need a politician from the front rank, and in Liam Fox we have one.We need a clear chain of command that flows right from the top. My national security council, with the key ministers and defence chiefs, will sit from day one of a new government, as a war cabinet.We need a strategy that is credible, and do-able. We are not in Afghanistan to deliver the perfect society. We are there to stop the re-establishment of terrorist training camps.Frankly, time is short. We cannot spend another eight years taking ground only to give it back again.So our method should be clear......send more soldiers to train more Afghans to deliver the security we need. Then we can bring our troops home.And I know the most urgent requirement of all. That those brave men and women we send into danger have every piece of equipment they need to do the job we ask of them. I will make sure that happens.And I have something else to say. When the country is at war, when Whitehall is at war, we need people who understand war in Whitehall.That\u2019s why I\u2019m proud to announce today that someone who has fought for our country and served for forty years in our armed forces will not only advise our defence team but will join our benches in the House of Lords and if we win the election could serve in a future Conservative Government:General Sir Richard Dannatt. As we welcome him to serve with us, let us all salute those who serve our country.FAMILY, COMMUNITY, COUNTRYWe could have come to Manchester this week and played it safe. But that\u2019s not what this party is about and it\u2019s certainly not what I\u2019m about.When I stood on that stage in Blackpool four years ago it wasn\u2019t just to head up this party, sit around and wait for the tide to turn. It was to lead this party and change it, so together we could turn the tide.Look what we\u2019ve done together. More women candidates, campaigning on the environment, the party of the NHS. And this year, here in Manchester, our most successful, dynamic conference for twenty years.I\u2019d like to thank everyone involved, the police who kept us safe and your chum and mine, Eric Pickles.But also this year, in these difficult times, we\u2019ve won the argument on the economy and debt as George Osborne showed in that magnificent speech on Tuesday.That was the success we achieved this year.But for me and Samantha this year will only ever mean one thing. When such a big part of your life suddenly ends nothing else - nothing outside - matters. It\u2019s like the world has stopped turning and the clocks have stopped ticking. And as they slowly start again, weeks later, you ask yourself all over again: do I really want to do this? You think about what you really believe and what sustains you.I know what sustains me the most. She is sitting right there and I\u2019m incredibly proud to call her my wife.My beliefs. I am not a complicated person. I love this country and the things it stands for.That the state is your servant, never your master. Common sense and decency. The British sense of community.I have some simple beliefs.That there is such a thing as society, it\u2019s just not the same thing as the state. That there is a \u2018we\u2019 in politics, and not just a \u2018me.\u2019Above all, the importance of family. That fierce sense of loyalty you feel for each other. The unconditional love you give and receive, especially when things go wrong or when you get it wrong. That powerful sense you have when you hold your children and there\u2019s nothing, absolutely nothing - you wouldn\u2019t do to protect them.This is my DNA: family, community, country. These are the things I care about. They are what made me. They are what I\u2019m in public service to protect, promote and defend. And I believe they are what we need in Britain today more than ever.I know how lucky I\u2019ve been to have the chances I had. And I know there are children growing up in Britain today who will never know the love of a father. Who are born in homes that hold them back. Who go to schools that keep them back.Children who will never start a business, never raise a family, never see the world. Children who will live the life they\u2019re given, not the life they want. That is what I want to change.I want every child to have the chances I had. That is why I\u2019m standing here.BIG GOVERNMENTBut we won\u2019t help anyone unless we face up to some big problems. The highest budget deficit since the war. The deepest recession since the war. Social breakdown; political disillusionment. Big problems for the next government to address.And here is the big argument in British politics today, put plainly and simply. Labour say that to solve the country\u2019s problems, we need more government.Don\u2019t they see? It is more government that got us into this mess.Why is our economy broken? Not just because Labour wrongly thought they\u2019d abolished boom and bust. But because government got too big, spent too much and doubled the national debt.Why is our society broken? Because government got too big, did too much and undermined responsibility.Why are our politics broken? Because government got too big, promised too much and pretended it had all the answers.Of course it was done with the best intentions. And let\u2019s be clear: not everything Labour did was wrong.Devolution; the minimum wage; civil partnerships, these are good things that we will we keep.But this idea that for every problem there\u2019s a government solution for every issue an initiative, for every situation a czar....It ends with them making you register with the government to help out your child\u2019s football team. With police officers punished for babysitting each other\u2019s children. With laws so bureaucratic and complicated even their own Attorney General can\u2019t obey them.Do you know the worst thing about their big government? It\u2019s not the cost, though that\u2019s bad enough. It is the steady erosion of responsibility. Our task is to lead Britain in a completely different direction.So no, we are not going to solve our problems with bigger government. We are going to solve our problems with a stronger society. Stronger families. Stronger communities. A stronger country. All by rebuilding responsibility.THE DEBT CRISISThe clearest sign of big government irresponsibility is the enormous size of our debt.If we win the election, we will have to confront Labour\u2019s Debt Crisis, deal with it, and take the country with us. I want everyone to understand the gravity of our situation.Our national debt has doubled in the last five years and our annual deficit next year will be over £170 billion.That\u2019s twice as big as when we nearly went bankrupt in the 1970s. It is a massive risk to our economy. If we spend more than we earn, we have to get the money from somewhere.Right now, the Government is simply printing it. Sometime soon that will have to stop, because in the end, printing money leads to inflation. Then the Government will have to borrow it.But we\u2019ll only be given the money if lenders are confident we can pay it back. If they\u2019re not, we\u2019ll have to pay higher interest rates and that could stop our economic recovery in its tracks.So we have three choices.Option one: we can just default on the debt. Not pay it. Other countries have done that in the past. But I don\u2019t think anyone in this country wants to go down that road.Option two: we could encourage inflation, which would wipe out the value of the debt, making it easier to pay off. But that\u2019s not just an economic disaster \u2013 it\u2019s a social disaster too. It doesn\u2019t just wipe out debts, it wipes out people\u2019s hard-earned savings.So we have the third option - for me the only option. We must pay down this deficit. The longer we leave it, the worse it will be for all of us.I know there are some who say we should just wait.Don\u2019t talk about the deficit. Don\u2019t even plan for what needs to be done. Just wait. Don\u2019t they understand \u2013 it\u2019s the waiting that\u2019s the problem.The longer we wait for a credible plan, the bigger the bill for our children to pay. The longer we wait, the greater the risk to the recovery. The longer we wait, the higher the chance we return to recession.Here\u2019s the most obvious reason we can\u2019t wait. The more we wait, the more we waste on the interest we\u2019re paying on this debt.Next year, Gordon Brown will spend more money on the interest on our debt than on schools. More than on law and order, more than on child poverty.So I say to the Labour Party and the trades unions just tell me what is compassionate, what is progressive about spending more on debt interest than on helping the poorest children in our country?The progressive thing to do, the responsible thing to do is to get a grip on the debt but in a way that brings the country together instead of driving it apart. That means showing leadership at the top which is why we will cut ministers\u2019 pay and freeze it for a parliament.It means showing that we\u2019re all in this together which is why we\u2019ll freeze public sector pay for all but the one million lowest paid public sector workers......for one year to help protect jobs.And it means showing that the rich will pay their share which is why for now the 50p tax rate will have to stay and Child Trust Funds for those on middle and higher incomes will have to go.Yes we have made some tough choices. But in British politics today that is the only responsible thing to do.PENSIONERSDealing with this debt crisis is not just about cuts in the short term. We must also live within our means over the long term. Everyone knows we have an ageing population.Our pension system was designed in a time when many people didn\u2019t live till 70 \u2026. It is out of date and it has to change. That\u2019s why this week we made the difficult decision to bring forward the raising of the pension age.I know that working longer will be tough for many people. But it will also allow us to help pensioners more.I got an email from a lady who wrote to me in desperation. She doesn\u2019t want me to reveal her name because she\u2019s so frightened of what might happen to her.She and her husband left school at fifteen and started work straight away. They bought their own home, where they\u2019ve lived for forty years. But they\u2019ve been let down terribly. She lost out on the 10p tax and took a drop in her pension. She and her husband aren\u2019t entitled to pension credit because they saved for their old age.Here\u2019s what she says:\u201cduring the cold spell this winter, we sat watching TV with blankets wrapped around us.The drug dealer and the druggies who live nearby had their windows wide open and the heating full on.We don\u2019t bother watching police dramas on the TV, we just look out of our window.Our savings are making no money.If one of us dies we cannot afford to stay in our home.\u201dThis lady doesn\u2019t want pity. Pensioners don\u2019t want pity. They just want to know that if they\u2019ve lived responsibly, they\u2019ll be looked after in their old age.Parties have been talking about raising the pension in line with earnings for years. But it never happens.Well let\u2019s be the party that finally makes it happen. Because of the difficult choice we\u2019ve made on the pension age we\u2019ll be able not just to deal with our debt but to raise the basic state pension in line with earnings. Not just for one year, but for every year.GROWTHCutting back on big government is not just about spending less. Getting our debt down means getting our economic growth up.Let\u2019s be clear where growth will come from. Not big government, with its Regional Development Agencies and National Investment Corporations but entrepreneurs. New businesses, new industries, new technologies.I get enterprise. I worked in business for seven years. And let me tell you what I learned during that time.Complicated taxes, excessive regulations they make life impossible for entrepreneurs.So I will always put the same questions to Ken Clarke and his business team.What are you doing to make it easier to start a business? Easier to take people on? What are you doing to make regulation less complicated? To make locating a business here more attractive?Ken Clarke and David Willetts this week helped launch our plan to Get Britain Working.It is a plan to boost science, skills, self-employment a plan to improve training, technology, tax incentives for entrepreneurs.This is what it means.It means the man who\u2019s lost his job and his confidence saying yes, I can set up on my own, I can take responsibility, there\u2019s nothing to stop me.It means the people he takes on, who thought they were written off, thinking yes I\u2019ve got another chance and I can provide for my family again.Self-belief is infectious and I want it to spread again throughout our country especially through the poorest places where Labour let hope fade away.In Britain today, there are entrepreneurs everywhere \u2013 they just don\u2019t know it yet. Success stories everywhere \u2013 they just haven\u2019t been written yet. We must be the people who release that potential.FINANCIAL REFORMAnd just a quick word to the man who says he abolished boom and bust and then saved the world.It was you Gordon Brown who designed the system of financial regulation that helped cause the financial crisis. You want to keep it the same. We say it needs to change.That\u2019s why we will give back to the Bank of England its power to regulate the City powers that should never have been taken away.BROKEN SOCIETYBut once we\u2019re generating economic growth - what are we going to do with it? What kind of society do we hope to build?Look at Britain in 2009. It is, in so many ways, a great place to live. Great culture and arts, great diversity, great sport.And think of the great sport coming up next year England in the World Cup, then the Olympics, then rugby and cricket too. And yes, let\u2019s get the Football World Cup here in 2018 as well.But in Britain today there is a dark side as well. After twelve years of big government, we still have those stubborn social problems.Poverty, crime, addiction. Failing schools. Sink estates. Broken homes.The truth is, it\u2019s not just that big government has failed to solve these problems. Big government has all too often helped cause them by undermining the personal and social responsibility that should be the lifeblood of a strong society.Just think of the signals we send out. To the family struggling to raise children, pay a mortgage, hold down a job.\u201cStay together and we\u2019ll give you less; split up and we give you more.\u201dTo the young mum working part time, trying to earn something extra for her family \u201cfrom every extra pound you earn we\u2019ll take back 96 pence.\u201dYes, 96 pence.Let me say that again, slowly.In Gordon Brown\u2019s Britain if you\u2019re a single mother with two kids earning £150 a week the withdrawal of benefits and the additional taxes mean that for every extra pound you earn, you keep just 4 pence.What kind of incentive is that? Thirty years ago this party won an election fighting against 98 per cent tax rates on the richest. Today I want us to show even more anger about 96 per cent tax rates on the poorest.And in that fight, there\u2019s one person this party can rely on. He\u2019s the man who has dedicated himself to the cause of social justice\u2026and shown great courage in standing up for those least able to stand up for themselves. Iain Duncan SmithAnd I am proud to announce today that if we win the election he will be responsible in government for bringing together all our work to help mend the broken society.LABOUR AND POVERTYLabour still have the arrogance to think that they are the ones who will fight poverty and deprivation.On Monday, when we announced our plan to Get Britain Working you know what Labour called it? \u201cCallous.\u201dExcuse me? Who made the poorest poorer? Who left youth unemployment higher? Who made inequality greater?No, not the wicked Tories\u2026 you, Labour: you\u2019re the ones that did this to our society.So don\u2019t you dare lecture us about poverty. You have failed and it falls to us, the modern Conservative Party to fight for the poorest who you have let down.FAMILYWe\u2019ll start with what is most important to me \u2013 and what I believe is most important for the country - families.I believe that a stable, loving home is the most precious thing a child can have. Society begins at home. Responsibility starts at home. That\u2019s why we cannot be neutral on this.Now I don\u2019t live in some fantasy land where every family is happily married with 2.4 kids. Nor am I going to stand here and pretend that family life is always easy.But by recognising marriage and civil partnerships in the tax system and abolishing the couple penalty in the benefits system, we\u2019ll help make it that little bit easier.But it\u2019s not just about money. It\u2019s also about emotional support, particularly in those fraught early years before children go to school. Labour understood this and we should acknowledge that.That\u2019s why Sure Start will stay, and we\u2019ll improve it. We will keep flexible working, and extend it. And we will not just keep but transform something that was there long before Sure Start began \u2013 health visitors.But making the country more family-friendly is not just about what government does. Responsibility goes much wider. It\u2019s about what we all do. It\u2019s about the way we live.Why aren\u2019t we building homes with enough room for a family to sit round a table and actually eat a meal together?It\u2019s about our culture. Why do so many magazines and websites and music videos make children insecure about the way they look or the experiences they haven\u2019t even had?And it\u2019s about our society. We give our children more and more rights, and we trust our teachers less and less. We\u2019ve got to stop treating children like adults and adults like children.It is about everyone taking responsibility. The more that we as a society do, the less we will need government to do.WELFAREBut you can\u2019t expect families to behave responsibly when the welfare system works in the opposite direction.In welfare, big government has failed people in a big way. There are two million children in Britain growing up in homes where no-one works. Two million.That is the highest in Europe. It is one in six children in our country.We have to break this cycle of welfare dependency.I got an email from a guy called Viv Williams. He lost his job last year and was desperate to get back into work. But he had a mortgage to pay so he went to register for Job Seeker\u2019s Allowance.He\u2019d twisted his ankle and walked in with a limp, so you know what they said? They told him he couldn\u2019t register for Job Seeker\u2019s Allowance because he wasn\u2019t fit to work so he\u2019d have to go on incapacity benefit.He told them there was nothing wrong with him, that he wanted to work. But no \u2013 he wasn\u2019t allowed to.This is a man who wanted to take responsibility for himself and his family and the system said no, you\u2019ve got to depend on the state.As he says: \u201cI told them, you\u2019re having a laugh.\u201d But it\u2019s not funny. The welfare system today sends out completely crazy signals.We have got to turn it around and with Theresa May and David Freud in charge we will. We\u2019re going to make it clear: If you really cannot work, we\u2019ll look after you. But if you can work, you should work and not live off the hard work of others.NHSSo we have to reform welfare and strengthen families. But when I think of my family, in the end there\u2019s only one thing that matters and that is that the people I love are healthy and well.My family owes so much to the National Health Service. No, it is not perfect. But I tell you, when you\u2019re carrying a child in your arms to Accident and Emergency in the middle of the night and don\u2019t have to reach for your wallet it\u2019s a lot better than the alternative.So we will never change the idea at the heart of our NHS, that healthcare in this country is free at the point of use and available to everyone based on need, not ability to pay.But that doesn\u2019t mean the NHS shouldn\u2019t change. It has to change because for many people, the service isn\u2019t good enough. Mostly, that\u2019s not the fault of those who work in the NHS.The fault lies with big government. With their endless targets and reorganisations, Labour have tried to run the NHS like a machine.But it\u2019s not a machine full of cogs. It is a living, breathing institution made up of people \u2013 doctors, nurses, patients.This lever-pulling from above \u2013 it has got to stop. With Andrew Lansley\u2019s reform plans, we\u2019re going to give the NHS back to people. We\u2019ll say to the doctors: those targets you hate, they\u2019re gone.But in return, we\u2019ll do more for patients. Choice about where you get treated. Information about how good different doctors are, how good different hospitals are.Information about the things that really matter, cancer survival times......the rate of hospital infections......your chances of surviving if you have a stroke.We will give doctors back their professional responsibility.But in exchange they will be subject to patient accountability. That\u2019s why we can look the British people in the eye and say this party is the party of the NHS now, today, tomorrow, always.CRIMEThe instinct to protect the people we love is so strong. Nearly two years ago it was that instinct \u2013 that love \u2013 that drove Fiona Pilkington to do something desperate.When I first read her story in the paper I found it difficult to finish the article \u2013 it\u2019s one of the saddest things I\u2019ve ever read.Fiona was so driven to despair by the vile thugs that bullied her and her lovely disabled daughter Francecca and by the police that didn\u2019t answer her cries for help that she could only see one way out. She put her daughter in her car, drove to a lay-by, and set it on fire.If no one would protect them then by ending their lives, she was keeping them safe.No one could hurt them anymore. Just think about what we allowed to happen here in our country. This goes deep and it\u2019s been going on for years.It is about a breakdown of all the things that are meant to keep us safe......a complete breakdown of responsibility.A breakdown of morality in the minds of those thugs a total absence of feeling or conscience. A breakdown in community where a neighbour is left to reach a pitch of utter misery. And a breakdown of our criminal justice system.Every part of it, the police, the prosecution services, the prisons......is failing under the weight of big government targets and bureaucracy. The police aren\u2019t on the streets because they\u2019re busy complying with ten different inspection regimes. The police say the CPS isn\u2019t charging people\u2026because they have to hit targets to reduce the number of unsuccessful trials.And the prisons aren\u2019t rehabilitating offenders\u2026because they\u2019re focused on meeting thirty-three different performance indicators.This all needs to change. I\u2019m not going to stand here and promise you a country where nothing bad ever happens. I do not underestimate how difficult it will be to deal with this problem of crime and disorder.We cannot rebuild social responsibility from on high. But the least we can do the least we can do is pledge to all the people who are scared, who live their lives in fear and who can\u2019t protect themselves, that a Conservative Government, with Chris Grayling, with Dominic Grieve, will reform the police, reform the courts, reform prisons. We will be there to protect you.TERRORISMWe understand too the grave responsibility we will have to protect our people from terrorism. This party knows only too well the pain and grief that terrorism brings.Twenty-five years ago, almost to the day on the Thursday night of our party conference in Brighton, the IRA exploded a bomb that injured and killed good friends and colleagues.Today let us honour their memory and send our thoughts and best wishes to all those, including Margaret Tebbit, who still bear the scars of that terrible night.SCHOOLSTo build a responsible society we need to teach our children properly. I come at education as a parent, not a politician.When I watch my daughter skip across the playground to start her first term in year one, I want to know that every penny of the education budget is following her and the other children into that school and that classroom.So when I see Ed Balls blow hundreds of millions on so-called \u201ccurriculum development\u201d on consultancies, on quangos like the QCDA and BECTA like every other parent with a child at a state school I want to say:This is my child, it's my money, give it to my headteacher instead of wasting it in Whitehall.But it\u2019s not just about money. It\u2019s about values. We know that discipline is vital but we overrule head teachers when they exclude a disruptive pupil.We know that every child has different abilities and different needs but too often we put them all in the same class so the brightest aren\u2019t stretched and those who are struggling fall behind.We know that competitive sport is important but we\u2019ve had minister after minister promising it and nothing ever happens.Discipline. Setting by ability. Regular sport.These are all things you find in a private school. Not because the Government tells them to do it, but because it\u2019s what parents want. Why can\u2019t parents in state schools always get what they want?With us, they will, because our reforms will create more good schools and more school places. Yes, our plans will increase competition \u2013 and no, that is not a dirty word. It means that when a good new school opens down the road, the other ones around it will want to improve. Big government has totally failed in state education and with Michael Gove we will get the radical change we need.COUNTRYFamily, community, country. In recent years we\u2019ve been hearing things about our country we haven\u2019t heard for a long time. People saying they don\u2019t know what it is to be British, what this country stands for.People in Scotland who want to leave the United Kingdom and people in England who say let them go.I am passionate about our Union and I will never do anything to put it at risk. And because of the new political force we have created with the Ulster Unionists, I\u2019m proud that at the next election we will be the only party fielding candidates in every part of the United Kingdom.Britishness is not mechanical, it\u2019s organic. It\u2019s an emotional connection to a way of life, an attitude, a set of institutions.Make these stronger and our national identity becomes stronger. To be British is to be open-minded.We don\u2019t care who you are or where you\u2019re from, if you\u2019ve got something to offer then this is a place you can call home.But if we want our country to carry on with this proud, open tradition, we\u2019ve got to understand the pressures of mass immigration and that\u2019s why we need to put limits on it.To be British is to be generous. Whenever there\u2019s a disaster on the other side of the world, British people dig deep into their pockets and give their money. Comic Relief didn\u2019t raise less money this year because of the recession \u2013 it raised more.That says big things about our country, and government should reflect that. That\u2019s why I\u2019m proud that we\u2019ve ring-fenced the budget for international development.To be British is to be sceptical of authority and the powers-that-be.That\u2019s why ID cards, 42 days and Labour\u2019s surveillance state are so utterly unacceptable and why we will sweep the whole rotten edifice away.And to be British is to have an instinctive love of the countryside and the natural world. The dangers of climate change are stark and very real. If we don\u2019t act now, and act quickly, we could face disaster.Yes, we need to change the way we live. But is that such a bad thing? The insatiable consumption and materialism of the past decade, has it made us happier or more fulfilled?Yes, we have to put our faith in technologies. But that is not a giant leap. Just around the corner are new green technologies, unimaginable a decade ago, that can change the way we live, travel, work.And yes, we need global co-operation. But that shouldn\u2019t be difficult. It just takes leadership, and that\u2019s what we need at the Copenhagen summit this December.POLITICSBut if you care about our country, you\u2019ve got to care about the health of our institutions. And today one of them, more than any other, is in a serious state of decline.Our parliament used to be a beacon to the world. But the expenses scandal made it a laughing stock.We apologised to the public, paid back the money that shouldn\u2019t have been claimed......and published all our expenses online to help stop this happening again.We\u2019ve led the way in other areas too......MPs\u2019 pay and pensions, cutting the cost of politics. But let me make something clear - this is not over.We are just starting the job of building the new politics we need. Because the anger over expenses reflected something deeper. The sense that people have been left powerless by big government.So it is time to shake things up. We need to redistribute power and responsibility. It\u2019s your community and you should have control over it......so we need decentralisation. It\u2019s your money and you should know what is being done with it......so we need transparency. It\u2019s your life that\u2019s affected by political decisions and the people who make those decisions should answer to you, so we need accountability.EUBut if there is one political institution that needs decentralisation, transparency, and accountability, it is the EU.For the past few decades, something strange has been happening on the left of British politics. People who think of themselves as progressives have fallen in love with an institution that no one elects, no one can remove, and that hasn\u2019t signed off its accounts for over a decade.Indeed even to question these things is, apparently, completely beyond the pale. Well, here is a progressive reform plan for Europe.Let\u2019s work together on the things where the EU can really help, like combating climate change, fighting global poverty and spreading free and fair trade.But let\u2019s return to democratic and accountable politics the powers the EU shouldn\u2019t have.And if we win the election, we will have as the strongest voice for our country\u2019s interests, the man who is leading our campaign for a referendum, the man who will be our new British Foreign Secretary: William Hague.WHAT WE CAN PROMISEFamily, community, country.Recognising that what holds society together is responsibility......and that the good society is a responsible society. That\u2019s what I\u2019m about \u2013 that\u2019s what any government I lead will be about.The problems we face are big and urgent. Rebuilding our broken economy......because unless we do, our children will be saddled with debt for decades to come.Mending our broken society......because unless we do, we will never solve those stubborn social problems that cause the size of government to rise.Fixing our broken politics......because unless we do, we will never reform public services......never see the strong, powerful citizens\u2026who will build the responsible society that we all want to see.This week you\u2019ve heard about our plans, our policies, the changes we want to make and the team to put them in place.But I know that whatever plans you make in Opposition, it\u2019s the unpredictable events that come to dominate a government.And it\u2019s your character, your temperament and your judgment, not your policies and your manifesto \u2013 that really make the difference.You can never prove you\u2019re ready for everything that will come your way as Prime Minister. But you can point to the judgments you\u2019ve made. And you can learn from the mistakes that others have made.I\u2019ve seen what happens when you win and you waste your mandate obsessing about the 24 hour news cycle and fighting each day as if it\u2019s a new general election, ducking the difficult things that would have really made a difference.That was Blair. And I\u2019ve seen what happens when you turn every decision into a political calculation. That was \u2013 that is \u2013 Brown.So I won\u2019t promise things I cannot deliver. But I can look you in the eye and tell you that in a Conservative Britain:If you put in the effort to bring in a wage, you will be better off. If you save money your whole life, you\u2019ll be rewarded. If you start your own business, we\u2019ll be right behind you. If you want to raise a family, we\u2019ll support you. If you\u2019re frightened, we\u2019ll protect you.If you risk your safety to stop a crime, we\u2019ll stand by you. If you risk your life to fight for your country, we will honour you.Ask me what a Conservative government stands for and the answer is this, we will reward those who take responsibility, and care for those who can\u2019t.CONCLUSIONSo if we cut big government back. If we move society forward.And if we rebuild responsibility, then we can put Britain back on her feet.I know that today there aren\u2019t many reasons to be cheerful.But there are reasons to believe. Yes it will be a steep climb. But the view from the summit will be worth it. Let me tell you what I can see.I see a country where more children grow up with security and love because family life comes first. I see a country where you choose the most important things in life - the school your child goes to and the healthcare you get. I see a country where communities govern themselves - organising local services, independent of Whitehall, a great handing back of power to people.I see a country with entrepreneurs everywhere, bringing their ideas to life - and life to our great towns and cities. I see a country where it\u2019s not just about the quantity of money, but the quality of life - where we lead the world in saving our planet. I see a country where you\u2019re not so afraid to walk home alone, where you\u2019re safe in the knowledge that right and wrong is restored to law and order.I see a country where the poorest children go to the best schools not the worst, where birth is never a barrier.No, we will not make it if we pull in different directions, follow our own interests, take care of only ourselves.But if we pull together, come together, work together - we will get through this together.And when we look back we will say not that the government made it happen......not that the minister made it happen......but the businesswoman made it happen......the police officer made it happen......the father made it happen......the teacher made it happen.You made it happen.

aVIt is an honour and a privilege to stand here, before the party I lead, before the country I love, as the Conservative prime minister of the United Kingdom.I want to tell you today, in the clearest terms I can, what we must do together, and what we can achieve together.But first, let's remember where we've come from. Three defeats. Thirteen party conferences \u2013 4,757 days in the wilderness.Remember what they said about us? They called us a dead parrot. They said we had ceased to be. That we were an ex-party.Turns out we really were only resting \u2013 and here we are. Back serving our country. Together in the national interest. Giving Britain the good, strong government it deserves.There are so many we need to thank for that. The British people. You have given us a chance and we will work flat out to prove worthy of that chance.I want to say a big thank you to those who led this party before me. William Hague got us back on our feet. Iain Duncan Smith helped us get back our heart. Michael Howard gave us back our confidence.I know that I am standing here as prime minister because they stood up for this party in good times and bad, and I will always remember that.And it is impossible to pay tribute to previous leaders of this party, without mentioning the greatest peacetime prime minister of the 20th century.Next week, Margaret Thatcher celebrates her 85th birthday. She'll be doing it in Downing Street, and I know everyone in this hall will want to wish her well.But there are some very special people I'd like to thank \u2013 you, the people of this party. I can't thank all of you individually \u2013 but I am going to single one of you out.His name is Harry Beckough. Harry joined our party in 1929 to fight Stafford Cripps. Since then, across 81 years and 21 elections, Harry has been with us.When Churchill warned of an iron curtain, Harry was with us. When this country had never had it so good, Harry was with us. When a lady refused to turn, Harry was with us.This year, when we fought the general election, Harry \u2013 aged 96 \u2013 was there, manning the loudhailer on the battle bus in Marlborough. And I'm delighted to say Harry is with us here today.I tell you something \u2013 this is a party for all generations. Harry, without people like you we wouldn't be here \u2013 and our party wouldn't be in government. So thank you for everything you've done, and all you represent.I'll never forget the night of 6 May. Watching the results coming in. The Tories back in the north. Winning in Wales. Sweeping across West Yorkshire. Taking seats we hadn't won in decades: Carlisle. Cannock. Thurrock. The end of a Labour government that had done so much damage.But, also, as I drove to London, there was that growing sense that we just weren't going to make it across the winning line.I went to bed at about 7am in a hotel, wishing like anything I was at home with Sam and the little ones, not knowing where it was all heading.I woke up two hours later and felt sure of the answer. The country wants leadership, not partisanship.Try the big thing. Do the right thing. Succeed and you can really achieve something. Fail and, well, at least you tried.I know there are a few who say that we should have sat tight, waited for our opponents to fall out and brought in a minority government. But a minority government would have limped through parliament, unable to do anything useful for our country.The voters left us with a hung parliament and they wanted us to respond responsibly, to do the right thing, not play political games.So I set out to form a strong, stable, coalition government. And I want to thank Nick Clegg for what he did.There were loads of phone calls and meetings in those five hectic days in May. My daughter Nancy asked at breakfast one morning: "Daddy, why are you spending so much time with this man Nick Leg?"Nick and I didn't agree about everything. He wanted clearer pledges on PR. I wanted them on the family.When I told him what I really thought of the European parliament, he said: "My God, it's worse than I thought."But we recognised we could work together. Not just lots of shared values, like wanting a country that is more free, more fair, more green, more decentralised, but a shared way of trying to do business.Reasonable debate, not tribal dividing lines. Give and take. Respect when you disagree. Trust. A sense that politics shouldn't be so different from the rest of life, where rational people do somehow find a way of overcoming their disagreements.Nick Clegg is not just sitting in government trying to win a few concessions here and there. The Liberal Democrats are proper partners, getting stuck in, making big decisions, shaping what we do and taking responsibility.That's why we can form a proper government and you can be proud of what we've done together.Now, I know there will be compromise, and I know we'll have to do things we might not like.Next May, there'll be a referendum on electoral reform. I don't want to change our voting system any more than you do. But let's not waste time trying to wreck the bill \u2013 let's just get out there and win the vote.Because you know what? At its best, this party always puts country first. We'll leave the vested interests to others.And no, we're not about self-interest either. This is the party of the national interest and, with this coalition, that's what we're showing today.People wondered what a coalition could achieve. But just look at what we are achieving already \u2013 together, in the national interest.Conservative policies, policies you campaigned on, policies we are delivering. Two hundred new academies. Ten thousand university places. Fifty thousand apprenticeships.Corporation tax \u2013 cut. The jobs tax \u2013 axed. Police targets \u2013 smashed. Immigration \u2013 capped. The third runway \u2013 stopped. Home Information Packs \u2013 dropped. Fat cat salaries \u2013 revealed. ID Cards \u2013 abolished. The NHS \u2013 protected. Our aid promise \u2013 kept.Quangos \u2013 closing down. Ministers' pay \u2013 coming down. A bank levy \u2013 coming up. A cancer drugs fund \u2013 up and running. £6bn of spending saved this year. An emergency budget to balance the books in five years. An EU referendum lock to protect our sovereign powers every year.For our pensioners \u2013 the earnings link restored. For our new entrepreneurs \u2013 employees' tax reduced. And for our brave armed forces \u2013 the operational allowance doubled.Look what we've done in five months. Just imagine what we can do in five years.In five years time, our combat troops will have left Afghanistan. This party has steadfastly supported our mission there, and so will this government.But that does not mean simply accepting what went before. In our first few weeks in office, we set a clear new direction. Focused. Hard-headed. Time-limited.We are not in Afghanistan to build a perfect democracy. No dreamy ideas. Just hard-headed national security \u2013 pure and simple.Almost every terrorist who took part in 9/11 was trained by al-Qaida in Afghanistan. If we left tomorrow, those training camps could easily come back, because Afghans are not yet capable of securing their own country.But we will not stay a day longer than we need to. British combat forces will not remain in Afghanistan after 2015.By then, they will have been there for 14 years and in Helmand province for nine \u2013 three years longer than world war two.For those who have served; for those who bear the scars; and for those who will never come home, this country has gratitude beyond words.This government has set a new direction right across our foreign policy.Our principles are simple. Don't neglect important relationships. Already we are restoring ties with India, with allies in the Gulf, with our friends in the Commonwealth.Don't make commitments without the right resources. Today, we're geared up to fight old wars. We have armoured brigades ready to repel Soviet tanks across the German plain.But we struggled to provide enough helicopters for our soldiers in Afghanistan, for the real war we are really fighting.Since becoming prime minister, nothing has shocked me more than the complete mess of the defence budget we inherited.So our defence review will match our commitments with the resources we've got. This will mean some big changes. But I promise you this: I will take no risks with Britain's security.That's why, when more and more countries have or want nuclear weapons, we will always keep our ultimate insurance policy, we will renew our nuclear deterrent based on the Trident missile system.But Britain's reputation is not just about might. It's about doing what is right. When this country has got it wrong, we'll admit it, as I did when I apologised for Bloody Sunday.When there's a cloud hanging over our reputation, we'll address it, as we have done by setting up an inquiry into whether this country was complicit in the mistreatment of detainees.We will always pursue British interests, but there are some red lines we must never cross.Like the sight of the man responsible for the Lockerbie bombing, the biggest mass murderer in British history, set free to get a hero's welcome in Tripoli. No. It was wrong, it undermined our standing in the world, and nothing like that must ever happen again.When I walked into Downing Street as prime minister, I was deeply conscious that I was taking over the heaviest of responsibilities, not least for the future of our United Kingdom.Tony Blair, Gordon Brown \u2013 and John Major before them \u2013 worked hard to bring lasting peace to Northern Ireland, and I will continue their work.And as the threat of dissident republican terrorism increases, I want to make it clear that we will protect the people of our country with every means at our disposal.And I want to make something else clear. When I say I am prime minister of the United Kingdom, I really mean it. England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland \u2013 we're weaker apart, stronger together, so together is the way we must always stay.But there is another side to life as prime minister. Like being made to watch the England football team lose 4-1 to Germany, in the company of the German chancellor.It's a form of punishment I wouldn't wish on anyone. I have to say, she is one of the politest people I have ever met \u2013 every time their players scored another goal, she would turn to me and say: "I really am terribly sorry."It's brought a whole new element to Anglo-German diplomatic relations: whatever you do, don't mention the score.But however different life has got as prime minister, there's one thing that, for me, has stayed the same. My belief about how this country needs to change.Let's start by being honest with ourselves. The mess this country is in \u2013 it's not all because of Labour.Of course, they must take some of the blame. Alright - they need to take a lot of the blame.Let me just get this off my chest. They left us with massive debts, the highest deficit, overstretched armed forces, demoralised public services, endless ridiculous rules and regulations and quangos and bureaucracy and nonsense.They left us a legacy of spinning, smearing, briefing, back-biting, half-truths and cover-ups, patronising, old-fashioned, top-down, wasteful, centralising, inefficient, ineffective, unaccountable politics, 10p tax and 90 days detention, an election bottled and a referendum denied, gold sold at half price and council tax doubled, bad news buried and Mandelson resurrected, pension funds destroyed and foreign prisoners not deported, Gurkhas kept out and extremist preachers allowed in.Yes, they deserve some blame, and we'll never let them forget it.But the point I want to make is this. The state of our nation is not just determined by the government and those who run it. It is determined by millions of individual actions \u2013 by what each of us do and what we choose not to do.Yes, Labour failed to regulate the City properly. But they didn't force those banks to take massive risks with other people's money.Yes, Labour tried to boss people around and undermined responsibility. But they weren't the ones smashing up our town centres on a Friday night or sitting on their sofas waiting for their benefits.Yes, Labour centralised too much and told people they could fix every problem. But it was the rest of us who swallowed it, hoping that if the government took care of things, perhaps we wouldn't have to.Too many people thought: "I've paid my taxes, the state will look after everything."But citizenship isn't a transaction in which you put your taxes in and get your services out. It's a relationship \u2013 you're part of something bigger than you, and it matters what you think and feel and do.So to get out of the mess we're in, changing the government is not enough. We need to change the way we think about ourselves, and our role in society.Your country needs you, and today I want to tell you about the part we've all got to play, and the spirit that will take us through.It's the spirit I saw in a group of NHS maternity nurses in my constituency who told me they wanted to form a co-op to use their own ideas and their nous to help new parents.It's the spirit you see just down the road in Balsall Heath, where local residents' street patrols have turned a no-go area into a place where people can once again feel safe.It's the spirit that, just today, has seen some of our leading social organisations come together to set up a new Citizen University, to help give people the skills they need to play a bigger part in society.It's the spirit of activism, dynamism, people taking the initiative, working together to get things done.Sometimes that spirit gets taken a little too far. I got a letter from a six-year-old girl called Niamh with a pound coin stuck to it. And there was a note from her mum, which said: "Dear Mr Cameron ... after hearing about the budget, Niamh wanted to send you her tooth fairy money to help."There we are, George \u2013 nearly there. Niamh: thankyou.What I'm talking about, the spirit we need, is the big society spirit \u2013 and here's why I think its time has come.All over the world, governments are wrestling with the same challenges. Not just building prosperous, competitive economies, providing good public services and paying for pensions but creating strong societies, improving quality of life, ensuring that everyone feels they belong.The countries that succeed will be those that find new ways of doing things, new ways of harnessing the common good, better alternatives to the old-fashioned state, and we're on the right side of that argument.Here at home, at this year's election, the result may not have been clear-cut when it came to the political parties. But it was clear enough when it came to political ideas.The old way of doing things: the high-spending, all-controlling, heavy-handed state, those ideas were defeated. Statism lost ... society won. That's what happened at the last election and that's the change we're leading.From state power to people power. From unchecked individualism to national unity and purpose. From big government to the big society.The big society is not about creating cover for cuts. I was going on about it years before the cuts.It's not government abdicating its role, it is government changing its role.It's about government helping to build a nation of doers and go-getters, where people step forward not sit back, where people come together to make life better.Of course the cynics and the defeatists will say it can't be done, that we're stuck in some inevitable decline. But that's what they said in the 70s. They were wrong then \u2013 and we'll prove them wrong again.We can build a country defined not by the selfishness of the Labour years but by the values of mutual responsibility that this party holds dear.A country defined not by what we consume but by what we contribute. A country, a society where we say: I am not alone. I will play my part. I will work with others to give Britain a brand new start.Over the coming months, we will need that spirit as we face up to our financial responsibilities. Everyone knows that this government is undertaking a programme of spending cuts.I know how anxious people are. "Yes", they say: "of course we need to cut spending. But do we have to cut now, and by this much? Isn't there another way?"I wish there was another way. I wish there was an easier way. But I tell you: there is no other responsible way.Back in May, we inherited public finances that can only be described as catastrophic. This year, we will borrow more money than we spend on the NHS. Just think about that.Every doctor's salary. Every operation. Every heating bill in every hospital. Every appointment. Every MRI scan. Every drug. Every new stethoscope, scalpel, hospital gown.Everything in our hospitals and surgeries \u2013 paid for with borrowed money, much of it from abroad. And then think about the interest.This year, we're going to spend £43bn on debt interest payments alone. £43bn \u2013 not to pay off the debt \u2013 just to stand still.Do you know what we could do with that sort of money? We could take 11 million people out of paying income tax. We could take every business in the country out of corporation tax.That's why we have acted decisively \u2013 to stop pouring so much of your hard-earned money down the drain.And it's stopped us slipping into the nightmare they've seen in Greece, confidence falling, interest rates rising, jobs lost and in the end, not less but more drastic spending cuts than if you'd acted decisively in the first place.Our emergency budget showed the world that Britain is back on the path of fiscal responsibility.It took us out of the danger zone \u2013 and the man we have to thank for that is George Osborne.The world has backed us. Our credit rating \u2013 the mark of trust in our economy \u2013 has been preserved. The International Monetary Fund, the G20, yes even the EU. They support what we're doing.There's just one group of people who don't. You guessed it, the people who mortgaged Britain to the hilt in the first place \u2013 Labour.Labour's plan is just to halve the deficit over four years. Let me tell you what that means.It means that even after years of cuts, not only would the national debt still be growing, it would be growing as a share of our national income.The problem would still be getting worse. And as a result, the cuts would be bigger, not smaller because the interest payments on that debt would be higher.That's why it's right to deal with this problem now, and right to deal with it properly.And I promise you that if we pull together to deal with these debts today, then just a few years down the line the rewards will be felt by everyone in our country.More money in your pocket. More investment in our businesses. Growing industries, better jobs, stronger prospects for our young people. And the thing you can't measure but you just know it when you see it, the sense that our country is moving forwards once again.The big society spirit means facing up to this generation's debts, not shirking responsibility. And here I want to say something to the people who got us into this mess. The ones who racked up more debt in 13 years than previous governments did in three centuries.Yes you, Labour. You want us to spend more money on ourselves, today, to keep racking up the bills, today and leave it to our children \u2013 the ones who had nothing to do with all this \u2013 to pay our debts tomorrow?That is selfish and irresponsible.I tell you what: these Labour politicians, who nearly bankrupted our country, who left a legacy of debts and cuts, who are still in denial about the disaster they created. They must not be allowed anywhere near our economy, ever, ever again.Reducing spending will be difficult. There are programmes that will be cut. There are jobs that will be lost. There are things government does today that it will have to stop doing.Many government departments will have their budgets cut by, on average, 25% over four years. That's a cut each year of around 7%.Of course, that's big. But let's remember, a lot of businesses have had to make the same or bigger savings in recent years.And when we're done with these cuts, spending on public services will actually still be at the same level as it was in 2006.The spending cuts we do have to make, we'll make in a way that is fair. Fairness includes protecting the service we most rely on \u2013 the health service.We said five years ago we were the party of the NHS and now in government, by protecting NHS spending from cuts, we are showing it.And as we work to balance the budget, fairness includes asking those on higher incomes to shoulder more of the burden than those on lower incomes.I'm not saying this is going to be easy, as we've seen with child benefit this week. But it's fair that those with broader shoulders should bear a greater load.And I think it's time for a new conversation about what fairness really means.Here's what I think. Yes, fairness means giving money to help the poorest in society. People who are sick, who are vulnerable, the elderly \u2013 I want you to know we will always look after you. That's the sign of a civilised society, and it's what I believe.But you can't measure fairness just by how much money we spend on welfare, as though the poor are products with a price tag, the more we spend on them the more we value them.Fairness means supporting people out of poverty, not trapping them in dependency. So we will make a bold choice.For too long, we have measured success in tackling poverty by the size of the cheque we give people. We say: let's measure our success by the chance we give. Let's support real routes out of poverty \u2013 a strong family, a good education, a job.So we'll invest in the early years, help put troubled families back on track, use a pupil premium to make sure kids from the poorest homes go to the best schools not the worst, recognise marriage in the tax system and, most of all, make sure that work really pays for every single person in our countryRemember last year? When you stood up to show how angry you were about the injustice of some low paid single mothers going out to work and losing 96p for every extra pound they earned?Well after months of hard work, I can tell you Iain Duncan Smith has found a way to end that system.So to that single mother struggling and working her heart out for her children, we can now say: "We're on your side; we'll help you work; we will bring that injustice to an end."Here's something else about fairness. Fairness isn't just about who gets help from the state.The other part of the equation is who gives that help, through their taxes. Taking more money from the man who goes out to work long hours each day so the family next door can go on living a life on benefits without working \u2013 is that fair?Fairness means giving people what they deserve \u2013 and what people deserve depends on how they behave.If you really cannot work, we'll look after you. But if you can work, but refuse to work, we will not let you live off the hard work of others.Tackling the deficit is what we have to do. But transforming our country is what we passionately want to do.Here again we need the big society spirit \u2013 of activism and dynamism. We need it to get growth.Let me tell you what I believe. It will be the doers and grafters, the inventors and the entrepreneurs who get this economy going.Yes, it will be the wealth creators \u2013 and no, those aren't dirty words.When you think of a wealth creator, don't think of the tycoon in a glass tower. Think of the man who gets up and leaves the house before dawn to go out and clean windows.Think of the woman who sits up late into the night trying to make the figures add up to make sure she can pay her staff.I can't tell you how much I admire people who leave the comfort of a regular wage to strike out on their own.I'll always remember what the owner of a small business told me once. He said: "When I was starting out, the government didn't lift a finger to help me. Then as soon as I start making money they're all over me trying to take it away."That is completely the wrong way round. We need to get behind our wealth creators. That's what we're doing.Dealing with the deficit so interest rates stay low. Slashing red tape. Cutting the small business profits rate, corporation tax and national insurance contributions for new businesses.But I don't think our job ends there. I don't believe in laissez-faire. Government has a role not just to fire up ambition, but to help give it flight.So we are acting to build a more entrepreneurial economy. Tens of thousands of university and apprenticeship places and a new generation of technical schools.A new Green Investment Bank, so the technologies of the future are developed, jobs created and our environment protected.Big infrastructure projects like high speed rail, super-fast broadband, carbon capture and storage.A £1bn regional growth fund to stimulate enterprise in those areas where the private sector is weak.And as we've announced this week, a new enterprise allowance that gives money and support to unemployed people who want to start their own business.And there's another way we're getting behind business \u2013 by sorting out the banks.Taxpayers bailed you out, now it's time for you to repay the favour and start lending to Britain's small businesses again.Just as we need the big society spirit to get our economy going, we need it in our society too.Social change is where this coalition has its beating, radical heart. This is what drives us. To change forever the way this country is run.We're going to start by taking power away from central government and giving it to people.On 11 May, a great shadow was cast over the empire of the quangocrats, the bureaucrats and the power-hoarders.He is the enemy of the bureaucratic state. Public chum number one. The big man on the side of the people. Eric Pickles.Eric has come in to government and hit the ground sprinting, leading the most radical shift in power this country has seen for decades.More freedom for local councils to keep more of the money when they attract business to their area, to finance big new infrastructure projects and to run new services.More power for neighbourhoods to keep local pubs open, stop post offices from closing, to run local parks, to plan the look, shape and feel of their area.New powers to you to choose the hospital you get treated in, the school your child goes to.And because information is power, we're bringing transparency to government.All those things the last government kept from you, who spends your money, what they spend it on, what the results are, where the waste is, we're putting it in your hands. After all, it's your money \u2013 so you should see where it's going.This is not about a bit more power for you and a bit less power for central government \u2013 it's a revolution.Let's leave Labour defending the status quo, the vested interests, the unions, the quangocrats, the elites, the establishment.We are the radicals now, breaking apart the old system with a massive transfer for power, from the state to citizens, politicians to people, government to society. That is the power shift this country needs today.And let me tell you why we desperately need this change. It's because the old way, of just pouring money into public services from on high, didn't make the difference it promised to.Health inequalities got worse. Almost four in ten children left primary school unable to read, write and do maths properly. There were nearly a million violent crimes a year.So if anyone tells you that all we need to improve our hospitals and schools or keep our streets safe is more money, tell them, been there, done that and it didn't work.So this is what radicalism means. No more top-down, bureaucrat-driven public services. We're putting those services in your hands.The old targets and performance indicators that drove doctors, nurses and police officers mad \u2013 they're gone.All that bureaucracy that meant nothing ever happened \u2013 we're stripping it away.The big, giant state monopolies \u2013 we're breaking them open to get new ideas in.Saying to the people who work in our public services - set up as a co-operative, be your own boss, do things your way.Saying to business, faith groups, charities, social enterprises \u2013 come in and provide a great service.Already, businesses are getting people trained and ready for work. GPs are coming together to deliver local NHS services. And next year, the first generation of free schools will open in the state sector.But as with any radical changes, there's going to be opposition. I want to give you an idea of the mentality we're fighting.Ed Balls, the man who used to be in charge of education in our country, said one of the dangers of our schools policy was that it would create "winners".Winners? We can't have that. The danger that your child might go to school and turn out to be a winner. Anti-aspiration. Anti-success. Anti-parents who just want the best for their children.What an unbelievable attitude from this Labour generation.Now I've heard people say there are some places where reform can't go \u2013 like law and order.I disagree. Of course the state has a clear role, to score a line between right and wrong, to punish those who step over it, and to do it in a way that gives people confidence.That's why I have no time for those who sneer at public attitudes to punishing criminals.Offenders who should go to prison will go to prison. Justice must be done.But we also have to recognise where the state is failing on crime. We spend £41,000 a year on each prisoner \u2013 and within a year of leaving, half of them reoffend.There are 150,000 people in Britain today who get their heroin substitutes on the state, their addictions maintained by the taxpayer.We have police officers who spend more time on paperwork than they do on patrol. It's here that reform is needed most.So let's get our best charities to help rehabilitate offenders, our best social enterprises to get people off drugs.Let's get more local people \u2013 who know their streets \u2013 to be special constables. And let's get our police officers out from behind their desks and on the streets fighting crime.I've seen what the police do for us \u2013 how they put themselves in the line of danger to keep us safe. So I want to give them more freedom. But in return for that freedom, police are going to have someone new to answer to.Not ministers \u2013 people. You.On the way are new elected police commissioners that you can vote in \u2013 and kick out. Neighbourhood beat meetings where you hold the police to account.I say to every policeman and woman in the country \u2013 don't be afraid of these changes. The more you've been controlled by the central state, the less people have respected you. I want to change that.More freedom for you to be out on the streets, policing the way you know best \u2013 and in a way local people support, that will mean more respect for the vital work that you do.This is the reform our public services need. From top-down to bottom-up. From state power to people power. The big society spirit blasting through.But the big society needs you to give it life. People already do so much to help others.Three weeks ago, volunteers were asked to come forward to help with the 2012 Olympic Games. You know how many applications have come in? 100,000.Together we're going to make these Olympics great for Britain and great for the world.And on the way we're going to throw everything we can into winning that bid for the 2018 World Cup.There is such an appetite out there for people to play their part. Our job is to help them, encourage them, break down the barriers that stop them.So let's scrap the health and safety rules that put people off. Let's get community organisers to stimulate social action in our poorest areas. Let's get going with national citizen service so more teenagers get some purpose in their lives.And today I can announce international citizen service, to give thousands of our young people, those who couldn't otherwise afford it, the chance to see the world and serve others.Last century, America's peace corps inspired a generation of young people to act, and this century, I want international citizen service to do the same.That's the big society spirit, around the world and back here at home.So that great project in your community \u2013 go and lead it. The waste in government \u2013 go and find it. The new school in your neighbourhood \u2013 go and demand it.The beat meeting on your street \u2013 sign up.The neighbourhood group \u2013 join up. That business you always dreamed of \u2013 start up. When we say "we are all in this together", that is not a cry for help but a call to arms.Society is not a spectator sport. This is your country. It's time to believe it. It's time to step up and own it.So mine is not just a vision of a more powerful country. It is a vision of a more powerful people.The knowledge in the heart of everyone \u2013 everyone \u2013 that they are not captive to the circumstances of their birth, they are not flotsam and jetsam in the great currents of wealth and power, they are not small people but big citizens. People that believe in themselves. A Britain that believes in itself.Not a promise of a perfect country. Just an achievable future of a life more fulfilled and fulfilling for everyone.At this time of great national challenge, two parties have come together to help make it happen. Yes, this is a new kind of government, but no, not just because it's a coalition.It is a new kind of government because it is realistic about what it can achieve on its own, but ambitious about what we can all achieve together.A government that believes in people, that trusts people, that knows its ultimate role is not to take from people but to give, to give power, to give control, to give everyone the chance to make the most of their own life and make better the lives of others.Yes, we will play our part \u2013 but the part you play will mean even more.Your country needs you. It takes two. It takes two to build that strong economy. We'll balance the budget, we'll boost enterprise, but you start those businesses that lead us to growth.It takes two to build that big society. We'll reform public services, we'll devolve power, but you step forward to seize the opportunity.Don't let the cynics say this is some unachievable, impossible dream that won't work in the selfish 21st century \u2013 tell them people are hungry for it.I know the British people and they are not passengers \u2013 they are drivers. I've seen the courage of our soldiers, the spirit of our entrepreneurs, the patience of our teachers, the dedication of our doctors, the compassion of our care workers, the wisdom of our elderly, the love of our parents, the hopes of our children.So come on \u2013 let's pull together. Let's come together.Let's work, together, in the national interest.

aVThis week, in Manchester, this party has shown the discipline, the unity, and the purpose that is the mark of a party of government. I'm proud of my team, I'm proud of our members, I'm proud to lead this party - but most of all, I'm proud of you. People have very clear instructions for this government: "Lead us out of this economic mess." "Do it in a way that's fair and right." "And as you do it, make sure you build something worthwhile for us and our children." Clear instructions. Clear objectives. And from me: a clear understanding that in these difficult times, it is leadership we need. To get our economy moving. To get our society working, and in a year - the Olympics year - when the world will be watching us, to show everyone what Great Britain really means. But first I want to say something to you in this hall. Thank you. Despite the predictions we won elections all over the country this May, so let's hear it for those great campaigns you fought and the great results you achieved. And thank you for something else. In the AV referendum, you did Britain a service and kicked that useless voting system off the political agenda for decades to come. And next year let's make sure we back Boris, beat Ken and keep London Conservative. You're not just winners - you're doers. This summer, as before, Conservatives went to Rwanda to build classrooms, teach children and help grow businesses. Social action: that is the spirit of the modern Conservative Party. This is a party - ours is a country - that never walks on by. Earlier this year some people said to me: "Libya's not our concern", "don't start what you can't finish", and even - "Arabs don't do democracy." But if we had stood aside this spring, people in Benghazi would have been massacred. And don't let anyone say this wasn't in our national interest. Remember what Qadhafi did. He's the man who gave Semtex to the IRA, who was behind the shooting of a police officer in a London square, who was responsible for the bombing of a plane in the skies over Lockerbie. Let's be proud of the part we played in giving the Libyan people the chance to take back their country. In Afghanistan today, there are men and women fighting for Britain as bravely as any in our history. They come from across our country: England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland. They now have the equipment they need. And we're on target to bring them home by the end of 2014. Theirs has been a campaign of incredible courage and sacrifice, and I know everyone in this hall will want to send a message to everyone who serves and who have served. Those in uniform in our armed forces and in our police. And those not in uniform, keeping us safe from terrorism on our streets. We're proud of you.  We salute you.  Thank you. But leadership in the world is about moral strength as much as military might. A few months ago I was in Nigeria, on a trade mission. While I was there, I visited a vaccination clinic. It was very hot, pretty basic and the lights kept going off. But to the rows of women, cuddling their babies, this place was a godsend. One of the nurses told me that if it wasn't for British aid, many of those beautiful babies would be dead. In four years' time, this country will have helped vaccinate more of the world's poorest children than there are people in the whole of England. Of course, we'll make sure your money goes to the people who need it most, and we'll do it in a way that's transparent and accountable. But I really believe, despite all our difficulties, that this is the right thing to do. That it's a mark of our country, and our people, that we never turn our backs on the world's poorest, and everyone in Britain can be incredibly proud of it. Leadership in fighting poverty. Leadership in fighting tyranny. But when it came to that decision to help the Libyan people, there was something dispiriting about the debate here at home. It wasn't that some people thought we shouldn't do what we did - of course it's everyone's right to disagree. It was that too many thought Britain actually couldn't do something like that any more. And you hear that kind of pessimism about our economic future, our social problems, our political system. That our best days are behind us. That we're on a path of certain decline. Well I'm here to tell you that it isn't true. Of course, if we sit around and hope for the best, the rest will leave us behind. If we fool ourselves that we can grow our economy, mend our society, give our children the future we want them to have. If we fool ourselves that we can do these things without effort, without correcting past mistakes, without confronting vested interests and failed ideas, then no, we're not going to get anywhere. But if we put in the effort, correct those mistakes, confront those vested interests and take on the failed ideas of the past, then I know we can turn this ship around. Nobody wants false optimism.  And I will never pretend there are short cuts to success.  But success will come: with the right ideas, the right approach, the right leadership. Leadership from government: to set out the direction we must take, and the choices we must make. But leadership also from you. Because the things that will really deliver success are not politicians or government. It's the people of Britain, and the spirit of Britain. Some say that to succeed in this world, we need to become more like India, or China, or Brazil. I say: we need to become more like us.  The real us. Hard-working, pioneering, independent, creative, adaptable, optimistic, can-do. That's the spirit that has made this United Kingdom what it is: a small country that does great things; one of the most incredible success stories in the history of the world. And it's a spirit that's alive and well today. I see it in Tania Sidney-Roberts, the head teacher I met in Norwich who started a free school from scratch, now four times over-subscribed. Her ambition?  To set up another school and do it all over again. That's leadership. I see it in the group of GPs in Bexley who have taken more control of their budgets, and got their patients - some of the poorest in the country - free care on Harley Street. Their ambition?  To cut waiting times, cut costs and improve care - all in one go. That's leadership. And we all saw it this summer. Dan Thompson watched the riots unfold on television. But he didn't sit there and say 'the council will clean it up.' He got on the internet.  He sent out a call.  And with others, he started a social movement. People picked up their brooms and reclaimed their streets. So the argument I want to make today is simple: leadership works. I know how tough things are. I don't for one minute underestimate how worried people feel, whether about making ends meet, or the state of the world economy. But the truth is, right now we need to be energised, not paralysed by gloom and fear. Half the world is booming - let's go and sell to them. So many of our communities are thriving - let's make the rest like them. There's so much that's great about our country. We don't have to accept that success in this century automatically belongs to someone else. We just have to remember the origin of our achievements: the people of Britain, taking a lead. That's why so much of my leadership is about unleashing your leadership. Giving everyone who wants to seize it the opportunity, the support and above all the freedom to get things done. Giving everyone who wants to believe it the confidence that working hard and taking responsibility will be rewarded not punished. So let's reject the pessimism. Let's bring on the can-do optimism. Let's summon the energy and the appetite to fight for a better future for our country, Great Britain. Of course that starts with our economy. As we meet here in Manchester, the threat to the world economy - and to Britain - is as serious today as it was in 2008 when world recession loomed. The Eurozone is in crisis, the French and German economies have slowed to a standstill; even mighty America is being questioned about her debts. It is an anxious time. Prices and bills keep going up - petrol, the weekly shop, electricity. On the news it's job losses, cutbacks, closures. You think about tuition fees, and house prices, the cost of a deposit, and wonder how our children will cope. Of course, government can help - and this one is. We have cut petrol duty, kept the winter fuel allowance and kept cold weather payments. We froze council tax this year, and as George announced in that great speech on Monday, we're going to freeze it again next year too. But we need to tell the truth about the overall economic situation. People understand that when the economy goes into recession, times get tough. But normally, after a while, things pick up. Strong growth returns.  People get back into work. This time, it's not like that. And people want to know why the good times are so long coming. The answer is straightforward, but uncomfortable. This was no normal recession; we're in a debt crisis. It was caused by too much borrowing, by individuals, businesses, banks, and most of all, governments. When you're in a debt crisis, some of the normal things that government can do, to deal with a normal recession, like borrowing to cut taxes or increase spending - these things won't work because they lead to more debt, which would make the crisis worse. Why? Because it risks higher interest rates, less confidence and the threat of even higher taxes in future. The only way out of a debt crisis is to deal with your debts. That's why households are paying down their credit card and store card bills. It means banks getting their books in order. And it means governments - all over the world - cutting spending and living within their means. This coalition government, Conservatives and Liberal Democrats, Nick Clegg and I - we've led the way here in Britain. Our plan is right.  And our plan will work. I know you can't see it or feel it yet. But think of it like this. The new economy we're building: it's like building a house. The most important part is the part you can't see - the foundations that make it stable. Slowly, but surely, we're laying the foundations for a better future. But this is the crucial point: it will only work if we stick with it. And there's something else we've got to stick to. Because we're not in the Euro, we can lay these foundations ourselves: on our own terms; in our own way. So let me say this: as long as I'm Prime Minister, we will never join the Euro. And I won't let us be sucked into endless bail-outs of countries that are in the Euro either. Yes, we're leading members of the IMF and have our responsibilities there. But when it comes to any Euro bail-out mechanism, my approach is simple: Labour got us into it and I've made sure we're getting out of it. Of course, our deficit reduction programme is just one big bail-out of the last Labour government. This past year we've been subjected to a sort of national apology tour by Labour. Sorry for sucking up to Qadhafi.  For not regulating the banks properly.  For crushing civil liberties.  For failing to go green.  For not building enough homes.  For the infighting that made them the most dysfunctional government ever. But you know what? Nothing - not a peep - on the thing they really need to say sorry for. Wasting billions and billions of your money. No apology for that. You know what the Shadow Chancellor, Ed Balls claimed last week? That Labour didn't spend more money than they had "available". Hello?  Ed - you spent £428 billion more than you had "available". There is only one conclusion you can rationally draw. We must never let these Labour politicians anywhere near our economy again. As before, it falls to us to clear up after the Labour Party. I have insisted that we do it in a way that is fair. You can't cut a deficit the size of ours without everyone making a sacrifice. But those with the most money are bearing the biggest burden. We've imposed a permanent levy on the banks, getting them to pay more every year than Labour did in one year. We've raised taxes on people who make their money overseas but live here. At the same time we've given real help to the poorest and most vulnerable. We're taking over a million of the lowest-paid people out of tax altogether. And after the scandal of the 75p pension rise under Labour, we're linking pensions to earnings so elderly people will be £10,000 better off in their retirement. Yes, this is a one-nation deficit reduction plan - from a one-nation party. And here's something else that we - yes we - have done. The NHS is the most precious institution in our country - to my family, to your family. At the last election, it was Labour policy to cut the NHS. It was Liberal Democrat policy to cut the NHS. It was our policy - Conservative policy - to protect the NHS and spend more on it this year, next year and the year after that because we are the party of the NHS, and as long as I'm here we always will be. But real fairness isn't just about what the state spends. It's about the link between what you put in and what you get out. As we debate what people get from the state, let's remember how we generate taxes. So to the unions planning to strike over public sector pensions I say this. You have every right to protest. But our population is ageing. Our public sector pensions system is unaffordable. The only way to give public sector workers a decent, sustainable pensions system, and do right by the taxpayer, is to ask public servants to work a little longer and contribute a little more. That is fair. What is not fair, what is not right, is going on strikes that will hurt the very people who help pay for your pensions. Dealing with our debts is line one, clause one of our plan for growth. But it is just the start. We need jobs - and we won't get jobs by growing government, we need to grow our businesses. So here's our growth plan: doing everything we can to help businesses start, grow, thrive, succeed. Where that means backing off, cutting regulation - back off, cut regulation. Where that means intervention, investment - intervene, invest. Whatever it takes to help our businesses take on the world - we'll do it. The global economy has transformed in recent years. It used to take companies decades to become global giants: now it can take a couple of years. When you step off the plane in Delhi or Shanghai or Lagos, you can feel the energy, the hunger, the drive to succeed. We need that here. Frankly, there's too much 'can't do' sogginess around. We need to be a sharp, focused, can-do country. But as we go for growth, the last thing I want is to pump the old economy back up, with a banking sector out of control, manufacturing squeezed, and prosperity confined to a few parts of the country and a select few industries. Our plan is to build something new and to build something better. We can do it. Look what's happening in East London. Europe's financial capital is now matched by Europe's technology capital in Tech City. Facebook, Intel, Google, Cisco - even Silicon Valley Bank - seeing our potential and investing here. Look what's happening across our country. The wings of the world's biggest jumbo jet - built in Wales. The world's most famous digger - the JCB - made in Staffordshire. Do you watch Formula One? Well whether it's the German Michael Schumacher, the Australian Mark Webber or the Brazilian Reubens Barrichello, they all have one thing in common - they drive cars built right here in Britain. This is the new economy we're building: leading in advanced manufacturing, technology, life sciences, green engineering. Inventing, creating, exporting. Of course, it's easy to talk about these things: harder to deliver it. For a start, you won't deliver it just by dividing industries into saints and sinners. That's not just an insult to the financial and insurance companies, accountancy firms and professional services that make us billions of pounds and create millions of jobs - it's much too simplistic. As I've always argued, we need businesses to be more socially responsible. But to get proper growth, to rebalance our economy, we've got to put some important new pieces into place. Taking action now to get credit flowing to the small businesses that are the engine of the economy. And ring-fencing the banks so they fulfil their role of lending safely to the real economy. Setting up Technology and Innovation Centres where scientists and academics can work with entrepreneurs to turn brilliant inventions into successful products. Reforming taxation to encourage enterprise and investment in high growth firms. And sometimes that means taking controversial decisions; challenging vested interests. When firms need to adapt quickly to win orders and contracts, we can't go on with rigid, outdated employment regulations. The critics may say: what about workers' rights? But the most important worker's right of all is having a job in the first place. When in modern business you're either quick or you're dead, it's hopeless that our transport infrastructure lags so far behind Europe's. That's why we need to build high speed rail and why we'll get the best super-fast broadband network in Europe too. When a balanced economy needs workers with skills, we need to end the old snobbery about vocational education and training. We've provided funding for 250,000 extra apprenticeships - but not enough big companies are delivering. So here's a direct appeal: If you want skilled employees, we'll provide the funding, we'll cut the red tape. But you've got to show more leadership and give us the apprenticeships we need. Unlocking growth and rebalancing our economy also requires change in Brussels. The EU is the biggest single market in the world - but it's not working properly. Almost every day, I see pointless new regulation coming our way. A couple of weeks ago I was up in the flat, going through some work before the start of the day and I saw this EU directive. Do you know what it was about? Whether people with diabetes should be allowed to drive. What's that got to do with the single market? Do you suppose anyone in China is thinking: I know how we'll grow our economy - let's get those diabetics off our roads. Europe has to wake up - and the EU growth plan we've published, backed by eight countries, which I want us to push at every meeting, every council, every summit, is the alarm call that Brussels needs. There's one more thing. Our businesses need the space to grow - literally. That's one of the reasons we're reforming our planning system. It's hard to blame local people for opposing developments when they get none of the benefits. We're changing that. If a new manufacturing plant is built in your area - your community keeps the business rates. If new homes get built - you keep the council tax. This is a localist plan from a localist party. Now I know people are worried about what this means for conservation. Let me tell you: I love our countryside and there's nothing I would do to put it at risk. But let's get the balance right. The proportion of land in England that is currently built up is 9 per cent.  Yes, 9 per cent. There are businesses out there desperate to expand, to hire thousands of people - but they're stuck in the mud of our planning system. Of course we're open to constructive ideas about how to get this right. But to those who just oppose everything we're doing, my message is this: Take your arguments down to the job centre. We've got to get Britain back to work. The new economy we're building must work for everyone. You know the real tragedy of New Labour's economy? Not just that it was unsustainable, unbalanced, overwhelmed with debt. But that it left so many behind. Labour talked opportunity but ripped the ladders of opportunity away. We had an education system that left hundreds of thousands unprepared for work. A welfare system that trapped millions in dependency. An immigration system that brought in migrant workers to do the jobs that those on welfare were being paid not to do. We had a housing system that failed to meet demand, so prices shot up and fuelled an unsustainable boom. And we had a government that creamed the taxes off the boom to splurge back into benefits - redoubling the failure all over again. Labour: who tell us they care so much about fairness, about justice, who say they want to hit the rich and help the poor - it was Labour gave us the casino economy and the welfare society. So who's going to lift the poorest up? Who's going to get our young people back to work? Who's going to create a more equal society? No, not you, the self-righteous Labour Party. It will be us, the Conservatives who finally build an economy that works for everyone and gives hope to everyone in our country. That starts with a good education - for everyone. It sounds so simple: proper teaching, good discipline, rigorous exams. But it's hard. It's hard because our education system has been infected by an ideology that instead of insisting on every child's success has too often made excuses for failure. They said: "poor kids can't learn." "Black boys can't do well." "In this community we really mustn't expect too much - don't you understand?" Oh yes, I do understand. Believe me I do understand and I am disgusted by the idea that we should aim for any less for a child from a poor background than a rich one. I have contempt for the notion that we should accept narrower horizons for a black child than a white one. Yes it's the age-old irony of the liberal left: they practice oppression and call it equality. So we are fighting back. And something massive is happening. There is now irrefutable proof that the right schools, with the right freedoms and the right leadership, can transform the education of the most deprived children. You heard yesterday from that inspirational student from Burlington Danes Academy in Hammersmith. Inner city school. Deprived area. Nearly half the pupils on free school meals. But this year, three-quarters got five good GCSEs including English and maths. That's way better than what the majority of the state schools in Sussex, Cambridgeshire, Hampshire got last year - some of the most affluent counties in the country. Why? Because the head teacher, her staff, the parents - rose up and said: "We are as good as anyone.  Our children can achieve anything." Leadership works. So we're backing more head teachers to turn schools into Academies. And we want more parents, teachers, charities, businesses, entrepreneurs, to come in to our education system and set up Academies and Free Schools. Change really is underway. For the first time in a long time, the numbers studying those core and vital subjects history, geography, languages are going up. Pupils' exams will be marked on their punctuation and grammar. And teachers are going to be able to search pupils' bags for anything banned in school - mobile phones, alcohol, weapons, anything. It's a long, hard road back to rigour, but we're well and truly on our way. And here's something else we're going to do. In Britain today, we have schools that are intolerant of failure, where ninety percent of pupils get five good GCSEs. Yes: private schools. You've heard me talk about social responsibility so let me say this. I want to see private schools start Academies, and sponsor Academies in the state system. Wellington College does it, Dulwich does it - others can too. The apartheid between our private and state schools is one of the biggest wasted opportunities in our country today. So let it be this party that helps tear it down. Rigour back in learning.  Standards back in schools.  Teachers back in control. Yes - the Conservatives are back in government. An economy that works for everyone means sorting out welfare and immigration too. Welfare began as a life-line. For too many it's become a way of life. Generation after generation in the cycle of dependency - and we are determined to break it. Part of our answer is controlling immigration. So we've put a cap on the numbers of non-EU immigrants allowed to come into our country to work. We mustn't lock out talent - I want the best and brightest entrepreneurs, scientists and students from around the world to get the red carpet treatment. But the bogus colleges, the fake marriages, the people arriving for a month and staying for years, the criminals who use the Human Rights Act to try and stay in the country - we are clamping down on all of them. We've got to get some sense back into our labour market and get British people back into work. For years you've been conned by governments. To keep the unemployment figures down, they've parked as many people as possible on the sick. Two and a half million, to be exact. Not officially unemployed, but claiming welfare, no questions asked. Now we're asking those questions. It turns out that of the 1.3 million people who have put in a claim for the new sickness benefit in recent years. One million are either able to work, or stopped their claim before their medical assessment had been completed. Under Labour they got something for nothing. With us they'll only get something, if they give something. If they are prepared to work, we're going to help them - and I mean really help them. If you've been out of work and on benefits for five years, a quick session down the job centre and a new CV just isn't going to cut it. You need to get your self-esteem and confidence back; you need training and skills; intensive personal support. Previous governments were never willing to make a proper commitment to this, but we have - investing now, so we don't pay later. We're going to spend up to £14,000 on some people just to get them trained and back into work. Yes, I know that's a lot of money - but it's worth it. Let it be us, let it be this government that finally builds an economy where no one is left behind. And for most people that includes a home of their own: not just any old home but a decent one: light and spacious, a place with a proper front door and room for the kids to play in. But the percentage of British people who own their home is going down. Unless they get help from their parents, do you know the average age of a first-time buyer in our country today?  Thirty seven. You hear people say: "why can't people just rent like in Europe?" or "there's nothing we can do because we don't have the money." I disagree. The failure of the housing market is bound up in the debt crisis. Because lenders won't lend, builders won't build and buyers can't buy. We're sorting this out, bringing back the Right to Buy and using the money to build new homes. Macmillan made us the party of the property-owning democracy. Margaret Thatcher gave people the Right to Buy. Now let us, in this generation, inspire a new Tory housing revolution. While I'm on the subject of those great Conservative figures, let me say this. I'm incredibly fortunate to have such strong support from our previous leaders. Michael Howard.  Iain Duncan Smith.  William Hague.  Sir John Major.  And of course, Lady Thatcher. You know what? We don't boo our leaders. We're proud of our past and what those people did for our country. A few months ago, we were shocked by the scenes on our streets in London and other parts of the country. But perhaps the most shocking thing is that people weren't that surprised. There was no great call for a public enquiry to find out what had gone wrong. Instead the sound you could hear was the angry, insistent, overwhelming cry of a country shouting to its leaders: We know. We know why this happened. We know what's gone wrong. We know that if the system keeps fudging the difference between right and wrong, we'll never improve behaviour. We know that as long as the police go round with one hand tied behind their back, we'll never make our streets truly safe. And more than anything we know that if parents don't meet their responsibilities, kids will get out of control. Yes, people said: we know what's gone wrong: and we want you to put it right. One thing people want is speedy justice. After the riots those responsible were put straight in the courts and tough sentences were quickly handed out. And I've made it clear to the police, to the prosecution services, to the Ministry of Justice, to the Attorney-General, if we could do that then, let's make sure we do it all the time.  But the problems go deeper. That's why my driving mission in politics is to build a Big Society, a stronger society. It starts with families. I want to make this the most family-friendly government the country has ever seen. More childcare. More health visitors. More relationship support. More help with parenting. And for the 120,000 families that are most troubled - and causing the most trouble - a commitment to turn their lives around by the end of this Parliament. Today I can announce this: a new focus on the 65,000 children in care. Do you know how many children there are in care under the age of one?  3,660. And how many children under the age of one were adopted in our country last year?  Sixty. This may not seem like the biggest issue facing our country, but it is the biggest issue for these children. How can we have let this happen: we've got people flying all over the world to adopt babies, while the care system at home agonises about placing black children with white families. With the right values and the right effort, let's end this scandal and help these, the most vulnerable children of all. But for me, leadership on families also means speaking out on marriage. Marriage is not just a piece of paper. It pulls couples together through the ebb and flow of life. It gives children stability. And it says powerful things about what we should value. So yes, we will recognise marriage in the tax system. But we're also doing something else. I once stood before a Conservative conference and said it shouldn't matter whether commitment was between a man and a woman, a woman and a woman, or a man and another man. You applauded me for that. Five years on, we're consulting on legalising gay marriage. And to anyone who has reservations, I say: Yes, it's about equality, but it's also about something else: commitment. Conservatives believe in the ties that bind us; that society is stronger when we make vows to each other and support each other. So I don't support gay marriage despite being a Conservative. I support gay marriage because I'm a Conservative. We value community spirit and social action too. We see it everyday in our own lives, it's one of the great things about Britain, and do you know what? Over the last five years of the Labour government, the number of people volunteering went down. Last year, the decline was halted. And now the proportion of people saying they feel they belong strongly to their neighbourhood is the highest for a decade. If you're cynical, go to Wythenshawe, a few miles from here. It used to be ravaged by crime and drugs and graffiti. But local people opened a community hall and a gym. They got the kids off the streets. They cleaned up graffiti and kicked out the drug dealers. Of course, government can't legislate for this. But we can support the leadership that makes it happen. That's why we're giving neighbourhoods new powers to take over the running of parks, playgrounds and pubs. It's why we're making it easier for people to give their time and money to good causes. It's why we want elected mayors in our great cities, and it's why right now we're drawing up plans to really open up public services and give more power to people. But one of the biggest things holding people back is the shadow of health and safety. I was told recently about a school that wanted to buy a set of highlighter pens. But with the pens came a warning. Not so fast - make sure you comply with the Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations 2002. Including plenty of fresh air and hand and eye protection. Try highlighting in all that. This isn't how a great nation was built. Britannia didn't rule the waves with arm-bands on. So the vetting and barring scheme - we're scaling it back. CRB checks - we're cutting them back. At long last common sense is coming back to our country. Building stronger communities is why we've introduced National Citizen Service. You saw it for yourself at the start of this afternoon's session. One of the people who took part this year, Owen Carter, wrote to me and said: "[This] has changed my perspective of life - you can do anything if you work hard and have a supportive team around you. You can do anything'. That's the spirit I'm talking about. That's why we're tripling the scale of National Citizen Service. That's how we'll build our Big Society. That is leadership. Next year, we welcome the world for the Olympics - and of course the Queen's Diamond Jubilee. These two events say a lot about Britain. Tradition.  Modernity.  All in one. And today, we can choose to be a country that's back on its feet and striding forward. Paying down our debt and earning a living. Getting people off welfare and into work. Breaking new ground in education, with excellence for everyone not a privileged few. We can be a country where people look back on their life and say: I've worked hard, I've raised a family, I'm part of a community and all along it was worth my while. We're too far away from that today but we can get there. It's not complicated, but not easy either - because nothing worthwhile is easily won. But you know, we've been told we were finished before. They said when we lost an Empire that we couldn't find a role. But we found a role, took on communism and helped bring down the Berlin Wall. They called our economy the sick man of Europe. But we came back and turned this country into a beacon of enterprise. No, Britain never had the biggest population, the largest land mass, the richest resources, but we had the spirit. Remember: it's not the size of the dog in the fight - it's the size of the fight in the dog. Overcoming challenge, confounding the sceptics, reinventing ourselves, this is what we do. It's called leadership. Let's turn this time of challenge into a time of opportunity. Not sitting around, watching things happen and wondering why. But standing up, making things happen and asking why not. We have the people, we have the ideas, and now we have a government that's freeing those people, backing those ideas. So let's see an optimistic future. Let's show the world some fight. Let's pull together, work together. And together lead Britain to better days.

aVIn May 2010, this party stood on the threshold of power for the first time in more than a decade. We knew then that it was not just the ordinary duties of office that we were assuming. We were entering into Government at a grave moment in the modern history of Britain.At a time when people felt uncertainty, even fear. Here was the challenge: To make an insolvent nation solvent again. To set our country back on the path to prosperity that all can share in. To bring home our troops from danger while keeping our citizens safe from terror. To mend a broken society.Two and a half years later of course I can't tell you that all is well, but I can say this: Britain is on the right track.As Prime Minister it has fallen to me to say some hard things and to help our country face some hard truths. All of my adult life, whatever the difficulties, the British people have at least been confident about one thing. We have thought we can pay our way.That we can earn our living as a major industrial country...\u2026and we will always remain one.It has fallen to us to say - we cannot assume that any longer.Unless we act, unless we take difficult, painful decisions, unless we show determination and imagination, Britain may not be in the future what it has been in the past.Because the truth is this. We are in a global race today. And that means an hour of reckoning for countries like ours. Sink or swim. Do or decline.To take office at such a moment is a duty and an honour\u2026\u2026and we will rise to the challenge.Today I\u2019m going to set out a serious argument to this country about how we do that. How we compete and thrive in this world\u2026\u2026how we can make sure in this century, like the ones before, Britain is on the rise.Nothing matters more.Every battle we fight, every plan we make, every decision we take is to achieve that end\u2026\u2026Britain on the rise.BRITAIN CAN DELIVERThough the challenge before us is daunting, I have confidence in our country. Why? Because Britain can deliver. We can do big things.We saw it this summer. The Jubilee, the Olympics, the Paralympics\u2026\u2026the best country in the world\u2026\u2026and let\u2019s say it: with our Queen, the finest Head of State on earth.I was trying to think of my favourite moment. Was it telling President Hollande that no, we hadn\u2019t cheated at the cycling, we didn\u2019t have rounder wheels, it was just that we peddled faster than the French?No\u2026 for me it was seeing that young woman who swam her heart out for years\u2026\u2026nine training sessions a week, two hours a time.My best moment was putting that gold medal around the neck of Ellie Simmonds. And I am so grateful for what all those Paralympians did.When I used to push my son Ivan around in his wheelchair, I always thought that some people saw the wheelchair, not the boy.Today more people would see the boy and not the wheelchair \u2013 and that\u2019s because of what happened here this summer.And the Olympics showed us something else. Whether our athletes were English, Scottish, Welsh or from Northern Ireland \u2026they draped themselves in one flag.Now, there\u2019s one person who didn\u2019t like that \u2026and he\u2019s called Alex Salmond.I\u2019m going to see him on Monday to sort that referendum on independence by the end of 2014. There are many things I want this coalition to achieve but what could matter more than saving our United Kingdom \u2026let\u2019s say it: we\u2019re better together and we\u2019ll rise together \u2013 so let\u2019s fight that referendum with everything we\u2019ve got.There are so many people to thank for this summer. Those that won the bid, those that built the stadia, that ran the Games \u2026and of course: the man who put a smile on our faces\u2026\u2026the zinger on the zip-wire\u2026\u2026the Conservative Mayor of London: our Boris Johnson.And those Games-Makers. You know, I\u2019ve spent three years trying to explain the Big Society \u2026they did it beautifully in just three weeks.There is another group of people who stepped into the breach this summer \u2013 and we in this party never forget them. Our armed forces have been on the ground in Afghanistan for over ten years now. 433 men and women have made the ultimate sacrifice. Just last weekend there was a memorial service for one of the fallen, and the eulogy said this:\u201cAll that they had they gave. All that they might have had. All that they had ever been. All that they might ever have become.\u201dFor all those who serve, and their families, I repeat the commitment I made when this Government came to office. By the end of 2014, all UK combat operations in Afghanistan will have come to an end. Nearly all our troops will be home \u2013 their country proud, their duty done \u2026and let everyone in this hall stand and show how profoundly grateful we are for everything they do.CONSERVATIVES CAN DELIVERTo meet the challenges our country faces, we must have confidence in ourselves\u2026 confidence as a party. We\u2019ve been in office two and a half years now \u2013 and we\u2019ve done some big, life-changing things.Just ask Clive Stone, who you saw in a film earlier. I met him years ago, when we were in Opposition. He had cancer and he said to me: the drug I need \u2013 it\u2019s out there but they won\u2019t give it to me because it\u2019s too expensive \u2026please, if you get in, do something about it.And we have. A new cancer drugs fund that has got the latest drugs to more than 21,000 people and counting. There was a reason we could do that. It\u2019s because we made a big decision to protect the NHS from spending cuts.No other party made that commitment.Not Labour. Not the Liberal Democrats. Just us \u2013 the Conservatives.To all those people who said we\u2019d bring the NHS down ... I say \u2026well, yes, you\u2019ve got a point.I\u2019ll tell you what is down.Waiting lists \u2013 down. Mixed wards \u2013 down. The number of managers \u2013 down. Bureaucratic targets \u2013 down. Hospital infections \u2013 down.And what\u2019s up? The number of doctors, the number of dentists, the number of midwives, the number of operations carried out in our NHS.So be in no doubt: this is the party of the NHS and that\u2019s the way it\u2019s going to stay.We made a big decision to go on saving lives abroad too. I know some are sceptical about our aid budget. But picture the scene \u2013 you\u2019re in a health centre in Kinshasa. See the child with a needle in her arm, being injected with a Yellow Fever vaccine \u2026the difference between living and dying\u2026\u2026how can anyone tell me that\u2019s a waste of money.Since we gathered here in Birmingham on Sunday, British aid money has vaccinated 130 thousand children around the world. One hundred and thirty thousand children.You, the Conservative party helped do that, and you should be proud of what you\u2019ve done.Here\u2019s something else this party\u2019s done in government. Last December I was at a European Council in Brussels. It was three in the morning, there was a treaty on the table that was not in Britain\u2019s interests\u2026\u2026and twenty five people around that table were telling me to sign it.But I did something that no other British leader has ever done before \u2026I said no \u2013 Britain comes first \u2013 and I vetoed that EU treaty.We\u2019re doing big, Conservative things.For years people said you\u2019ll never reform public sector pensions, the trade unions won\u2019t stand for it. Well, we\u2019ve done it, and it\u2019s going to cut the cost to the taxpayer almost in half.For years people said benefits are out of control and there\u2019s nothing you can do about it. Well, because of our welfare cap, no family will be getting more in benefits than the average family earns.For years people asked why we couldn\u2019t get rid of those radical preachers who spout hatred about Britain while living off the taxpayer\u2026\u2026well, Theresa May \u2013 a great Home Secretary - has done it \u2013 and she\u2019s got Abu Hamza on that plane and out of our country to face justice.Be proud of what we\u2019ve done already. Two million of the lowest-paid workers being taken out of income tax altogether. Over eighteen million households helped with a freeze in their council tax \u2013 and we\u2019re freezing it all over again next year too.BRITAIN ON THE RISEBig, Conservative things - delivered by this government; made possible by this party. We can deliver. We can do big things.The Olympics reminded us how great it feels to be successful. But we mustn\u2019t let that warm glow give us a false sense of security. All around the world, countries are on the rise.Yes, we\u2019ve been hearing about China and India for years \u2026but it\u2019s hard to believe what\u2019s happening in Brazil, in Indonesia, in Nigeria too.Meanwhile, the old powers are on the slide. What do the countries on the rise have in common?They are lean, fit, obsessed with enterprise, spending money on the future \u2013 on education, incredible infrastructure and technology.And what do the countries on the slide have in common?They\u2019re fat, sclerotic, over-regulated, spending money on unaffordable welfare systems, huge pension bills, unreformed public services.I sit in those European Council meetings where we talk endlessly about Greece\u2026\u2026while on the other side of the world, China is moving so fast it\u2019s creating a new economy the size of Greece every three months.I am not going to stand here as Prime Minister and allow this country to join the slide. My job \u2013 our job - is to make sure that in this twenty first century, as in the centuries that came before, our country, Britain, is on the rise. And we here know how that is done.It is the collective result of individual effort and aspiration\u2026\u2026 the ideas you have, the businesses you start, the hours you put in.Aspiration is the engine of progress. Countries rise when they allow their people to rise. In this world where brains matter more, where technologies shape our lives, where no-one is owed a living \u2026the most powerful natural resource we have is our people.Not just the scientists, the entrepreneurs, the engineers ... not just the teachers, the parents, the nurses \u2026 but all our people: including the poorest, those who\u2019ve never had a job, never had a chance, never had hope.That\u2019s why the mission for this government is to build an aspiration nation \u2026 to unleash and unlock the promise in all our people.And for us Conservatives, this is not just an economic mission \u2013 it\u2019s also a moral one. It\u2019s not just about growth and GDP\u2026\u2026it\u2019s what\u2019s always made our hearts beat faster \u2013 aspiration; people rising from the bottom to the top.Line one, rule one of being a Conservative is that it\u2019s not where you\u2019ve come from that counts, it\u2019s where you\u2019re going.We\u2019ve been led by the daughter of a grocer, the son of a music hall performer ... by a Jew when Jews were marginalised, by a woman when women were sidelined. We don\u2019t look at the label on the tin; we look at what\u2019s in it.Let me put that another way. We don\u2019t preach about one nation but practise class war \u2026we just get behind people who want to get on in life.The doers. The risk takers. The young people who dream of their first pay-cheque, their first car, their first home \u2013 and are ready and willing to work hard to get those things.While the intellectuals of other parties sneer at people who want to get on in life, we here salute you.They call us the party of the better-off \u2026 no: we are the party of the want to be better-off, those who strive to make a better life for themselves and their families \u2013 and we should never, ever be ashamed of saying so.THE RIGHT IDEASThis party has a heart but we don\u2019t like wearing it on our sleeve. Conservatives think: let\u2019s just get on with the job and help people and not bang on about it. It\u2019s not our style. But there\u2019s a problem with that.It leaves a space for others to twist our ideas and distort who we are: the cartoon Conservatives who don\u2019t care. My mission from the day I became leader was to change that. Yes, to show the Conservative party is for everyone: North or South, black or white, straight or gay.But above all - to show that Conservative methods are not just the way we grow a strong economy, but the way we build a big society.That Conservative methods are not just good for the strong and the successful but the best way to help the poor, and the weak, and the vulnerable.Because it\u2019s not enough to know our ideas are right \u2013 we\u2019ve got to explain why they are compassionate too. Because we know what we\u2019re up against.We say we\u2019ve got to get the private sector bigger and the public sector smaller\u2026our opponents call it \u2018Tory cuts, slashing the state\u2019. No: it\u2019s the best way to create the sustainable jobs people need.We say help people become independent from welfare\u2026our opponents call it: \u2018cruel Tories, leaving people to fend for themselves.\u2019No: there is only one real route out of poverty and it is work.We say we\u2019ve got to insist on a disciplined, rigorous education for our children \u2026 our opponents call it: \u2018elitist Tories, old-fashioned and out of touch.\u2019No: a decent education is the only way to give all our children a proper start in this world.The reason we want to reform schools, to cut welfare dependency, to reduce government spending is not because we\u2019re the same old Tories who want to help the rich... it\u2019s because we\u2019re the Tories whose ideas help everyone - the poorest the most.A strong private sector. Welfare that works. Schools that teach. These three things are essential to helping our people rise They are essential to our success in this world.And you know what \u2013 Labour will fight them all the way. So these things are not just the battle-ground for Britain\u2019s future \u2026 they are also the battle-lines for the next election \u2013 and it is a fight we\u2019ve got to win, for our party and our country.ECONOMYTo help our people rise, then \u2013 number one \u2013 we need an economy that creates good jobs. We need businesses, of every size, in every type of industry, in every part of the country \u2013 investing and taking people on.There are some basic things they need to do that. Low interest rates so they can afford to take out a loan.And confidence that it\u2019s worth investing - because the customers will be there, whether at home or abroad. Getting the deficit down is essential for both.That\u2019s why our deficit reduction plan is not an alternative to a growth plan: it\u2019s the very foundation of our growth plan. It\u2019s the only way we\u2019ll get Britain on the rise.Now I know you are asking whether the plan is working. And here\u2019s the truth: the damage was worse than we thought, and it's taking longer than we hoped.The world economy \u2013 especially in the Eurozone \u2013 has been much weaker than expected in the past two years. When some of our big trading partners like Ireland, Spain and Italy are suffering, they buy less from us. That hurts our growth and makes it harder to pay off our debts.But here is the crucial thing you need to know.Yes it\u2019s worse than we thought, yes it\u2019s taking longer, but we are making progress. Thanks to the grit and resolve of George Osborne, we have cut a quarter off the deficit in the past two years. 25 per cent. That\u2019s helped to keep interest rates at record low levels......keeping mortgages low. Leaving more money in your pockets. Giving businesses more confidence to invest. Creating more jobs.And if you don\u2019t believe me, just look at the job creation figures. Since this government took office, over one million new jobs have been created in the private sector. That is more \u2013 net \u2013 in the last two years than Labour managed in ten years.LABOURNow, the Labour politicians who got us into the mess say they have a different way out of it. They call it Plan B and it goes like this: We should stop worrying about deficit reduction, borrow more money and spend it to boost the economy.It sounds so reasonable when you put it like that. Let me tell you why it\u2019s not.Right now, while we\u2019ve got a deficit, the people we\u2019re borrowing money from believe that we\u2019ll pay it back - because we\u2019ve set out a tough plan to cut spending and live within our means.That\u2019s why our interest rates are among the lowest in the world, even though the deficit left to us by Labour was one of the highest in the world.If we did what Labour want, and watered down our plans, the risk is that the people we borrow money from would start to question our ability and resolve to pay off our debts.Some may actually refuse to lend us that money. Others would only lend it to us at higher interest rates.That would hurt the economy and hit people hard.If you have a mortgage of £100,000, just a 1 per cent interest rate rise would mean an extra thousand pounds to pay each year. Labour\u2019s plan to borrow more is actually a massive gamble with our economy and our future. And it would squander the sacrifices we\u2019ve already made.We\u2019re here because they spent too much and borrowed too much. How can the answer be more spending and more borrowing? I honestly think Labour haven\u2019t learned a single thing.When they were in office, their answer was always: Borrow more money.Now they\u2019re out of office it\u2019s: Borrow more money.Whatever the day, whatever the question, whatever the weather it\u2019s: borrow more money.Borrow, borrow, borrow.Labour: the party of one notion: more borrowing. I sometimes wonder if they know anything about the real economy at all.Did you hear what Ed Miliband said last week about taxes? He described a tax cut as the government writing people a cheque.Ed... Let me explain to you how it works. When people earn money, it\u2019s their money. Not the government\u2019s money: their money.Then, the government takes some of it away in tax. So, if we cut taxes, we\u2019re not giving them money - we\u2019re taking less of it away. OK?And while we\u2019re on that - who suffers when the wealthy businessman goes off to live in Geneva? Not him \u2013 he\u2019s paying about half the tax he would do here \u2026 it\u2019s those who want to work who suffer because the jobs aren\u2019t being created here.We promised that those with the broadest shoulders would bear the biggest burden \u2026 and with us, the rich will pay a greater share of tax in every year of this Parliament than in any one of the thirteen years under Labour.Under Labour.We haven\u2019t forgotten, you know. We remember who spent our golden legacy, who sold our gold \u2026who busted our banks, who smothered our businesses \u2026 who wracked up our debts, who wrecked our economy \u2026who ruined our reputation, who risked our future \u2026who did this? \u2013 Labour did this \u2013 and this country should never forget it.ASPIRATION ECONOMYTo get Britain on the rise we need a whole new economy \u2026more enterprising, more aspirational \u2026and it\u2019s taking shape already.We\u2019re getting our entrepreneurial streak back: last year the rate of new business creation was faster than any other year in our history.Let me repeat that.The rate at which new businesses started \u2013 faster than any year on record. We\u2019re making things again. We had a trade surplus in cars last year for the first time in almost 40 years.And it\u2019s not just the old industries growing, it\u2019s the new. We\u2019re number one in the world for offshore wind. Number one in the world for tidal power. The world\u2019s first green investment bank.Britain leading; Britain on the rise. We\u2019re showing we can do it. Look at the new investment coming in.In the last two years, Google, Intel, Cisco \u2013 the big tech firms \u2013 they\u2019ve all set up new bases here. And we are selling to the world again.When I became Prime Minister I said to the Foreign Office: those embassies you\u2019ve got \u2026turn them into showrooms for our cars, department stores for our fashion, technology hubs for British start-ups.Yes, you\u2019re diplomats but you need to be our country\u2019s salesforce too. And look what\u2019s happening. In just two years, our exports to Brazil are up 25 per cent \u2026 to China \u2013 40 per cent \u2026 to Russia \u2013 80 per cent.There are so many opportunities in this world. I want to tell you about one business that\u2019s seizing them. It\u2019s run by a guy called Alastair Lukies.He and his business partner saw a world with almost 6 billion mobile phones and just 2 billion bank accounts. They saw the huge gap in the market\u2013 and they started a mobile banking firm \u2026 helping people in the poorest parts of the world manage their money and start new companies.He\u2019s been with me on trade missions all over the world \u2013 and his business is booming. Back in 2010, when we came to office, they employed about 100 people \u2013 now it\u2019s more than 700.Then they were nowhere in Africa, nowhere in Asia, now they are the global player, with one million new users every month. So don\u2019t let anyone tell you Britain can\u2019t make it in this world \u2013 we\u2019re the most enterprising, buccaneering, creative, dynamic nation on earth.And to those who question whether it\u2019s right to load up a plane with businesspeople \u2013 whether we\u2019re flying to Africa, Indonesia, to the Gulf or China \u2026whether we\u2019re taking people from energy, finance, technology or yes \u2013 defence \u2026 I say \u2013 there is a global battle out there to win jobs, orders, contracts \u2026 and in that battle I believe in leading from the front.To get our economy on the rise there\u2019s a lot more to do \u2013 and frankly a lot more fights to be had. Because there are too many of what I\u2019d call the \u201cyes-but-no\u201d people. The ones who say \u201cyes, our businesses need to expand \u2026but no we can\u2019t reform planning.\u201dIt\u2019s simple. For a business to expand, it needs places to build. If it takes too long, they\u2019ll just build elsewhere.I visited a business the other day that wanted to open a big factory just outside Liverpool. But the council was going to take so long to approve the decision that they\u2019re now building that factory on the continent \u2013 and taking hundreds of jobs with them.If we\u2019re going to be a winner in this global race we\u2019ve got to beat off this suffocating bureaucracy once and for all. And then there are those who say \u201cyes of course we need more housing\u201d \u2026 but \u201cno\u201d to every development \u2013 and not in my backyard.Look - it's OK for my generation. Many of us have got on the ladder. But you know the average age that someone buys their first home today, without any help for their parents? 33 years old.We are the party of home ownership \u2013 we cannot let this carry on.So yes \u2013 we\u2019re doubling the discount for buying your council house \u2026we\u2019re helping first-time buyers get a 95 per cent mortgage \u2026but there\u2019s something else we need to do \u2013 and that\u2019s accept we need to build more houses in Britain.There are young people who work hard year after year but are still living at home. They sit in their childhood bedroom, looking out of the window dreaming of a place of their own.I want us to say to them \u2013 you are our people, we are on your side, we will help you reach your dreams.WELFAREIf we want our people to rise so Britain can rise, we must tackle welfare. Here\u2019s two facts for you.Fact one. We spend £90 billion a year on welfare for working-age people. Not pensions. Just welfare for working age people \u2013 and that\u2019s one pound in every eight the government spends.Fact two. More of our children live in households where nobody works than almost any other nation in Europe. Let me put it simply. Welfare isn\u2019t working. And this is a tragedy.Our reforms are just as profound as those of Beveridge 60 years ago. He had his great evils to slay. Squalor. Ignorance. Want. Idleness. And Disease.Here are mine.First, unfairness.What are hard-working people who travel long distances to get into work and pay their taxes meant to think when they see families \u2013 individual families \u2013 getting 40, 50, 60 thousand pounds of housing benefit to live in homes that these hard working people could never afford themselves?It is an outrage. And we are ending it by capping housing benefit.The second evil: injustice.Here\u2019s the choice we give our young people today.Choice one: Work hard. Go to college. Get a job. Live at home. Save up for a flat. And as I\u2019ve just said, that can feel like forever.Or: Don\u2019t get a job. Sign on. Don\u2019t even need to produce a CV when you do sign on. Get housing benefit. Get a flat. And then don\u2019t ever get a job or you\u2019ll lose a load of housing benefit.We must be crazy.So this is what we\u2019ve done.Now you have to have to sign a contract that says: you do your bit and we\u2019ll do ours.It requires you to have a real CV and it makes clear: you have to seek work and take work \u2013 or you will lose your benefit. And we\u2019re going to look at ending automatic access to housing benefit for people under 25 too.If hard-working young people have to live at home while they work and save, why should it be any different for those who don\u2019t?The next evil: bureaucracy.Sign on. Sign here. Come back in a fortnight. Repeat as required.What does this do for the guy who\u2019s been out of work for years, playing computer games all day, living out a fantasy because he hates real life?For people like him we\u2019re doing something new. The Work Programme takes the money we\u2019re going to save from getting people off the dole \u2026and uses it today to get them into work, with proper training.We\u2019re spending up to £14,000 on one individual to get them into work \u2013 and already almost 700,000 people have got onto the Work Programme.So let\u2019s be clear: in British politics today it is this party saying no-one is a write-off, no-one is hopeless \u2026and with Iain Duncan Smith leading this revolution let this be the party that shows there is ability and promise in everyone.And just one more thing on welfare.You know our work experience programme, where we give young people the chance to work in a supermarket, a shop, an office?Here\u2019s what one union official said about it. I quote: \u201cThe scheme belongs back in the nineteenth century, along with Oliver Twist and the workhouse. It is nothing short of state sponsored slavery\u2026\u201dHonestly. What an appalling, snobbish attitude to the idea of work. We\u2019re not sending children up chimneys, we\u2019re giving them a chance. What\u2019s cruel isn\u2019t asking something of people \u2013 it\u2019s when we ask nothing of them. Work isn\u2019t slavery, it\u2019s poverty that is slavery\u2026\u2026and again it\u2019s us, the modern compassionate Conservative party, who are the real champions of fighting poverty in Britain today.EDUCATIONTo help people to rise, to help Britain rise, there\u2019s a third \u2013 crucial \u2013 thing we must do. Educate all our children.And I mean really educate them, not just pump up the grades each year. In maths, in science, in reading, we\u2019ve fallen behind \u2026not just behind Germany and Canada but Estonia and Australia too.This is Britain\u2019s real school report and the verdict is clear: must try harder. You\u2019ve heard of pushy parents, sharp-elbowing their way to a better education for their kids?Well \u2013 this is a pushy government.My approach is very simple. I\u2019ve got two children in primary school, and I want for your children what I want for mine. To go to schools where discipline is strict, expectations are high and no excuses are accepted for failure.I don\u2019t want great schools to just be the preserve of those that can pay the fees, or buy the nice house in the right catchment area \u2026I want those schools to be open to every child \u2013 in every neighbourhood.And the reason I know that every child can go to a school like that is because with this Government, more and more new ones are opening.We\u2019ve heard from some of them this week \u2026 not just the 79 new free schools \u2013 with over a hundred more to come\u2026\u2026but from some of the more than 2000 academies we\u2019ve helped create \u2013 state schools given all the freedoms, and carrying all the high expectations, of private schools.Yes \u2013 that\u2019s my plan \u2013 millions of children sent to independent schools \u2026independent schools, in the state sector.That\u2019s the genuine revolution that\u2019s now underway.The Harris Academy in Peckham has increased the number of students getting five good GCSEs \u2013 from 12 percent when it was under local authority control to almost 90 percent now.The transformation has been astonishing \u2013 and the methods have been Conservative.Smart uniforms, teachers in suits. Children taught physics, chemistry and biology not soft options. Children set by ability \u2013 with excellence applauded, extra resources for those most in need but no excuses for slacking.When you see a school like that succeed it prompts the question: Why can\u2019t every school be that way? Why can\u2019t every child have those chances?It\u2019s not because parents aren\u2019t ambitious enough \u2013 most of these schools are massively over-subscribed.It\u2019s because the old educational establishment \u2013 the left-wing local authorities, the leaders of the teachers unions, the Labour party theorists \u2013 stood in the way.When we saw a badly failing school in Haringey and wanted to turn it into an Academy, the Labour authority, the Labour MP and the teaching unions said no.When inspirational teachers and parents \u2013 in Hammersmith, in Norwich, in Bristol and in Wigan \u2013 wanted to open free schools, the left-wing establishment said no.When we proposed: More pay for good teachers... Getting rid of bad teachers \u2026Longer school days to help children learn\u2026 Flexible school hours to help parents work \u2026More stretching exams for those who\u2019re really able\u2026 Less nonsense about health and safety\u2026the left-wing establishment have said just one thing: No.When you ask them: why is a school failing? Why aren\u2019t the children succeeding? You hear the same thing over and over again.\u2018What can you expect with children like these?\u2019 they say. \u2018These children are disadvantaged.\u2019Of course we want to tackle every disadvantage. But isn\u2019t the greatest disadvantage of all being written off by those so in hock to a culture of low expectations that they have forgotten what it\u2019s like to be ambitious, to want to transcend your background, to overcome circumstance and succeed on your own terms?It\u2019s that toxic culture of low expectations \u2013 that lack of ambition for every child \u2013 which has held this country back.Well, Michael Gove and I are not waiting for an outbreak of sanity in the headquarters of the NUT or an embrace of aspiration in the higher reaches of Labour before we act.Because our children can\u2019t wait.So when people say we should slow down our education reforms \u2013 so adults can adjust to them, I say:I want more free schools, more Academies, more rigorous exams in every school, more expected of every child.And to all those people who say: he wants children to have the kind of education he had at his posh school \u2026I say: yes \u2013 you\u2019re absolutely right.I went to a great school and I want every child to have a great education.I\u2019m not here to defend privilege, I\u2019m here to spread it.CONCLUSIONI don\u2019t have a hard luck story. My dad was a stockbroker from Berkshire.It\u2019s only when your dad\u2019s gone that you realise \u2013 not just how much you really miss them \u2013 but how much you really owe them.My dad influenced me much more than I ever thought. He was born with no heels on his feet and legs about a foot shorter than they\u2019re meant to be. But he never complained - even when he lost both those legs later in life.Because disability in the 1930s was such a stigma, he was an only child. Probably a lonely child.But Dad was the eternal optimist. To him the glass was always half full. Usually with something alcoholic in it.When I was a boy I remember once going on a long walk with him in the village where we lived, passing the church he supported and the village hall where he took part in interminable parish council meetings.He told me what he was most proud of. It was simple \u2013 working hard from the moment he left school and providing a good start in life for his family.Not just all of us, but helping his mum too, when his father ran off. Not a hard luck story, but a hard work story.Work hard. Family comes first. But put back in to the community too.There is nothing complicated about me. I believe in working hard, caring for my family and serving my country. And there is nothing complicated about what we need today.This is still the greatest country on earth. We showed that again this summer. 22nd in world population. 3rd in the medals table.But it\u2019s tough. These are difficult times. We\u2019re being tested. How will we come through it? Again, it\u2019s not complicated. Hard work. Strong families. Taking responsibility. Serving others.As I said on the steps of No10 Downing Street before walking through that door: Those who can should, those who can\u2019t we will always help.The job of this party \u2026 of this government \u2026 is to help to bring out the best in this country. Because at our best we\u2019re unbeatable.We know Britain can deliver because we\u2019ve seen it time and again.This is the country that \u2026 invented the computer, defeated the Nazis, started the web, saw off the slave trade, unravelled DNA and fought off every invader for a thousand years.We even persuaded the Queen to jump out of a helicopter to make the rest of the world smile \u2026. there is absolutely nothing we cannot do.Can we make Britain the best place in the world to start a business, grow a business and help that business take on the world and win? Yes.Can we \u2013 the people who invented the welfare state in the first place \u2013 turn it into something that rewards effort, helps keep families together and really helps the poorest with a new start in life. Yes.Can we take our schools and turn out students that will take on the brightest in the world? Yes. Of course we can.Let us here in this hall, here in this government, together in this country make this pledge \u2013 let\u2019s build an aspiration nation \u2026let\u2019s get Britain on the rise.Deficit, paid down. Tough decisions, taJken. Growth, fired up. Aspiration, backed all the way.We know what it takes to win \u2026 to win in the tough world of today \u2026 to win for all our people \u2026 to win for Britain.So let\u2019s get out there and do it.

aVThis week in Manchester we've shown this Party is on the side of hardworking people. Helping young people buy their own home. Getting the long-term unemployed back to work. Freezing fuel duty. Backing marriage. Cutting the deficit. Creating jobs. Creating wealth. Make no mistake: it is this Party with the verve, energy and ideas to take our country forward. And I want to thank everyone here for the great week we've had. When we came to office, we faced a clear and daunting task: to turn our country around. In May 2010, the needle on the gauge was at crisis point. People were talking about this country in a way they had not done for decades. But three and a half years later, we are beginning to turn the corner. The deficit is falling. Our economy is growing. The numbers of our fellow countrymen and women in work are rising. We are not there yet, not by a long way. But, my friends, we are on our way. I want to thank the people who have done the most to get us this far. You. The British people. Never giving up. Working those extra hours. Coping with those necessary cuts. You. British business. You kept people on in the hard times. Invested before you knew for certain that things were getting better. Together - we are clearing up the mess that Labour left. But I have a simple question, to the people in this hall and beyond it. Is that enough? Is it enough that we just clear up Labour's mess and think 'job done'? Is it enough to just fix what went wrong? I say - no. Not for me. This isn't job done; it is job begun. I didn't come into politics just to fix what went wrong, but to build something right. We in this party - we don't dream of deficits and decimal points and dry fiscal plans. Our dreams are about helping people get on in life. Aspiration, opportunity: these are our words, our dreams. So today I want to talk about our one, abiding mission. I believe it is the great Conservative mission. That as our economy starts to recover, we build a land of opportunity in our country today. Now, I know, it'll be tough. But I know we've got what it takes in this Party. Some people say "can't be done" - Conservatives say "what's to stop us?" They said we couldn't get terrorists out of our own country. Well - Theresa knew otherwise... ...and that's why Abu Qatada had his very own May Day this year... Didn't it feel good seeing him get on that plane? Some people said the NHS wasn't safe in our hands. Well - we knew otherwise. Who protected spending on the NHS? Not Labour - us. Who started the Cancer Drugs Fund? Not Labour - us. And by the way - who presided over Mid Staffs? Patients left for so long without water, they were drinking out of dirty vases... ...people's grandparents lying filthy and unwashed for days. Who allowed that to happen? Yes, it was Labour... ...and don't you dare lecture anyone on the NHS again. And some people say a lot of things on Europe. You'll never be able to veto an EU treaty. You'll never cut the Budget. And if you did these things - you'd have no allies in Europe. Well we've proved them wrong. I vetoed that treaty. I got Britain out of the EU bail-out scheme. And yes - I cut that budget. And in doing all this, we haven't lost respect - we've won allies to get powers back from Europe. That is what we will do... ...and at the end of it - yes - we will give the British people their say in a referendum. That is our pledge. It will be your choice: in or out. BRITAIN IN THE WORLD And friends, you know what someone said about us recently? Apparently some Russian official said: Britain is "just a small island that no-one pays any attention to." Really? Let me just get this off my chest. When the world wanted rights, who wrote Magna Carta? When they wanted representation, who built the first Parliament? When they looked for compassion, who led the abolition of slavery? When they searched for equality, who gave women the vote? When their freedom was in peril, who offered blood, toil, tears and sweat? And today - whose music do they dance to? Whose universities do they flock to? Whose football league do they watch? Whose example of tolerance of people living together from every nation, every religion, young and old, straight and gay? Whose example do they aspire to? I haven't even got on to the fact that this small island beat Russia in the Olympics last year, or that the biggest-selling vodka brand in the world isn't Russian, it's British - Smirnoff - made in Fife. ...so yes, we may be a small island but I tell you what, we're a great country. But I want to make a serious point about our place in the world. Following that vote on Syria in the House of Commons, some people said it was time for Britain to re-think our role. I'm sorry - but I don't agree. If we shrunk from the world we would be less safe and less prosperous. The role we play, the organisations we belong to... ... and yes - the fact our defence budget remains the 4th largest in the world... ...all this is not about national vanity - it's about our national interest. When British citizens -our fathers, mothers, daughters- are in danger... ...whether that's in the deserts of Algeria or the city of Nairobi then combatting international terrorism - it matters to us. When five of the world's fastest growing economies are African, then trading with Africa - and yes helping Africa to develop with aid - that matters to us. And at the heart of all this work - the finest Foreign Secretary I could ask for: William Hague. Around the world, we really do matter as a United Kingdom: England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland. The date of the referendum has been set. The decision is for Scotland to make. All the arguments about our economy, jobs, currency - I believe they make an unanswerable case for the UK. But today I want a more simple message to go out to all the people of Scotland. From us here in this hall, from me, from this party, from this country, from England, Wales, Northern Ireland and it's this: We want you to stay. We want to stick together. Think of all we've achieved together - the things we can do together. The nations - as one. Our Kingdom - United. For 12 years now, men and women from all parts of these islands have been serving their country in Afghanistan. Next year, the last of our combat troops will be coming home... ...having trained up the Afghans to look after their own country. More than a decade of war. Sacrifice beyond measure - from the finest and bravest armed forces in the world. And I want us to stand, to raise the roof in here, to show just how proud of those men and women we are. THATCHER We in this room are a team. And this year, we said goodbye to one of our team. Margaret Thatcher made our country stand tall again, at home and abroad. Rescuing our economy. Giving power to our people. Spreading home ownership. Creating work. Winning the Cold War. Saving the Falklands. I asked her about her record once. I was sitting next to her at a dinner - and I was really nervous. As ever she was totally charming, she put me at ease... ...but after a while I said: "Margaret, if you had your time in Government again, is there anything you'd do differently?" And she turned to me and said: "You know, I think I did pretty well the first time around." Well we can all agree with that - and we can all agree on this... ...she was the greatest peace-time Prime Minister our country has ever had. LABOUR'S MESS Margaret Thatcher had an almighty mess to clear up when she came to office and so did we. We will never forget what we found. The biggest Budget deficit in our peace-time history. The deepest recession since the Second World War. But it wasn't just the debt and deficit Labour left, it was who got hurt. Millions coming here from overseas while millions of British people were left on welfare. The richest paying lower tax rates than their cleaners. Unsustainable, debt-fuelled banks booming - while manufacturing withered away. The North falling further behind. Towns where a quarter of people lived on benefits. Schools where 8 out of 10 children didn't get five decent GCSEs. Yes, they were famously "intensely relaxed" about people getting filthy rich. ...but tragically, they were also "intensely relaxed" about people staying stuck on welfare year after year... "intensely relaxed" about children leaving school without proper qualifications so they couldn't hope to get a job at the end of it. That was it. That was what they left. The casino economy meets the welfare society meets the broken education system... a country for the few built by the so-called party of the many. and Labour: we will never let you forget it. OUR MISSION These past few years have been a real struggle. But what people want to know now is: was the struggle worth it? And here's the honest answer. The struggle will only be worth it if we as a country finish the job we've started. Finishing the job means understanding this. Our economy may be turning the corner - and of course that's great. But we still haven't finished paying for Labour's Debt Crisis. If anyone thinks that's over, done, dealt with - they're living in a fantasy land. This country's debt crisis, created by Labour, is not over. After three years of cuts, we still have one of the biggest deficits in the world. We are still spending more than we earn. We still need to earn more and yes, our Government still needs to spend less. I see that Labour have stopped talking about the debt crisis and now they talk about the cost of living crisis. As if one wasn't directly related to the other. If you want to know what happens if you don't deal with a debt crisis.. ...and how it affects the cost of living... ...just go and ask the Greeks. So finishing the job means sticking to our course until we've paid off all of Labour's deficit, not just some of it. And yes - let's run a surplus so that this time we fix the roof when the sun is shining... ...as George said in that brilliant speech on Monday. To abandon deficit reduction now would throw away all the progress we've made. It would put us back to square one. Unbelievably, that's exactly what Labour now want to do. How did they get us into this mess? Too much spending, too much borrowing, too much debt. And what did they propose last week? More spending, more borrowing, more debt. They have learned nothing - literally nothing - from the crisis they created. But finishing the job is about more than clearing up the mess we were left. It means building something better in its place. In place of the casino economy, one where people who work hard can actually get on. In place of the welfare society, one where no individual is written off. In place of the broken education system, one that gives every child the chance to rise up and succeed. Our economy, our society, welfare, schools. ...all reformed, all rebuilt - with one aim, one mission in mind: To make this country, at long last and for the first time ever, a land of opportunity for all. For all. So it makes no difference whether you live in the North or in the South, whether you're black or you're white, a man or a woman, the school you went to, the background you have, who your parents were. ...what matters is the effort you put in, and if you put the effort in you'll have the chance to make it. That's what the land of opportunity means. That's what finishing the job means. Of course I know that others in politics may talk about these things. But wishing for something, caring about something - that's not enough. You can't conjure up a dynamic economy, a strong society, fantastic schools all with the stroke of a minister's pen. It takes a mixture of hard work, common sense and - above all - the right values. When the left say: you can't expect too much from the poorest kids; don't ask too much from people on welfare; business is the problem, not the solution. Here in this party we say: that's just wrong. If you expect nothing of people that does nothing for them. Yes, you must help people - but you help people by putting up ladders that they can climb through their own efforts. You don't help children succeed by dumbing down education. ...you help them by pushing them hard. Good education is not about equality of outcomes but bringing the best out of every single child. You don't help people by leaving them stuck on welfare. ...but by helping them stand on their own two feet. Why? Because the best way out of poverty is work - and the dignity that brings We know that profit, wealth creation, tax cuts, enterprise... ...these are not dirty, elitist words - they're not the problem... ...they really are the solution because it's not government that creates jobs, it's businesses. it's businesses that get wages in people's pockets, food on their tables, hope for their families and success for our country. There is no shortcut to a land of opportunity.  No quick fix.  No easy way to do it. You build it business by business, school by school, person by person. ...patiently, practically, painstakingly. And underpinning it all is that deep, instinctive belief that if you trust people and give them the tools, they will succeed. This party at its heart is about big people, strong communities, responsible businesses, a bigger society - not a bigger state. It's how we've been clearing up the mess. And it's how we're going to build something better in its place. So let's stick with it and finish the job we've started. ECONOMY A land of opportunity starts in our economy. The chance to get a decent job. To start a business. To own a home. And at the end of it all - more money in your pocket. To get decent jobs for people, you've got to recognise some fundamental economic facts. We are in a global race today. No one owes us a living. Last week, our ambition to compete in the global race was airily dismissed as a race to the bottom... ...that it means competing with China on sweatshops and India on low wages. No - those countries are becoming our customers. and we've got to compete with California on innovation; Germany on high-end manufacturing; Asia on finance and technology. And here's something else you need to recognise about this race. The plain fact is this. All those global companies that employ lots of people - they can set up anywhere in the world. They could go to Silicon Valley. To Berlin. And yes, here in Manchester. And these companies base their decisions on some simple things: like the tax rates in each country. So if those taxes are higher here than elsewhere, they don't come here. And if they don't come here, we don't get those jobs. Do you get that, Labour? British people don't get those jobs. Last week Labour proposed to put up corporation tax on our biggest and most successful employers. That is just about the most damaging, nonsensical, twisted economic policy you could possibly come up with. I get to visit some amazing factories in my job. One of my favourites is Jaguar Land Rover... ...not just because they actually let me get in a car and drive it around on my own... ...but really because I get to meet people there who are incredibly proud of their work and their craftsmanship... ...the fact that what they're making sells around the world - the best of British design and engineering. So when Ed Miliband talks about the face of big business, I think about the faces of these hardworking people. Labour is saying to their employers: "we want to put up your taxes. don't come here - stick your jobs and take them elsewhere". I know that bashing business might play to a Labour audience. But it's crazy for our country. So if Labour's plan for jobs is to attack business - ours is to back business. Regulation - down. Taxes - cut for businesses large and small. A new industrial policy that looks to the future - green jobs, aerospace jobs, life science jobs. We've made a good start: 1.4 million new jobs created in our private sector since we came to office... ...and that is 1.4 million reasons to finish the job we've started. In a land of opportunity, it's easier to start your own business. To all those people who strike out on their own, who sit there night after night... ...checking and double checking whether the numbers stack up... ...I say I have so much respect for you - you are national heroes. I'll never forget watching Samantha do just that - winning her first customer, sorting out the cash flow, that magic moment when she got her first business cards printed. I was incredibly proud of her then - and I am incredibly proud of her now. People setting up new businesses need finance - that's why we've brought in Start-up Loans. They need their taxes cut - and we're doing it - up to £2000 off your National Insurance bill for every small business And it's working. Let me tell you how many businesses have started up in Britain since the election: over 300,000. That is 300,000 more reasons to finish the job we've started. In a land of opportunity, more people must be able to own a home of their own. You know that old saying, your home is your castle? Well for most young people today, their home is their landlord's. Generation Y is starting to become Generation Why Do We Bother? Millions of them stuck renting when they're desperate to buy. I met a couple on Sunday - Emily and James. They'd both had decent jobs, but because they didn't have rich parents, they couldn't get a big enough deposit to buy a house. And let me tell you where I met them. In their new home, bought with our Help to Buy mortgage scheme. It was still half built. but they showed me where the kitchen would be. Outside there was rubble all over the ground, but they'd already bought a lawn-mower. And they talked about how excited they were to be spending a first Christmas in a home of their own. That is what we're about. And this, the party of aspiration is going to finish the job we've started. In a land of opportunity there's another thing people need. the most important thing of all. more money in their pockets. These have been difficult years. People have found it hard to make ends meet. That's why we've frozen council tax. and why we are freezing fuel duty. But we need to do more. I know that. We've heard Labour's ideas to help with the cost of living. Taxes on banks they want to spend ten times over. Promising free childcare - then saying that actually, you've got to pay for it. An energy promise they admitted 24 hours later they might not be able to keep. It's all sticking plasters and quick fixes... cobbled together for the TV cameras. Red Ed and his Blue Peter economy. To raise living standards in the long-term, you need to do some major things:... ...you need to cut the deficit to keep mortgage rates low... ...you need to grow your economy, get people jobs... ...and yes - cut people's taxes. I want people to keep more of their money. We've already cut the taxes of 25 million hardworking people... ...and yes - that is 25 million more reasons to finish the job we've started. We're Tories. We believe in low taxes. And believe me - we will keep on cutting the taxes of hardworking people. NORTH SOUTH And here in Manchester let me say this: when I say a land of opportunity for all I mean everyone - North and South. This country has been too London-centric for far too long. That's why we need a new North-South railway line. The fact is this. The West Coast mainline is almost full. We have to build a new railway. and the choice is between  another old-style Victorian one - or a high speed one. Just imagine if someone had said, no, we can't build the M1, or the Severn Bridge, imagine how that would be hobbling our economy today. HS2 is about bringing North and South together in our national endeavour. Because think of what more we could do with the pistons firing in all parts of our country. With its wind and wave power, let's make the Humber the centre of clean energy. With its resources under the ground, let's make Blackpool the centre of Europe for the shale gas industry. With its brains and research centres, let's make Manchester the world leader in advanced materials. We're building an economy for the North and South, embracing new technologies, producing things and selling them to the world. So make no mistake who's looking forward in British politics... ...we'll leave the 1970s-style socialism to others... ...we are the party of the future. We're making progress. You know how I know that? It's every week, at Prime Minister's Questions. There was a time when I'd look across to Ed Balls, and there he was, shouting his head off, and doing this with his hands - screaming out the economy was flat-lining. ...and all with such glee. But recently, it's gone a bit quiet. Could it be because there was no double dip and the economy's now growing? Well, I've got a gesture of my own for Ed Balls. ...and don't worry - it's not a rude one... .jobs are up. .construction is up. ...manufacturing is up... .inward investment. .retail sales. .homebuilding... .business confidence. .consumer confidence - all these things are up. And to anyone who wants to talk our economy down, let me tell you this. Since this conference began, over 100,000 jet planes have soared into the sky on wings made in Britain. Every single day in this country, over 4,000 cars are coming off the production line - ready to be exported around the globe. Last year, Britain overtook France as Germany's top trading partner... ...not bad for a nation of shop-keepers. And that's the point. Exports to China are up. Exports to Brazil are up. .exports to India, Russia, Thailand, South Korea, Australia - all up. So let us never forget the cast-iron law of British politics... Yes - the oceans can rise. .and empires can fall. .but one thing will never, ever change. .it's Labour who wreck our economy and it's we Conservatives who clear it up. EDUCATION A land of opportunity means educating our children - and I mean all our children. It's OK for the children who have parents reading them stories every night - and that's great. .but what about the ones at the back of the class, in the chaotic home, in the home of the drug addict or alcoholic? We need these children - and frankly they need us. That's why three and a half years ago, one man came into the Department of Education. ...Michael Gove, there he is... ...with a belief in excellence and massive energy... ...like a cross between Mr Chips and the Duracell bunny. Let's look at the results. More students studying proper science. More children learning a foreign language. We've ended the dumbing down in exams. For the first time - children in our schools will learn the new language of computer coding. And we're sending a clear message to children: if you fail English and maths GCSE, you're going to have to take and re-take them again until you pass. Because as I tell my own children - there's not a job in the world where you don't need to spell and add up properly. But ultimately - really raising standards means innovation, choice. .it means giving passionate people the freedom to run our schools. That's what Free Schools are all about. I'll never forget sitting in the classroom at Perry Beeches III in Birmingham, on the first day of term this year. I met a mum there who said to me - this is what I've dreamed of for my child... ...proper uniforms, high standards... ...this is going to give my child a good start in life. When Michael Howard asked me what job I wanted in the Shadow cabinet I said education... ...because this is the kind of thing I came into politics to bring about. You want to know something totally extraordinary about free schools? Labour's official policy is to be against them... ...but - get this - Labour MPs are backing them in their local area. And not just any Labour MPs. I promise I'm not making this up.. ...the Shadow Education Secretary - Stephen Twigg - has backed one in his own city. Unbelievable. And isn't that always the way with the Left? They don't like privilege - unless of course it's for their own children. Well we in this Party are ambitious for all our children... ...and we've got to finish the job we started. We've already got technical colleges run by great companies like JCB... ...I say: let's have one of those colleges in every single major town. We've had a million apprenticeships start with this Government... ...now we want a new expectation: as you leave school you have a choice - go to university or do an apprenticeship. And while we've still got children leaving primary school not reading, writing and adding up properly... ...let us set this ambition for our country: let's eliminate illiteracy and give every one of those children a chance. And friends as we do all this, we're remembering the most vulnerable children of all. There are thousands of children every year who grow up in homes where nappies - and bedclothes - go unchanged... ...and where their cries of pain go unheard. These children just need the most basic opportunity of all: a loving family. Two years ago I told you about our determination to speed up adoption... ...and this past year, we saw record numbers finding permanent, loving homes. 4000 children adopted... ...that is 4000 more reasons to finish the job we've started. And as we keep on with this, we remember who is on the front line. I have to make some tough decisions in my job... ...but none as tough as whether to break up a family and rescue a child... or try and stitch that family back together. Social work is a noble and vital calling. I'll never forget how after my son Ivan was born, a social worker sat patiently in our kitchen and told us about the sort of help we might need. This Government has helped get some of the brightest graduates into teaching... ...and we have pledged to do the same for social work... ...now let us, in this hall, hear it for Britain's social workers who are doing such an important job in our country today. WELFARE The land of opportunity needs one final thing: welfare that works. We know how badly things went wrong. Our fellow citizens working every hour of every day to put food on the table ask this: why should my taxes go to people who could work but don't? Or to those who live in homes that hardworking people could never afford? Or to people who have no right to be here in the first place? I say this to the British people: you have every right to be angry about a system that is unfair and unjust - and that's why we are sorting it out. We've capped welfare.  We've capped housing benefit.  We've insisted on new rules so that if you reject work, you lose benefits. And let's be absolutely clear. As Boris said in that great speech yesterday, the problems in our welfare system and the problems in our immigration system are inextricably linked. If we don't get our people back to work - we shouldn't be surprised if millions want to come here to work. But we must act on immigration directly too - and we are. Capping immigration. Clamping down on the bogus colleges. And when the Immigration Bill comes before Parliament, we will make sure some simple and fair things, that should have always been the case, are now set in stone. If you are not entitled to our free National Health Service, you should pay for it. If you have no right to be here, you cannot rent a flat or a house.  Not off the council, not off anyone else. When you are a foreign prisoner fighting deportation, you should pay your own legal bills. If you appeal - you must do it from your own country, after you've been deported, not from here. And on these huge, national problems we are making progress. Immigration has come down. On welfare: not only are there more people in work than ever before. .the number of households where no one works is at its lowest rate since records began. .and I want to thank the most determined champion for social justice this Party has ever had: Iain Duncan Smith. Iain understands that this isn't about fixing systems, it's about saving lives. .and that's why we've got to finish the job we've started. There are still over a million young people not in education, employment, or training. Today it is still possible to leave school, sign on, find a flat, start claiming housing benefit and opt for a life on benefits. It's time for bold action here. We should ask, as we write our next manifesto, if that option should really exist at all. Instead we should give young people a clear, positive choice: Go to school. Go to college. Do an apprenticeship. Get a job. But just choose the dole? We've got to offer them something better than that. And let no one paint ideas like this as callous. Think about it: with your children, would you dream of just leaving them to their own devices, not getting a job, not training, nothing? No - you'd nag and push and guide and do anything to get them on their way. and so must we. So this is what we want to see: everyone under 25 - earning or learning. And you know - on this, as on everything else, Labour will fight us... .but remember: we are giving people real opportunities. I've had people say to me "I'm back on my feet"... "I feel worthwhile." One wrote to me saying: now I can tell my son his Dad really does something. This is what our Party is all about. We don't patronise people, put a benefit cheque in their hand and pat them on the head. We look people in the eye as equals and say: yes, you've been down - but you're not out. .you can do it, you have it in you, we will give you that chance. And that's why we can say today that it's this Party that is fighting for all those who were written off by Labour... .it's this Party that's for the many not the few. .Yes - the land of despair was Labour... .but the land of hope is Tory. We have done some big things to transform Britain. But we need to finish the job we've started. We need to go further, do more for hardworking people... ...give more children a chance, back more businesses, help create more jobs. And I'm clear about how that job will best get done. It requires a strong Government, with a clear mandate, that is accountable for what it promises and yes, what it delivers. And let me tell everyone here what that means. When the election comes, we won't be campaigning for a coalition... ...we will be fighting heart and soul for a majority Conservative Government - because that is what our country needs. CONCLUSION You don't do this job to be popular. You do it because you love your country. I do the best I can. And for me, it comes back to some simple things. Country first. Do what's decent. Think long-term. There's an old story that's told about a great hall in Oxford, near my constituency. For hundreds of years it's stood there - held up with vast oak beams. In the 19th century, those beams needed replacing. And you know what they found? 500 years before, someone had thought. those beams will need replacing one day. .so they planted some oak trees. Just think about that. Centuries had passed. Columbus had reached America. Gravity had been discovered. .and when those oaks were needed, they were ready. Margaret Thatcher once said: "We are in the business of planting trees for our children and grandchildren or we have no business being in politics at all." That is what we are doing today. Not just making do and mending. .but making something better. Since I got to my feet, almost a hundred children have been born across this country. Children of wealth - and children of none. Children of parents in work - and children of parents out of work. For every single one of those new-born babies let us pledge today that we will build something better. .a land of opportunity. A country built on that enduring principle, seared in our hearts, that if you work hard, save, play by the rules and do your fair share - then nothing should stand in your way. A new economy. A new welfare system. A new set of values in our schools. Not just fixing the mess we inherited - but building something better. We've got a year and a half 'til that election... .a year and a half until Britain makes a choice: move forward to something better or go back to something worse. .but I believe that if this party fights with all we have, then this country will make the right choice. Because we always have before. Whenever we've had the choice of giving in to some shabby compromise or pushing forward to something better we've said: this is Great Britain. .the improbable hero of history. .the country that doesn't give in, that doesn't give up. .that knows there's no such thing as destiny - only our determination to succeed. So I look to our future and I'm confident. There are battles to fight but beyond this hall are the millions of hardworking people who renew the great in Great Britain every day. In the way they work and the way they give and raise their families. These are the people we have alongside us. ...together we've made it this far... ...together we'll finish the job we've started... ...together we'll build that land of opportunity.

aVI am so proud to stand here today as Prime Minister of four nations in one United Kingdom. I was always clear about why we called that referendum. Duck the fight \u2013 and our union could have been taken apart bit by bit. Take it on \u2013 and we had the chance to settle the question. This Party has always confronted the big issues for the sake of our country. And now\u2026England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland\u2026we are one people in one union and everyone here can be proud of that. And we can all agree, during that campaign a new star \u2013 a new Conservative star \u2013 was born\u2026someone who\u2019s going to take our message to every corner of Scotland: our very own Ruth Davidson. The lead-up to that referendum was the most nerve-wracking week of my life. But I can tell you the best moment of my year. It was June 6th, the 70th anniversary of D Day. Sam and I were in Bayeux, in France, with my constituent, Patrick Churchill\u2026no relation to the great man \u2013 but a great man himself. Patrick is 91 years old \u2013 and 70 years ago, he was there fighting fascism, helping to liberate that town. I\u2019ll never forget the tears in his eyes as he talked about the comrades he left behind\u2026or the pride they all felt in the job they had done. As we walked along the streets he pointed out where he had driven his tank\u2026and all along the roadside there were French children waving flags \u2013 Union Jacks \u2013 the grandchildren of the people he had liberated. Patrick\u2019s here today with his wife Karin \u2013 and I know, like me, you\u2019ll want to give them the warmest welcome. When people have seen our flag \u2013 in some of the most desperate times in history \u2013 they have known what it stands for. Freedom. Justice. Standing up for what is right. They have known this isn\u2019t any old country. This is a special country. June 6th this summer. Normandy. I was so proud of Great Britain that day. And here, today, I want to set out how in this generation, we can build a country whose future we can all be proud of. How we can secure a better future for all. How we can build a Britain that everyone is proud to call home. The heirs to those who fought on the beaches of Northern France are those fighting in Afghanistan today. For thirteen years, young men and women have been serving our country there. This year, the last of our combat troops come home \u2013 and I know everyone here will want to show how grateful and how proud we are of everyone who served. But the end of the Afghan mission does not mean the end of the threat. The threat is Islamist extremist terrorism \u2013 and it has found a new, hellish crucible \u2013 with ISIL, in Iraq and Syria. These people are evil, pure and simple. They kill children; rape women; threaten non-believers with genocide; behead journalists and aid workers. Some people seem to think we can opt out of this. We can\u2019t. As I speak, British servicemen and women are flying in the skies over Iraq. They saw action yesterday. And there will be troops on the frontline \u2013 but they will be Iraqis, Kurds, and Syrians\u2026fighting for the safe and democratic future they deserve. We are acting in partnership with a range of countries \u2013 including those from the region. Because let\u2019s be clear: There is no \u201cwalk on by\u201d option. Unless we deal with ISIL, they will deal with us, bringing terror and murder to our streets. As always with this Party, we will do whatever it takes to keep our country safe. And to those who have had all the advantages of being brought up in Britain, but who want to go and fight for ISIL \u2013 let me say this. If you try to travel to Syria or Iraq, we will use everything at our disposal to stop you: Taking away your passport; prosecuting, convicting, imprisoning you\u2026and if you\u2019re there already \u2013 even preventing you from coming back. You have declared your allegiance. You are an enemy of the UK \u2013 and you should expect to be treated as such. When it comes to keeping Britain safe, I had one man by my side for four years. When he was a teenager, he didn\u2019t only address the Tory party conference\u2026he read Hansard in bed\u2026and had a record collection consisting of one album by Dire Straits and dozens of speeches by Winston Churchill. All I can say is this: that boy became a fine Parliamentarian\u2026a brilliant Foreign Secretary\u2026our greatest living Yorkshireman\u2026and someone to whom I owe an enormous debt of gratitude: William Hague. William, there\u2019s one more task I want you to carry out: bringing fairness to our constitution. During that referendum campaign we made a vow to the Scottish people that they will get more powers \u2013 and we will keep that vow. But here\u2019s my vow to the people of England, Wales and Northern Ireland. I know the system is unfair. I know that you are asking: if Scotland can vote separately on things like tax, spending and welfare\u2026.why can\u2019t England, Wales and Northern Ireland do the same? I know you want this answered. So this is my vow: English votes for English laws \u2013 the Conservatives will deliver it. We\u2019ve delivered a lot these past four years\u2026but we\u2019ve had to do it all in a coalition government. Believe me: coalition was not what I wanted to do; it\u2019s what I had to do. And I know what I want next. To be back here in October 2015 delivering Conservative policies\u2026based on Conservative values\u2026leading a majority Conservative Government. So where do we want to take our country? Where do I want to take our country? During these four years, I hope that the British people have come to know me a little. I\u2019m not a complicated man. I believe in some simple things. Families come first. They are the way you make a nation strong from the inside out. I care deeply about those who struggle to get by\u2026but I believe the best thing to do is help them stand on their own two feet \u2013 and no, that\u2019s not saying \u201cyou\u2019re on your own\u201d, but \u201cwe are on your side, helping you be all you can.\u201d And I believe in something for something; not something for nothing. Those who do the right thing, put the effort in, who work and build communities \u2013 these are the people who should be rewarded. All of this is underpinned by a deep patriotism. I love this country \u2013 and my goal is this: To make Britain a country that everyone is proud to call home. That doesn\u2019t just mean having the fastest-growing economy, or climbing some international league table. I didn\u2019t come into politics to make the lines on the graphs go in the right direction. I want to help you live a better life. And it comes back to those things I believe. A Britain that everyone is proud to call home is a Britain where hard work is really rewarded. Not a free-for-all, but a chance for all\u2026the chance of a job, a home, a good start in life\u2026whoever you are, wherever you are from. And by the way \u2013 you never pull one person up by pulling another one down. So this Party doesn\u2019t do the politics of envy and class warfare\u2026we believe in aspiration and helping people get on in life \u2013 and what\u2019s more, we\u2019re proud of it. The past four years have been about laying the foundations for that Britain. The next five will be about finishing the job. Put another way \u2013 if our economic plan for the past four years has been about our country \u2013 and saving it from economic ruin\u2026our plan for the next five years will be about you, and your family \u2013 and helping you get on. But Conservatives know this. Nothing comes easy. There\u2019s no reward without effort; no wealth without work; no success without sacrifice\u2026and we credit the British people with knowing these things too. Other parties preach to you about a Brave New World\u2026we understand you have to start with the real world and make it better. So let other politicians stand on stages like this and promise an easy life. Not me. I am here today to set out our Conservative commitment for the next five years. If you want to provide for yourself and your family, you\u2019ll have the security of a job\u2026but only if we stick to our long-term economic plan. If you work hard, we will cut your taxes\u2026but only if we keep on cutting the deficit, so we can afford to do that. For those wanting to buy a home, yes \u2013 we will help you get on that housing ladder\u2026but only if we take on the vested interests, and build more homes \u2013 however hard that is. We will make sure your children get a great education; the best education\u2026but only if we keep taking on everyone who gets in the way of high standards. For those retiring, we will make sure you get a decent pension; and real rewards for a life of work\u2026but only if we as a country accept we all have to work a bit longer and save a bit more. It\u2019s pretty simple really: a good job, a nice home, more money at the end of the month, a decent education for your children, a safe and secure retirement. A country where if you put in, you get out. A Britain everyone is proud to call home. And a real long-term plan to get there. It starts with more decent jobs. And look how far we\u2019ve come. Today there are 1 million 800 thousand more jobs in our country than there were in 2010. We are creating more jobs here in Britain than in the whole of Europe put together. 1.8 million jobs. You know \u2013 when Britain is getting back to work, it can only mean one thing\u2026the Conservatives are back in Government. So here\u2019s our commitment for the next five years. What the economists would call: the highest employment rate of any major economy. What I call: full employment in Britain. Just think of what that would mean. Those who can work, able to work\u2026standing on their own two feet, looking at their children and thinking \u201cI am providing for you.\u201d We can get there \u2013 but only if we stick to our plan. Companies are coming from all over the world to invest and create jobs here. That\u2019s not happened by accident. It\u2019s because they see a Government rolling out the red carpet for them, cutting their red tape, cutting their taxes. So here is a commitment: with the next Conservative Government \u2013 we will always have the most competitive corporate taxes in the G20\u2026lower than Germany, lower than Japan, lower than the United States. But George said something really important in that brilliant speech on Monday. A message to those global companies: We have cut your taxes \u2013 now you must pay what you owe. We must stick to the plan on welfare too. With us, if you\u2019re out of work, you will get unemployment benefit\u2026but only if you go to the Job Centre, update your CV, attend interviews and accept the work you\u2019re offered. As I said: no more something-for-nothing. And look at the results: 800,000 fewer people on the main out-of-work benefits. In the next five years we\u2019re going to go further. You heard it this week \u2013 we won\u2019t just aim to lower youth unemployment; we aim to abolish it. We\u2019ve made clear decisions. We will reduce the benefits cap, and we will say to those 21 and under: no longer will you have the option of leaving school and going straight into a life on benefits. You must earn or learn. And we will help by funding three million Apprenticeships. Let\u2019s say to our young people: a life on welfare is no life at all\u2026instead: here\u2019s some hope; here\u2019s a chance to get on and make something of yourself. What do our opponents have to say? They have opposed every change to welfare we\u2019ve made \u2013 and I expect they\u2019ll oppose this too. They sit there pontificating about poverty \u2013 yet they\u2019re the ones who left a generation to rot on welfare. And while we\u2019re at it: let\u2019s compare records. Under Labour, unemployment rose. With us, unemployment is falling faster than at any time for 25 years. Under Labour, inequality widened. With us, it\u2019s narrowed. Those are the facts. So let\u2019s say it loudly and proudly\u2026with Britain getting off welfare and back to work\u2026the real party of compassion and social justice today is here in this hall \u2013 the Conservative Party. It\u2019s not just the job numbers that matter \u2013 it is the reality of working life for people in our country\u2026especially the lowest-paid. Anyone should be free to take on different jobs so they can get on. But when companies employ staff on zero hours contracts and then stop them from getting work elsewhere, that\u2019s not a free market \u2013 it is a fixed market. In a Britain that everyone is proud to call home, people are employed, they are not used. Those exclusive zero hours contracts that left people unable to build decent lives for themselves \u2013 we will scrap them. But there\u2019s still more injustice when it comes to work, and it\u2019s even more shocking. Criminal gangs trafficking people halfway around the world and making them work in the most disgusting conditions. I\u2019ve been to see these \u2013 houses on terraced streets, built for families of four, cramming in 15 people like animals. To those crime lords who think they can get away with it, I say No: not in this country; not with this party\u2026with our Modern Slavery Bill we\u2019re coming after you and we\u2019re going to put a stop to it once and for all. Once you have a job, I want you to take home more of your own money. If you put in, you should get out \u2013 not hand so much of it to the taxman. That\u2019s why these past four years, despite everything, I\u2019ve made sure we provide some relief to taxpayers in our country \u2013 especially the poorest. No income tax until you earn £10,000 a year \u2013 and from next April, £10,500 a year. Three million people taken out of income tax altogether. A tax cut for 25 million more. And our commitment to you for the next five years: we want to cut more of your taxes. But we can only do that if we keep on cutting the deficit. It\u2019s common sense \u2013 tax cuts need to be paid for. So here\u2019s our plan. We are going to balance the books by 2018, and start putting aside money for the future. To do it we\u2019ll need to find £25 billion worth of savings in the first two years of the next Parliament. That\u2019s a lot of money, but it\u2019s doable. £25 billion is actually just three per cent of what government spends each year. It is a quarter of the savings we have found in this Parliament. I am confident we will find the savings we need through spending cuts alone. We will see the job through and get back into the black. And as we do that, I am clear about something else. We need tax cuts for hardworking people. And here and now, I have a specific commitment. Today, the minimum wage reaches £6.50 an hour, and before long we\u2019ll reach our next goal of £7. I can tell you now that a future Conservative Government will raise the tax-free personal allowance from £10,500 to £12,500. That will take 1 million more of the lowest paid workers out of income tax \u2013 and will give a tax cut to 30 million more. So with us, if you work 30 hours a week on minimum wage, you will pay no income tax at all. Nothing. Zero. Zilch. Lower taxes for our hardworking people\u2026that\u2019s what I call a Britain that everyone is proud to call home. But we will do something else. The 40p tax rate was only supposed to be paid by the most well-off people in our country\u2026but in the past couple of decades, far too many have been dragged into it: teachers, police officers. So let me tell you this today. I want to take action that\u2019s long overdue, and bring back some fairness to tax. With a Conservative government, we will raise the threshold at which people pay the 40p rate. It\u2019s currently £41,900\u2026in the next Parliament we will raise it to £50,000. So here\u2019s our commitment to the British people: No income tax if you are on Minimum Wage. A 12 and a half thousand pound tax-free personal allowance for millions of hardworking people. And you only pay 40p tax when you earn £50,000. So let the message go out: With the Conservatives, if you work hard and do the right thing\u2026we say you should keep more of your own money to spend as you choose. That\u2019s what our long-term economic plan means for you. And while I\u2019m on the subject of the big economic questions our country faces \u2013 on spending, on tax \u2013 did you hear Ed Miliband last week? He spoke for over an hour, but didn\u2019t mention the deficit once. Not once. He said he \u2018forgot\u2019 to mention it. Ed \u2013 people forget their car keys, school kids sometimes forget their homework\u2026but if you want to be Prime Minister of this country, you cannot forget the biggest challenge we face. A few weeks ago, Ed Balls said that in thirteen years of Government, Labour had made \u2018some mistakes\u2019. \u2018Some mistakes\u2019. Excuse me? You were the people who left Britain with the biggest peacetime deficit in history\u2026who gave us the deepest recession since the war\u2026who destroyed our pensions system, bust our banking system\u2026who left a million young people out of work, five million on out-of-work benefits \u2013 and hundreds of billions of debt. Some mistakes? Labour were just one big mistake. And five years on, they still want to spend more, borrow more, tax more. It\u2019s the same old Labour, and you know what? They say that madness is doing the same thing over and over again but expecting different results. Well I say: madness is voting for this high spending, high taxing, deficit ballooning shower and expecting anything other than economic disaster. In a country that everyone is proud to call home, you should be able to buy a home \u2013 if you\u2019re willing to save. It shouldn\u2019t be some impossible dream. But we inherited a situation where it was. Young people watched Location, Location, Location not as a reality show \u2013 but as fantasy. We couldn\u2019t solve this housing crisis without some difficult decisions. The planning system was stuck in the mud \u2013 so we reformed it\u2026and last year, nearly a quarter of a million houses were given planning permission. Young people needed massive deposits they just couldn\u2019t afford\u2026so we brought in Help to Buy. Of course there were those who criticised it\u2026usually speaking from the comfort of the home they\u2019d bought years ago. But let\u2019s see what actually happened. They said Help to Buy would just help people in London\u2026but 94 per cent of buyers live outside the capital. They said it would help people with houses already\u2026but four-fifths are first-time buyers. They said it would cause a housing bubble\u2026but as the Bank of England has said, it hasn\u2019t. So here\u2019s our renewed commitment to first-time buyers: if you\u2019re prepared to work and save, we will help you get a place of your own. This conference we have announced a landmark new policy. It\u2019s called Starter Homes. We\u2019re going to build 100,000 new homes \u2013 and they\u2019ll be twenty percent cheaper than normal. But here\u2019s the crucial part. Buy-to-let landlords won\u2019t be able to snap them up.Wealthy foreigners won\u2019t be able to buy them. Just first-time buyers under the age of 40. Homes built for you, homes made for you \u2013 the Conservative Party, once again, the party of home ownership in our country. In a Britain that everyone is proud to call home, you wouldn\u2019t be able to tell a child\u2019s GCSEs by their postcode or what their parents do. There must be a great education for every child. A month ago I had this wonderful moment. Florence is now 4 and just starting school, so for the first time, all three of my children are at the same primary school. It was such a joy to take them to school together; Florence clinging on for dear life until she saw a new friend and rushed off to her classroom. It\u2019s hard to describe what a relief it is as a parent to find a decent school for your child. It shouldn\u2019t be a lottery. What we have in our state primary in London I want for every child in the country. And we\u2019re getting there. More children in good or outstanding schools. More children studying science, languages and history. A new curriculum \u2013 with five year olds learning fractions; eleven years olds coding computers. And the biggest change is the culture. Teachers who feel like leaders again. Who say: this is our school, we\u2019re proud of it, the children must behave in it, we will not tolerate failure in it. We\u2019ve come so far \u2013 and make no mistake \u2013 the biggest risk to all this is Labour. You know what drives me the most mad about them? The hypocrisy. Tristram Hunt, their Shadow Education Secretary \u2013 like me \u2013 had one of the best educations money can buy. But guess what? He won\u2019t allow it for your children. He went to an independent school that wasn\u2019t set up by a local authority\u2026but no, he doesn\u2019t want charities and parents to set up schools for your children. He had the benefit of world-class teachers who happened not to have a government certificate\u2026but no, he wants to stop people like that from teaching your children. I tell you \u2013 Tristram Hunt and I might both have been educated at some of the best schools in our country. But here\u2019s the difference: You, Tristram \u2013 like the rest of the Labour Party \u2013 want to restrict those advantages\u2026I want to spread them to every child in Britain. We know Labour\u2019s real problem on education. Every move they make, they\u2019ve got to take their cue from the unions. That\u2019s who they really represent. The unions. Well, I\u2019ve got a bit of news for you. It\u2019s not something we\u2019ve ever said before. We in this party are a trade union too. I\u2019ll tell you who we represent. This party is the union for hardworking parents\u2026the father who reads his children stories at night because he wants them to learn\u2026the mother who works all the hours God sends to give her children the best start. This party is the trade union for children from the poorest estates and the most chaotic homes. This party is the union for the young woman who wants an Apprenticeship\u2026or the teenagers who want to make something of their lives\u2026this is who we represent, these are the people we\u2019re fighting for\u2026and that\u2019s why on education we won\u2019t let Labour drag us back to square one \u2013 we\u2019re going to finish what we have begun. A real education isn\u2019t just about exams. Our young people must know this is a country where if you put in, you will get out. Now I\u2019ve got in trouble for talking about Twitter before, but let me put it like this. I want a country where young people aren\u2019t endlessly thinking: \u2018what can I say in 140 characters?\u2019 but \u2018what does my character say about me?\u2019 That\u2019s why I\u2019m so proud of National Citizen Service. Every summer, thousands of young people are coming together to volunteer and serve their community. We started this. People come up to me on the street and say all sorts of things\u2026believe me \u2013 all sorts of things\u2026but one thing I hear a lot is parents saying \u201cthank you for what this has done for my child.\u201d I want this to become a rite of passage for all teenagers in our country. So I can tell you this: the next Conservative Government will guarantee a place on National Citizen Service for every teenager in our country. That rule: that if you put in, you should get out\u2026more than anywhere it should apply to those who want dignity and security in retirement. But for years it didn\u2019t. There were three great wrongs. Wrong number one: the Pension Credit that was basically a means test \u2013 the more you saved, the less you got. Wrong number two: compulsory annuities that meant you couldn\u2019t spend your own money as you wished. Wrong number three: when people passed away, the pension they had saved was taxed at 55 per cent before it went to their family. Three wrongs \u2013 and we are putting them right. The means test \u2013 it\u2019s going. In its place: a new single-tier pension of £142 a week\u2026every penny you have saved during your working life, you will keep. Those compulsory annuities \u2013 scrapped\u2026giving you complete control over your private pension. As for that 55 per cent tax on your pension? You heard it this week: we\u2019ve cut it to zero per cent. Conservative values in action. When it comes to our elderly, one thing matters above everything. Knowing the NHS is there for you. From Labour last week, we heard the same old rubbish about the Conservatives and the NHS. Spreading complete and utter lies. I just think: how dare you. It was the Labour Party who gave us the scandal at Mid Staffs\u2026elderly people begging for water and dying of neglect. And for me, this is personal. I am someone who has relied on the NHS \u2013 whose family knows more than most how important it is\u2026who knows what it\u2019s like to go to hospital night after night with a child in your arms\u2026knowing that when you get there, you have people who will care for that child and love that child like their own. How dare they suggest I would ever put that at risk for other people\u2019s children?\u2026how dare they frighten those who are relying on the NHS right now? It might be the only thing that gets a cheer at their Party conference but it is frankly pathetic. We in this party can be proud of what we\u2019ve done. We came in and protected the NHS budget. Funding six and a half thousand more doctors \u2013 3300 more nurses\u2026a Cancer Drugs Fund to save lives\u2026more people hearing those two magic words: \u201call clear\u201d. And think of the amazing things around the corner. From the country that unravelled DNA, we are now mapping it for each individual\u2026it\u2019s called the genome, and I\u2019ve got a model of one of the first ones on my desk in Downing Street. Cracking this code could mean curing rare genetic diseases and saving lives. Our NHS is leading the world on this incredible technology. I understand very personally the difference it could make. When you have a child who\u2019s so ill and the doctors can\u2019t work out what he\u2019s got or why \u2013 you\u2019d give anything to know. The investment we\u2019re making will mean that more parents have those answers \u2013 and hopefully the cures that go with them. And let\u2019s be clear: all this is only possible because we have managed our economy responsibly. That is why I can tell you this: we will do it again. The next Conservative Government will protect the NHS budget and continue to invest more. Because we know this truth\u2026something Labour will never understand \u2013 and we will never forget\u2026you can only have a strong NHS if you have a strong economy. A Britain that everyone is proud to call home. A place where reward follows effort; where if you put in, you get out. But it also means a country that is strong in the world \u2013 in control of its own destiny\u2026and yes \u2013 that includes controlling immigration. To me, this is about working on all fronts. It\u2019s about getting our own people fit to work. Fixing welfare \u2013 so a life on the dole is not an option. Fixing education \u2013 so we turn out young people with skills to do the jobs we are creating. And yes \u2013 we need controlled borders and an immigration system that puts the British people first. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve capped economic migration from outside the EU\u2026shut down 700 bogus colleges \u2013 that were basically visa factories\u2026kicked out people who don\u2019t belong here, like Abu Qatada\u2026and let\u2019s hear it for the woman who made it happen: our crime-busting Home Secretary, Theresa May. But we know the bigger issue today is migration from within the EU. Immediate access to our welfare system. Paying benefits to families back home. Employment agencies signing people up from overseas and not recruiting here. Numbers that have increased faster than we in this country wanted\u2026at a level that was too much for our communities, for our labour markets. All of this has to change \u2013 and it will be at the very heart of my renegotiation strategy for Europe. Britain, I know you want this sorted so I will go to Brussels, I will not take no for an answer and when it comes to free movement \u2013 I will get what Britain needs. Anyone who thinks I can\u2019t or won\u2019t deliver this \u2013 judge me by my record. I\u2019m the first Prime Minister to veto a Treaty\u2026the first Prime Minister to cut the European budget\u2026and yes I pulled us out of those European bail-out schemes as well. Around that table in Europe they know I say what I mean, and mean what I say. So we\u2019re going to go in as a country, get our powers back, fight for our national interest\u2026and yes \u2013 we\u2019ll put it to a referendum\u2026in or out \u2013 it will be your choice\u2026and let the message go out from this hall: it is only with a Conservative Government that you will get that choice. Of course, it\u2019s not just the European Union that needs sorting out \u2013 it\u2019s the European Court of Human Rights. When that charter was written, in the aftermath of the Second World War, it set out the basic rights we should respect. But since then, interpretations of that charter have led to a whole lot of things that are frankly wrong. Rulings to stop us deporting suspected terrorists. The suggestion that you\u2019ve got to apply the human rights convention even on the battle-fields of Helmand. And now \u2013 they want to give prisoners the vote. I\u2019m sorry, I just don\u2019t agree. Our Parliament \u2013 the British Parliament \u2013 decided they shouldn\u2019t have that right. This is the country that wrote Magna Carta\u2026the country that time and again has stood up for human rights\u2026whether liberating Europe from fascism or leading the charge today against sexual violence in war. Let me put this very clearly: We do not require instruction on this from judges in Strasbourg. So at long last, with a Conservative Government after the next election, this country will have a new British Bill of Rights\u2026to be passed in our Parliament\u2026rooted in our values\u2026and as for Labour\u2019s Human Rights Act? We will scrap it, once and for all. So that\u2019s what we offer: a Britain that everyone is proud to call home. And a very clear plan to get there. Over the next five years we will deliver the following things: 3 million Apprenticeships. Full employment. The most competitive corporate taxes in the G20. Eliminating the budget deficit through spending cuts, not tax rises. Building 100,000 new Starter Homes. Letting you pass on your pension tax-free. Ring-fencing NHS spending so not a penny is cut. Renegotiating in Europe. Delivering that in-out referendum. Scrapping the Human Rights Act. No income tax until you earn £12,500. No 40p tax rate until you earn £50,000. If you want those things, vote for me. If you don\u2019t, vote for the other guy. And let\u2019s be clear. This is a straight fight. It doesn\u2019t matter whether Parliament is hung, drawn or quartered, there is only one real choice. The Conservatives or Labour. Me in Downing Street, or Ed Miliband in Downing Street. If you vote UKIP \u2013 that\u2019s really a vote for Labour. Here\u2019s a thought\u2026on 7th May you could go to bed with Nigel Farage, and wake up with Ed Miliband. So this is the big question for that election. On the things that matter in your life, who do you really trust? When it comes to your job\u2026do you trust Labour \u2013 who wrecked our economy \u2013 or the Conservatives, who have made this one of the fastest-growing economies in the West? When it comes to Britain\u2019s future, who do you trust? Labour \u2013 the party of something-for-nothing, and human wrongs under the banner of human rights\u2026or the Conservatives \u2013 who believe in something for something, and reward for hard work? Who do you trust?\u2026the party of big debt; big spending, big borrowing\u2026or the party \u2013 our Party \u2013 of the first pay cheque, the first chance, the first home\u2026the one that is delivering more security, more opportunity, more hope \u2026the one that is making this country great again\u2026yes, our party, the Conservative Party. We\u2019re making Britain proud again. Look what we are showing the world. Not just a country that is paying down its debts\u2026and going from the deepest recession since the war to the fastest-growing major advanced economy in the world\u2026but at the same time: a country that has kept its promises to the poorest in the world\u2026that is leading not following on climate change\u2026and that\u2019s just saved our union in one of the greatest shows of democracy the world has ever seen. We\u2019re making Britain proud again. Our exports to China doubling\u2026our car industry booming\u2026our aerospace expanding\u2026our manufacturing growing\u2026 we\u2019re making Britain proud again. Car engines \u2013 not imported from Germany, but built down the road in Wolverhampton. New oil rigs \u2013 not made in China, but built on the Tyne. Record levels of employment\u2026record numbers of apprenticeships\u2026Britain regaining its purpose, its pride and its confidence. We\u2019re at a moment where all the hard work is finally paying off\u2026and the light is coming up after some long dark days. Go back now and we\u2019ll lose all we\u2019ve done\u2026falling back into the shadows when we could be striding into the sun. That\u2019s the question next May. Do you want to go back to square one \u2013 or finish what we\u2019ve begun? I don\u2019t claim to be a perfect leader. But I am your public servant, standing here, wanting to make our country so much better \u2013 for your children and mine. I love this country, and I will do my duty by it. We\u2019ve got the track record, the right team\u2026to take this plan for our country and turn it into a plan for you. I think of the millions of people going out to work, wiping the ice off the windscreen on a winter\u2019s morning\u2026raising their children as well they can, working as hard as they can\u2026doing it for a better future, to make a good life for them and their families. That is the British spirit \u2013 there in our ordinary days as well as our finest hours. This is a great country and we can be greater still. Because history is not written for us, but by us, in the decisions we make today\u2026 and that starts next May. So Britain: what\u2019s it going to be? I say: let\u2019s not go back to square one. Let\u2019s finish what we have begun. Let\u2019s build a Britain we are proud to call home\u2026for you, for your family, for everyone.

aVI am so proud to be standing here in front of you today \u2013 back in government\u2026 \u2026and not just any government \u2013 a majority Conservative Government. To the people in this hall, I want to say thank you. You are the greatest team a Prime Minister could ever have. And to the British people: When you put your cross in the Conservative box, you were putting your faith in us. To finish the job we started. To back working people. To deliver security for you and your family. And I\u2019ll tell you now: we will not let you down. But just for a moment, think back to May 7th. I don\u2019t know about you, but it only takes two words to make me smile. Exit poll. And then what happened that night: The Conservatives, winning across Wales; on the march in the Midlands. Bolton West, Derby North, Berwick, Wells \u2013 Conservative once more\u2026 \u2026Gower for the first time ever. The North, more Tory; the South, the East, almost a clean sweep\u2026 \u2026and Cornwall \u2013 that wonderful county \u2013 100 per cent Conservative. As dawn rose, a new light \u2013 a bluer light \u2013 fell across our isles. And I will never forget that morning. Getting back to London. Seeing many of you. Then sitting down in the flat at No10 with Sam and the kids getting ready for school. There we were, surrounded by half-packed boxes and bin bags. Well, you have to be ready for anything. I was writing my speech and preparing to go and see Her Majesty. And I thought\u2026 I\u2019ll just lie down and let it all sink in. As I shut my eyes, Ed Balls had gone. And when I woke up and I switched on the radio, Nigel Farage had gone too. There was a brief moment when I thought it was all a dream. But there\u2019s a serious point. Why did all the pollsters and the pundits get it so wrong? Because, fundamentally, they didn\u2019t understand the people who make up our country. The vast majority of people aren\u2019t obsessives, arguing at the extremes of the debate. Let me put it as simply as I can: Britain and Twitter are not the same thing. The British people are decent, sensible, reasonable\u2026 \u2026and they just want a government that supports the vulnerable, backs those who do the right thing and helps them get on in life. Good jobs; a decent home; better childcare; controlled immigration; lower taxes so there\u2019s more money at the end of the month\u2026 \u2026an NHS that\u2019s there for them, 7 days a week; great schools; dignity in retirement\u2026 \u2026that is what people want and that is what we will deliver. The party of working people, the party for working people \u2013 today, tomorrow, always. PARTY CHANGE Ten years ago, I stood on a stage just like this one and said if we changed our party we could change our country. We\u2019ve done that \u2013 together. I didn\u2019t campaign on the NHS alone \u2013 you joined me. It wasn\u2019t just me who put social justice, equality for gay people, tackling climate change, and helping the world\u2019s poorest at the centre of the Conservative Party\u2019s mission \u2013 we all did. And I didn\u2019t select our candidates \u2013 it was you. Look who was elected in May. Nusrat Ghani, whose parents, just a generation ago, were living in a small village in Kashmir. Seema Kennedy, who was five when she and her family were forced to flee revolutionary Iran. Five years ago, Johnny Mercer was on his third tour of duty in Afghanistan. Caught in an ambush, he was left cradling a dear comrade as he lay fatally wounded. Just days before the election, Scott Mann was doing his postal round in Cornwall \u2013 delivering not just his own campaign leaflets, but his rivals\u2019 too. Different journeys, often difficult journeys, all leading here. So let us hear it for them now \u2013 the new generation of Conservative MPs. Round the cabinet table, a third of my colleagues are women. A few months ago, we were discussing childcare. It was introduced by the Black British son of a single parent, Sam Gyimah. He was backed up by the daughter of Gujarati immigrants who arrived in our country from East Africa with nothing except the clothes they stood up in, Priti Patel\u2026 \u2026and the first speaker was Sajid Javid, whose father came here from Pakistan to drive the buses. This is what we\u2019ve done together. And now with couples married because of us\u2026 \u2026working people backed because of us\u2026 \u2026the NHS safe because of us\u2026 \u2026and children in the poorest parts of the world saved because of us\u2026 \u2026everyone in this hall can be incredibly proud of our journey \u2013 the journey of the modern, compassionate, One Nation Conservative Party. GREATER BRITAIN So as five years of government stretch out before us, what do I see on the skyline? I love Britain. I love our history and what we\u2019ve given to the world. I love our get-up-and-go; that whenever we\u2019re down, we\u2019re never out. I love our character; our decency; our sense of humour. I love every part of our country. England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland \u2013 we are one nation and I will defend our Union with everything I have got. Every day, in every way, Great Britain lives up to its name. And I know this: we can make it greater still. A Greater Britain. Where people have greater hope, greater chances, greater security. I really believe we\u2019re on the brink of something special in our country. This year, we\u2019ve seen more people in work than at any time in our history\u2026 \u2026more of our children starting university than ever before\u2026 \u2026more British entrepreneurs setting up shop than anywhere else in Europe. Wages are rising. Hope is returning. We\u2019re moving into the light. But we\u2019re not there yet. We\u2019re only half way through. For me, that has a very literal meaning. I can say something today that perhaps no Prime Minister has ever really been able to say before. I\u2019m starting the second half of my time in this job. As you know, I am not going to fight another election as your leader. So I don\u2019t have the luxury of unlimited time. Let me tell you: I am in just as much of a hurry as five years ago. Securing our country, growing our economy; jobs, exports, growth, infrastructure\u2026 \u2026these are the stepping stones on the path to greatness for our country \u2013 and we\u2019ve been laying them every day since we came to office. We will continue to do so. But to make Britain greater, we need to tackle some deep social problems\u2026 \u2026problems we only just made a start on, as we focused on the economic emergency that faced us. The scourge of poverty. The brick wall of blocked opportunity. The shadow of extremism \u2013 hanging over every single one of us. A Greater Britain doesn\u2019t just need a stronger economy \u2013 it needs a stronger society. And delivering this social reform is entirely fitting with the great history of the Conservative Party\u2026 \u2026who have always been the optimists, the agents of hope and the leaders of change. That\u2019s why I joined it. That\u2019s why I wanted to lead it. And now, in my final term as Prime Minister, I say: let\u2019s live up to the greatest traditions of Conservative social reform. CONSERVATIVE VALUES In all the challenges we face, we will be guided by our Conservative values. Our belief in strong defence and sound money. Our belief in an enterprise economy\u2026 \u2026that if you set free the ambition that burns so deeply within the British people, they will strike out on their own, take on new workers, take on the world. Our belief in equality of opportunity, as opposed to equality of outcome\u2026 \u2026not everyone ending up with the same exam results, the same salary, the same house \u2013 but everyone having the same shot at them. Now some people may argue these things are obvious. I have to tell you, they\u2019re not. It becomes clearer by the day that the Labour Party has completely abandoned any notion of these ideas. So let us resolve here, at this conference, to do what we\u2019ve always done: to prove our Conservative truths\u2026 \u2026to save Britain from the danger of Labour\u2026 \u2026and to rebuild Britain so it is greater still. A Greater Britain \u2013 that is our goal. NATIONAL SECURITY It begins by making the case for strong defence. My first duty as Prime Minister is to keep people safe. Some of the loneliest moments in this job are when you are reading intelligence reports about plots being planned against the British people. This summer I was told that Reyaad Khan and Junaid Hussain were in Syria planning terrorist attacks on UK soil. Of course, I asked all the proper questions. How do we stop them? Is there another way? Do we have that capability? Is it legal? I knew that whatever action I took would provoke a big debate. But my job as Prime Minister is quite simple, really: ultimately, it\u2019s not to debate; it\u2019s to decide. And the choice I faced was this: Act \u2013 and we could stop them carrying out their plans. Stall \u2013 and we could see innocent people murdered on our streets. So I took decisive action to keep Britain safe \u2013 and that\u2019s what I will always do. LABOUR LEADER And on the subject of protecting our country from terrorism, let me just say this: Thousands of words have been written about the new Labour leader. But you only really need to know one thing: he thinks the death of Osama bin Laden was a \u201ctragedy\u201d. No. A tragedy is nearly 3,000 people murdered one morning in New York. A tragedy is the mums and dads who never came home from work that day. A tragedy is people jumping from the towers after the planes hit. My friends \u2013 we cannot let that man inflict his security-threatening, terrorist-sympathising, Britain-hating ideology on the country we love. MIGRATION Another big judgment call to make is when a refugee crisis confronts our world. Like most people, I found it impossible to get the image of that poor Syrian boy Aylan Kurdi out of my mind. We know in our hearts our responsibilities to help those fleeing for their lives. But we know, too, that we must keep our heads. Let\u2019s start with a simple fact. Twelve million people have been made homeless by the conflict in Syria. And so far only 4 per cent of them have come to Europe. If we opened the door to every refugee, our country would be overwhelmed. The best thing Britain can do is help neighbouring countries, the Syrian people and the refugees in the camps \u2026 \u2026and when we do take refugees, to take them from the region, rather than acting in a way that encourages more to make that dangerous journey. As we do this, let\u2019s remember: we haven\u2019t only just started caring about Syrians. We\u2019ve been helping them over the past four years, giving more in aid to that part of the world than any other country except America. And we have been able to do that because this party made a promise and kept a promise \u2013 to spend 0.7 per cent of our national income on aid. Other countries also made that promise. But they didn\u2019t keep it.I say to them: if Britain can keep her promises, so should you. But the real answer to the refugee crisis lies in helping countries like Syria become places where people actually want to live. That means having a government that\u2019s not terrorising its people \u2013 and that\u2019s why Assad must go. In its place, we need a government that can be our ally in the defeat of ISIL\u2026 \u2026because we will never be safe here in Britain until we eradicate that death cult. Some think we can contract that out to America. We shouldn\u2019t. We must play our part too. And we can, because of that commitment we made this summer: yes, we will spend two per cent of our GDP on defence \u2013 this year, next year, throughout this decade. In the coming years, we\u2019ll be launching the biggest aircraft carriers in our history\u2026 \u2026a new class of Hunter Killer submarines\u2026 \u2026new Joint Strike Fighter jets; improved Apache helicopters; a new fleet of drones\u2026 \u2026and because our independent nuclear deterrent is our ultimate insurance policy \u2013 this Government will order four new trident submarines. In government, I have a team who keep us safe at home and abroad\u2026 \u2026Justine Greening, Michael Fallon, Philip Hammond and Theresa May. But above all, we have Britain\u2019s Armed Forces. Let me tell you this: In the last year alone they tackled Ebola in West Africa; protected the skies over the Baltic; flew missions over Iraq. They built defences against ISIL in Lebanon; trained army officers in Afghanistan; and patrolled the seas around the Falklands. There they were, in the Pacific, flying supplies to cyclone victims; in the Atlantic, shipping assistance to those hit by hurricanes; in the Med, pulling people out of sinking dinghies. Little England? No. Never. Great Britain. And I\u2019ll tell you what, with Armed Forces like this, we can be even greater still. So let\u2019s stand and thank them for everything they do to keep us safe. EUROPE A Greater Britain is one that is strong in the world \u2013 and that should mean one that is strong in Europe, too. It comes back to those Conservative values: our belief in the nation state, but also in free trade. We all know what\u2019s wrong with the EU \u2013 it\u2019s got too big, too bossy, too interfering. But we also know what\u2019s right about it \u2013 it\u2019s the biggest single market in the world. Now, some people say: \u201ctake what we\u2019ve got and put up with it\u201d. Others say: \u201cjust walk away from the whole thing\u201d. I say: no. This is Britain. We don\u2019t duck fights. We get stuck in. We fix problems. That\u2019s how we kept our border checkpoints when others decided to take theirs down. It\u2019s how we kept the pound when others went head first into the Euro. Because we do things our way. We get rebates. We get out of bailouts. But do you know what? It\u2019s not just what we get out of, it\u2019s what we get Europe into. Who do you think got Europe to open trade talks with America, which would be the biggest trade deal in our history? Who do you think got Europe to agree to sanctions on Iran, which brought that country to the negotiating table? Us. Britain. We did. Believe me, I have no romantic attachment to the European Union and its institutions. I\u2019m only interested in two things: Britain\u2019s prosperity and Britain\u2019s influence. That\u2019s why I\u2019m going to fight hard in this renegotiation \u2013 so we can get a better deal and the best of both worlds. Let me give you one example. When we joined the European Union we were told that it was about going into a common market, rather than the goal that some had for \u201cever closer union\u201d. Let me put this very clearly: Britain is not interested in \u201cever closer union\u201d \u2013 and I will put that right. ECONOMIC SECURITY A Greater Britain needs a dynamic economy. Today, it\u2019s a beacon in an uncertain world\u2026 \u2026we\u2019ve got more foreign investment flooding into our country than anywhere else in Europe \u2013 anywhere in the world except for America and China. But if anyone thinks the battle on the economy is won, they need to think again. The battle has only just begun. We still need to find savings and produce more; still need to become more competitive; still need to make the most of our entire country \u2013 and build the Northern Powerhouse. And all at a time when our opponents have given up any sensible, reasonable, rational arguments on the economy. We live in a country where the main opposition party \u2013 let\u2019s not forget, the alternative government \u2013 believes in nationalising industries without compensation, jacking up taxes to 60 per cent of people\u2019s income, and printing money. There\u2019s an academic called Richard Murphy. He\u2019s the Labour Party\u2019s new economics guru, and the man behind their plan to print more money. He gave an interview a few weeks ago. He was very frank. He admitted that Labour\u2019s plan would cause a \u201csterling crisis\u201d, but to be fair\u2026 \u2026he did add, and I quote, that it \u201cwould pass very quickly\u201d. Well, that\u2019s alright then. His book is actually called \u201cThe Joy of Tax\u201d. I\u2019ve read it. It\u2019s got 64 positions \u2013 and they\u2019re all wrong. This is actually serious. I tell you: our party\u2019s success in growing our economy and winning the economic arguments has never been more vital. Nothing less than the security of every single family in our country depends on it. And as we do that, I know that we will have on our side not just the British people, not just British business\u2026 \u2026but our Iron Chancellor, George Osborne. You know what makes me most angry about Labour? It\u2019s not just that their arguments are wrong; it\u2019s the self-righteous way they make them. The deficit-deniers, who go around saying we\u2019re hurting the poor. Hang on a second. Who gets hurt when governments lose control of spending and interest rates go through the roof? Who gets hurt when you waste money on debt interest and have to cut the NHS? Who gets hurt when taxes go up and businesses start firing rather than hiring? No \u2013 not the rich\u2026 \u2026it\u2019s poor people, working people. Yes, the very people Labour claim to be for. Well let\u2019s just remember: Labour ideas don\u2019t help the poor, they hurt the poor. That\u2019s right, Labour: you\u2019re not for working people, but hurting people. If you want a lecture about poverty, ask Labour. If you want something done about it, come to us, the Conservatives. There\u2019s another argument we need to win. There are some people who understand the deficit needs to come down, but don\u2019t get why we need a surplus. I\u2019ll tell you why. I don\u2019t stand here like a former Prime Minister once did and say I have abolished boom and bust. We can\u2019t just be thinking about today, we should be thinking about the rainy days that could come \u2013 just like a family does. They put something aside, take out the insurance plan, pay off some of the mortgage when they have something spare. That\u2019s what we should do as a country \u2013 making sure we are ready to cope with future crises. There\u2019s a word for those who say live for today, forget about tomorrow: it\u2019s selfish. I\u2019m not here to mortgage our children\u2019s future. I\u2019m here to insure it. HOME OWNERSHIP But for me, there\u2019s one big piece of unfinished business in our economy: housing. A Greater Britain must mean more families owning a home of their own. It goes back to those Conservative beliefs: reward for hard work. If you\u2019ve worked hard and saved, I don\u2019t want you just to have a roof over your head \u2013 I want you to have a roof of your own. In the last 5 years, 600,000 new homes have been built. More than 150 people a day are moving in thanks to our Help to Buy scheme. And in our manifesto, we announced a breakthrough policy: extending the Right to Buy to housing association tenants. Some people said this would be impossible. Housing associations would never stand for it. The legislation would never pass. Let me tell you something. Greg Clark, our brilliant Communities Secretary, has secured a deal with housing associations to give their tenants the Right to Buy their home. That will mean the first tenants can start to buy their homes from next year. Yes, as we said in our manifesto, 1.3 million to be given the chance to become homeowners. A promise made. A promise kept. But the challenge is far, far bigger. When a generation of hardworking men and women in their 20s and 30s are waking up each morning in their childhood bedrooms \u2013 that should be a wakeup call for us. We need a national crusade to get homes built. That means banks lending, government releasing land, and yes \u2013 planning being reformed. And in all these things I\u2019ll be working with a great London Mayoral candidate \u2013 and, I hope, soon to be our London Mayor \u2013 Zac Goldsmith. But I want to single someone out. He\u2019s served this country. He\u2019s served this party. And there\u2019s a huge amount more to come. So let\u2019s hear it for the man who for two terms has been Mayor of the greatest capital city on earth: Boris Johnson. Increasing home ownership means something else. For years, politicians have been talking about building what they call \u201caffordable homes\u201d \u2013 but the phrase was deceptive. It basically meant homes that were only available to rent. What people want are homes they can actually own. After all, the officials who prepare the plans for the new homes, the developers who build them, the politicians who talk about them\u2026 \u2026most of these people own the homes they live in. Don\u2019t they realise other people want what they\u2019ve got \u2013 a home of their own? So today, I can announce a dramatic shift in housing policy in our country. Those old rules which said to developers: you can build on this site, but only if you build affordable homes for rent\u2026 \u2026we\u2019re replacing them with new rules\u2026 \u2026you can build here, and those affordable homes can be available to buy. Yes, from Generation Rent to Generation Buy\u2026 \u2026our party, the Conservative party\u2026 \u2026the party of home ownership in Britain today. SOCIAL REFORM A more prosperous Britain. But we must not stop there as we build a Greater Britain. We are not a one-trick party. For us, economic success \u2013 that\u2019s not the finished article. It\u2019s the foundation on which we can build a better society. Our patriotism has never been simply some grand notion of ruling the waves, or riding high in the money markets\u2026 \u2026but a deep compulsion which says: \u201cyou make a country greater by making life better for its people.\u201d And today, that means entering those no-go zones, where politicians often don\u2019t dare to venture. It means taking on our big social problems\u2026 \u2026entrenched poverty, blocked opportunity, the extremism that blights our communities. Why? So when the new mum looks at her new-born baby \u2013 the most precious thing she\u2019s ever seen \u2013 and she vows to provide for it, she knows she actually can. When the schoolgirl sits in that classroom, she knows that her studies really can take her to the very top. When the child of immigrants sees our flag, he feels so loyal to this country \u2013 his country \u2013 he wants to put on a uniform and defend it. That is what fires me up. Not pounds and pence, plans and policies, but people. And to those who say: our social problems are too big and there\u2019s no way you can sort them out. I say: You said our party wouldn\u2019t change \u2013 we have. You said our long-term economic plan wouldn\u2019t work \u2013 it is. You said we wouldn\u2019t win the election \u2013 we did. So we are going to tackle those big social problems \u2013 just you watch us. POVERTY Central to that is an all-out assault on poverty. Conservatives understand that if we\u2019re serious about solving the problem, we need to tackle the root causes of poverty. Homes where no-one works; children growing up in chaos; addiction, mental health problems, abuse, family breakdown. Today, a teenager sitting their GCSEs is more likely to own a smartphone than have a dad living with them. Think of your own child, think of the day they were born; how fragile they were\u2026 \u2026and then think that, every day, three babies are born in Britain addicted to heroin. We\u2019ll never deal with poverty unless we get to grips with these issues. We made a start in the last five years with our Troubled Families programme. It\u2019s already turned around the lives of over 100,000 families. And do you know one of its central aims? It\u2019s simple: get the adults a job. Because we know in this party that the best route out of poverty is work. That\u2019s why we reformed welfare, introduced the cap and helped create 2.5 million jobs. But it\u2019s not enough simply to have a job: work has got to pay. Nearly two-thirds of children in poverty have parents who are in jobs. For them, work hasn\u2019t worked. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve cut taxes for the lowest paid and we\u2019ll keep on doing that. And from next year, we\u2019ll take a giant leap forward. Yes, a new National Living Wage. Over £9 an hour by the end of the decade. An £80-a-week pay rise for the lowest paid. Work paying for millions of people. So let the message go out: if you work hard, want to get on, want more money at the end of the month\u2026 \u2026the party for you is right here in this hall. But being out of work is only one of the causes we must tackle. Children in care are today almost guaranteed to live in poverty. 84 per cent leave school without five good GCSEs. 70 per cent of prostitutes were once in care. And tragically, care leavers are four times more likely to commit suicide than anyone else. These children are in our care; we, the state, are their parents \u2013 and what are we setting them up for\u2026 \u2026the dole, the streets, an early grave? I tell you: this shames our country and we will put it right. Just as we said to failing schools, \u201cdo a better job with our children or we will send new leaders in\u201d, so we will say to poorly performing social services, \u201cimprove or be taken over\u201d. Just as we got the best graduates teaching at our most difficult schools, let\u2019s get our brightest and best to the frontline of social work. But we must also stop children needing to be in care at all. When we came to office, the adoption rate in our country was frankly a scandal. It has gone up. Our Adoption Bill will help it increase still further. But there\u2019s so much more to do. So let us in this hall say to all those children desperate for a family, and all those families yearning for a child: We, the Conservatives, we are the ones who will bring you together. There\u2019s another service run by the state that all too often fails and entrenches poverty. Prison. Now I believe if you\u2019ve committed a crime, punishment must follow. And when it\u2019s serious enough, that punishment must mean prison. Let\u2019s not forget, since we came to office, crime is down by a quarter. But the system is still not working. Half of criminals offend within a year of being released. Nearly half go into prison with no qualifications; many come out with none either. And all the problems that may have led them to that life \u2013 drug addiction, mental health problems, childhood abuse \u2013 remain unchanged. We have got to get away from the sterile lock-em-up or let-em-out debate, and get smart about this. When prisoners are in jail, we have their full attention for months at a time \u2013 so let\u2019s treat their problems, educate them, put them to work. When we restrict someone\u2019s freedom outside prison, we can make sure they\u2019re working and paying taxes, rather than spending £30,000 a year keeping them in a cell \u2013 so where it makes sense, let\u2019s use electronic tags to help keep us safe and help people go clean. And when our prisons are relics from the time of Dickens \u2013 it\u2019s time to sell them off and build new ones that actually work. This is going to be a big area of social reform in the next five years. And I have just the man for the job. The man who takes on every vested interest and gives everyone a chance\u2026 \u2026the man who began the great transformation of our education system and is now going to do the same for prisons\u2026 \u2026yes, the great Conservative reformer, Michael Gove. OPPORTUNITY If we tackle the causes of poverty, we can make our country greater. But there\u2019s another big social problem we need to fix. In politicians\u2019 speak: a \u201clack of social mobility\u201d. In normal language: people unable to rise from the bottom to the top, or even from the middle to the top, because of their background. Listen to this: Britain has the lowest social mobility in the developed world. Here, the salary you earn is more linked to what your father got paid than in any other major country. I\u2019m sorry, for us Conservatives, the party of aspiration, we cannot accept that. We know that education is the springboard to opportunity. Our reforms are already working. More children studying maths and science. More learning coding and engineering. More doing the extra-curricular activities that teach confidence and build character. Recently, I was at a school in Runcorn. Last year, 53 of their children went off to university. 52 of them were the first ever in their family to do so. That is why I\u2019m so passionate about academies and free schools: Head teachers are growing in confidence as they throw off the shackles of local council control\u2026 \u2026raising the aspirations of children, parents, communities. This movement is sweeping across our country. So my next ambition is this. 500 new Free Schools. Every school an academy\u2026 \u2026and yes \u2013 Local Authorities running schools a thing of the past. But let\u2019s be honest. For too many people, even a good education isn\u2019t enough. There are other barriers that stand in their way. Picture this. You\u2019ve graduated with a good degree. You send out your CV far and wide. But you get rejection after rejection. What\u2019s wrong? It\u2019s not the qualifications or the previous experience. It\u2019s just two words at the top: first name, surname. Do you know that in our country today: even if they have exactly the same qualifications, people with white-sounding names are nearly twice as likely to get call backs for jobs than people with ethnic-sounding names? This is a true story. One young black girl had to change her name to Elizabeth before she got any calls to interviews. That, in 21st century Britain, is disgraceful. We can talk all we want about opportunity, but it\u2019s meaningless unless people are really judged equally. Think about it like this. Opportunity doesn\u2019t mean much to a British Muslim if he walks down the street and is abused for his faith. Opportunity doesn\u2019t mean much to a black person constantly stopped and searched by the police because of the colour of their skin. Opportunity doesn\u2019t mean much to a gay person rejected for a job because of the person they love. It doesn\u2019t mean much to a disabled person prevented from doing what they\u2019re good at because of who they are. I\u2019m a dad of two daughters \u2013 opportunity won\u2019t mean anything to them if they grow up in a country where they get paid less because of their gender rather than how good they are at their work. The point is this: you can\u2019t have true opportunity without real equality. And I want our party to get this right. Yes us, the party of the fair chance; the party of the equal shot\u2026 \u2026the party that doesn\u2019t care where you come from, but only where you\u2019re going\u2026 \u2026us, the Conservatives, I want us to end discrimination and finish the fight for real equality in our country today. EXTREMISM Tackling the causes of poverty. Fighting for real opportunity. And there\u2019s one more big social reform in our mission to rebuild Britain as an even greater country. We need to confront \u2013 and I mean really confront \u2013 extremism. When I read what some young people born and brought up in this country are doing, it makes me feel sick to my stomach. Girls not much older than my eldest daughter, swapping loving family homes and straight-A futures for a life of servitude under ISIL, in a land of violence and oppression. Boys who could do anything they wanted in Britain \u2013 who have benefitted from all this country stands for \u2013 instead ending up in the desert wielding a knife. This ideology, this diseased view of the world, has become an epidemic \u2013 infecting minds from the mosques of Mogadishu to the bedrooms of Birmingham. And here\u2019s what we need to do. One: tear up the narrative that says Muslims are persecuted and the West deserves what it gets. Never mind that it\u2019s Britain and America behind the biggest effort to help the victims of Syria. Who is ISIL murdering more than anyone else? Muslims. No-one should get away with this politics of grievance anymore. Two: take on extremism in all its forms, the violent and non-violent. People don\u2019t become terrorists from a standing start. It begins with preachers telling them that Christians and Muslims can\u2019t live together. It moves to people in their community saying the security services were responsible for 7/7. It progresses to a website telling them how to wage jihad, fight in Syria, and defeat the West. And before you know it, a young British boy, barely 17, is strapping bombs to his body and blowing himself up in Iraq. We have to stop it at the start \u2013 stop this seed of hatred even being planted in people\u2019s minds, let alone allowing it to grow. Three: we need to tackle segregation. There are parts of Britain today where you can get by without ever speaking English or meeting anyone from another culture. Zoom in and you\u2019ll see some institutions that actually help incubate these divisions. Did you know, in our country, there are some children who spend several hours each day at a Madrassa? Let me be clear: there is nothing wrong with children learning about their faith, whether it\u2019s at Madrassas, Sunday Schools or Jewish Yeshivas. But in some Madrassas we\u2019ve got children being taught that they shouldn\u2019t mix with people of other religions; being beaten; swallowing conspiracy theories about Jewish people. These children should be having their minds opened, their horizons broadened\u2026 \u2026not having their heads filled with poison and their hearts filled with hate. So I can announce this today: If an institution is teaching children intensively, then whatever its religion, we will, like any other school, make it register so it can be inspected. And be in no doubt: if you are teaching intolerance, we will shut you down. This goes to a wider truth. For too long, we\u2019ve been so frightened of causing offence that we haven\u2019t looked hard enough at what is going on in our communities. This is passive tolerance. And I\u2019ll tell you where it leads: To children, British children, going to Pakistan in the summer holidays, before they\u2019ve even started their GCSEs, and forced to marry a man they\u2019ve never met\u2026 \u2026children, British children, having their genitals mutilated, not just in a clinic in Lagos but the backstreets in Britain. This passive tolerance has turned us into a less integrated country; it\u2019s put our children in danger. It is unforgiveable. So let me say it right here: no more passive tolerance in Britain. We\u2019ve passed the laws \u2013 now I want them enforced. People who organise forced marriages \u2013 I want them prosecuted. Parents who take their children for FGM \u2013 I want them arrested. And as we do that, we shouldn\u2019t just be saying what\u2019s wrong with these practices; we should be saying what\u2019s right with Britain. Freedom. Democracy. Equality. These are precious. People fought for them \u2013 many died for them\u2026 \u2026in the trenches, a century ago; on the beaches, 30 years later\u2026 \u2026in the Suffragettes; in Gay Pride. Half the world is crying out for these freedoms \u2013 they see what we\u2019ve achieved with them. Free speech \u2013 and the best literature in the world. Freedom of religion \u2013 and many faiths living side by side, peacefully. Free thinking \u2013 and the endless advances in medicine and technology that has brought. A free economy \u2013 and a standard of living our grandparents could only have dreamed of. I want my children \u2013 I want all our children \u2013 to know they\u2019re part of something big \u2013 the proudest multi-racial democracy on earth. That\u2019s why we\u2019re making sure they learn British history at school. That\u2019s why we started National Citizen Service to bring different people together. I want them to grow up proud of our country. That\u2019s right: less Britain-bashing, more national pride \u2013 our way, the Conservative way, the only way to greater days. CONSERVATIVES So big battles. Big arguments. A Greater Britain. Keeping our head as Labour lose theirs. So I have a message for those who voted for us and those who never have: If you believe in strong defence, and helping the poorest, most desperate people in the world. If you want an NHS that\u2019s there for everybody, and schools that stretch our children\u2026 \u2026and you understand none of that is possible without a strong economy. If you believe we can become the enterprise capital of the world and beat poverty. If you believe that the fight against extremism is the fight for our existence; and you want this to be the generation that ends discrimination. If you want these things, the party you need is the party right here. And it\u2019s never too late. Bernard Harris from Leicester wrote to me before polling day and said this. \u201cAged 82, this is possibly my last election. \u201cIn my life I have foolishly voted Labour, believing it served the working class. \u201cHow wrong I was. Labour is against all I aspire to. \u201cI am 100 per cent for a United Kingdom, a sound economy, free enterprise, a trading Europe and a decent standard of living. \u201cOnly a Conservative Government will achieve this.\u201d Bernard, you found the right party \u2013 and I want many more to follow in your footsteps. CONCLUSION So I believe that we can make this era \u2013 these 2010s \u2013 a defining decade for our country\u2026 \u2026the turnaround decade\u2026 \u2026one which people will look back on and say: \u201cthat\u2019s the time when the tide turned\u2026 \u2026when people no longer felt the current going against them, but working with them.\u201d We can be that Greater Britain. Because we know this: nothing is written. We\u2019ve proved it in schools across our country\u2026 \u2026that the poorest children don\u2019t have to get the worst results \u2013 they can get the best. Over the next five years we will show that the deep problems in our society \u2013 they are not inevitable. That a childhood in care doesn\u2019t have to mean a life of struggle. That a stint in prison doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll get out and do the same thing all over again. That being black, or Asian, or female, or gay doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019ll be treated differently. Nothing is written. And if we\u2019re to be the global success story of the 21st century, we need to write millions of individual success stories. A Greater Britain \u2013 made of greater expectations\u2026 \u2026where renters become homeowners\u2026 \u2026employees become employers\u2026 \u2026a small island becomes an even bigger economy\u2026 \u2026and where extremism is defeated once and for all. A Greater Britain\u2026 \u2026no more, its people dragged down or held back\u2026 \u2026no more, some children with their noses pressed to the window as they watch the world moving ahead without them. No \u2013 a country raising its sights, its people reaching new heights\u2026 \u2026a Great British take-off \u2013 that leaves no-one behind. That\u2019s our dream \u2013 to help you realise your dreams. A Greater Britain \u2013 made of greater hope, greater chances, greater security. So let\u2019s get out there \u2013 all of us \u2013 and let\u2019s make it happen.
