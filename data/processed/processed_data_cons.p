VMy Lord Derby, my lords, ladies and gentlemen, I thank you very heartily for the reception you have given to me, and I congratulate you most sincerely upon the great meeting which you have had in London and which I am told exceeds in the numbers and influential character of its constituents anything that since the foundation of this association has been experienced (cheers); and it is not unfitting that at this time you should assemble in your numbers to give expression to your feelings and views upon political affairs and to combine in your strength to guide the nation in the right way (cheers); for though strictly technical politics seem to be sufficiently quiet, owing to the temporary paralysis which appears to have fallen on our opponents (laughter), yet the situation is not destitute of elements of disturbance, and even of apprehension, either in this country or abroad.  I do not wish to refer to the great industrial conflict which is dividing us at this moment.  It is well that such an event, lamentable though it is, should be kept as much as possible out of political discussion.  (Cheers.)  All we can say is that, in view of the vast commercial and industrial interests which depend upon the union of classes in this country, we hope that this division may before long cease.  (Hear, hear.)Indian PolicyBut abroad our attention is drawn more than anything else to the splendid example of patriotism and devotion which is being set before our eyes in India.  (Cheers.)  There have been greater issues tried on that soil, there have been greater dangers confronted; but I doubt whether at any period in the history of the connexion of this island with India such splendid devotion to their Sovereign and their flag has been exhibited, not only by those who belong to this country, but also by the loyal and splendid races who inhabit our dependencies.  (Cheers.)  It is a great subject of congratulation that, when so many influences combine to tempt men to an easy and inglorious life, when there are so few of those exciting causes which draw forth the heroic qualities from men, at such a crisis as this we should be able to show a display of the highest virtues of a nation of which at any time Great Britain or India would have been proud.  (Cheers.)  I feel bound, specially in the circumstances of the time, to pay a tribute of respect and admiration to the statesman by whom these great operations are being conducted in India.  (Cheers.)  As you know, Lord Elgin is not a partisan of ours.  We speak of him with all impartiality so far as political preference might tend to bias us, but we feel that in a moment of great difficulty and of sudden danger he has shown great courage and resolution and has acted worthily of the great crisis in which he was placed and the splendid position which he occupies.  (Cheers.)  I am glad to be able to say this because I think there are some critics of his in this country who hardly reflect upon the bearing of their words when they attack him.  (Hear, hear.)  There are men, apparently, upon whom the influence of the existing struggle presses so much more than the recollection of past comradeship that they accuse Lord Elgin of having broken the faith which he himself, with his own hand, deliberately passed, and, by that act, of having brought the present war upon this country.  That is an accusation which men do not make in these calmer days against even their political opponents, and it seems somewhat strange that it should be made against a political friend.  (Cheers.)  I will not attempt to go into the minute, hypercritical details of verbal criticism by which this charge is attempted to be substantiated, but I will only invite your consideration of this - that Lord Northbrook, a former Viceroy, thoroughly acquainted with all the circumstances of India and all the features of this case, and not concurring with us in the expediency of the policy which we have adopted, has yet pronounced in the most formal manner that there is no pretence or foundation for this charge of a breach of faith.  (Cheers.)  Now, a charge of breach of faith, when it is made against your own country, when it is made in the face of 200 millions of men, many of them of the same race and religion as those with whom the breach of faith is alleged to have been committed - such a charge as that should be made gravely and with circumspection and with a due consideration of all the responsibility which it involves.  (Cheers.)  The responsibility is enormous, and it is hard to measure the condemnation which is due to those who in the mere hurry-scurry of party welfare are not ashamed to cast this slight upon their country, upon the Queen\u2019s officer, or to set up this subject of difference between the races whom it is our highest privilege and desire to keep together.  (Cheers.)  Perhaps I may note, as I am passing, other incidents in the controversy of the moment as applied to foreign affairs which show the same vehemence of imagination betraying the judgement of our opponents.TunisI see only this morning that Mr Bryce has been criticising the conduct of the government, and one of his causes of censure is that we have concluded a treaty with France which is injurious to the cotton industry of this country.  Mr Bryce might have read the treaty to which he refers.  The essence of the treaty is that for 15 years it fixes 5 per cent instead of 8 per cent as the duty to be charged upon cotton goods imported into Tunis.  (Hear, hear.)  But the treaty is important to us for another reason, and I hold it on that account, so far as such matters can be dealt with as important, to be of considerable moment.  As you are no doubt aware, under international law a treaty only lasts as long as the Powers who make it last, and we have a treaty with Tunis which is, no doubt valuable in its provisions.  But the regency of Tunis is a very remarkable political structure.  It is entirely at the disposal of France, and a decree could at any moment bring its national existence to a close.  I am not saying that France ought to make such a decree, nor am I for a moment suggesting that she will under her present enlightened Government.  The only important point is this \u2013 that if there was a system of life insurance for States, as there is for individuals, Tunis would be an uncommonly bad life (laughter), and no decent office would undertake its insurance.  (Renewed laughter.)  Under these circumstances, I hold it to be a matter of considerable importance that we have now a treaty with France which will last as long as France does, instead of a treaty with Tunis which would only last as long as Tunis does, and, at all events for the next 15 years, the cotton trade of this country will be very much the better for that operation.  (Hear, hear.)Siam and MadagascarThen I see Mr. Asquith accusing me of having made surrenders of territory to France in Siam and Madagascar.  Really, the boldness of his imagination positively alarms me.  (Laughter.)  It is quite true that Siam has been despoiled or deprived of a considerable portion of her territory \u2013 all the territory on the other side of the Mekong, 20 miles of the territory on this side, and the temporary \u2013 so-called temporary \u2013 occupation of most important and valuable provinces besides.  Now all that has been done, no doubt.  The French Government have been allowed by the English Government \u2013 I do not say the English Government ought to have prevented it, but with the acquiescence of the English Government it has been done; but it was all done under Mr Gladstone (laughter and cheers), and it is too hard that I should be accused of making a surrender of Siam to the French, when all the time Mr Gladstone was doing this.  I, out of a respect for what I believe is the duty of statesmen in Opposition, carefully abstained from raising any public question on the subject.  There was, it is quite true, one matter left behind when I succeeded to office.  There was a territory far in the hills, small in extent, almost entirely destitute of population, and so unhealthy that during six months of the year the inhabitants themselves could not venture to mark out its limits.  This territory was claimed by France and by England.  The Sovereign of the territory was a judicious man, and in order to avoid disagreeable complications he sent assurances to Burma of his allegiance on one side, and assurances to Siam and Anam of his allegiance on the other; and as England claims through Burma, and France through Siam, it is obvious that on evidence which might have been thought somewhat similar France claimed this bit of territory and England claimed it too.  What was to be done?  First we thought of arbitration; but then we found that it was so desperately unhealthy that no arbiter would go there (laughter), and that if we sent for the people who knew anything about it and examined them in London or Paris we should have eaten up\u000a\u000aseveral times the fee simple value of the territory before we had got half through the case.  Under these circumstances, the French Ambassador and I, we resorted to a very vulgar plan very commonly known in commerce \u2013 we split the difference.  (Cheers and laughter.)  A great river happens to pass through this territory, dividing it into approximately equal shares.  England took the western share, France took the eastern share (hear, hear), and without any further expense the controversy was solved.  (Cheers.)  If you call that surrendering to France \u2013 surrendering to another country \u2013 I can only say I wish all the controversies we have with the various nations of the world could be settled so simply and so satisfactorily.  (Cheers.)  But Mr. Asquith did not stop there.  He accused me of surrendering to France in the matter of Madagascar.  That is the cruellest thing of all, because Madagascar was invaded, conquered, a protectorate was declared, its most valuable maritime portion annexed to France.  All this was announced to the English Government, and no protest was made.  That is all perfectly true, but it was all done by Mr. Gladstone (laughter and cheers); and so again, another expedition was sent two years ago which has resulted in the more complete absorption of Madagascar by France; but that expedition was announced and started while Lord Rosebery was Prime Minister.  (Hear, hear.)  Do not understand me to blame these statesmen for what they did in these matters of Siam and Madagascar.  But the question is a very difficult one and would require more argument from me than I can give it now.  I do not blame them for what they did, but I do blame them for saying I did it.  (Cheers.)  Well, these are the substance of the attacks you see made on our foreign policy.  They have gone on repeating the words Siam and Madagascar until they really believe they have a grievance against the existing Government.  (Laughter.)  I would entreat you not to exercise levity towards us, not to spare condemnation if we are wrong, but if you condemn us, do not accept the facts from the mouths of our adversaries, but ascertain the facts for yourselves.Greece and TurkeyWell, there has been as you know, another very interesting matter of foreign affairs upon which condemnation has been levelled very freely at her Majesty\u2019s Government.  The only satisfactory thing is that that condemnation has been levelled almost equally from two opposite sides of the question.  I am speaking of the condition of South-Eastern Europe.  I will not go into that, but I ask you to notice that we profess to be a British Government, that we profess that British interests and rights are the main objects of our policy.  (Cheers.)  We do not censure people who have a vehement passion for the Turks.  We do not censure people who have a vehement passion for the Greeks.  I know, without attempting to hold the balance between these two influences, I know very excellent persons on both sides of the question, but those persons must not act as members of her Majesty\u2019s Government.  (Hear, hear.)  We are in the position, as we have said before, but it is so little accepted that I venture to say it again.  We are in the position of trustees.  Our business is to dispose of the power and the resources which are in our hands for the object for which the trust exists \u2013 namely, the interests of Great Britain and Ireland.  (Cheers.)  Though we may have the highest respect for those who have enthusiasms upon the Greek or the Turkish side we cannot admit that those motives can be allowed to weigh upon us in the slightest degree.  We should be exactly in the position of trustees full of philanthropic zeal who paid all the money of those who entrusted it to them to a hospital instead of spending it on the persons to whom the trust belonged.  (Cheers.)  It is not enough that your motive is noble, generous, beautiful; it must also be just (cheers); and that and that axiom is, I think, not sufficiently taken into consideration when the policy of England in the South-East of Europe is judged.  Our object was to maintain the peace.  (Cheers.)  If peace had not been maintained great calamities would have fallen on the world.  The result of the efforts of the Powers of Europe was that in respect of the Slavonic principalities and territories peace was maintained.  Everybody imagined that Macedonia and Bulgaria and Serbia and Montenegro would rise and add to the general confusion, and produce the shock of far greater and more important Powers.  But that did not take place.  Peace was maintained.  It was broken, unfortunately, in one instance by the Greeks against our most earnest representations.  They, and they only, have suffered by what they did; and I do not wish to press upon them the results of their unwise and unthinking conduct.  (Hear, hear.)  We did our best to restrain them.  I maintain that you have no right, or at least it is a very doubtful proceeding, to try and prevent a man from killing himself by killing him yourself (laughter); and with that limitation we behaved ourselves to Greece.  All that exhortation or representation, and even something like an apparent threat, could do we did; but we shrank before the possible danger that might come if we were found in a war between Greece and Turkey fighting on the Turkish side.  (Hear, hear)  Therefore, the concert of Europe failed to prevent this Greek war.  I hold that the responsibility is entirely with Greece (cheers), but in every other respect the concert of Europe has up to this time succeeded.  It has dealt with vast and important problems of the Turkish Empire without breaking that peace which in the present state of the world we all feel to be so valuable, without incurring the dangers of international war between other and powerful countries which might have brought about countless calamities to mankind.  (Cheers.)London Municipal GovernmentNow, gentlemen, you are here, no doubt, not entirely or mainly to deal with foreign affairs, and I owe you some apology for having dealt with them so much.  (Cries of \u2018No\u2019 and \u2018Go on.\u2019)  But there are other things which interest us besides foreign affairs, and they are things which concern our own daily and hourly well-being.  We live in the largest city in the world.  We necessarily make great claims upon the government of that city.  But we ask ourselves whether it is in all respects governed as effectively, as wisely, and as cheaply as it might be.  (Cheers and laughter.)  And that is a question which the inhabitants of London will be forced to answer.  My own belief, which is known to you \u2013 for I have expressed it before \u2013 is that in this matter the inhabitants of London, or perhaps I should rather say the statesmen of this country, have fallen victims to a common intellectual complaint of the present day, which I may name, as I see that Mr. Gladstone has consecrated the word, megalomania (laughter) \u2013 the passion for big things simply because they are big.  And in so doing they have departed from the traditions and the precedents of all other large municipalities, for London has a constitution wholly different from theirs.  We are very proud of our municipal genius in this country and the splendid results which the municipalities all over the country have produced, and we are not the less proud when we compare them with what happens in some other countries.  (Laughter and cheers.)  But in London you have not got a municipality; you have a little Parliament; and a little Parliament is not what you want.  (Loud cheers and laughter.)  We have a big Parliament to which we all pay the deepest reverence.  But we think that one big Parliament is enough for this island, and to double it by another little Parliament, which has less important matters to deal with, but which is hampered by all the difficulties which hinder the progress of business in its larger archetype \u2013 I think that is a proceeding destitute of wisdom and judgement.  (Cheers.)  Your so-called municipality is, I believe, something like ten or twelve times larger than any other municipality in the country, and the result is that you have ten or twelve times the amount of business to do.  But the day remains limited to 24 hours, and the human being remains limited to the amount of force with which Nature has endowed his brain and body.  (Laughter and cheers.)  And the consequence is that \u2013 though I desire to speak with the utmost respect of the members of the London County Council, and I reverence them very much for the amount of time and labour which they bestow fruitlessly upon the public good (loud laughter and cheers) \u2013 yet I feel that if our Legislature had condescended to look upon the precedents which we have all over the country we should have seen that we might have obtained a much more efficient machine, or some much more efficient machines, if we had been content to look upon London as what it is \u2013 not as one great municipality, but as an aggregate of municipalities.  (Cheers.)  Now, that is a problem which you will have to consider.  I hold that the limitation of the size of your municipality is one of the essential conditions of its efficacy and excellence, and for this reason \u2013 that you get working upon your municipalities the best men of the town or district which they inhabit, the men  who are well-known to their fellow citizens, who have themselves conducted their own businesses with great success and still continue to do so, but who can find some time in their day to give to the conduct of the municipality to which they belong, and who would be the best administrators.  (Hear, hear)  You cannot possibly find men not only of greater integrity, but men who, by their very education and by their daily experience, are taught to solve problems which come up for solution in their official capacity.  (Hear, hear.)  But if you overload them you will not get these men.  They cannot give you the whole of their time; some must be given to their own affairs, and, though I do not for a moment deny that you have excellent men on the London County Council, they are men of another type.  They are men who give themselves wholly up to this matter.  That is not so good, or anything like so good, as a Government consisting of men who are still conducting their own affairs of the same sort.  (Hear, hear)  What I am going to say I say with apology, for I should be exceedingly sorry if I were thought, for a moment, to cast a slur, which it would be most impertinent for me to cast, on the members of the County Council, but they are running a danger of becoming professional politicians.  (Cheers.)  And so you see that in their daily capacity there is almost as much waste of time as there is in the House of Commons.  (Laughter.)  In the House of Commons it is a necessary evil; it is one of the conditions on which we receive the inestimable benefit of representative institutions.  But we do not require to duplicate that phenomenon, and you will see if you watch the proceedings of the London County Council that they are overborne by the labour which they have to go through; that the committees they have to attend are endless; and the result is that their debates are adjourned from time to time, and are to an unfortunate, and, I fear, an increasing, extent devoted rather to abstract questions which concern advancing politicians than to those more prosaic and simple matters on which the happiness and welfare of five millions of people depend.  (Cheers.)Two Instances of MegalomaniaAnd I would entreat you, if you have still temptations to megalomania, to look at two great instances of it in the world.  Do you wish to be governed as Paris is governed?  (Cries of \u2018No.\u2019)  Do you wish to be governed as New York is governed?  (Cries of \u2018No.\u2019)  And yet the result at New York, which was waited for with so much interest, and which so many people deplore, was adopted after an effort to amend the admitted defects of the municipality by enormously increasing its area and bringing a much vaster population within its range.  (Hear, hear.)  It failed \u2013 it failed lamentably.  It failed because it could not obtain the assistance and support and co-operation of the only class of men by whom municipal institutions can thoroughly, satisfactorily be conducted.  This matter will be commended to you.  I earnestly hope that it will be entertained by the County Council \u2013 though perhaps it may seem a suicidal course to recommend to it \u2013 in a wise, a patriotic and enlightened spirit; and I earnestly hope that our friends will do their best, even at some inconvenience, to furnish for this or the next election a sufficient number of candidates to enable this matter to be impartially considered. The Problem of London GovernmentI do not think, if you elected the best county council in the world, that you would have solved the problem of London municipal government.  You will not solve it until you seek to give a large portion of the duties which are now performed by the County Council to other smaller municipalities (loud cheers), elected in narrower areas, and having a full and real knowledge of the condition of the people for whom they are legislating.  You cannot tell me \u2013 unless we have a political omniscience which I cannot discern \u2013 you cannot tell me that Hackney knows much of what goes on in Putney, or that Hampstead knows much of what goes on in Greenwich.  But this matter, I have no doubt, will be pressed to the front.  I have very little doubt that some legislation on the subject will be introduced by the Government in the ensuing Session.  (Cheers.)  But, of course, that is not a matter for Government or for party majorities.  We must have the thorough sympathy and co-operation of the best and most enlightened; or the policy with which we are dealing, the enterprise on which we have embarked, will fail.Recent Bye-ElectionsAnd now, gentlemen, the only matter which, perhaps, I ought to refer to is a question which interests us all; and that is the movement of the pendulum.  (Laughter.)  Though we have made an exceedingly good fight there is no doubt that our numbers have in several constituencies declined.  I should be very sorry if that reflection caused the slightest discouragement to any person present.  It is an essential result of your system of Parliamentary representation.  When a general election comes, the electors have before them all the sins of the Government of the day, which are more numerous with one Government and less numerous with another (laughter), but I am afraid are present with all.  And they have that excitement which will induce them to abandon their ease and put aside their enjoyments for the moment in order to fulfil one of the most vital duties that rest upon them as citizens.  But when you come to a bye-election, matters are very different.  There is no general inquest on the proceedings of the Government, but there are a number of things the Government have probably done which affect the feelings of a limited number of persons, and it is a curious maxim of human nature that people of eccentric opinions are very intense in their feelings and convictions, and people of reasonable convictions are very much inclined to stay at home.  (Hear, hear)  I do not know, of course, the various cross currents that may have decided certain votes in some of these recent contests.  I only venture to go on information which I have received.  On the morning when the result of the contest at Middleton was declared I received a telegram from a body calling itself the National Canine Association.  (Loud laughter.)  They did not sign their names or tell me from where the information came, so this is the first opportunity I have had of acknowledging their courtesy.  (Cheers and laughter.)  They were very fully convinced that all the votes that told against us at Middleton were bestowed by people whose dogs had been muzzled, to their own great discontent.  (Laughter.)  I do not suppose that that is a solitary instance.  Of course, the dogs are very much to the fore, and you know all about them; but I am not sure there may not be a party of cats (laughter), and I have no doubt there are many small parties of that kind, and you may always be sure of the result that, in proportion to the smallness of the party is the intensity of the convictions that actuate them.  (Hear, hear.)  For these reasons you must not be surprised at the movement of the pendulum.  It moved during our last Government; when it concluded we were still in a majority in Great Britain and a very large majority in England.  But there was a body of opinion in which no pendulum moves which gave a majority the other way.  But it is not merely this motion which I may call the automatic result of the conditions of political movement in this country; but there is another special cause which produces indifference on our side, and might tend to cause electoral defeat, and that cause is the utter disorganisation into which our adversaries have fallen.  (Hear, hear.)  They profess, and I have no doubt sincerely, to deeply regret the retirement of Mr. Gladstone; but they have not so much cause to regret it as we have.  As long as Mr. Gladstone was on the front bench nobody on our side thought of muzzled dogs.  (Laughter.)  No petty considerations were allowed to thrust aside solicitude for the great interests which, in our belief, were threatened by Mr. Gladstone\u2019s gigantic changes.  (Cheers.)  No follower to Mr. Gladstone has shown himself.  I do not know precisely who the leader on the other side is.  (Laughter and cheers.)  I wish to tender him my heartiest respects and to express a wish that he would withdraw the mask from his face and let me see what lineaments he has.  (Laughter.)  But the result is that the terror, that salutary terror which keeps eccentric spirits from wandering from the fold, has gone away.  People say, \u2018Oh!  The Government has a large majority, and the idea that the country will entrust its destinies to Sir William Harcourt \u2013 well, it is not worth considering.\u2019  (Laughter.)  Therefore, they give themselves freely to the pleasure of poking fun at their friends and revenging any little cause of irritation which they may have felt. Home Rule and the Need for VigilanceThese are human passions \u2013 I may call them human failings.  They are natural in a party, and still more natural in a large party; but standing in the presence of the strongest organisation which the Conservative party has seen, and I think the strongest organisation any party in this country has seen (cheers), I would urge upon them that the correction and remedy of errors of this kind is precisely the service which a strong organisation should perform.  (Hear, hear.)  When we are in the flood-tide of success and everybody is thinking of politics, no doubt such a body as this is very useful; but it does little to influence a movement determined by higher and more potent causes.  But in a time of slack water such as we are in now, when a few eccentrics, by whom a contest may be decided, have their full opportunity and know it is their hour of licence, then is the time when an organisation such as the National Union should make itself a power and its utility felt.  (Cheers.)  Do not imagine that the cause for your exertion has passed away.  No doubt the history of recent times as it will be written is a very strange history.  No doubt the dismemberment of the Empire was undertaken under auspices that might well make us fear.  The whole organisation \u2013 and a terrible organisation it is \u2013 which the Nationalists are able to bring to bear, joined to the whole organisation of the Liberal party, the great prestige and long services of Mr Gladstone and the influence of his seductive eloquence \u2013 all these things, and many more, were joined together in order to assure success to the recent Home Rule movement.  They succeeded after many years of effort in procuring the assent of the House of Commons.  They delighted to indulge in menaces of the fate that would befall the House of Lords if they dared to stand in their way.  Their confidence was unlimited; they never believed for a moment that it was upon that stone that their undertaking would trip.  But the matter turned out differently from their expectation.  The House of Lords rejected the Bill by a contemptuous majority (cheers), and then they were told that their cup was to be filled and final condemnation was to be pronounced.  (Laughter.)  But, instead of that, the country has sent back a larger majority than has ever been returned in our time to support it.  (Cheers.)  No doubt it was a great victory, and no doubt the effect has been for the moment to silence the cry for Home Rule, so that you only hear it now and again in a stray election speech.  But do not imagine that the danger has passed by.  The elements are all there \u2013 all the elements of discontent; all the elements of the organisation by which the integrity of the country was threatened; and, I might add, all the elements by which the integrity of the Church of England was threatened.  (Hear, hear.)  All these things remain where they were.  What they want is a prophet to give life to the dry bones, a general to handle the troops which are ready to his hands.  The general has not shown himself.  (Laughter.)  But do not count upon his absence.  In this period of repose it is for you to perfect your organisation and to make your security undoubted.  (Cheers.)  Do not count that there will be always absent from the benches opposite you a man who can use the elements of discontent and subversion which have been handed down for his employment.  It is for you to prepare against that danger.  If you now use the period of repose; if you now foresee that this lull will not be permanent, but that the tempest will be on you again; you may again have the proud privilege which you had before; and it will again be said that it is due to your efforts and to that party which you organised that the Empire which we all cherish and value has been preserved.  (Loud cheers.)

aVMy Lords and gentlemen, I thank you very heartily for the kind manner in which you have received this toast, and I desire to express my gratitude to you and to my noble friend who on this occasion has kindly brought us together.  (Hear, hear.)  The National Union owes much to him for his constant and unsparing support, and every triumph which we can register and is achieved by it, falls to his glory in no small degree.  I am very grateful for the kind expression you have given of your feelings on this occasion, but it impresses strongly the conviction on my mind that, as for what we have done, it is mainly the workers of such societies as this that have achieved the great victory over which we are able to rejoice. The Change of Political FeelingIt has been indeed a very remarkable victory.  (Cheers.)  There is no other case in the life of the Queen, or I think since the time of the great Reform Bill, where a Ministry has twice referred its conduct to the judgement of the constituencies and has twice been returned with the strongest evidence of their approval and support.  We cannot be vain enough to attribute the main operation in this great change to any action on our part.  We rather point to it as a proof of the marvellous change which has come over the political feeling of the country and of London (cheers), where the instincts of the country are first to be discerned.  I am old enough to remember a very different state of things.  (Cheers.)  I can remember when London was the highest expression of Liberal enthusiasm, when the strongest trust of the party leaders of the Whig or Liberal party was in every part of London; and I remember, when I lived there, it was most of all in the borough of Marylebone that the fire of Liberalism seemed to burn bright and perpetual.  The sort of people who stood then for London boroughs were not the aristocratic Whigs (laughter); they were not any modified expression of Liberal orthodoxy; they were the extremest Radicals which the populace could get together.  I remember well a great election when the two members were Sir Benjamin Hall \u2013 all that could be desired of the fine flower of Radicalism \u2013 and Mr. Harper Twelvetrees, whose name sufficiently expresses the kind of orthodoxy he represented.  We had no chance in those days, and any one who should prophesy that in half a century these London boroughs would be the safest refuge for Conservative statesmen would have been regarded as simply insane.  It has been a very great change.  The City of London has become so Conservative that it is not only safe from those attacks of Radicalism, but it is the principal object of every Radical hatred.  Much the same has been the case in most of the London boroughs, and you know very well what the balance of our losses and gains in the last few elections has been.  But what strikes me as most extraordinary is that the great strength of Conservative feeling lies among the vast number of owners of villas of every kind who surround London.  In my time they were a certain \u2018find\u2019 for every Radical candidate, but a notable change has taken place there.  The question naturally occurs to us whether this state of things will last and how are we to make it last.  My answer is that you will make it last by trying to do your duty.  (Cheers.)Housing of the Working ClassesIf you observe that the villas outside London are the principal seed-plots of Conservatism I am afraid that if you look carefully you will find that such Radicalism as still remains attaches to those districts of London, unfortunately still too large, where what is called the great question of the housing of the poor is living and burning.  I would recommend this, that there is no surer guide to the Conservative party in trying to maintain and to improve their hold over public opinion in London than that they should devote all the power they possess to getting rid of that which is really a scandal to our civilisation \u2013 the sufferings which many of the working classes have to undergo, in the most moderate, I might say the most pitiable, accommodation.  These things will strike any one who looks at the question, but there has been so much controversy on the matter that in touching it I earnestly desire to protest that I am not trying to blame anybody or any set of men.  I am deeply aware of all the difficulties which attach to this question.  They have been created quite as much by economic laws as by any conscious human agency.  But though I would not dream of hinting at blame upon any persons to the right or to the left, yet, looking at the state of things we find, I would not the less earnestly press upon all over whom my opinion may have any weight that the subject which should occupy their attention more than any other social subject is that of providing adequate and healthy accommodation for the working classes.  (Cheers.)  I beg to say that these are no new opinions on my part.  Some 16 or 17 years ago, when first I took my present office, the question was then under agitation.  There was a vast area of ground, the site of Millbank Prison, which was about to be put on the market.  I introduced a Bill and urged it strongly on the acceptance of Parliament, that this land should be sold, not at its market price, but at its cost price for the purpose of promoting the erection of proper houses for the poor.  (Cheers.)  The measure passed the House of Lords, but in the House of Commons \u2013 it was a time of great political confusion \u2013 the difficulties of passing it were too great and it fell through.  I merely allude to this to show that, in urging it upon you now as an object of social endeavour more calling for your zeal and exertion than any other, I am supporting no new opinions but opinions which I have cherished for years.  (Cheers.)  I feel that I could not go further into social questions on the present occasion when my opportunities are naturally restricted, and therefore I will not deal further with them.  I would only ask you to bear in mind that you must not allow yourselves to be frightened away from the remedies for social evils by the fact that they are made a cover or pretence for attacks upon property and other institutions.  (Hear, hear.)  You must repel these attacks, but at the same time you must not allow your attention to be diverted from the stern necessities which the vast social changes of our time are imposing upon all who cherish the prosperity of this country.  (Hear, hear.) The Object of the Hour I am aware that these matters, deeply important as they are, are not the matters which at this moment occupy our attention in the first rank.  We have grave duties to perform and those duties must be fulfilled.  (Cheers.)  They may require strenuous effort, they may require self-denial, but if you wish to uphold the reputation which has been handed down to us from our fathers, if you mean to sustain the Empire which they did so much to build up and which we have sacrificed so many things to maintain, if we mean that the glory of England shall suffer no tarnish at our hands, we must not allow our efforts to slacken until the great enterprise in which we have engaged has been carried through.  (Cheers.)  We are speaking now at a time of some anxiety.  We do not know exactly what is taking place and we earnestly hope that the issue may be better than the beginning; but we have to push it through.  (Cheers.)  It may be that there are matters which have not been explained and which ought to be explained.  It may be that we have to scrutinise every step by which the present result has been reached; but whatever our attitude may be with regard to the efforts that have been made, to the failures or the successes of the past, we must remember that the one thing we have to keep before us is that on the issue of this great enterprise the glory and perpetuity of\u000a\u000aour Empire rest and that we must spare no effort and no sacrifice by which ultimate success may be achieved.  (Loud cheers.)

aVMy Lord Derby, my lords, ladies, and gentlemen: I am not a stranger to this audience - (hear, hear) - nor do I re­quire any introduction, I hope, of an elaborate kind, either to my friends in Manchester or to the larger national gathering which is collected within these walls, and which represents every Conservative Asso­ciation in England. (Cheers.) It was to have been my happy fortune last year to have addressed in another great industrial centre a meeting which, if not as great and as enthusiastic as this - for I imagine that would be hard to find out of Lancashire and out of Manchester - (hear, hear) - at all events a gathering collected upon similar lines, and to deal with great national questions, but I was prevented by illness. Happily for myself, at all events, no such accident has intervened today - (hear, hear) - to prevent me speak­ing to you upon a subject which, if not as exciting as the war, which would have been my topic had I spoken this time 12 months - (hear, hear) - is, I firmly and conscientiously believe, not less intimately bound up with our greatness as a nation and our Imperial position in the world than even was that mighty struggle which we have now brought happily to a successful conclusion. (Cheers)Calumnies against the BillHad I spoken to this audience last year - at all events if I had had to deal with the calumnies and misrepresentations to which the war gave birth \u2013 I should have had 9-tenths of the nation, 99-hundredths of the nation, 999-thousandths of the nation on my side. And why? Because the subject was under­stood. Because the voice of the calumniator, though not silent, was crushed, was crushed by the knowledge which the whole country had of the true issues at stake. I have perhaps therefore tonight a more difficult and a more responsible task before me, because I have to recognise that, up to the present time at all events, the voice of the calumniator has been too long uncontradicted, and that it is full time that this country should show that it is capable of distinguishing truth from falsehood, and that it is not to be hoodwinked even by the most elaborate and ingenious travesties of the truth. It is a melancholy reflection that the misstatements which have been sown broadcast for so long should have been readily accepted even by those of whom we might have expected and hoped better things. I received a letter not many days ago from a correspondent whose bona fides was obvious. He said to me, \u2018Absurd as it may seem to you, I do implore you when you speak at Manchester to contradict these two falsehoods which are believed here, even by many of the best of the artisan and working classes.\u2019 And what do you think those misstatements were which I was gravely asked to contradict? One of them was that the Education Bill which is now before Parliament, and which is absorbing at the present time the whole political attention of the country, did away with Board schools; and the second misstatement was that in the rate-supported schools of the future denominational teaching would be required by law. Now, if these two things can be believed about the Education Bill, anything can be believed about it. They are not only untrue, they are not only falsehoods of the blackest character, but they are falsehoods the falsity of which could be seen in five minutes by anybody who had taken the trouble to read through the Bill. And yet such is the courage - if I am to use the most com­plimentary term at my disposal - such is the courage of our opponents, so confidently do they count either upon the ignorance or upon the indifference of our countrymen, that this kind of lie can find persons shameless enough to propagate it, and others credulous enough to believe it.The reasons for introducing the BillNow there is one preliminary question which I often find asked by those who have but slightly followed this controversy. They say to me: Why did the Unionist Government ever start this unhappy dispute? Why have you, by bringing forward an Education Bill, filled the land with these insensate clamours from north to south, and from east to west? Why have you disturbed the social peace which might have lasted, had you not taken the course you thought fit, for an indefinite period? It is a perfectly fair question. I will give it a direct and, I hope, an intelligible answer. The answer is this, that the existing educational system of this country is chaotic, is ineffectual, is utterly behind the age, makes us the laughing-stock of every advanced nation in Europe and America, puts us behind not only our American cousins but the German and the Frenchman and the Italian, and that it was not consistent with the duty of an English Government, of a British Government, to allow that state of things longer to continue without an adequate remedy.The evils of the present systemWhat were, what are the evils under which, educationally speaking, this great country at the present groans? I have got so much to say to you on the subject of education that I am only going to touch on the heads, the main points which I wish you to bear in mind. In the first place, then, from a local government point of view, we have the absurdity of two rating authorities dealing with education, both with power to draw upon the local resources. But the local government point of view I quite admit is not the worst point of view. From the educational point of view, to begin at the top - or to begin, at all events, if not at the top, at the point immediately underneath our University system - you have the great county councils and borough councils of this country, corporations like the great Corporation of Man­chester, building technical schools like that which I hope to have the honour of opening tomorrow, but without the smallest power so to arrange the education in their district that those who are expected to profit by these great technical schools shall come to them with adequate preparation. The Corporation of Manchester at an enormous cost has built this great institution, the glory not only of Manchester but of the whole of Lancashire. And yet the Corporation of Manchester at this moment is incapable of dealing with secondary education, with higher elementary education, and with elementary education which, if they be not all treated as one organic whole, make all this expenditure vain, empty, and useless, a cost to the ratepayers, but no benefit to the industrial community.Many authorities: no unity or connectionTo go a step lower, there is at this moment in England no public authority which is capable of supplying secondary education in its true sense, and when you come to that higher primary education which has been illegally carried on by the School Boards, though I heartily sympathise with the objects they had in view, when you come to deal with that you have under the existing system, between the Corporation on one side and the School Board on the other, inevitable overlapping, unless you come, as the public spirit and common sense of Manchester has been able to come, to some kind of arrange­ment between those bodies whom the State has thrown down to fight it out as best they can in their midst. And when, leaving higher elementary education, I come to that elementary education which is the necessity of every class in the community, and to which we justly require every man in the land from the highest to the lowest to subject his children, what do we find? Under the existing system we find Board schools which are in no relation either to the voluntary schools on the one side or to the secondary schools and higher technical schools on the other, and we find the voluntary schools, educating, remember, more than half of the children of this country, we find them in many cases starved for want of funds and incap­able of carrying out - properly, at all events - the great duties entrusted to them by the community.The duty of the GovernmentNow, I say that that is a system which this Government, if it was to be worthy of its name, could not tolerate. I say that is a system we are bound to reform, and therefore, when I am asked why the Government have disturbed the serenity of the social calm which existed before this Bill was introduced, I say we did it in obedience to the greatest mandate which a Government can have, in obedience to the duty which devolves upon the whole adult community, that the nation should see that the children of the nation are brought up to carry on and, if possible, improve the traditions of their forefathers. I am told that by the course the Govern­ment have adopted we have given a tonic to the Radical party. I do not grudge it them. They want it. But even if they did not want it, I should think we were utterly unworthy of the confidence which the nation has reposed in us, if for mere party and transitory reasons we had refused to deal with this great problem which pressed for solution.The central principle of the BillAnd what is our solution? I am not going into it in detail, but in substance it is this - that we should put all the branches of education of which I have spoken under the control and supervision of those great public assemblies, the borough councils and the county councils of the country. That is the central principle of the Bill. On that everything else hangs, and I shall have to ask you to remember that fact when I come in a few moments to deal with one of the greatest controversies which this Bill has aroused. We want those great municipal and county authorities to co-ordinate the higher with the lower education, to provide secondary education and higher elementary education without overlapping. We want them - and this is one of the most important things that needs to be done - we require them to train teachers. At present, under our existing system, we find no machinery, no adequate machinery, no tolerable machinery, no machinery that any other country in the world but our own would stand for a moment. We want this municipal and county authority to provide the machinery for training teachers, and we want it to control all the schools with­out exception, so far as secular education is concerned, in which the children of our people are educated, and to see that, so far as secular education is concerned, they are properly equipped and adequately staffed. Remember, then, that the Bill is an organic whole, which deals with a great and admitted evil. It deals with it on a fixed and intelligible plan, and no amendment ought to be admitted into the Bill which destroys it as an organic whole. Very well. So far I do not say I have a unani­mous opinion behind me. Can anybody say that on any subject unanimity is to be expected in this country, and least of all upon the subject of education? But so far I do believe that, if we could eliminate all other points of controversy, the educa­tionalist of this country would come into line with the Govern­ment.The religious difficultyWhere, then, is the difficulty? The difficulty, as you know, lies in religion. Our countrymen, by a vast majority, are of opinion - and personally I agree with them - irrespective, I believe, of political party or Church membership, that religion should be taught to the children of this country. Unfortunately, while we are on the whole agreed on that point, we are not, and probably shall never be, agreed as to what religion should be taught to the children of this country.An ideal system Now, the ideal system - the system which we would set on foot had we the power to reconstruct society - would be that every parent sh\u000a\u000aould find provided for his child a school in which religion should be taught after the manner desired by that parent. That is the ideal system which carries out the principle of ideal justice, but evidently it is not a practicable system. The divisions of religious opinion among us are unhappily so great, and are unhappily of such a character that it is quite impossible that if you are to have compulsory education in the public schools of the country you can so arrange it that every parent should, as a matter of course, find at his doors a school in which religious education is given according to his own particular beliefs.The next best systemVery well, what is theoretically the next best system? In my judgment the next best system theoretically is probably what I may roughly call the Scottish system, and I do not say so only because I am a Scotsman. In the Scottish system there is absolute freedom given to each locality to give the religious teaching which a majority of that locality think desirable for the various classes of parents in the locality. That, in my belief, is a very good system. It works well in Scotland. It works well in some parts of Scotland where the divisions of religion are of the acutest kind. But I do not think it is practicable in this country for reasons which at this moment it would take too long to enter into, but one of which I will just mention in passing. It is this - that that system cannot be adopted unless you abolish the Cowper-Temple Clause and that, as you all know, is by the great body of Nonconformists in this country valued as a portion of the system of education with which they will never willingly part.The only possible alternativeWell, if the Scottish system is impracticable, then I venture to say that the only possible alternative in which there is even a semblance of justice is one which, while it permits so-called undenominational teaching in schools entirely supported out of public funds, permits denominational teaching in schools which are not so wholly supported out of public funds. And therefore, in my judgment, any plan is absolutely inadmissible, and ought not to be contemplated by any Government, or passed by any Parliament, or supported by any constituency which destroys as part of that system the voluntary schools of the country. In other words, so long as you choose to maintain the Cowper-Temple Clause in the schools wholly supported out of public funds, so long must you as a matter of simple and elementary justice allow voluntary schools, outside the wholly rate-supported schools, in which denomina­tional teaching can take place. And when I find - I was going to say our Nonconformist friends, but that is an unfair way of putting it - when I find certain extreme Nonconformist agitators looking forward to what they call a national system of education, and when I discover that that national system of education is one that exactly suits the Nonconformists, but does not suit other people, then I say that that system o\u000a\u000a" type="text/javascript"> f education may have many merits, but does not deserve the merit of being called national. You will observe, then, that I am brought as regards secular education to the single authority - that authority being the county council or the borough council - and that as regards religious education in this country we must as part of our system, so long as we maintain the Cowper-Temple Clause, maintain the right to have the children of that party of the nation which desires it taught in voluntary schools. I believe that the conclusion to which I have thus brought you - I hope at not too great length - is one that commends itself to the moderate men of all parties, whether Churchmen, whether Nonconformists, whether Roman Catholics, or whether belonging to any of the other sects, or to no sects into which the community is divided.Two schools of thoughtWhere then, you will ask me, is the difficulty? The difficulty largely arises because those who hold the general theory of education which I have ventured to propound are divided, and must naturally be divided, into two schools of thought - those, on the one hand, who, agreeing that we must retain our voluntary and denominational schools, are more preoccupied in seeing that there should be adequate popular control for those schools; and those, on the other hand, who agree that there should be adequate popular control, but who are more preoccupied on their side that the denominational character of those schools should not be interfered with. And a good deal of the difficulty has arisen - among those who agree with the general principles advocated by the Government - between those two opposite poles of thought or schemes of thought.The powers of the managersNow let me say that I think some of the difficulty has arisen owing to a misunderstanding of one of the terms used in the Government Bill - the term \u2018managers.\u2019 I think it very natural that anybody who saw the term \u2018managers\u2019 in the Bill would say: \u2018These are the people who have got control of the schools.\u2019 It is a mistake, but it is a natural mistake. I do not think it is a mistake for which either the Government draftsman or the Government are responsible, because we have borrowed the term \u2018manager\u2019 from the preceding Act of 1870, and in the Act of 1870 \u2018management\u2019 and \u2018manager\u2019 are terms which do not carry with them the idea of control. It is only necessary to remind you of the case, for example, of the London School Board. The London School Board controls all the rate-supported schools in London, and the rate-supported schools in London contain the majority of the children in London, and, as you know, the metropolitan area is the largest area probably which ever has been, which ever could be, placed under the control of one local education authority. But the London School Board has the control of its schools. In each of the schools there are managers. In every Board school under the London School Board there are managers, but they have not got the control; and the theory of our Bill is that the control should be not with the managers, but with the borough council or with the county council, as the case may be; and I would venture to urge upon the friends of the Bill - for in this part of my speech I am dealing with the friends of the Bill, I shall have a word to say about its enemies directly - that if they desire, as the Government most heartily desire, that public control should be made a reality - and that it should be adequate to the amount of support given out of public funds - I would earnestly ask them to turn their attention not to the balance of power among the managers, but to increasing the authority of the borough council or county council as the case may be.Increased power to the local education authorityThe reason I make this appeal to them is twofold. If they succeed in modifying the Bill in the direction of making the managers the real controlling power over the schools they would violate that great principle of the Bill which I have endeavoured to explai\u000a\u000an to you, the principle that education should be in the hands of the unifying authority of the borough or county council; so that to increase the managerial power at the expense of the county council or the borough council is really violating the general principle of the Bill, and is running counter, I cannot help thinking, to the soundest view of the direction in which education reform should proceed. That is one reason why I would ask them to turn their attention rather to increasing the power of what is called in the Bill \u2018the Local Education Authority\u2019 than to increasing or modifying the balance of power or want of power among the managers. But there is another reason.Taxation and representationI have constantly heard it urged, I have constantly read it in the controversial pamphlets, that this Bill errs by dividing taxation and representation. In my judgment nothing would tend more to divide taxation and representation than handing over the real control of the elementary schools in this country to any authority, call them managers or call them what you will, other than the county council or the borough council. Who raise the rate? Who pay the rate? The county council and the borough council raise the rate. The constituency of the county council and the con­stituency of the borough council pay the rate. Let them control the schools, let them have the real control over secular education. If, for example, in a country parish you were to make the real controllers of the school the local managers, if you allowed them to draw upon the funds of the county council, then, indeed, you would violate that constitutional principle, then, indeed, you would divorce repre­sentation from taxation, then, indeed, you would be open to some of the criticisms which, in my judgment, are most unfairly passed upon this Bill. Therefore, let me say that I hope the House of Commons - if it be anxious, as it ought to be anxious, to see that there is adequate popular control over secular education - will devote their attention to increasing the really true and effective authority of the borough council or the county council, as the case may be, rather than to merely manipulating the constitution of those who, so far as secular education is concerned, are merely servants and ministers of the borough or county council. I have dealt with one school of thought among those who are friendly to the Bill, those who are anxious - legitimately anxious - to increase popular control.What the Voluntary Schools give upMay I add this one observation? Anybody reading the literature of this subject - if you can call it literature, let us rather say the flood of pamphleteering that has been poured forth upon the country - would suppose that the voluntary schools have everything to gain and nothing to lose by this Bill, nothing to lose, I mean, in the way of the authority of the existing managers over those schools. That is a profound delusion. This Bill, in its aim of unifying and co-ordinating national education, asks sacrifices from many and not least from those who manage our voluntary schools at the present time. No doubt there are schools to whom this Bill will be very little but pure gain from the managers\u2019 point of view; but there are many others who will come into it with grave misgivings and much reluctance, and if anybody doubts that I would ask them to consider this imaginary case. Let us suppose that the Bill became law in the shape in which it was introduced so far as what is known as the option clause is concerned - in the shape, that is to say, in which each local authority had the power to decide whether it would adopt the Bill or not. Let us further suppose in regard to the new grant of a million (or I should say it is a little less, let us call it a round million) which is promised by the Exchequer to the elementary schools of this country - let us suppose that that proportion which would belong to every county which adopted the Bill was given to a county if it did not adopt it, but divided, not as the county would have divided it, had it adopted the Bill, but equally among all the schools, Board and Voluntary alike; who, then, I ask you, in a county which under my suppo­sition had not adopted this Bill, would clamour that the Bill should be adopted? Would it be the managers of the voluntary schools? Or would it be the Nonconformist agitators? My belief is that if that experiment were tried it would be found that no county council or borough council would consent to see themselves excluded from the management of education in their district; while the voluntary schools, of course, their resources aided by the new grant, would go on happily and merrily, not, indeed, forming part of what we want to see created - namely, a great uniform national system of education - but still quite happily for themselves and free from all inconvenience arising from elected managers or from meddlesome county councillors. I think if anybody will meditate upon that hypothesis they will see that my proposition is not without its justification - the proposition, I mean, that after all the voluntary schools in this country are giving up that which in many cases their managers greatly value when they are obliged to fall in with this new scheme of national education.Threatened refusal to pay ratesWell, I turn now from arguing over the details of the Bill with its friends to making a few comments upon its foes. It is a very curious thing that this Bill when it was introduced was most favourably received by the House of Commons, that it was favourably received by the County Councils\u2019 Association. and it was favourably received by the Municipal Corporations\u2019 Association, and that it was not until Parliament separated and the extreme agitator was turned loose to spend his holidays uncontradicted in inflaming the country that we heard of all these extraordinary defects which the measure is now supposed to contain - defects, mark you, so grave that, if we are to believe what we see in the public prints and what I learn from my own personal correspondence, there are a large number of conscientious Nonconformists who seriously think, not only that they will be justified, but that it will be their duty to refuse the payment of rates when this Bill comes into force.Unworthy of the citizens of a free countryWith regard to that attitude, as I believe, a genuine and conscientious attitude, I do not desire to speak with disrespect; but may I say, if that is consistent with respect, as I hope it is, that I think this attitude quite unworthy of the citizens of a free country. The Constitution of this country gives to the electorate and to Parliament, the organ of the electorate, the power to deal with legislative matters. It is always in the power of the electorate, and always in the power of Parliament, to reverse a decision previously come to, and in a free country it is not admissible that any individual, simply because he dislikes, or, it may be, disapproves, or even, it may be, vehemently disapproves, of the action either of the majority of his countrymen or of a Parliament of his countrymen - it is not legitimate for him to disobey the laws of his country. They say their objection is conscientious. Of course it is conscientious; I hope all objections are conscientious; but if I conscientiously object to anything that Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman does, am I, therefore, justified in refusing my rates or my taxes?Capable of indefinite applicationIs not this principle that, whenever you disapprove of the action of the Ministers or Parliament or the electorate, you may immediately refuse your rates, capable of indefinite application? I do not like Home Rule; suppose, per impossibile, the Radicals passed Home Rule, am I going to protest by refusing rates and taxes? Is civilised government possible on terms like that? Does not the whole idea of a free, self-governing country contradict it? Well, it may be said that is a very sound maxim for the ordinary affairs of life and the common legislation of Parliament; but here is a question in which morality is fundamentally involved.A challengeWell, I make a challenge. I make a challenge of a very simple kind. Will anyone tell me what this fundamental principle of morality is? I will engage to show either that it is, on the face of it, not a fundamental principle of morality, or that, if it is, it has been consistently violated in England and Scotland by Nonconformists for the last 30 years. I think it probable, I think it certain, I can prove one or other of those propositions to you, and I think I can almost promise that I will prove both. Well, that is a fair challenge which I think every Nonconformist who conscientiously believes that he is bound to put his house­hold furniture up to auction as a protest against this Education Bill is bound to answer before he goes further.The conscientious NonconformistsBut as I am talking to the conscientious Nonconformists, may I say with what extreme pain I have found myself in con­flict with them over this Bill. To a mere political fight I need hardly say I have no objections. I have been inured to it from my youth up. But when I find people with whom, perhaps, on broad questions of policy I agree, and whom when I do not agree I am anxious to treat with every respect, when I find them really hurt and apparently suffering under a sense of wrong over this Bill, I quite honestly admit that it gives me great pain, and I would very gladly do anything I could to meet their objections. Though I am told every day of my life that I am trampling upon their rights, that they are being deprived of their privileges as citizens, that their consciences are being out­raged, I can most truly say that, having given the subject every consideration, I think in a spirit of great impartiality, while I understand that there can be differences of opinion about the Bill, I cannot understand how it is that they can find that this particular class of objection can weigh upon their minds.They gain much and lose nothingI ask myself, do they object to the Bill as it is, or to the Bill as it is represented to be? Is it the measure that we have been discussing at such length, and on the whole, though with prolixity, without violence in Parliament, is it the Bill they object to? or is it the extraordinary travesty, parody, and caricature of that measure - no, I will not call it caricature, because a caricature involves resemblance of some sort - which has been presented to them by the political agitators who have been deafening us for the last six weeks? I have never, in a now rather prolonged political experience, known the art of misrepresentation carried to such cynical lengths. I have never known any body of agitators draw with such apparent security and confidence upon the credulity of their fellow countrymen. They have improved, so far as I have observed, upon all previous methods. We are quite familiar with mere misrepresentation. We know the orator who misdescribes the subject he is dealing with; but those gentlemen have gone much further than that. What they have done is to take everything in the present system, in the present chaotic educational system under which we groan, and take everything in that system to which the Nonconformists object, and to say of it, this is what the Bill imposes upon you, even in a case where the Bill remedies it. I will give you an illustration. It is stated over and over again that the working man is to be deprived of his school, that the \u2018people\u2019s schools\u2019 by this Bill are to be taken away from the people. Now observe. The people\u2019s school! I presume by the people\u2019s school is meant the Board school. But under the Bill the Board school is left to a body popularly elected, and by a far better electoral machinery than is the School Board now. But in addition to that, the volun­tary schools, which now are not under popular control at all, are by this Bill placed absolutely under the control of a popularly-elected body; so that instead of taking away from the people the people\u2019s school we are giving to the people all the schools they did not possess and in which their children are now educated.Position of the ClergyOne other example I may perhaps give you, indeed I must give you, because it has figured so largely in this controversy. I see it in pamphlets. I see it in speeches. I see it in letters to the papers. I see it in an endless private correspondence, that this Bill increases the power of the clergyman, and that it is intended and devised for the purpose of increasing clerical control, that its object is for ever to put the public schools of this country under the heel of the clergy. Everybody who has followed this controversy will admit I have not exaggerated what has been said. Now let me say that I think a great injustice has been done to the clergy of this country. You would have supposed, to hear these people talk, that the common thing in England was for the children of reluctant Dissenters to be hounded into some elementary school and there taught by force doctrines to which their parents violently objected. So far as I know, you may go from parish to parish in rural England, and you will never find the religious controversy or the religious difficulty existing. You will never find it has occurred to the mind either of the parson or the parent. You will find that different sections and different creeds live in harmony, and that the rare occasion on which the contrary is the case is but the exception which proves the rule. You will also find this - that if the clergy have been left, as I think they have been left, too large a share in the elementary education of this country, it is not because they were greedy of power, but because in parish after parish, and in district after district, the only man ready to take the trouble and make sacrifices of time and energy for the education of the children of the parish was this much-abused clergyman. Well, that is a parenthesis. The argument I was dealing with, the allegation, the shameless and the most impudent allegation, is that this Bill puts education under the heel of the clergy. Precisely the reverse is the fact.Powers of clergy reduced, not increasedAt present (and permanently, if you refuse to adopt this Bill) at present it is true that, for the reasons I have stated - reasons not discreditable to the clergy of this country - in a vast number of parishes there is what is called a one-man control of schools, that one-man control being the control of the clergyman of the parish. But that is the system which exists now. That is the system which will remain if this Bill be rejected. That is the system which will remain if, in the phrase which was used, we either withdraw the Bill or dissolve. But what is the system which this Bill introduces? That is the point. I say that the typical case - I do not say it is universally so - will be that whereas the clergyman of the parish is at present sole manager of the education of his parish, now under the Bill he will be one of six managers. In most cases there will be added to him five laymen, two of them very likely, in many cases certainly, not belonging to the same denomination as himself. What do these agitating controversialists mean by saying that a scheme like that puts the education of the country under the heel of the clergy - the clergy being in a minority of one to six among the managers, the lay managers being five in number - and the managers not having the control of secular education in the schools? The control of that secular education lies with the county council or borough council, and in the case of the borough council, at all events, the clergyman is by law prevented from having a seat upon it.Powers of Nonconformists increasedOne more audacious misstatement I must mention. It is that this Bill, in the words of some pamphleteer or other, rivets the denominational system upon this country. May I remind you that under the existing law, passed by a Liberal Administration, the denominational system is absolutely riveted on those places where the denominationalists have provided adequate school accommodation for the children in the district? The borough council or the county council, or any other popularly elected body you please, is powerless. They cannot build a school to suit the Nonconformists. The Nonconformists are obliged to go, whether they like it or not, and in whatever number they may be, to the Church of England or the Wesleyan or the Roman Catholic school, as the case may be. I consider that that is a monstrous system. I believe it is depriving them of a liberty they should possess; and that liberty will be given them by this Bill. It will give to them the power which has never been theirs before - should the circumstances of their district require it, to build out of the rates, out of the public funds, a school which would suit those whom the voluntary and denominational schools and the district do not suit. And yet we are told that this Bill \u2018rivets denominationalism on the country.\u2019History repeating itselfThese charges are as cynical in substance as they are violent in language; but I take comfort to myself. At first I admit I was rather disheartened that such misunderstanding should occur among an intelligent population, but I have looked back upon the history of the Act of 1870, and I take comfort. That Act is now quoted by the militant Nonconformists as the great palladium of their liberties, as the great gift of a Liberal Government to them; but I find that when the Act of 1870 was passed the self-same epithets of which I have been the special recipient were put at the disposal of Mr. Forster, and that he, then the colleague of Mr. Gladstone responsible for that Bill, was abused by the same people and in the same terms. He was opposed by the same methods, the same demonstrations, the same banners, the same threats not to pay rates, and by the same abuse that is now showered upon us in such profusion at the present moment. I saw the other day a piece of doggerel which, I believe, was sung to a hymn tune at the recent great gathering near Leeds. Its author, I believe, was the secretary of the Northern Counties Education League. I do not know whether it is more remarkable as poetry or as history, but as history I observe that it associates together as the givers of free education to the people men who were violently opposed to the Act of 1870, which it praises. Let me parenthetically remark that it was the Conservatives who gave free education. That is not what I want to dwell upon. What I desire to point out is that this historian-poet now seems to think that the Act of 1870 was the joint and harmonious work of a body of statesmen who, as a matter of fact, differed violently upon it. This gives me great hopes for the future; and I believe that when 20 years hence - let us say in 1922 - some future poet, of a similar calibre, shall hymn the Nonconformist view of education, I shall be found associated with perhaps Mr. Lloyd-George as one of the authors of that great and Nonconformist educational reform known as the Education Bill of 1902.The aims of the agitatorsWhat are these men aiming at? I am not talking now of the friends, perhaps the critical friends, but still the friends of the Bill. I am not talking now of the conscientious Nonconformist of whom I spoke just now. I am talking of the political agitators. What is it that they want? If they really and genuinely wanted the Nonconformist grievances remedied, would not they hail with acclamation a Bill which deals with so many of the real difficulties under which they labour? Would they not hail a Bill, for example, which gives, what is not now given, a real opportunity for Nonconformist teachers to be trained? Would they not hail a Bill which, according to the promises which I have made on behalf of my colleagues in the House of Commons will give to pupil teachers, Nonconformist pupil teachers, opportunities which at present in the rural districts they do not possess, and which in the existing state of the law they cannot acquire? Would they not hail a Bill which deals - which, as I have indicated, the Government desire it should deal - with what are called \u2018single-school areas\u2019 in the country where there is but one school and that a Church school, to which the children of all denomi­nations are obliged to go? Would they not hail with acclamation a Bill which enables them for the first time in our history to build out of public funds a school according to their own views, and, if you will, their own prejudices even in those places where at the present time all necessary accommo­dation is provided by schools belonging to one or other of the denominations? So much for the Nonconformist grievance. Again, if they sincerely desire to do away with that clerical influence about which they talk so much, about which they raise so many spectres, would they not be the first to hail with acclamation a measure which, whatever else can be said of it, certainly ought to earn this tribute of praise, that it is a great measure for giving the laity their full share in the education of the country? If they really believed that their children were being perverted - I know not into what paths, what religious paths or by-paths - would they not hail a measure which prevents any clerical eccentricity, and which puts it in the power of laymen, if need be, to regulate those matters connected with the education of the children of which complaint has been occasionally made? And, above all, if education be their object, ought they not to hail with pleasure a Bill which gives all the benefits which I described earlier in my speech in respect of the proper organisa­tion and unification of national education? Ought they not to hail a measure which from the highest to the lowest step in the educational ladder will co-ordinate and will arrange and will provide that no working man shall send his child to an ill-equipped school, which will provide that no working man with a child of really superior attainments shall be debarred from making his way through one grade to another of higher education until he has fulfilled his natural destiny? Would they not hail with pleasure a scheme which will give to the people of this country an absolute unlimited complete control over secular education in all public elementary schools?Their objects - political, not educationalI do not believe those questions can be answered. The real truth is that these agitators are not animated either by a desire to diminish Nonconformist grievances, or by a desire to minimise clerical influence, or by a desire to improve education. Their objects are political. What they wish is first to turn out the present Government, a relatively unimpor­tant matter; but they wish in the second place - and they avow it - to avoid any such reform of our educational system as shall save the voluntary schools from slow and gradual extinction. What does that mean? Let us suppose they defeat this Bill, and with the Bill the Government, and then some kind of hybrid party comes in to take our places. Are they going to try a reform of education? Not they! If this Bill be rejected I see no hope, during my lifetime at all events, of a great educational reform. I do not believe these agitators desire it. They wish to see the difficulty of raising subscriptions grow and grow, and, with the growth of the difficulty, the voluntary schools one by one extinguished like lamps at the end of a feast, in order that when that happy consummation is reached they may have what they call a national system of education. That means that for 20 years or more you are going to have the voluntary schools - more than half the schools in the kingdom - starved, that for 20 years and more the children of the working men in this country are in a large number of cases to have an inferior education. A gentleman in the audience says that there will be Board schools for them to go to. But how, under the existing law, are you going to get Board schools in those places until the voluntary schools are extinguished, and how are you going to extinguish the voluntary schools?The education of the children at stakeThe slow and gradual extinction of the voluntary schools means the degradation of education during the whole time it lasts, and when it is accomplished - if it ever is to be accom­plished - then it means an enormous and quite unnecessary burden thrown upon the rates, and, what is far worse, a perennial religious controversy, dividing all men, sundering all parties, embittering all the relations of life, until those who sincerely believe that the purely undenominational educa­tion of Board schools is not what they want for their children can induce a Government to give them what they legitimately desire. Is that an idea which we should tolerate? For my own part, I think we have reached a point in the educational history of this country which is of capital and paramount importance. I am not going to dwell upon the consequences to our party or to the Govern­ment of any defeat of this measure. I am not going to ask you to consider the painful silence of friends, the ill-concealed contempt of enemies which would follow upon the abandonment of any plan so long thought out, so earnestly supported as this one. It is on no party or political ground that I appeal to this vast assembly. I tell you there are at stake issues more important than the fortunes of any political party, be it what it may. There is at stake the education of your children for a generation. And if for that time we - I mean the members of the House of Commons, the majority of the members in the House of Commons - it we hesitate either through a desire to avoid a little extra trouble, or through the fear of a few loud-mouthed speeches or men­dacious pamphleteers, to do our duty and carry through this great reform, then I say we shall receive the contempt of the parents of the children living and to be born, for the next generation, and that contempt which we shall receive we shall most justly and richly have earned. [1] The Cowper-Temple Clause (Section 14 of the Act of 1870) provides that in schools built out of the rates no religious catechism or religious formulary distinctive of any particular denomination shall be used. There is no restriction of this kind upon the Board Schools in Scotland.

aVMy Lord Derby, ladies and gentlemen, I mean to talk to you tonight upon one subject, and one subject alone, not because there are not many other topics of deep interest to this nation on which I should like to address you, but because I am well aware that you first want to hear what I have to say upon the subject of tariff reform.  (Hear, hear.)  And if that subject is to be dealt with at all, it had better not be limited by the introduction of other alien themes.  Now, ladies and gentlemen, this is not a new subject; it is not a new subject in this hall, it is not a new subject discussed by the Conservative Association.  On the contrary, all who will look back over the records of this great association, drawn from every part of England, whom I now have the honour to address \u2013 all, I say, who will study these records may convince themselves that the subject of tariff reform has never been absent, or but rarely absent, from your deliberations.  At all events, within the limits of my political recollection there have been varieties of opinion held upon this subject within the limits of one united Party.The Rise of Tariff ReformWhat is it, ladies and gentlemen, which has suddenly brought this topic \u2013 I am sorry my voice is not all I could wish \u2013 (cheers) \u2013 what has suddenly brought this subject, often before you previously, into the exceptional prominence which it now holds.  There are those who would attribute this new importance which it has acquired to a great speech delivered by a great man \u2013 (cheers) \u2013 in the month, I think it was, of May last.  But, after all, it was not in May last that Mr. Chamberlain \u2013 (loud cheers) \u2013 not in May last \u2013 Mr. Chamberlain first uttered sentiments which he there expressed with such burning eloquence, and something more is required to account for a phenomenon unparalleled in the political experience of any man whom I am now addressing.  What, then, is the reason why tariff reform has suddenly come so much to the front.  I attribute it to more than one cause.  In the first place, remember that the late war has brought us into closer and more conscious touch with that great Colonial Empire, of which this country is the centre.  Remember, also, that the Prime Ministers and representatives of those Colonies brought before this country and the Empire, in the most categorical and explicit terms, the question of tariff reform in connection with our Colonial Empire.  And, remember, also, that there has been for some time past \u2013 long, indeed, before the recent developments of this tariff controversy \u2013 there has been a growing uneasiness as to the condition of British trade in its relation to the trade of the world.  (Cheers.)Growing UneasinessIf you want to have evidence of that fact, don\u2019t look at the speeches that have been delivered since tariff reform came to the front.  Look at the speeches delivered before that epoch, then you will have some impartial test, some undoubted guide as to the opinions held on this subject; and if you look at the speeches, the papers, the pamphlets, and the articles written on the subject of technical education, written on the necessity of meeting foreign competition by increased efforts in this country \u2013 a movement which I heartily sympathise with \u2013 (hear, hear) \u2013 and which I have in my way to the best of my ability, done my best to promote \u2013 (cheers) \u2013 if, I say, you look at those speeches, delivered by men of all shades of opinion, you will see that I am not exaggerating when I say that there has been or some years past a feeling of growing uneasiness as to the industrial place of Great Britain among the industrial nations of the world.  (Hear, hear, and cheers.)  Therefore, when Mr. Chamberlain made his speech, the speech no doubt to which we date back \u2013 and naturally date back \u2013 this particular movement; the speech itself would have had no effect comparable to that which was actually produced had it not fallen on ground prepared for it by circumstances \u2013 (cheers); had it not dealt with a problem that every man conscientiously or unconscientiously began to put to himself.  Now, that feeling was greatly intensified by what occurred in relation to Canada\u2019s Imperial effort to give preferential treatment to this country.  (Cheers.)  You all have the particulars of that incident in your mind, how Canada gave preferential treatment to our manufactures, and how thereupon Canada was threatened by at least one foreign Power with some species of retaliation for the effort she had made.  That brought home, I am convinced, to many minds the consciousness of our helplessness under our existing tariff system to deal with a situation of that kind.Tariff to Meet TariffYou can\u2019t go to war over tariff questions.  Tariff attacks can only be met by tariff replies.  (Loud cheers.)  And I think every Englishman felt, when he heard that there was some danger lest that great Colony should be penalised for her efforts after closer Imperial union; every Englishman, I say, felt that we were helpless indeed, under our existing tariff system, to meet with a situation so unexpected and so dangerous \u2013 (cheers); and that feeling of helplessness has not been diminished by a survey of the commercial history of the world during the last two generations. Sixty years have passed, or nearly 60 years, since the greatest, or at all events, the most notorious step was taken in the direction of tariff reform in this country, in the great epoch between 1841 and 1846.  Those sixty years have been filled with refutations of the prophecies made by the great tariff reformers.  (Hear, hear.)  I am not going to say a word against those tariff reforms.  I believe them to have been appropriate, and indeed necessary, at the time they were made.  (Hear, hear.)  But the time they were made is very different from the time in which we live \u2013 (cheers) \u2013 and every year which has passed, at all events in the latter half of that sixty years, during the generation of which we in this room have some personal recollection, is a contradiction of all the hopes, all the aspirations, and all the prophecies which then filled the mouths and the minds of men.  (Hear, hear.)Cobden\u2019s PropheciesI am never one of those who attack Mr. Cobden because he has made a great many prophecies which have been falsified.  Any of us who are rash enough to make prophecies, and are famous enough to have those prophecies recorded, are pretty sure sixty years hence to find ourselves very much in Mr. Cobden\u2019s position.  At all events, if he was unfortunate, he was only a little more unfortunate than the rest of his fellow creatures.  (Laughter.)  The observations I have to make upon these prophecies is not by way of criticism of Mr. Cobden, but, if criticism at all, of Mr. Cobden\u2019s followers; because he laid down, or he is supposed to be responsible for laying down, a certain doctrine of fiscal policy adapted to the world in which he lived - adapted to the world which he thought he had the right to foresee; but not adapted to the world in every respect, at all events, in which we at this time live.  (Cheers.)  What was Mr. Cobden\u2019s ideal?  No one will deny that he was a patriot, but I think few who have studied his life and writings will pretend that the sentiment of nationality had any large place in his philosophy of politics.  He looked forward to a world in which national divisions might indeed remain, but their emphasis would be largely diminished, if not wholly effaced, in which the divisions between nations would in no sense correspond with fiscal or commercial divisions, in which Free Trade would have swept asunder altogether all rivalry between men of different race, of different creed, and of different political institutions, in which the world would commercially be one without artificial barriers, and in which production would follow its natural line, and in which international manufactures would take, not a competitive, but a co-operative shape.  That was his ideal, and he drew from it the conclusion that upon a world thus industrially organised, that in such a world war would be a practical impossibility; that nation would be so linked to nation by commercial and financial ties, it would be impossible for either national ambition, or for national vanity, to break the great peace which was to brood over the face of the world.  Who shall deny that that ideal had in it elements of great nobility?  Not I, for one.  But that ideal world is not the world in which we live.Face the Actual FactsIt is not merely \u2013 and let th\u000a\u000ais be noted, for it is important \u2013 it is not merely that Protection has survived this relic, this barbarous relic, as Mr. Cobden would have thought of a past time; it is not merely that nation is still divided from nation by political and racial peculiarities.  The actual facts are far stronger and more significant than that.  What has happened is that the sentiment of nationality has received an accretion of strength since that time of which no man then living can have dreamed for a moment, and that contemporaneously with this growing sentiment of nationality we have found Protection in foreign countries, not holding on as the creed of an obscurantist minority, but growing in strength day by day, and day by day more and more separating the nations commercially from one another.  I regret it.  I regret it.  I think it is a matter of profound regret, but, after all, we have to take account of the facts of the world in which we are living, and neither an individual nor a nation can venture, with any prospect of felicity or success, to act as though he lived in an ideal world, and not in the world which actually, and, as a matter of fact, surrounds him.  (Hear, hear, and cheers.)  Well, I am afraid that in these years we have too much been in the position of dreamers, confident in the beauty and the virtue of our own ideal, refusing to see that it was not conformed to by our neighbours or the world with which we had to deal; and the result is that we have watched for 50 years, without saying a word, or making a sign; we have watched the wall of hostile tariffs growing up, dividing nation from nation, and dividing us from the Protective nations of the world.  (Hear, hear.)  And we have seen our own Colonies, our own flesh and blood, the very sinews of the Empire that is to be \u2013 (cheers) \u2013 building up one vested interest after another, with a system of Protection which, when it reaches its logical and its natural conclusion, will have made it as hard for us, their Mother Country \u2013 pledged to defend them, bound to them by every tie of affection and regard \u2013 it will make it as hard for us to export the results of our industry, enterprise, and capital, as we now find it to export those results to America, or to other Protective countries.  I don\u2019t know whether there is anybody who has faced these facts in their integrity, who can look at them with indifference.  But the fact remains that for the whole period of the lifetime of any man I am now addressing, we have done nothing whatever, either in regard to foreign markets or in regard to our own Colonies, to hinder a state of things so absolutely inconsistent with Free Trade as Mr. Cobden understood it.  (Cheers.)Cobden\u2019s French TreatyI ought, however, to make one exception.  I have said that no effort has been made.  That I believe to be, in strictness, incorrect.  One effort, one great effort, and in its measure one successful effort, was made, and it was made by Mr. Cobden himself.  I allude to the famous commercial Treaty with France negotiated in 1859, and brought to a successful issue in 1860; and when I consider the history of that treaty I ask myself whether Mr. Cobden was indeed a Cobdenite.  (Hear, hear, and laughter.)  What was the essence of the treaty of 1860?  We were then in process of completing that great series of reforms \u2013 for which I may incidentally remark it was Tory and Conservative statesmen chiefly, who obtained the credit for that great system of reform which did so much for English commerce, and set so good an example to the world.  In 1859 there were certain taxes still in existence which the then Chancellor of the Exchequer and the financial authorities of the day thought might well be repealed, but for the repeal of which they desired to obtain from the French \u2013 at the time perhaps the most Protectionist nation with whom we had large dealings \u2013 they wished to obtain from the French Government some concessions in the direction of free exchange of goods.  Now I want to put to you this question; the duties which were promised to the French Government as a consideration for some diminution in their Protective tariffs were, as I have told you, duties to which no value was attached, but the contrary, by the British Exchequer.Retaliatory Taxes JustifiedWhen Mr. Cobden negotiated that treaty, he and those who sent him, must either have been resolved to keep on those duties if the treaty failed, or they must have been resolved to give them up in any case.  If the latter \u2013 if they were determined to give up those duties which on their merits they desired to repeal, then they were asking from the French Government consideration without value received.  And the most complimentary epithet that I can imagine for a diplomatic transaction of that kind is that it was extremely dexterous.  (Laughter.)  The epithets that I should be inclined to apply are of a less complimentary description.  (Renewed laughter.)  But I do not think that those less complimentary epithets are deserved.  I believe that Mr. Cobden, who was the emissary, and Mr. Gladstone, who was the Chancellor of the Exchequer, when they were dealing with the French Government of the day, did not mean to indulge in these over-dexterous tactics, but they did say to them, and meant to say to them, \u2018If you will give us increased facilities for our exports, we will remit these taxes; if you will not give us increased facilities we will retain these taxes.\u2019  I think that is the only interpretation I can put, consistently with the honour of the persons concerned, upon that great commercial transaction.  But if so, then in the opinion of Mr. Gladstone and Mr. Cobden in 1859 and 1860, it was legitimate to keep on taxes which would have been from a purely Treasury and Revenue point of view, illegitimate, in order to put pressure upon a foreign Government to relax theirs.Self-Complacent IndifferenceThere is no economical distinction.  There may be a distinction from the point of view of practical difficulty, but there is absolutely no economical distinction whatever between keeping on a tax for diplomatic purpose which you would otherwise repeal, and putting on a tax which you would otherwise not have put on for carrying out the same objects.  (Cheers.)  I do not know, ladies and gentlemen, whether this point has ever been dealt with by the Cobden Club.  (Laughter.)  If not, I respectfully commend it to their attention.  Well that, so far as I know is one exception in all these years, the one effective exception of our attitude to a somewhat self-complacent indifference to the tariff proceedings of our great commercial friends and rivals, and the tariff proceedings of our own Colonies.  I don\u2019t think it is to our credit.  (Hear, hear.)  And I confess that when I hear criticisms \u2013 criticisms in which I sympathise, taken by themselves \u2013 when I hear criticisms upon the American and the German policy, which has caused those great industrial nations to accompany their marvellous commercial expansion with Protective duties, which must have thrown a most heavy burden upon the consumer, I feel that they have a retort to which I, at least, have no reply.  They may well say to us that, although they have been thus Protectionist, at all events within the limits of their own country they have established permanent Free Trade.  And at this moment, within the circuit of the German Empire, and within the vast ambit of the American Commonwealth, all duty, all restriction upon Free Trade, everything which can hamper production, everything which can limit the increase of wealth, has been abolished by their patriotism and their foresight, and they may well ask whether we in the British Empire can point to a similar picture, and whether at this moment that Free Trade of which we talk so much, and of which we boast so justly, is a Free Trade extending beyond the limits of the four seas, and whether it even includes those great self-governing Colonies which we proudly boast are to be the great buttresses of our Empire in the future.  (Cheers.)Sufferings under Free TradeI take it, ladies and gentlemen, that it is quite impossible for any man to say, I know it is quite impossible for any Free Trader to say that we have not suffered deeply and profoundly by foreign tariffs in this country.  (Hear, hear.)  Free Trade is indeed an empty name, and a vain farce, if, in fact, foreign nations are setting themselves to work to divert our industries into channels into which they never would have naturally flowed, to exclude our manufactures from their markets, to limit as far as they can the international play of supply and demand \u2013 I say Free Trade is indeed a farce if those things do not produce an evil effect, not merely upon the country which imposes Protective duties, but on the Free Trade country \u2013 and there is but one \u2013 (cheers) \u2013 which has to endeavour to the best of its ability to pierce them.  And I do not believe that the evil of foreign Protective tariffs is limited to their mere exclusion of our products from their markets.  There has been a development of which Mr. Cobden and Mr. Cobden\u2019s contemporaries never dreamed, a development of the trust system under the protection of those tariffs which inflicts an injury upon the capital, and still more upon the workmen \u2013 (hear, hear) \u2013 of these islands.  The phenomenon is so new that I dare scarce venture to prophesy what developments it is likely to take, whether it is going to expand into a great national danger, or whether it is going to be limited to the evils which I fear it has already inflicted; but of this you may be absolutely sure, that in the combination, that in the alliance of trusts and tariffs, there is a danger to the capital, to the enterprise of this country, which reacts, not mainly, not principally, upon the capitalist, for he is always at liberty to go to those happier regions where his industry will be looked after, but will fall with the heaviest weight upon the artisan and labouring classes of this country \u2013 (cheers) \u2013 who have no methods, or no methods known to me, by which they are capable of protecting their interests against such a calamity.  (Hear, hear.)    No Cure, But Only a PalliativeNow, if I have rightly described the dangers, and the evils from which we suffer, you have a right to ask me whether I know of a cure.  (Cheers.)  My answer, I am afraid, will be a disappointing one.  I know of no cure; but I do know of a palliation.  (Cheers.)  I am not going to stand up here on an occasion when it is my duty to advise the great Party of which, for the moment, I am the chief \u2013 (cheers) \u2013 it is not, I say, my duty to draw an imaginary picture of the blessings to follow from the remedy, or from any remedy which I have to propose.  I know of no cure; the ill has gone too far.  You will not get the great commercial nations of the world to abandon Protection.  You will not get, I fear, our great self-governing Colonies to retrace all the steps which we have, without remonstrance, permitted them to take.  I therefore say there is no complete cure of the evils that I have described.  But I think there is a palliation, and it is that palliation which I am here to recommend to you today.  (Cheers.)  Remember what the situation is which I have endeavoured to describe to you.  Mr. Cobden supposed that the world was going to be a Free Trade world, in which trade would follow its natural courses, unhampered by the devices of statesmen and politicians, untouched by the influence of international treaties.  That is what he hoped.  That is what he believed.  What, in fact, we have got to deal with is a world in which these international commercial relations are regulated entirely by treaty, and are governed entirely by the arrangements come to between the different nations concerned.An Impossible PositionIt is common sense that in a world which is commercially governed by treaty we, the greatest commercial nation of all, should come forward and say, \u2018We will endeavour to arrange treaties with you.  We have nothing to give you \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 we have nothing to withhold from you.  We throw ourselves upon your mercy, and upon your consideration.  (Renewed laughter.)  Remember, please remember, how good we are to your commerce, how we throw no impediments in its way, how we do all we can for you, and please don\u2019t forget us when you are making your next treaty.\u2019  (Laughter.)  Well, well, I am incapable of believing that a nation which deprives itself of its power of bargaining is a nation which is likely to make very good bargains.  I have been asked by friends of mine whether there really is any ground for believing that we should make better bargains if we had the freedom of negotiation which I ask you to give us.  (Loud cheers.)  I confess that the very question seems to me to show that the questioner lives in a world of economic phantasmagoria, with no relation whatever to the realities in which, fortunately or unfortunately, our lot is cast.  Are commercial bargains different from every other bargain?  Are negotiations between nations, which have to deal with duties upon manufactured goods \u2013 are they different in essence and in character from other negotiations carried on for other purposes?  (Voices: No.)  And did any man ever hear of a country going into negotiations for these other purposes, which ever came out of those negotiations with a trace of success, unless they had in the course of those negotiations something which they could offer, and something which in case of necessity they might withhold?  (Cheers.)Freedom of Negotiation: Mr. Balfour\u2019s DemandsMy request, therefore, to you tonight is the fundamental and essential request to which everything I have to say in the remainder of my speech is subsidiary and accidental \u2013 my fundamental request is that the people of this country should give to the Government of this country from whatever Party that Government may be drawn, that freedom of negotiation of which we have been deprived, not by the force of circumstances, not by the action of overmastering forces, not by the pressure of foreign Powers, but by something which I can only describe as our own pedantry and our own self-conceit.  (Cheers.  Voice: \u2018How can we give you that power?\u2019)  I have stated the fundamental proposition, which I wish to affirm, but I agree with my friend opposite that it is necessary for me, though it may not be interesting to you, that I should answer some questions which will inevitably be asked as to the manner in which that freedom for which I ask is going to be used.  (Hear, hear.)  I would, however, observe that that question is often put in a manner which I regard as highly unreasonable.  I suppose there is not a man in this room who denies that we ought to have a fleet, a navy, but am I, or any other Minister standing in this place, am I to tell you how that navy is to be used in 1904, 1905, 1906, or 1907?  (Cheers.)  That is a kind of prophecy which neither I nor any other man can make.  (Hear, hear.)  All you can say is this: That it is absolutely necessary for this country to have at its command, in case of need, a great navy.  (Cheers.)  And it is necessary, though I admit less necessary, but it is necessary in my judgement, that this country should also have at its command those instruments of negotiation for which in general terms I have already pleaded.  (Cheers.)  But though I think the question is thus put very often in a most unreasonable fashion, I am perfectly ready to answer it, so far as in my judgement it can be answered, by hypothesis and prophecy.  Well, let it be noted that I have brought before your attention two separate aspects of one great problem.  I have pointed out to you that we have allowed, so to speak, the world to slide into this system of high Protective duties against this country without effort and without remonstrance, but that world which has thus acted partly consists of our own Colonies, our self-governing Dependencies, who have fiscal, and must always retain fiscal autonomy, and partly it consists of foreign nations properly so-called.A Colonial and a Foreign ProblemThe problem connected with the two is evidently a distinct problem, though it arises from the same difficulty, and springs from the same root.  And as regards the first of those, our relations with our Colonies, let me say I think we have in this country been strangely blind, and strangely dull \u2013 (hear, hear) \u2013 to the abnormal and anomalous situation in which the British Empire is placed in these fiscal matters.  You will find many cases in which fiscal union has been the prelude to that closer, and more intimate union, which is the basis of national strength.  (Hear, hear.)  I may mention as a Scotsman \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 the case of England and Scotland.  If any of you will consult your histories you will see that what reconciled the smaller kingdom to union with the greater kingdom was no love of being under a British Parliament, but the sense that it was absolutely necessary for national existence, or, at all events, for national prosperity \u2013 (hear, hear) \u2013 that England and Scotland should be fiscally one.  (Cheers.)  And that union, which began merely, so to speak, on a fiscal basis, has grown, as we all know, in a manner which has welded the two people together in an inseparable unity, which it will not be given to any hostile force ever to divorce.  (Cheers.)  If I wished to load my speech with historical illustrations, I might, of course, point to the case of Germany \u2013 different in many respects, but resembling the case of Scotland in this respect, that the fiscal union began before that political union, which has been the greatest incident in modern European history.  (Hear, hear.)  Well, we have been content apparently, so far as our Empire is concerned, to see divisions, fiscal divisions, growing with our growth, and strengthening with our strength, and at the very moment that the population and the wealth of our Colonies are increasing, and in other respects the sentiment of a common interest of a common blood, and of common institutions is gaining strength, at the very moment I say we see these fiscal divisions growing up, of which no man can prophesy the ultimate result, but which I venture to say no man of sober judgement or any knowledge of history can contemplate without disquiet.  (Cheers.)  Well, that is the first branch of the problem.  I am disposed to say that in many respects it is the most important branch, and I have sorrowfully to admit that it is also the most difficult branch.  And for this reason.  The evil has been allowed to grow, both by us and by our Colonies, to a point in which it is probably incapable of any complete solution, and in which even an attempted solution, so far as I am able to see, would involve taxation of food in this country.Impossibility of Taxing FoodNow, I do not think the public opinion is ripe in this country for the taxation of food.  (Hear, hear.)  I have given the matter my most earnest consideration, and this is the conclusion at which I have arrived.  Of course, all must admit - I don\u2019t care what their opinions are - all must admit that the taxation of food - indeed, every kind of taxation, is in itself an evil. (Hear, hear.)  But I think that the evil of the taxation of food, so long as that taxation is kept within very narrow limits \u2013 I want to tell the whole truth to this great audience \u2013 the evil of taxation on food, kept within these narrow limits has been exaggerated beyond what reason and logic justify.  But I think, nevertheless, that for historic reasons that feeling, though it does go beyond what logic and reason seem to justify is one of those ingrained \u2013 perhaps ingrained means necessarily permanent \u2013 but is one of those sentiments born of the history of a people, of which it is absolutely necessary that every practical statesman should take account, and of which I do take account, and which I believe you cannot traverse with impunity.  And the reason is not far to seek.  Compare the case of France and of England.  In France at this moment it would be impossible for any legislator to attempt to make a breach in that theoretical equality which for historic reasons, burned into them by the great struggle of the French Revolution, every Frenchman believes in, or most Frenchmen believe in, as an immutable creed.  An Englishman cares little for speculative equality, what he wants is liberty.  (Hear, hear.)  Very well.  The Frenchman, however, is tolerant to a degree incredible among us to any taxation of food, all his food.  You remember it is a country governed under as democratic a government as our own, and taxation on food is part of their normal system, and they are not content with having taxation on food for what we should call national and Imperial purposes, but they pay what we pay out of our rates very largely by taxation on food.  (Hear, hear.)  Very well.  Now take the case of England.  In England we had no French Revolution.  There is not burnt into us by our historic experience any of the feelings which animate the French on the subject of equality; but the memory of the misery endured by our working classes, and especially by the agricultural labourer, in the days when wheat was at 70s., 80s., or 100s. per quarter, has become associated, though I admit with very little historic propriety, but is has become associated with the question of the abolition of the corn tax.  It burnt into the historic imagination of the people; it cannot be eliminated by the best logic, the most conclusive reasoning, or the most eloquent speeches.  (Hear, hear.)  I am therefore distinctly of opinion \u2013 I am speaking here as one who is bound to give advice to a great Party on the policy which they should regard as their official policy \u2013 (hear, hear) \u2013 I am bound to give you, as the best results of my reflection, to ask you to adopt the conclusion that a tax on food is not \u2013 with the public opinion in the state in which it is \u2013 within the limits of practical politics.  (Cheers.)  So much for the Colonial branch of the question.A Tariff War Not IntendedNow you will ask me how I mean to carry out, or how I contemplate should be carried out, that liberty of negotiation for which I ask in respect of foreign countries.  Well, there are a great many people who seem to think that if we ask for liberty of negotiation in respect of tariffs with foreign countries, we mean to enter into a general tariff war with the whole world.  No such idea, no such expectation, is entertained at all events by myself.  (Hear, hear.)  I don\u2019t know whether most of you have sufficiently followed the practice of foreign countries in their tariff negotiations.  What they commonly do, or what they often do, is to have what they call a combative tariff, a very high tariff placed upon all foreign goods, which they then proceed to reduce for the benefit of other nations, who give them something in return.  So that they start with an immense general import duty on all foreign goods, which they reduce for consideration received.  (Laughter.)I contemplate no such procedure with regard to this country.  I think it would involve far too great a disturbance of our habits, of our practice and of our trade.  But I do think that we might with advantage proceed from the other end, and, if it suited us, and if we thought we could do it without disadvantage to ourselves, which, after all, is the guiding policy in these matters \u2013 (hear, hear) \u2013 we might inform any foreign country who we thought were treating us with outrageous unfairness that unless they modified their policy to our advantage, we should feel ourselves compelled to take this or that step in regard to their exports to our country.  (Cheers.)  Now, I do not for a moment suggest that foreign countries are animated by a desire to destroy our trade simpliciter; what they want to do is to improve their trade at our expense, which is perhaps rather a different thing.  (Cheers, and laughter.)  But, in any case, are you not trying them too high by your present system?  Is it fair, supposing they want to do us justice \u2013 let us assume that \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 is it fair to go to their negotiators and say, \u2018Well, we have nothing to give you; we cannot hurt you.  Our principles are such that you may kick us round the room, and we will only say it is according to principle, but please treat us as well as you can.\u2019  (Great laughter.)  Now, I do not think that is fair on the foreign negotiator, and I think he will be greatly helped to do us justice if he knows that behind our requests for justice  there is a method of exacting it.  (Loud cheers.)  Now, ladies and gentlemen, I have spoken at an outrageous length \u2013 (\u2018Go on\u2019) \u2013 but I have been most anxious to be perfectly clear and perfectly explicit as to the advice I want to give you, and, if I may say so, through you the country at this moment. You will admit I have not clouded my statement by any verbal rhetoric or attempt at eloquent declamation.  I have tried to give you the bare outlines of rather a hard and difficult argument.Mr. Balfour\u2019s Self-CatechismBut, in order that I may be absolutely beyond reproach, and that no man will be able to say tomorrow or hereafter, that I have been obscure, in order that every misunderstanding shall be apparently and obviously a wilful misunderstanding, I will for one moment \u2013 and it shall only be a moment \u2013 conceive myself asked certain questions by this audience.  It is not in accordance with procedure on this occasion, as it is during a General Election, that there should be self-appointed questioners upon the burning topics of the day.  May I erect myself for the moment, on your behalf, into a questioner, and may I put questions to myself?  (Hear, hear, and laughter.)  Very well.  The first question I put to myself is this.  I can imagine the gentleman who interrupted me \u2013 (a laugh) \u2013 most courteously, most courteously, about twenty minutes ago \u2013 I can imagine him putting this question.  He may say: \u2018Do you mean to come forward and ask the country to reverse the verdict arrived at in the great lawsuit between Free Trade and Protection in 1845 and 1846?\u2019  My answer is simple and plain.  I regard the controversy of 1846 as of no interest whatever to us now \u2013 (cheers) \u2013 except simply from a historical point of view.  I care no more for the quarrel between Mr. Cobden and his opponents than I do about the Bagarian controversy, which I expect nobody in my audience has ever heard of.  All that was appropriate to 1845 and 1846, but it is utterly inappropriate to 1903 and 1904.  (Cheers.)  Our grandfathers fought out their battles as men, and with a view to the actual situation of the world in which they lived.  Let us in that respect imitate their example, and let us not be misled by musty debates, living enough to those who took part in them, but which are as dead to us as ours will be to our grandsons 60 years hence.  (Hear, hear.)  That is the first question I put.  The second question I have imagined being put to me is this, \u2018Do you desire to reverse \u2013 to alter fundamentally \u2013 the fiscal tradition which has prevailed during the last two generations?\u2019  Yes, I do.  (Loud cheers.)  And how, I may imagine my questioner going on, do you propose to alter that tradition.  I propose to alter it by asking the people of this country to reverse, to annul, to delete altogether from their maxims of public conduct the doctrine that you must never put on taxation except for revenue purposes.  (Hear, hear.)  I say distinctly that in my judgement the country ought never to have stood self-deprived of that liberty; that it ought publicly to resume in the face of Europe and the world that liberty of which it has deprived itself.  And though, of course, the liberty so resumed may be abused \u2013 I don\u2019t doubt it \u2013 it may get into incompetent hands \u2013 it should be resumed, and this country should again have what every other country in the world possesses, and that of which no other country in the world would think of depriving itself \u2013 the liberty of negotiating with something to negotiate with.  The next question I can imagine being asked of me is \u2018Why do you want to resume this liberty of negotiation seeing how well the country has prospered for all these years without it?\u2019  To that my reply is, I hope, explicit and distinct.  My object is to mitigate, so far as circumstances allow, the injury done to us by hostile tariffs.  (Hear, hear.)  Those hostile tariffs have inflicted upon us injury of a double kind.  (Hear, hear.)  They have divided one fragment of the Empire fiscally from the other.  They have diverted our industries into channels in which they would never naturally have flowed; they have restricted and hampered our export trade, and by restricting and hampering our export trade their effects have acted and reacted over the whole community \u2013 the community of consumers, and the community of producers for home consumption.  These are the evils.  In addition, the third of the evils is the insecurity which I fear some great branches of our industry suffer, and must suffer so long as we permit protective duties in combination with trusts to pour into this country at unnatural prices goods which, under a true system of Free Trade \u2013 under a system, I mean, in which every country produced according to its natural capacities \u2013 would never be able to compete and never be able to oust the industries of home origin.  (Cheers.)  Two other questions, and only two other questions, have to be asked.  \u2018Will the remedy you propose be complete?\u2019  To that I answer: It will not be complete, even if it could be tried in its integrity, and it cannot be tried in its integrity because I believe that the country will not tolerate the tax upon food.  And if the last question be asked me: \u2018Then do you think it is of any value?\u2019 - to that I reply with equal clearness, emphasis, and decision, undoubtedly it will be useful.  There have been plenty of occasions in the past, and believe me there will be plenty of occasions in the future, when a British Minister having to conduct a great commercial negotiation, will feel his hands strengthened, will feel that he is indeed able to represent the interests of the great country whose foreign affairs he has to manage.  If he can say to some other \u2013 if he can say to the Ministers of the country with whom he is negotiating, \u2018We don\u2019t ask you to reverse your commercial policy; we don\u2019t ask from you anything which is impossible, but common justice and common fair treatment we do ask, and if we don\u2019t get it, we will take our own measures.\u2019  (Cheers.)\u2018I Mean to Lead\u2019Now, my lords and gentlemen, I hope, at the risk of some length and some tedium \u2013 (\u2018No, no\u2019) \u2013 I have at all events avoided any kind of obscurity.  I have been asked to give a lead.  I think the request was a reasonable one.  A man who, however unworthy, is called upon to lead a Party must lead it \u2013 (cheers) \u2013 and so long as I am in that position I mean to lead it.  (Loud and prolonged cheers, and \u2018What about Joe?\u2019)  I have given this great topic my best thoughts, my most earnest consideration, and I am firmly convinced that the policy which I now recommend to the Party and to the country is not only in absolute harmony with all our best traditions \u2013 (hear, hear) \u2013 not only finds its precedents in the statements of all our greatest leaders, is not only in perfect conformity with the spirit of the great body which we here represent, but that also and beyond all that, it is the best which this country, depending as it does, and depending as it does solely, upon its commercial and manufacturing position in the world, it is the best which this country can adopt.  In that faith, in that belief, and with all earnestness of purpose, I recommend to your favourable consideration.  (Loud and prolonged cheering, during which Mr. Balfour resumed his seat, having spoken just an hour and 20 minutes.)
p186
aVLord Winchester, my Lords, ladies and gentle­men, I think your Chairman has tonight struck the right note in the few words which he has just addressed to you. It is by no will of mine that this great assembly coincides with a moment of national difficulty (hear, hear). Long ago was it arranged that the representatives of the Con­servative opinion throughout the country should meet here; long ago was it determined that Southampton should be the spot on which, for this year, the topic which interest us as citizens and as members of a great party (hear, hear) should be thrashed out and discussed. Ladies and gentlemen, since all the arrangements which have brought together within these walls the great gathering I am now addressing there have been events which have stirred to their depths the feelings of every section and every class of the community (hear, hear), every inhabitant of the United Kingdom, and every subject of his Majesty beyond the seas (cheers), all the great English speaking peoples of the world (cheers), and I think I may add the general sentiment of civilised Europe (cheers). Ladies and gentlemen, under such circumstances as these I should certainly be doing violence to any own sentiments of what is appropriate, and I think I should be doing violence to your senti­ments of what is appropriate, if I dragged into the larger issue thus suddenly opened up any question, however important it might be, which dealt with any subject on which Britons of all political creeds, however varying their opinions on other subjects, are not in hearty agreement. The Leader of the Opposition, speaking I think two nights ago, uttered sentiments worthy on this subject, worthy of that high place which he holds, and which the Leader of an Opposition must always hold in the political life of a free people (hear, hear). It is true that he felt him­self bound to go into a large number of highly controversial subjects, and I do not blame him for that. I do not see he had any alternative before him, but he would be the first, I think, to agree that this is not the time at which I can most conveniently or appropriately deal with his allegations, tempting as that field of political dialectics may be, I refrain from entering on, and, indeed, the only observations which I shall make in the few words that I am going to say to you tonight which can be regarded as having the smallest party reference whatever are these. My utterances on a certain great question have been received with as many commentaries as if I was a classic, and they have been subjected or wrested into as many different meanings as if they were inspired. I suggest, and it is only a suggestion I make, that no man in or out of this hall should judge of my writings or my speeches upon economic questions by seeing what other people say of them (hear, hear), but they should read them for themselves (applause), and if they do that I am confident they will find that they are neither obscure, nor difficult, nor inconsistent (hear, hear), but that they represent a well thought out body of ideas which may be right or may be wrong, but which at all events stand there for public criticism, and must be judged by themselves, and not by their self-appointed commentors. Gentlemen, I must apologise for having even for a moment lapsed from the programme I have laid out for myself with regard to what I have to say to you this evening. And let me begin what I have to say by telling you that I hope and believe that it is wholly of a favourable complexion (cheers). Had it so fallen out that this meeting had been fixed for last night instead of tonight I cer­tainly could not have dared to preface my re­marks with any observation of that character. I think I may now say without raising unduly hopes which are likely to be dashed that so far as I am able to forecast the future, the lament­able and deplorable tragedy which took place on the night of last Friday will not end in one of those great international struggles (cheers) which, though they may be now and again in the history of the world necessary incidents in the collision of great interest, always leave a deplorable mark behind them, and always have had the effect of retarding the great progress of humanity and civilisation. In order that I may explain exactly the situation in which we now stand perhaps you will allow me to begin with something in the nature of a truism, but a truism which we are constantly apt to forget. The truism is this - That bad as war is to the principals, to the nations engaged in it it never has been, it never can be, it never will be waged between two great Powers without causing suffering and risks far beyond the circle of the subjects of those Powers and neutrals for whose Powers and neutrals themselves never do, and never can escape from some of the collateral evils which the condition of hostilities inevitably brings in its train. In all the great wars in which we were engaged, in which we were the protagonists of the nineteenth century, the period when some of the most glorious naval and mili­tary memories go back, in the days of what is called the great war, think not for a moment that we were able to pr\u000a\u000aevent some of the suffer­ing to those who occupied the position of neutrals. But while that is the inevitable incident of war, and while it is the duty of the neutrals to understand that this cannot be wholly avoided, nonetheless is it one of the most urgent duties upon the belligerents themselves, a duty which they should never be inclined to forget, and never be permitted to forget. But it is their business to make the positi\u000a\u000aon of neutrals as onerous as is consistent with the due fact of warlike operations. We have striven, I mean the Government have striven, supported by the House of Commons, and supported, I believe, in this matter by the country (hear, hear). We have striven to do our duty as neutrals with strict impartiality (hear, hear). I do not deny that we have had our difficulties. I do not deny that such incidents as those referred to by your Chairman in his opening remarks, such incidents as the sinking of the Knight Commander, such incidents as the strange vagaries of the two ships of the volunteer fleet (laughter), such difficulties as have arisen from the definition of contraband of war. I do not say that they have not strained, and greatly strained, and greatly increased the difficulties we have found in maintaining, as we have consistently maintained, the position of neutrals during the period of this great struggle (hear, hear). Well, everybody has recognised that among the difficulties incident to a neutral position were the possibilities of interference with commerce by the belligerents. Who, until last Monday morning, ever contemplated that among the dangers which neutrals ran was that of being fired upon during the progress of their peaceful avocations? (Hear, hear) Who ever contemplated that among the risks neutrals ran was the risk of being sunk, and having damage done, and even of danger to life (hear, hear), such an incident as that which took place in midnight last Friday? Who contemplated, who thought it possible, and who that did contemplate it, thought such incidents were possible? (Hear, hear) I think myself that these feelings of universal horror, indignation, and surprise, which filled the hearts of the whole civilised world. I think the character of those emotions was largely increased by the fact that it came as a complete surprise. No human being ever thought such incidents possible but everybody thought that if they were possible that these things were too horrible to be repeated. Now when we first heard of this story on Monday morning there was but one account for us, and the world of what had taken place. The horrified and startled fishermen who crowded into Hull on Sunday afternoon were the bearers - the only bearers - of the message of the tragedy in the North Sea. The Russian Fleet had gone on silently (shame), had made no sign, and on that day at all events we had only one version of this lamentable incident, and that was the version supplied to us by the trawlers on the Dogger Bank. The day before yesterday - yesterday morning - the situation changed because for the first time we had a counter story, an alternative version supplied to the Russian Government by the Russian Admiral. In the story of our fishermen there was much tragedy; there was no romance (hear, hear, and laughter). In the story of the Russian Admiral I don\u2019t know that there was any tragedy; but I am driven to believe that there was much tragedy (hear, hear). Now, ladies and gentlemen, for a reason that you will ap­preciate presently, I should under ordinary circum­stances have avoided expressing an opinion upon this part of the subject, because it is to be made the subject of an impartial and International in­quiry (loud and prolonged applause); and strongly as I feel, and strongly as I think every inhabitant of these islands must feel instinctively and without argument that the two stories, absolutely con­tradictory as they are in every particular which of these two stories it is impossible to doubt which is the one substantially true (hear, hear) - there would be no expression of my opinion on the subject until it has been investigated, as it will be by the Coroner\u2019s inquest by a Board of Trade inquiry, which we shall conduct under special circumstances with the assistance, I hope, of repre­sentatives of the Russian Government, but with a court which we shall constitute with special care, consisting of men who are authorities, and investigated as it will be in the third place and above and beyond all by that International tribunal to which I have just referred. I should not have attempted to prejudge it but for this fact, that if the story of the Russian Admiral be accurate it really is an attack upon our National honour (hear, hear). It carries with it the inevitable implication that we have not been doing our duty as a neutral power (loud applause). Now we are, it is true, the allies of Japan (cheers), and bound to assist Japan in certain well-defined circumstances (hear, hear), but just as we should make it a point of honour, if the case contem­plated by that treaty should ever arise, to use our whole national power to fulfil our ob­ligations (hear, hear), so until that case arises it is a point of honour with this Government, as it would be a point of honour with any British Government, that our duty as neutrals should be scrupulously performed. Looked at from this point of view, what is the story which has been communicated by the Russian Admiral at Vigo to his chiefs at St. Petersburg (\u2018A lie\u2019). He tells us - he tells the world - that on Friday night he was suddenly attacked (laughter) by two torpedo boats (laughter), that he fired upon them, that he sank one of them (laughter), that the other was injured - I don\u2019t know what has happened to it since (laughter). He tells us, further, that the reason he did not remain to assist the fishermen whose boats had been sunk was that the fishermen showed themselves hostile (laughter), were accessories to the attack, and that the fishermen were guilty of complicity, and en­deavoured to pass through his lines (laughter). Several questions inevitably suggest themselves in this connection, with this account of the affair which I should not put to a British audience in ordinary circumstances because they are obvious, but which I think ought to be stated for the reason I have just given, on the present occasion. In the first place I should like to ask how fishing boats, how trawlers, with their nets down, which, as I need hardly tell the inhabitants of Southampton, are probably the least moveable of floating craft; how they could attempt to pass any lines or engage in any hostile operations is incredible on the face of it. In the second place I should like to ask something about these tor­pedo boats that made the sudden attack. The Russian fleet was 30 miles out of its course (hear, hear), when it went to the Dogger Bank. Thirty miles, I think, is the actual distance. It had every reason to know - because every seaman does know - that at the Dogger Bank you would in all probability find a large fleet of vessels engaged in the peaceful pursuit of trawling. I may be permitted - every seaman knows it, but to empha­sise that general statement, let me read one or two sentences which I have translated from the Russian official sailing directions. On page 13 of these sailing directions you will find these words: \u2018The inexhaustible quantity of fish, especially cod, on the Dogger Bank attracts hundreds of fishing boats, which renders navigation difficult, especially at night\u2019 (hear, hear), and you will find on page 142 a sentence which runs as fol­lows, the material part of it runs as follows: \u2018The Dogger Bank, which is always crowded with fishing boats\u2019 (applause). The Russian Admiral went 30 miles out of his course, and the place was crowded with fishing boats, and there he found lying in wait among these fishing boats two torpedo boats (laughter). Why did the commanders of those torpedo craft choose that particular station for preparing their attack upon the Russian fleet? Why did they, gentlemen, choose it, knowing the nature of the case involved publicity? The very fact that Dogger Bank is crowded with fishermen, and crowded with fishermen of all nationalities, would make such an operation absurd on the face of it; and if these mysterious craft wanted, as I presume they did, to conceal their very existence from the public eye, would they h\u000a\u000aave gone over the whole North Sea and chosen as the only spot open to them that where publicity was inevitable and certain. And, in the second place, if they had wanted to lie in wait for the Russian fleet, by what extraordinary powers of prevision did they foresee that the Russian fleet would go 30 miles out of its course? (laughter and cheers). I think myself justified in publicly expressing - in­deed, more than justified - required to express publicly my disbelief in the existence of these phantom Japanese ships, not merely because, in the opinion of an expert whom I have had the opportunity of consulting, the nearest Japanese ship of war is 14,000 miles away, but because, as I have said, if two Japanese torpedo craft are really hunting the North Sea, or were hunting the North Sea, till one of them was sunk, they must have a base (hear, hear), and unless the sugges­tion is that the base is France, or Holland, or other countries bordering on the North Sea, I presume it is believed by the Admiral - not, I am convinced, believed for a moment by the Russian Government - but it is evidently believed by the Admiral that we have been giving them, contrary to our duty, our plain duty as neutrals, been providing them with a base. It is pure fancy. A base in an island like Britain, where everyone that comes to our shores is scanned, her character interpreted, her nationality known, in a country where all this is public property, and where with all our merits we are not good at keeping a secret is it conceivable by the most hostile witness\u000a\u000a\u000athat we should, for I don\u2019t know how many days, weeks, or months, been harbouring Japanese sailors and Japanese ships of war without knowing it ourselves, without the Russians knowing it, or without its being dreamed of in any part of the civilised world. I enter my most emphatic protest, as a member of his Majesty\u2019s Government, which is responsible in these matters against the allegation which affects, as I think, our honour as neutrals (hear, hear). More on this point I do not say, because if the truth be, as I think it is, and as I know every man whom I am addressing thinks it is (hear, hear), that truth will, I hope, be made manifest and clear as noonday, when that inquiry which, as I think, in the most, statesmanlike manner the Czar welcomes (hear, hear), when that inquiry takes place. I have mentioned the Czar and the Russian Government. Let me say in this connection that I think it is but bare justice to them to say that they have not at any time underrated the gravity of the crisis or failed to do what they could to diminish it. Remember that the wheels of diplomacy move slowly, and I shall not be thought offensive if I say that perhaps the wheels of Russian diplomacy move specially slowly (laughter). At all events, there have been occasions when that opinion has been borne in upon us. But in this case re­member that the North Sea tragedy was known to nobody until Monday morning, and that with­out delay the Russian Government expressed their deep regret at the occurrence and promised ample compensation to those who had suffered (interrup­tion). Well, that is only part of the subject. I am quite aware of that, but I am coming to the other part. They also, even at the beginning, indicated that any wrongdoer in this matter ought to receive punishment (hear, hear); and in ordinary times I do not think that any special difficulty would have arisen. Whence did come the special difficulties of this case? The special difficulty in this case came from the fact that the fleet which had committed what we, at all events, in this country, must be permitted to call an outrage, was on its way illimitable. If it was done the wrongdoers were fleeing from Europe, and if they had witnesses to produce for their version of what has taken place, those wit­nesses were being carried with them far from the control of any court, national or international. That is the difficulty. That was one difficulty. Well I am glad to say that I think that difficulty has been got over (hear, hear). There was another difficulty. The other difficulty was this. The Parisian Admiral, if the accounts of his views which have appeared in many sources of information be at all correct, and perhaps they are not correct, has a theory of the rights and duties of a belligerent fleet as against neutrals which really make the high seas a place of public danger (hear, hear). He defends naturally enough the action which be took on Friday last in the North Sea. In his name views have been put forward which would seem to justify, in his view, a Russian fleet, or any belligerent fleet, firing at large on any ship, upon any errand, which came too near them (laughter) by night, or I suppose by day. Now we, as your Chairman has remarked, are the guardians of the maritime, are among other great nations guardians of the maritime which ought to bind civilised countries. We must be the first to admit that there are circumstances in the theatre of war in which it is inevitable that neutrals should be put to inconvenience, or if they be rash even to danger. I do not see that in the China seas for instance it is possible for a Japanese or Russian fleet to treat the ordinary commerce of the world as if war was not going on, but there should be the proviso that such powers must be used with the utmost discretion, and reckless or indifference to cruelty ought to be avoided by every man who has the interest of civilisation or of his own country at heart. But while we have to admit that there may be circumstances in certain theatres of war-like operations where the neutral must be conscious in his movements, are we to allow - can the civilised world allow for a moment that all channels of commerce from St. Petersburg to Vladivostok; that all oceans, the Pacific and the Atlantic, that all the narrow ways of commerce, like the English Channel or the Red Sea, that those situated thou­sands of miles from the theatre of military opera­tions; is the Admiral to pass unscathed, unchal­lenged, unpunished (\u2018No, no\u2019), if he uses his supposed rights - his supposed rights as a belligerent to the danger of the peaceful neutral carrying on his ordinary avocation? The Russian fleet, I am told, one portion of the Russian fleet, I think, are going down the West Coast of Africa, and the other through the Mediterranean to the Red Sea. I do not know whether - I am only supposing - the principles which seem to underlie the judgment of the Russian Admiral are carried into effect they may meet on some dark night in the solitude of the ocean some homecoming transport, or liner approaches within the magic distance, and the ship which once carried the lives of privileged neutrals is fired upon. The ship is sunk, like the torpedo boat, in the North Sea, and the fleet pur­sues its way, happy in the consciousness that it has destroyed another of its enemies. There is an entry at Lloyd\u2019s that such and such a ship has not returned, and has left no record; the waves close over the tragedy, nothing more is heard, or, indeed, in the circumstances which I have supposed - can be heard, and countless families are in mourning, or a British Regiment is wiped out of existence, or the sailor, who carries out an avocation dangerous enough itself, has found a new danger and an unexpected fate in the course of his perilous undertaking. Is that a position which it is possible for neutrals to tolerate? (\u2018No, no; never\u2019). A fleet animated by the policy; a fleet of commanders to whom that policy commends itself as the one which duty forces upon him is a fleet which would have to be hunted out of existence (loud applause). If civilised commerce is to pursue its way unimpeded - and I am glad to say that in those views the Russian Govern­ment agreed with us (hear, hear), that they take the view, as I understand, which I am sure com­mends itself to other civilised nations, and they are giving orders, or have given orders, which shall prevent a recurrence (loud applause) of the tragedy which has filled our hearts with sorrow, and, I think, the hearts of most, of all, of those who have heard of it at all with something ap­proaching indignation. Now, I have nearly done (\u2018Go on\u2019), because I have surveyed the case from the beginning to the end, and I have shown you what it is that the Government think we ought to obtain, and I have indicated to you that what they think they ought to obtain we believe that we have attained (loud applause). The Russian Ambassador authorises a statement to the following effect: \u2018The Russian Government, on hearing of the North Sea incident, at once expressed its profound regret, and the Russian Emperor tele­graphed to the King in the same sense. The Russian Government also promised the most liberal compensation. The Russian Government have now ordered the detention at Vigo of that part of the fleet which was concerned in the inci­dent (loud applause), and those officers responsible and those officers who are material witnesses will not proceed on this voyage to the Far East (loud applause). An inquiry is to be instituted into the facts, and we and the Russian Government are agreed that an International Commission on Crimes, as provided for by the Hague Convention - I ought to any that is nothing to do with arbitration - shall find out the facts, and any person found guilty by this tribunal will be tried and punished ade­quately (cheers). The Russian Government say that precautions will be taken to prevent a recur­rence of such acts, and that special instructions with this object will be issued (cheers). Now, ladies and gentlemen, I think we must admit that the Russian Government has shown an en­lightened desire that truth and justice in this matter should prevail (hear, hear). Only a few hours ago I had myself taken a very gloomy view of the possibilities of the circumstances, and therefore of a peaceful solution of the question. I think the Czar has shown himself an enlightened judge of what is right in this matter as between nation and nation. We have asked nothing of others that I believe we should not gladly have granted had we been in their places. We have shown no desire - and I don\u2019t think such a desire was in the heart of any man - to take advantage of what perhaps might be called Russia\u2019s difficul­ties to enforce our demands. We have appealed simply to justice, to equity, to the principles which ought to govern the good relations between nation and nation (hear, hear), and we have not appealed in vain (applause). It might have been far otherwise. We might have seen the delays of diplomacy intervene, we might have seen one excuse urged after another, until either the Rus­sian fleet had vanished into the Far East or until other things had happened (hear, hear, and laughter). That we have not seen this is due, I hope, in part to the justice and moderation of our requests, is also due to the far-sighted wisdom of the Emperor. The world has now got its eye concentrated on one great warlike tragedy moving through its appointed course in the Far East. It would have been appalling if that great tragedy had been doubled by another, the greatest calamity that could perhaps befall mankind, a struggle between two First Class Powers. Speak­ing for the Government, I am sure we have done all we can consistently with national honour (loud applause) to avert that calamity. And speaking for my colleagues, I gladly grant that we have been met in the right spirit by the Government with which we had dealings. To say that the incident is closed and over would be too much, but surely, after the account which I have given you tonight of what has occurred, after the glimpse you have had of the national diplomacy of the last four or five days, you will not think me sanguine in hoping that the spirit of reason and justice which has brought us through the most difficult parts of this controversy without the supreme calamity of war, will still preside over the councils of nations, and that the greatest of all calamities, the calamity of a war between two European nations will be avoided. If it is I can promise it will be avoided without dishonour to this country. I think I may also venture to say that it will do nothing but credit to the ruler of that great Empire whom we have been so nearly coming into collision, but with whom it my earnest hope and sincere belief that our good relations shall remain undisturbed (cheers). I hope tonight I have brought you good news (cheers, and hear, hear). I have, indeed, touched upon no question which divides our countrymen. I hope I have said nothing which can in the smallest degree embitter international relations (hear, hear), and though I have spoken, as you may well see, under a heavy sense of responsi­bility, and under considerable difficulty, I do think that the events of the last few days, though they can never wipe out the tragic occurrence of Friday, will not bring in their train any of those widespread calamities which at one time I almost feared they might do. Ladies and gentlemen, I have done. I do not suppose that at any meeting of the Conservative Associations has a Minister had to speak under the circumstances in which I have had to address myself this evening. Certainly, never has a Minister had a more sympathetic audience (hear, hear), and you will allow me, while congratulating the country and Russia and Europe and the world on what I believe will be the result of the last few days\u2019 negotiations, you will allow me to add those larger wishes, my own thanks to you for the manner in which you have received me upon this historic occasion (prolonged cheering).

aVMr. Chairman, Lord Aberdeen, Ladies and Gentlemen, - Never since it came into being has that great political engine, the National Liberal Federation, found itself at its annual meeting in such circumstances as now surround you. I go further, and say that never within the memory of any man among us has the country seen such a political situation. This is a constitu­tional country. (A Voice: It used to be.) Well, we thought it was, but the close observer of recent events may well begin to have his doubts. The form of government under which we live is that of a limited monarchy. The power of the Crown, wisely exercised, cheerfully and loyally obeyed, sincerely respected, and endeared to us by gratitude for faithful practice, is yet subject to restriction.The Will of the PeopleWhat is the power that restricts it? It is the will of the people. It is not the fiat of a Minister, it is not the wishes or ambitions or interests of any junta or coterie of politicians. And how is the will of the people expressed? By the election of representatives to serve in Parliament, whether at a general election or by-elections. There­fore - and this is my point - the authority which places and maintains a Ministry in power is not the House of Commons; it is something behind it and above it. The authority originates with and resides in the popular will, or, in plain language, in public opinion. Yet here we have a Minister declaring that he cares nothing for the opinion of the country; he does not look beyond the actual House of Commons. The House of Commons behind whose support he shelters himself is nearly five years old; it was created amid a war fever which has long since passed away, and the votes which created it were sought and were given on the ground of that war and on that ground alone. So that this five-years-old House of Commons has less authority by far than Parliaments of its age usually have, and every passing election proves indisputably and undeniably that a profound and sweeping change has come over the feeling of the electorate. What is the plain duty of a Minister in such a case? This is not a matter for fine-drawn state­craft. It is a matter of common sense.A Government of Usurpation Let us try it by the rules of everyday life. Suppose that A gives a power of attorney to B to act for him, and that in process of time it becomes apparent to everybody concerned that A has lost his confidence in B, and no longer approves of the way in which B conducts his affairs. A acts through an agent who takes no notice. What, then, will be the duty of B, whom I assume to be a man of probity and honour; what will he do? He will refuse to take advantage of any technical plea, and will renounce duties which he can no longer honestly discharge in accordance with the wishes of his principal. It comes to this, then, that we have in office a Government of usurpation, such as we have not had in any man\u2019s experience before. Is Govern­ment altogether the right word? We are a plain, practical people, and what we mean by a Government is a body of men with a common policy, acting altogether in order to put that policy in practice by the aid of a majority in Parliament.The Government\u2019s PolicyWhat is the present Government\u2019s policy? I take three questions which they themselves have brought to the front. That is treating them fairly, surely. What is their fiscal policy? What is their Irish policy? What is their Army policy? With regard to the Army, we have had an elaborate exposition of and disquisition upon the theories of Imperial defence. But we are just as much in the dark as ever as to the way in which these theories are to be carried out or the require­ments which they impose upon us. Of their fiscal policy we only know this - that it is in a condition which precludes its appearance in public. They cannot state it, they cannot defend it, and they cannot even vote upon it in the House of Commons. They cannot set it on its legs. The Government becomes dissolved whenever the subject is mentioned. As to Ireland, a week ago I ask a few plain questions - not conundrums - mere questions as to matter of fact, and I not only received no answer, but no attempt at an answer. The strange story of Sir Antony MacDonnell remains a mystery. The sudden change from coercion to conciliation, which happened to take place just at the time when the Government required the votes of the Irish members for their educa­tion policy - it was a singular coincidence; - the abrupt abandonment of that policy of conciliation at the first growl of the ascendency party, the marvellous result of Mr. Wyndham out and Mr. Balfour still in - all these are unexplained. The Government commands the confidence of its followers in the House of Commons - which is its only excuse for continued existence - by the consistent concealment of its policy from Parliament and from the country.Mr. Chamberlain's Dark Room You may have observed that some days ago there was a discussion in the House of Commons upon the amount of accommodation provided for members, and the fact was discovered that the member for West Birmingham enjoys the use of a room although he is not at the head of any distinct political party. I do not grudge him that favour; but it was urged in extenuation of his occupation of it that it was a small, dark room, by which I suppose was meant very much what an enterprising and advertising hotel-keeper in a picturesque country by way of attracting the amateur photographer would call a developing-room. The very thing he wants! He is busy developing something. It was also a dark room, and that appears to be suitable also; and - I was forgetting this - it was said to be in a detached part of the building, also a very suitable location. But the House of Commons itself is, on critical occasions, a large, dark room, and the confidence of the supporters of the Government is never so enthusiastically voted as when the gas goes out.The Government\u2019s Reluctance to go to the Country I would ask you, is this what the country has been accustomed to? A feeling of surprise and bewilderment has grown into another feeling, a feeling of irritation and indignation scarcely paralleled in our history. Here is a Ministry for which, as the chairman has reminded you, not a single constituency is safe, and, if they reconstruct themselves, which they do now and then, they have either to go to the House of Lords for a new Minister or they have to sacrifice a Minister in the operation. No wonder then that last Session they put into the King\u2019s Speech a Bill to dispense with the necessity of a newly-appointed Minister seeking re-election. When they talked of that Bill we wondered why they were so full of this novel zeal for liberty. Now we know the reason. Let us give them full credit for this unique instance of foresight on their part. But when, sooner or later, this cryptic Government, with no support except that which it can find in the doomed members of an expiring House of Commons, when they go to the country what will they say? Their reluctance to go we can well understand on three grounds at least. There is their record, which will not bear a moment\u2019s inspection; there are their ranks, which are deeply divided and demoralised; they have no definite policy except a few strings of phrases which can hardly be put seriously before the world. Abuse of the OppositionKnowing, then, defeat to be certain they are clinging to office in the hope that somehow or other they will achieve some degree of union, and that they may develop some sort of a policy, so that defeat may not turn into a catastrophe. But in the meantime the May meetings of the party - I especially refer to the Primrose League meet­ing at the Albert Hall and Mr. Chamberlain\u2019s meeting with his own constituents at Birmingham - show that they are agreed that the best way of keeping up appearances is to denounce the Opposition. To read their speeches one would think that the Union Jack was em­blazoned with the counterfeit presentment of the Prime Minister, and that the Royal Arms contained, instead of a unicorn, an ex-Colonial Secretary rampant. Says Mr. Balfour to his audience and friends, \u2018We are the defenders of the Crown, the Empire, and religion.\u2019 He actually appears to take seriously the comedy of the Primrose League. And the same day Mr. Chamberlain, at Birmingham, rounded it off by remarking, putting all the vinegar - three kinds of vinegar - into one vessel, that the Liberal party was a party of Little Englanders, pro-Boers, and separatists. Have they learned nothing, these men? Has their South African policy commended itself to the country? Are they bent on reviving the passions of 1900? Are their eyes not open to the fact that the great majority of their countrymen condemn that policy? Do they seriously think that abuse of the Irish will be effec­tive Mr. Chamberlain, referring to the Irish Nationalists, said in a casual way, \u2018Mr. Bright called them rebels.\u2019 I do not recall a more ungenerous thing ever said by a public man in this country - dragging in an honoured memory to justify a slander. Why, if Mr. Chamber­lain wishes to abuse his political opponents, let him do it himself in his own words. But how absurd this sort of thing is. The one clear impression left on the public mind by their language and their policy is that the Irish were right in what is called rebellion, in attacking and seeking to deliver themselves from the system of Government under which they live and the unhappy results which have followed from it.Mr. Chamberlain\u2019s MistakeI am inclined to think that Mr. Chamberlain is mistaken in his conception that the records of a Government count for nothing in an appeal to the electors. Political memories are not quite so short as that. The country has an account to settle with him and his friends, and the longer it is deferred the heavier it will be. That he is not without misgivings on this score is evident, because he called attention to the fact that before the fiscal question was introduced their losses at the by-elections were greater than they have been since. Their misdeeds were more vividly before the eyes of the electors. Yes, but as the smoke of this fiscal controversy clears away - and there are a good many people I suspect, even tariff reformers, who would not be unduly distressed if it ended in nothing but smoke - when the smoke clears, so much more plainly will the track of the last ten years appear. I leave the matter there. Let them get what comfort they can and what shelter they can from their denunciation of the iniquities of the Opposition, past, present, and to come.The Agricultural Rates BillBut we received some commendation from the Prime Minister the other day. That is worse; it makes one examine oneself to see what can be wrong. It is true there was a good deal of irony in the way in which he communicated his commendation; but he did commend us because of our not having opposed the second reading of the two great masterpieces of his legislative programme for this Session, the Agricultural Rates Renewal Bill and the Aliens Bill. Let me say, if you will, a few words upon each of those. For our inaction in both of those cases there are excellent reasons. There was nothing incon­sistent in what we did - inconsistent with previous views. Take the Agricultural Rates Bill first. The original Bill was introduced in 1896. We were strongly opposed to it and we strenuously resisted it, and we have not altered by one hair\u2019s breadth our opinion upon the subject. We object to taking agricultural land and conferring benefits upon its owners at the expense of other people; and there was no fact concern­ing it which was more startling and convincing than this - that the City of London - not the little City, I mean the big City, London generally - is out of pocket annually £300,000 by this provision, and receives no benefit or equivalent for it. There had been a general enquiry by a Royal Commission, and there was what they call an interim report, which recommended this special favour to be shown to a particular kind of property, whereas the whole question cries aloud for reform and readjustment. We succeeded in getting a period put to the time when the Bill should last. In 1901 it had to be renewed. We adopted exactly the same position then as we have adopted this year. Procedure by way of repeal or non-renewal is impracticable.The Need of Comprehensive Rating ReformThese doles, as we call them, must be renewed until that can be carried out which the Government have promised, but have failed to execute - namely, a comprehensive measure readjusting the whole system of local taxation, dealing with urban and rural rates alike, and with relations of each to the national Exchequer. However arbitrary, however inequitable and indefensible, in our opinion, the present temporary law is, these doles cannot be removed after all these years by mere surgical excision. It is easier to do mischief of this sort than to remedy it. The only practical way of dealing with the question is to approach it, as we shall be able to do, from a wider standpoint altogether. The task is heavy and complicated, perhaps the heaviest task that lies before any Government, to frame a scheme that shall be fair to the country and fair to the town, fair to agricultural interests and fair to other interests, to the ratepayer and to the taxpayer, out of the bewildering and puzzling mosaic of present rating arrangements; but, whatever its difficulties, it is a branch of reform which no Government, certainly no Government sincerely concerned about trade, about the housing question, and about the land question, can possibly ignore or neglect.The Aliens BillNow I pass to the Aliens Bill, which is a case much simpler. Why did I, who voted for an amendment to the Aliens Bill last year, decline to vote for a similar amendment this year? That you will naturally ask. Because it is a different Bill altogether from last year\u2019s. The Government have taken out of it some of the vices which we detected and denounced in the Bill of last year. I have never objected on principle to regulating the admission into this country of undesirable men, of criminals, of diseased persons, of persons who are diseased morally, physically, or mentally. But there are two important points on which we shall certainly insist - the first that no man shall be excluded on the mere ground of poverty, and the second that there shall always be maintained admission for anyone who seeks an asylum on our shores from persecution, whether political or religious. A breach of these conditions would mean a loss of character not merely to the Government or to the Opposition, but to the nation itself. We can take no narrow view of national hospitality, if for no other reason than that our countrymen make such large use of and so freely benefit by the hospitality of other nations. We shall look for the support of the Prime Minister against t\u000a\u000ahe view of Mr. Chamberlain, who puts aside these excuses of disease and crime, and claims as the chief object, and merit, of this legislation the exclusion of the competitive labour of the poor man. Has not the alien in past years contributed most materially to the prosperity of this country without displacing native labour? The Royal Commission which was appointed on the subject distinctly says that, so far as skilled labour is concerned, there has been no such displacement of labour. I should have had more respect for this view of the question if I had not remembered that those who are so strong against admitting the deserving but poor alien to this country are the men who introduced Chinese into South Africa for the mere sake of cheapness, and also if I saw in that party solicitude for the interests of labour in other respects, and especially for restoring the combination laws to the position in which Parliament originally intended them to be.Two Other Government Bills Well, these are the facts regarding these two Bills; and I do not grudge the Prime Minister any satisfaction he can derive from our attitude upon them. But besides these two in this Session there are only two other Bills in their programme to which I think I need refer. They seem to be in no hurry to carry either of them. There is the need of organised help for the unemployed, urgently required in all industrial centres, and, above all, in the East-end of London, and surely this will not be put off until another winter comes upon us. The second is the question of the deplorable ecclesiastical calamity in my own country across the Tweed, which demands instantly and urgently an equitable settlement. Why are the Government not ready to act? It is no party question; we are all agreed; we have striven and strained ourselves to prevent any element of party feeling in it. It was evident months ago that an Executive Commission would be required; the Commission of inquiry reasonably and properly recommended s\u000a\u000auch an appointment. The recommendation was so obvious that it ought to have been the duty of the Government to prepare a Bill in anticipation of it. Every day\u2019s delay not only continues but aggravates the scandal; and Scotland is grievously afflicted in her highest and dearest and tenderest interest, the spiritual welfare of her people.Liberal PolicyWe are taunted also by the leaders of the Government party with having no policy. We may ask, as I have been asking by way of recrimination, what is their policy? I have already said that their policy is vague and intangible; and I find myself in extremely good company in making an observation to that effect, because what said Mr. Chamberlain the other day \u2018Have they,\u2019 that is the Liberals, \u2018have they a policy? What have we got?\u2019 he said. \u2018Have we any definite, distinct, beneficial policy? Our policy is not so clear as it might be.\u2019 He goes on: \u2018We must have a common object worth fighting for\u2019; and so he casts about to find a common object, and he apparently can think of nothing but the Imperialistic idea; and, find­ing this rather thin and nebulous, he falls to belabouring the Liberals again. Why did he not fall back on his old friend old-age pensions? But would it not be a propos, would it be impertinent, to inquire what has become of the pledges and promises of social constructive reform which ten years ago were paraded as a policy, with great profit to the Unionist party, but with none whatever either to those who in the simplicity of their heart believed in those promises, or to the country which, on the other hand, has been scourged from that day to this with a number of policies that were never heard of either in 1895 or 1900? If these eminent persons, however, took the trouble to read the speeches made by their opponents, they would have seen that our policy, so far from being a policy of negation, as Mr. Balfour said, or a non-existing policy, as Mr. Chamberlain said, is a positive and constructive policy.Undoing the Work of ReactionNo doubt much will have to be done to repair the false steps that have been taken when we have the power to do it. We must try to settle the education question on national and liberal lines; and no one can deny it wants settling, with Wales and East Ham and the West Riding of Yorkshire under our eyes. Then we must restore public control of the liquor traffic. We must do what we can to check the upward movement of the public expenditure; but we shall not be satisfied with these tasks. Still less shall we be satisfied to do what I sometimes see suggested that we should do - namely, to stand still and mark time till the last danger is passed of the revival of Protection. I have already mentioned one great subject, that of rating, which is urgent. In that must be included the taxation of urban site values, a reform for which our great municipalities are agitating and almost clamouring. This principle has been three times affirmed in the House of Commons; and I expect, though I have not received information, it has been affirmed a fourth time today, when a Scotch Bill dealing with the subject was under discussion in the House of Commons; and its effect, we believe, would be not only to place urban rating on a more equitable footing, but greatly to facilitate the solution of the problems of housing and of urban expansion. The Rural Problem No less urgent is the whole range of questions connected with the depopulation of the agricultural districts. To say that the well-being, and, indeed, almost the existence of the nation is endangered, is threatened, by this process of sapping is no exaggeration. We hold that measures are required for extending the facilities for smallholdings and for the erection of cottages, that tenant farmers are entitled to a larger liberty in the cultivation of their farms and greater security in the result. (A voice - \u2018What about civil and religious liberty?\u2019) Well, civil and religious liberty I take for granted; we will not forget the principles and rules of civil and religious liberty when we are dealing with education or any other subject of a cognate type. With regard to cottages and small holdings, which are powerful agents in stemming the current which is carrying men into the towns, I say that should it happen that the local authorities, either through social pressure or from any other cause, are unlikely to take a sufficiently strenuous part in administering such legislation and thereby combating an evil of national gravity, we ought not to shrink from adopting a policy of vigorous stimulation from the centre. We are all for encouraging local administration and responsibility; but whether it be in respect of the acquisition of land for the use of the people or the provision of cottages, or, to turn in another direction, the sanitary condition of cities as disclosed in their death-rates, the duty of proclaiming and enforcing a proper standard of administrative activity and efficiency will have to be undertaken a good deal more energetically by the State than it has been in the past. We must remember that there are interests of a kind so formidable in their social prestige and influence and in their financial power that the citizen may often have to forfeit a good deal of his rights and liberty unless he can count upon the central authority standing up for him.    The Combination LawsAgain, what could be more important to the prosperity and contentment of the people than a revision of the combination laws? You may take a large and favourable view, or a less favourable view of the trade unions as you like - for my part I hold them to be an unqualified good of the country - but whatever view men take of them no one wishes them, surely, to be hustled and harried. Yet witness the deplorable spectacle of the last few weeks, when a Bill, imperfectly reviving the original intention of Parliament in this matter, has been so mauled and maimed in the Committee under the inspiration of the Government, led and represented by their Solicitor-General, that the Labour members and the Liberal members have been obliged to leave the room.Electoral Reform           These are some of the things to be done. I know there are many others of almost equal importance, which I could mention; but I will only refer to one other great class of reforms, perhaps the most essential, because the most elementary of all. I mean those affecting the electoral machinery; reforms for facilitating registration, for making individual right and not property the test and ground of qualification, for cheapening elections, for giving to members of Parliament a modest stipend, so as to enlarge the choice of the electors. Then, when those things have been done, and other reforms which I might mention, a true representative people\u2019s Chamber would be con­stituted, strong enough to join issue with any other Chamber which challenged it. There would be the additional advantage in those things I have named, that it would be healthier for the country and for Parliament itself if elections came oftener than they do, and until you cheapen the cost of elections you can never accomplish that object.History Repeating ItselfThis is no conclusive list; I am not here either to frame or to pro­pound any programme whatever. I have far from exhausted the subjects. How history repeats itself. Could the condition of things at the present time be better described than they were by Mr. Glad­stone when he came here in 1891, and, as we were told yesterday, was entertained by your present mayor in his mayoralty? What was it that he then said? He said: \u2018The first difficulty that encounters me is this - a surfeit; for there is no other word adequate to describe it: it is not the excess merely, it is the absolute surfeit of work that remains to be done: work that accumulates from year to year, and work that is certain to fall more heavily in arrear in proportion to the prolongation of the rule of a Tory Government.\u2019Liberalism and LabourI would have you observe this further thing. Cast your mind back upon what I have been speaking about. Is there one of those things upon which there is any material difference between Liberal ideas and the ideas of those who directly represent labour in Parliament? Not one. Any seeming difference would at once dry up and disappear the moment we came to work together upon them. There is no reason why these two branches of the party of progress should not work har­moniously together. For my part I can honestly say that I have never heard upon any Liberal platform anything but sympathy and welcome expressed towards Labour members. If I have to my regret seen reported unfriendly things as having been said of the party to which I belong by prominent Labour politicians, I am confident that with patience and experience of one another any such feeling will evaporate.The Fiscal QuestionLet me ask you to go with me to the subject which has most occupied public attention for the last two years. How do we stand with regard to the great fiscal question I hold that we may claim to look both forward and back wards with a certain measure of cheerful assurance. The Protectionists have been beaten in argument; they have been routed at the by-elections; in the House of Commons they have been made to commit happy dispatch themselves. But we cannot lay down our arms until the Unionist party has formally separated itself from any schemes which directly or indirectly prejud­ice freedom of trade. They are far from having done this yet. Personally I would welcome a recantation even before a general election came on, because we have plenty of other issues to meet. We cannot for a moment relax our vigilance. Do not be blindly confident; do not be blind to the manoeuvres now going on, or the likelihood that they are leading up to some small and innocent-looking electoral instalment on account. Never mind if we are denounced as bigots and fanatics for insisting that the Free-trade position should be held intact. A general may have been foiled in his frontal attack and yet manage to effect a lodgment by a side way or a back way, and he will then think his foe was a very good sort of fellow and a very open-minded one to oblige him by allowing him to do so. But what comfort will it be, when the citadel has fallen, for the unwary defender to reflect that his defence was conducted in no antiquated spirit of obstinacy or intolerance?Unionist ManoeuvresWhat is the nature of these manoeuvres going on? We can only look from a distance and guess. We all remember the extraordinary campaign started two years ago, when the pioneer went out in advance under the flag of food taxation and preference with the blessing, the best wishes, and the warm sympathy of the commander of the main army, who contented himself with the humbler and less brilliant role of preparing at his leisure to annul, delete, and cancel the established and cardinal principle that taxation should be only for revenue purposes. I am not sure, on the whole, that the noisy and blatant vanguard is so likely to have done so much harm as the quieter and more insidious part of the army that remained. The pioneer included in his operations this very city on Tyneside, and it was to this city, and it may have been in this very house for aught I know - (\u2018No, the one you are going to\u2019) - I am glad that it was not - that he bequeathed the deathless picture of the annihilation of all our industries, the extinction of our fires, the stoppage of all our exports; while, marvellous to say, the imports were to continue coming in just as usual. What an odd thing it is that a clear and level-headed man like Mr. Chamberlain never realises apparently that trade is barter, and that if things go out other things must come in, and if things come in other things must go out. That was an unrivalled picture, but the glamour of it and of the triumph of his progress gradually faded away. Calamity overtook them; and now the chief preoccupa­tion of that army appears to be, not to equip itself with arms of offence, but rather they have been concerned with the exigencies present and prospective of the ambulance department.The Design of the Ambulance Waggon They are too stricken, too prostrate, to go to the country otherwise than in a recumbent position; and the deputation to Downing Street that we heard of, and the apparently incomplete negotiations of which we hear so much from time to time, only betoken some little differences between the authorities as to the design and decoration of the ambulance waggon. Mr. Chamberlain would, no doubt, like to have a fiery cross, Mr. Balfour would prefer a red cross or a cross of some neutral colour, but at any rate something which would appeal to Free-traders not to fire upon it; and the announcement which the country waits for with expectation and some amusement will tell us whether a combination of the two crosses is possible. There is no Geneva Convention for a political campaign. If Mr. Chamberlain\u2019s quick-firing gun and Lord Lansdowne\u2019s big revolver form part of the equipment of this melancholy procession when once it sets out on its way such concealment would be deserving of no greater reprobation than the prolonged policy of evasion and concealment and dissimulation of which the country has grown so heartily sick. If at this time of day you and I are deceived by any new formula, any freshly-discovered device for dressing up Protection in Free-trade garments, we shall have ourselves to blame. I fear little myself from any such concordat that may be devised. Supposing they do come to terms on the basis of the Sheffield and Glasgow programme, a concordat so spectral and unsubstantial will fail to consolidate their party or drive a wedge into the party of Free Trade.Mr. Chamberlain and the Trade Unionists Two nights ago Mr. Chamberlain again appeared, waving the fiery cross. The old fallacies and the old promises were trotted out again. Having secured the gentlemen of the Tariff Reform League, he now addressed himself to the trade unions and the workmen generally. He says to them that a great deal, after all, depends on what you think of the man who is addressing you. That is very true; and those who are asked to consent to dearer food on his pledge that the cost of living will not be increased will not forget the old-age pensions proposals which were \u2018so simple\u2019 that anybody could understand them. This new scheme is also described as simple, but those will be even more simple who are taken in by it. He goes on to say that he has no personal interest to serve. Who ever said he had a personal interest? I am not aware that it has ever been alleged by anyone. And he says he is a mere consumer; but are the people about him mere consumers? Are the members of his tariff commission nothing but consumers? Do none of them stand to gain by the proceedings in which they are engaged?The Colonies and Mr. ChamberlainHaving thus cleared his character from an imputation never made, he appeals to the working man. First, he interlards his appeal with higher and wider themes. He brings up the heavy artillery to which we are so accustomed, but the roar of which has never intimidated us - namely, the grand Imperial idea. \u2018The Colonies,\u2019 he says, \u2018helped us in the war, shall we reject and insult them now?\u2019 I would not reject and insult anybody, much less the Colonies. I give the Colonies credit for good feeling, for loyalty, and for good sense, and for a proper estimate of their own independence. The idea that their own indepen­dence, the idea that their loyalty depends upon trade advantages is the worst of insults. I think I once called it myself \u2018a squalid idea.\u2019 I repeat that it is a squalid idea. It has of ten been flung at my head and they can go on flinging it. What do the Colonies themselves say of this? We hear so much of what Mr. Chamberlain thinks about the Colonies, let us see what the Colonies think about Mr. Chamberlain. Here is a quotation from an article in the Toronto Globe of April 12th, which is the principal Ministerial organ in Ontario:'By what authority does Mr. Chamberlain pose as interpreter of Canadian sentiment and ambition? What has he seen of Canada, and what does he know of Canadian feelings, that he should talk about the endangering of Canadian loyalty? Does he measure Canadian loyalty by an extra five per cent, or ten per cent preference on Canadian wheat, or is he trying to \u201cbunco\u201d the British elector into the adoption of Protection with a bogey game of Colonial dismemberment? A man who visited the United States again and again, but only once, even when Colonial Secretary, deigned to touch Canadian soil, is in no position to estimate either the quality or the strength of Canadian sentiment. It would be well for Mr. Chamberlain were he to base his Protective propaganda on the needs and interests of the British taxpayer, rather than the fickleness of Canadian loyalty. Imperialistic tuft-hunters may submit, but the point will soon be reached when intelligent and self-respecting Canadians will resent the persistent misrepresentation of Canadian sentiment by British politicians. One of our chief humiliations is the tone of men like Mr. Chamberlain, who think we are bound to the Empire by ties of trade preference.'Mr. Chamberlain\u2019s Fallacies and ContradictionsNow, when he turns to his appeal to the workmen, we see instance after instance in his speeches of contradictory statements on the financial question. He praises high tariff countries, and says \u2018the conditions of life in Germany are such that many an English working­man would be glad to change places with some of his German competitors.\u2019 I would interpolate, How does it come to pass that at the last election in Germany there was a huge number - I think some­thing like one-half of the votes - which were given for Socialist candidates on the very ground that the exactions of the rich and of the State made their life almost intolerable? But now I have quoted what he says in commending life in Germany to the British working­man. What does he say himself when he is talking of aliens in that same speech \u2013 \u2018If the aliens were not allowed to come to England they would stop in Germany and the products of their cheap labour would come in their stead.\u2019 Thus Germany is, in the same speech, a workman\u2019s paradise and a country where goods are produced cheaply by sweating and unfair conditions. Surely it cannot be both. Again, he makes his appeal to the workmen by the promises of more employ­ment; but if his ten per cent duty on manufactured goods results in their exclusion, his arguments based on increased revenue - the foreigner paying our taxes and even, as we have now been told, our rates - fall to the ground; if, on the other hand, it does not keep them out, then where is the increased employment to come from? Our position with regard to this - and it is worthwhile to repeat it and revive our apprehension of it - is that any artificial steps taken for increasing the price of commodities is bound in the long run to reduce the opportunities for employment. Here and there it may benefit a single or particular trade by giving it a greater command of the home market. Take pearl buttons, referred to by one in the audience, for instance; or sugar refining - we have not heard so much of sugar refining since the effect of the Sugar Convention made itself felt, and large numbers of operatives in the confectionery trade were added to the ranks of the unemployed. Our contention is that, taking our home produce and our exports together, anything that arbitrarily raises the cost of production must react to the prejudice of the workman, and this for the simple reason, which we can never persuade Mr. Chamberlain to consider, that a diminution of the effective demand for commodities means a restriction of the employment of labour. If a man has to pay more for his boots or clothes, what is the effect upon him? He will economise in boots and clothes, he will not buy so many. How is that going to give more work to the boot-maker or the tailor? This is a plain argument quite apart from all those high-flying economic theories with which - and in this I agree with Mr. Chamberlain - the ordinary mind and the ordinary man might only be confused.The Real Remedies I commend those plain arguments to you who are workmen and to others. The way to improve our trade is by other methods altogether, first, by lightening the burden of taxation through a peaceful and frugal policy; secondly, by better education and more drastic control of the liquor traffic; thirdly, by improving the character and stamina of our people by reform of the deplorable surroundings in which masses of them live; and lastly, by giving agriculture a chance, by giving the farmers security, and offering the labourer a career in his calling. It is in such directions as these that will be found the redemption of our social system, and not by restricting trade and by following the will-o\u2019-the-wisp of baseless fallacies and mischievous and delusive promises.

aVThe chairman has recalled to our memory the last time that I had the pleasure and the honour of speaking to the National Union of Conservative Associations, and he has reminded us, if we required to be reminded, that since that day many things have happened (laughter), including the defeat of the Unionist party. The country has, of course, in consequence of that event, had the privilege of living for six or seven months under the rule of our opponents, and it is almost time that we should begin to take stock of their performances. (Hear, hear.) The election of last January provided us with a new Government. (A voice \u2013 \u2018What do you call it?\u2019) (Laughter and cheers.) No collective name in our political vocabulary enables me to answer the question just put to me (laughter and cheers); however we describe the new Government, we have certainly got one. But what I am going to discuss tonight is not the fact that we have a new Government­ - a Government belonging to a different party, composed of different individuals - but that we have got a new kind of Government, not differing merely in members, but differ­ing fundamentally in method. (Cheers.) We have got government by mandate. (Cheers.) Now, what is a mandate? What is its origin and genesis, its character? I have listened to the various speeches of the Ministers and their supporters, trying to collect an adequate answer to the question. I think I have found an answer. The origin of a mandate is usually to be found in some catch­word or phrase which is only a success on an election platform to a stormy audience, but which neither speaker nor audience thoroughly understands. (Cheers.) A mandate is a phrase which does duty for argument, which does duty for sense, which saves the necessity of eloquence, which is incapable of being translated into practice except at the loss of administrative justice, of admini­strative ability \u2013 which is, above all, an instrument which cuts short and saves thorough discussion. (Loud cheers.) Indeed, ladies and gentlemen, you may go further, and you may say that Government by mandate is an im­possibility unless you combine it with Parliamentary closure. I will give you, if I may, two examples of what is called a mandate. The first is a phrase echoed and re-­echoed from every Radical platform in the country, or from many Radical platforms in the country, and which takes the form of saying \u2018No tests for teachers.\u2019 No human being knows what that phrase precisely means, and directly you attempt to give a precise definition of it you find yourself either admitting that no tests for teachers were ever imposed or that tests for teachers cannot be avoided. If you mean by \u2018no tests for teachers\u2019 that the teachers in our schools, whether provided or voluntary schools, are not to be asked to sign elaborate theological formulae, I quite agree. Who has ever asked them to sign elaborate theological formulae? There is a clause, a pretentious and absurd clause, in this Bill which specifically forbids any teacher to sign such a formula. I should never think of dividing against such a clause. You may as well put in an Act of Parliament, \u2018It is hereby enacted that two and two make four.\u2019 So they do (laughter); and if you like to forbid that which never was done, you spend so much Parliamentary ink and Parliamentary paper, and you do no harm. (Laughter.) This is one horn of the dilemma. The other horn of the dilemma is that the tests for teachers did not mean requiring for the teacher that he should sign some elaborate religious formula; on the contrary, it means only that you should make no inquiries at all about the readiness or the capacity of a teacher to give religious education to the children of the school. (Hear, hear.) And I say that in that form the so-called mandate which forbids tests for teachers is absolute nonsense (hear, hear), and must be known by every man who gives five minutes\u2019 thought to the subject that it is nonsense. (Cheers.) What did the House of Commons declare the other day by an overwhelming majority, a majority drawn from every party in the House? It declared its desire that the compulsory education of the children of this country should not be secular education (cheers), and it admitted, as everybody admits, that if you are going effectually to give religious education that work must in the main be carried out by the ordinary teachers in the school. (Hear, hear.) Well, if you hold those two propositions - and 90 per cent of the House of Commons holds both (hear, hear) - then, I ask you, is it not mischievous nonsense to say that the children are to receive religions education, that the teachers are to give religious education, when the body appointing the teachers is not to ask whether they are competent to perform that duty? (Hear, hear.) But this irrational and unconsidered mandate was, in the opinion of the Government at all events, given at the general election, and these unfortunate Ministers who are endeavouring to govern us by mandate, and not by reason or by argu­ment (hear, hear), have been struggling in the meshes, having been endeavouring to disengage themselves from the network in which that so-called decision of the electorate has involved them. Ladies and gentlemen, it was no decision of the electorate. (Cheers.) Had anybody at these meetings, of which we heard so much, come forward and said to these crowds which no doubt vociferously cheered the Radical victor when he talked about tests for teachers - had put to these people this plain proposition: \u2018You want your children taught religion, and you want that religion taught by the teachers. Are you going to ask no questions, make no inquiries, take no steps for satisfying yourselves that the most important of all the functions which a teacher can ask to give (cheers) is one which he is capable of giving\u2019? That is the illustration of what is meant by a mandate.South AfricaWell, there was another mandate of which we have heard much, but of which we heard more, I may incident­ally say, five months ago than we hear now. (Laughter.) I mean the mandate in relation to Chinese labour. (Laughter and cheers.) Again, the Government found themselves entangled in the empty rhetoric of their followers. They struggled gallantly at first to carry out the mandate, but they found, as all men of common sense would have found in their place, that the mandate - the so-called mandate - was issued by the electorate in ignorance of the facts of the situation, and that no responsible government in this country - I do not care from what party it was drawn - would venture or could venture, without the immediate destruction of our South African position, to carry out in its integrity, in its entirety and immediacy, the so-called mandate of the people. Here again the easy phrases, the clap-trap utterances (cheers), the rash promises, the facile rhetoric of these gentlemen who received a mandate, has been an embarrassment from the moment they came into office until now; and, as I shall show you before I sit down, the evils which have been begun by this rash and intemperate dealing with the delicate and difficult problem of South Africa has produced, is producing, and, I fear, is likely to produce in the future, the most serious perils to the Empire. (Cheers.) Now, I told you just now that if you attempt to govern by mandate you must also govern by closure, and you must govern by closure because a policy founded upon mandate, a policy founded upon the kind of mandates that I have been describing to you, is one that will not stand argument. (Hear, hear.) Argument must be stopped at all hazards (hear, hear); if you cannot answer, you must gag; if you cannot meet reason by reason, you must meet reason either by clamour or by closure. (Hear, hear.) I do not discuss the question of clamour. (Laughter.) Closure we have had and had in abundance. Now I am not going to make the mistake, as I think it is, tonight of arguing before a great popular audience the details of House of Commons procedure. The House of Commons, according to my experience, is a body which is never understood, and never can be thoroughly understood but by those who form part of it, and even those who form part of it have an extraordinary gift of forgetting what they learned when they were members in that Assembly. We must manage our affairs as best we can and rule our procedure as best we may, and I am not coming here to appeal to this audience to support us in our opposition to the Government method by closure. What I do want to speak to you about is that which directly or immediately concerns yourselves, which is the fact that this closure gives the Government a free hand where a free hand ought not to be given them, and enables them to pass almost sub silentio proposals which, if adequately discussed in and out of the House of Commons, would, I am convinced, never receive the assent of the people of this country. (Cheers.)The Army ProposalsTake the case of the Army. (Hear, hear.) The Minister for War (a laugh) made a very able and elaborate speech early in the year, in which he asked for time, and in which he promised a full discussion of any pro­posals which he might make in July. July has come, the proposals have come - what is the amount of discussion we have been allowed? (\u2018None.\u2019) Do not let us exaggerate. I heard some gentleman say \u2018None.\u2019 We\u000a\u000ahad two hours (laughter); that is to say, two hours of independent criticism, as against four hours of Ministerial statement. Do you think that the country would be content with those proposals had we had time thoroughly to sift them? (\u2018No, no.\u2019) I am well per­suaded that they would not, and I will tell you why in a few sentences. I do not maintain, and never did while I was in office - and I apply no rules to my successors that I am not ready to apply to myself - I do not maintain that the existing principle of Regular battalions in the British Army is fixed and immutable, determined by infinite wisdom, neither to be diminished nor increased in obedience to the promptings of the economical spirit or in obedience to a reasonable calculation of the chances of war. I lay down no hard and fast proposition of that kind. I say that all the investigations of the experts, and of those civilians who have had access to expert knowledge and have been able to criticise experts, show that there are possible duties before the British Army which the present Army can but imperfectly carry out unless there be some means of ex­pansion found to meet a great national emergency. (Cheers.) I do not believe that proposition is seriously challenged by any military critic. I will lay down another proposition which I believe to be unchallenged by any military critic. It is this - that when the time for expansion comes, when that great national necessity meets us face to face, in the immediate future, our main difficulty will be to provide those expert members of an efficient army which cannot be created directly or immediately to fill a gap which no mere patriotic spirit can fill, to provide men who require a training which it is very difficult to give in an auxiliary force alone. (Cheers.) No one rates higher the importance of the auxiliary army than I do; but what an auxiliary force can hardly do is to provide elaborately trained officers, gunners, and professional staff, adequate not merely to the Regular Army as we now have it, but as we ought to have it in the supposed case of national emergency. (Cheers.) If that be the problem we have to meet, we must all admit it is a difficult one. We might not all agree as to what the solution is; some doubt whether a solution can be arrived at without a fundamental altera­tion of the relations between the State and the citizen in his military capacity. But, whatever our differences of opinion on this point may be, there is one thing on which we shall all agree, and it is this - that until you have found your machinery for expanding the Regular Army in time of war, it is nothing short of lunacy to deprive yourself of regiments in which trained men are to be found to supply the wants of the Army, which can give you officers and reserve and much that you will need even in the first months of a great war, carried on, let us say, for the defence of the North-West Frontier of India. (Loud cheers.) Now what has this Government by mandate done? (\u2018Nothing.\u2019) Well, they have done something - that is just my complaint - or they are going to do something. What have they done or what do they propose to do? Without framing their plan for this Army expansion, without having a scheme or telling us what their scheme is, they have begun to destroy before they have begun to build - before, indeed, they know how they are going to build. That is government by mandate. (Laughter.) Do you suppose the present Cabinet, unhampered by all the irrational talk about extravagance - do you suppose they would have set to work in the clumsy and disastrous fashion in which they have set to work had they not felt themselves bound by what they call this mandate? And when we, in the House of Commons, urge these unanswer­able arguments, we are not met by anything in the nature of a rational reply; we are met by the blunt statement­ \u2018This was the mandate of the country. Be it good or be it bad, be it reasonable or unreasonable, be it consistent or inconsistent with the safety of the Empire, thus has the country commanded us at the general election. We are its humble servants, and, despite reason and common sense, we must obey.\u2019 (Laughter.) That is a gross misrepresentation of the country. I do not in the least doubt that everybody would have liked to see a diminu­tion of naval and military expenditure; I am sure I should. Nobody loves paying taxes; I am sure I do not. (Laughter.) But to tell me the country want to cut down these Estimates by no rational or considered plan, but simply and in order to satisfy rhetorical state­ments made in the heat of a general election, is an insult to the country itself; and as to paying reverence to the democracy, it involves the profoundest insult to the democracy itself. (Cheers.)Self-Government in the New ColoniesThere is one other illustration perhaps even more important than the one to which I have just adverted - one more illustration of this government by mandate to which I must refer - it relates to South Africa. I am most reluctant to touch at a party meeting on that thorny subject, lest I should for a moment be thought to be using our colonial Empire as a pawn in the political game. I do not believe there is a single man or woman whom I are addressing who, if he or she had to choose between the exclusion of the party to which we belong during the term of our generation - to choose between that and the greatness and safety of our Empire beyond the seas would hesitate to choose the latter. (Cheers.) Ill should we deserve the name of the Imperial party if we could hesitate in our choice. (Hear, hear.) But I do not think that what I am going to say can do other than good. I do not think the exposure of what I consider the methods of the Government in this matter can affect in any adverse sense the fortunes of our follow country­men in South Africa. The Government - I will not say the country (hear, hear) - but the Government are on the eve of one of the most momentous decisions which have ever fallen to the lot of a British Government to make.Consider the conditions under which they intend to make it. You know that the plan of the late Government was to follow an unbroken, or practically unbroken precedent - I believe an absolutely unbroken precedent - not to give self-government without a fair trial, a fair preliminary tria\u000a\u000al, of an intermediate stage between govern­ment entirely from home and full autonomy. That plan has been abandoned, and they now propose to give absolute autonomy to our Colonies, to the Transvaal and the Orange Free State, with as little delay as possible. I think you will find that even those in South Africa who look with most dismay and most misgivings upon the experiment are nevertheless in favour of its being tried, since the only alternative appears to be government of the Transvaal from Downing Street (laughter and \u2018Hear, hear\u2019); and whatever be the ills which may await them in the future from the new Con­stitution, anything, in their opinion, is preferable to this intolerable meddling in their economic concerns of which the present Government have been guilty. (Cheers.) Very well. Let it for the sake of argument be agreed that fall autonomy is to be given; that a Constitution is to be framed which makes the Transvaal - and I presume the Orange Free State also - as independent as Australia, as New Zealand, as Canada, how is that Constitution to be formed? It is a matter of vital moment. The present Government, through the mouth of the Prime Minister, announced that they intended to give complete autonomy, and either in the same speech, or in some other speech delivered later, when asked why he was sending out a Commission of inquiry to South Africa, the, Premier told the House that they were in a condition at deplorable ignorance (\u2018Oh, oh\u2019) - I think those were his exact words (laughter) - as to the conditions there prevailing which ought to govern the framing of a new Constitution. I should have thought myself, if I had not seen that an opposite procedure was followed both in the Education Bill and in Army reform \u2013 I should have thought myself it would have been better to inform yourself of the conditions before arriving at your con­clusion. (Cheers.) That, however, is not the view of the Prime Minister, and everybody has his own methods of working out these questions. (Laughter.) It is not for me to criticise. My criticism comes in not in con­nexion with his own methods of determining his own policy, but when he sets to work to deal with the Opposition in the House of Commons, the House of Commons at large, and the country. He sends out a Commission because he is in a state of \u2018deplorable ignorance.\u2019 (Laughter.) Before next Tuesday he and his colleagues will have to make up their minds what the Constitution is to be. For next Tuesday he is going to tell us what it is, and he is going to allow us some four hours to discuss it. (Cries of \u2018Shame.\u2019) Do you not think, as impartial men, that he might have given us a copy of the information on which he is going to act? (\u2018Yes.\u2019) Our ignorance may be less deplorable than his own (laughter and cheers); but I take it that we should all obtain enlightenment from the opportunity of perusing the report of this Commission, for which, as taxpayers, we have all paid, and which has been sent out to supply the Government with information. We are going to have four hours to discuss it on Tuesday. (A voice \u2013 \u2018A scandal.\u2019) Yes, it is a scandal. (Cheers.) It has never been discussed in the colony at all, so that we now have, for the first time in British history, a step taken which is going to add two new members to the great constellation of self-governing colonies, without either the colony or the mother country having any adequate opportunity of considering either the decision of the Government or the grounds on which that decision was framed. (Cheers.)Conditions in the TransvaalFor my own part, I should have thought that a monstrous method of procedure even in the case of an ordinary colony; but consider what it is you are doing in the case of the Transvaal. You are dealing with a country where the population is almost equally divided between Boer and Briton, you are dealing with a colony where the memories of the war are not distant memories of the past, but almost present memories of what happened yesterday. You are dealing with a situation in which no country in the world has ever attempted, or, I believe, ever would attempt, to give full self-governing powers to a colony. The United States of America, after the great Civil War, did not immediately or for a long period put the South in possession of the full rights which they had possessed before the war. And yet, so far as the United States themselves are concerned, that might have been done with perfect consistency; it is a policy which might have been carried out without really endangering the Union, and for this reason - that the representatives of the South were only a minority of Congress, only a portion of one homogeneous whole, and would not have had that independent power which we gave, and gladly gave and safely gave, to great and friendly populations like Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. (Cheers.) The population of the Transvaal, I hope, will some day - I believe at no distant day - resemble those great self-governing colonies, but can we expect, human nature being what it is, that, if you give full self-government to the Trans­vaal, if you put into the hands of a body which is half or nearly half the whole population of the country the full powers, practically the whole powers, which the Dominion of Canada or the Commonwealth of Australia now enjoy, they will not use them to carry out by means even more dangerous, because they are not necessarily warlike, the objects which they failed to obtain by the arbitrament of arms. (Cheers.) The responsibility of the Government is tremendous. Have we the smallest ground for thinking that the reck­less policy of confounding the power of uttering plati­tudes and the power of governing States - have we any ground for thinking that confusion of ideas which prevails perhaps naturally enough at a general election is not dominating their councils now? Have they a real grip of the actualities of the position? (\u2018No.\u2019) I fear not. But how can we judge if we are not given information? (Hear, hear.) How can we judge unless we have a Parlia­mentary opportunity of commentary and criticism, of eliciting answers by questions insistently put, which is the great privilege of a great debating assembly like the House of Commons, but which this Government of mandate is determined to suppress. (\u2018Shame.\u2019) I can promise on behalf of my friends - I promise on your behalf (cheers), with absolute assurance that we shall not endeavour to turn to party or political account any con­troversy which may arise upon this subject. (Hear, hear.) But remember that there is at stake at this moment all that you fought for during the war. (Hear, hear.) Remember, and let the Government remember, if they take a false step we may lose all that was gained for the cause of civilisation by the vast expenditure of national treasure, by the even more to be regretted expenditure of the blood of those whom we most loved. (Hear, hear.) We have established claims against the British Empire in South Africa which we should be dishonoured if we forgot, for which we are bound to expend our last shilling, to fight to the last ditch; and if this Govern­ment, pursuing their policy of mandate and their love of platitude, establish some Constitution which hands over to those who recently were our enemies and who are not yet in any full measure our friends (hear, hear) - although I doubt not they are in process of becoming our friends were a wise policy pursued - remember if the Govern­ment hand over the power to those, our late respected enemies, they are endangering all that we fought for and that we bled for, all that we suffered for, the course of civilisation in those regions is destined to be indefinitely set back, your most sacred obligations will be broken, you will yourselves be involved in difficulties of which no man can see the end, and you will have shaken to its very foundation the basis of British greatness in African continents; and not in the African continent alone, but wherever the British colonist thinks he can rely on the greatness, the courage, the statesmanship, and the honour of England, and who, after any disaster con­sequent on our short-sightedness or policy, will say that henceforth the Empire of which he was proud offers no safeguards to him, and that he must look elsewhere if he is to pursue in security and safety the development of his civilisation. (Cheers.) My lords, ladies, and gentle­men, may the Government in this great decision be animated, not merely by excellent motives - for that I am quite ready to give them credit - but may they be animated by that far-sighted and courageous statesman­ship which is absolutely required if we are to steer the Empire through these difficulties which I have dimly indicated, and which every one who hears me knows to be as real as they are great. If they carry out what I hope - I hardly dare say I expect - but what I hope, if their plan is indeed sober, far-seeing, and just, then they may count, irrespective of party, on the support of their fellow countrymen. If otherwise, they will have dealt the most serious blow to the Empire of which they are but the temporary guardians (loud cheers), which for 150 years it has sustained. (Loud cheers.)

aVLord Plymouth, my lords, ladies, and gentlemen. It is twenty years since I had the pleasure and the honour of addressing a Birmingham meeting. I am sorry the interval since I last spoke in this great city has been so long, and I regret still more that when, in the ordinary course, this great gather­ing, representing as it does the Conservative branch of the great Unionist party throughout England, meets here we should not feel that we have with us and behind us, the active energy of that great statesman - (hear, hear) - whose work for Birmingham, whose work for Great Britain - (hear, hear) - whose work, shall I say in this audience above all, for our Colonial Empire - (loud cheers) - has given him an immortal place in the great series of statesmen who have guided the imperial destinies of this country. (Applause.) We have the consolation of knowing that Mr. Chamberlain - (load cheers) - although for the moment he cannot take any part in the firing line - (\u2018Pity\u2019) - yet gives us his keenest and heartiest sympathy - (hear, hear) - that he watches each step, each movement in the gradual evolution of public thought upon some of the greatest imperial questions of the day, with unabated interest - (hear, hear) - and that we here - we repre­senting the Conservative portion of the great Unionist party, have in all the work we are doing, and have been doing, his keenest and heartiest sympathy. (Cheers.) My lords and gentlemen, I have not had an opportunity of addressing the great body of the Conservative Unionists of England since the great reorganisation has been worked through and brought to a happy conclusion. This is my first opportunity of speaking to you, and I cannot preface what I have come here to say upon the great question of the day more appropriately than by congratulating you upon that reorganisation, which has carried out what has always been the view of the party to which I belong - namely, that the Conservative party should be in its organisation essentially democratic - (loud cheers) - that as we recognise and have recognised that our strength comes from the people - (hear, hear) - is born of the people - (hear, hear) - can have efficiency and perpetuity only by means of the people - (hear, hear) - our organisation should reflect our ideals, and that the system on which we carry out party Govern­ment should be one in which the leaders of the party may feel that they represent, not merely the officers of the party, but the rank and file and every member who belongs to it.An Appeal for TolerationThis reorganisation has been carried out. I believe it has been carried out successfully, and the result of it is that upon the various representative asso­ciations in each constituency it thrown the responsibility, the full responsibility, the representa­tive responsibility, of selecting their candidate, and of maintaining that unity without which no enthusiasm is of the smallest value, without which it is impossible that the causes which lie nearest to our hearts can ever reach their full and satisfactory fruition, which is the very condition of success in a free country governed under the party system. (Hear, hear.) Now I am not going to attempt to suggest how that practical unity in either case is to be carried out. I have no love either of processes of court-martial or processes of excommunication. (Hear, hear.) The first may be necessary under a great military system; the second has been rightly or wrongly thought to be necessary in many great ecclesiastical organisa­tions. But such things are not in my line. (Laughter and \u2018Hear, hear.\u2019) This, and this only would I say: You cannot lay down rules in black and white as to what constitutes party loyalty, or what does or does not amount to a difference of opinion with the great body of a party which should cut any member of that party from the general communion. (Hear, hear.) No precision of doctrine is possible in such circumstances, but the test of our competence as prac­tical men to deal with great practical problems will be measured by our power of working together, of forgetting small individual differences - (hear, hear) - of sinking petty jealousies - (hear, hear) - of silencing contemptible criticism - (hear, hear) - which we are able to show in the face of a great national and Imperial destiny - that you, gentlemen, representing as you do\u000a\u000aevery constitu­ency in England, every great body in England, will see both the need which lies before you, and each in your own measure be able to carry out the steps which are required to satisfy that need. I come here before you as your leader. (Cheers.) I believe I have your confidence. (Cheers, and a Voice: \u2018You have!\u2019). That I know. (Cheers.) I know I have done all in my power to earn it. (Hear, hear.) And while I am the last man in this room either to claim or to desire immunity from criticism, I think may appeal to every man who listens to me, and to that larger public throughout the country which may honour me by reading what I say tonight, I may appeal, to them, not in my interests or in yours - (hear, hear) - not on any personal. grounds, for, as every human being knows, I have no personal interest in the matter whatever - (hear, hear) - in the interests of the great cause to which we all owe service, and to which all of us are bound to sacrifice leisure and convenience - in the interests of that great cause I would ask them, each in their own sphere, not to exercise any tyrannical jurisdiction over those who may feel difficulties about this or that item in the party programme; but, at all events, to see that the degree of party unity is preserved throughout the whole of England, for which alone you can speak, which is the first condition to party success, and without which talents, energy, zeal, are all thrown away, and are all so much waste; but which, if you only can secure it, is bound to lead you at no distant date to that posi­tion of responsibility in the councils of the country which you have wielded with conspicuous success for so many years within the last generation - (hear, hear) - and which I am confident you will within a relatively short space - (hear, hear) - be called upon to wield again - (cheers) - for the benefit of every class of the country. (Cheers.)Enthusiasm for Fiscal ReformNow, my lords and gentlemen, you have reorganised yourselves, but an organisation is nothing as a mere machine, a mere soulless instrument, unless it be animated by convictions, by the consciousness of a mission - (hear, hear) - by a belief in principles - (hear, hear) - by a desire to reach a goal which alone will make it worthwhile for the citizens of a free country to engage in all the labours involved in carrying on free institutions. Have we those great aims? Where do we stand in respect of the principles that we desire to see adopted by the country at large? Do we feel that at this moment our affairs are being mismanaged by the present Government? (Hear, hear.) I should suppose that on that point there would be little doubt in any assembly. (Cheers.) However orthodox might be the complexion of their Radicalism that would hardly be doubted. But have we something more than a mere negative conviction, or, rather, a conviction of the negative deficiencies of our political opponents? Have we that positive consciousness that, were we called upon in our turn to govern the destinies of the Empire, we should rise to that great occasion which would then be offered us? (Cheers.) I think so. (Cheers.) If you carried your memories back, let me say, to the beginning of last session, the beginning of the year 1906, or, if you prefer, to the end of the year 1905, when the late Government resigned office, what you would find would be that, so far as we were concerned, so far as our p\u000a\u000aarty was concerned, the solitary subject, so far as I know, which excited the enthusiasm of the Unionist party, was the programme, was the desire to see some change in our fiscal system. (Loud cheers.) I am not going back on the history of the ten years of office, which I believe was one of the greatest periods of administrative success of this country - (hear, hear) - but which has passed into the domain of the historian, and is outside now, at all events for the moment, the sphere of discussion in current party controversy. Our business, ladies and gentlemen, is to make history, not to discuss it. (Hear, hear.) I have told you with general assent what the frame of mind was of our party two years ago. What was the frame of mind of our opponents? (A Voice: \u2018Nothing.\u2019) Some friend of mine in the gallery said \u2018Nothing!\u2019 I believe that to be a very accurate description - (laughter) - of all that we can learn, at all events from the authoritative utterances of their authoritative leaders. I do not know whether I misrepresent - I think I do not - some statements of the Prime Minister\u2019s, whose restoration to health we are so rejoiced to hear. (Hear, hear.) I don\u2019t know whether I misrepresent his statements before the election when I say, as far as I can remember, they were con­fined to a general expression of a desire to increase the happiness of everybody all round - in entirely proper and estimable sentiment - and a fixed intention to have an enquiry into the canal traffic of the United Kingdom - (laughter) - a proposal which, at all events, was innocuous. (Hear, hear.) But since then we have seen these gentlemen at work. We know exactly, I won\u2019t say what the Government as a unity can do, but what each Minister, in his individual and irresponsible capacity can do - (laughter) - and I rather think many of us, many of the community who are not, as we are, engaged in active political propaganda, have come to the conclusion at which we have long ago arrived, that these gentlemen are not the people to whom the safety of the country can properly be entrusted. Their conduct has raised, in addition to the great fiscal question, other issues which no Unionist can afford to forget - (hear, hear) - which no Unionist is likely to forget, and to which, before I finish, I may make a few references. (Hear, hear.) But before I come to that, let me ask you what has been the fate of the great fiscal controversy which excited among our own friends so much enthu­siasm at the time when we finally abandoned office, and when we handed over the destinies of the country to our successors. Has it lost force? (Cries of \u2018No!\u2019) Has it gained force? (Cries of \u2018Yes!\u2019) Does it represent a movement which, slowly here, rapidly there, but continuously everywhere - (hear, hear) - has gained strength? (Cries of \u2018Yes!\u2019) You have given me your answer. I agree with that answer. (Loud cheers.)Mr. Chamberlain and Tariff ReformThere are those who say that the origin, the sole origin of this great movement was a speech delivered by Mr. Chamberlain in this city in 1903. (Hear, hear.) My lords and gentlemen, even Mr. Chamberlain\u2019s great genius and great authority, even his magnificent advocacy of any cause which he has taken in hand, would have been insufficient to give permanent vitality to any great cry for reform unless the desire for reform were deeply rooted in the public needs of the com­munity. (Cheers.) And if anybody will take the trouble to do now what some day the historian will have to do, wh\u000a\u000aich is to trace the genesis of the great movement to its beginnings, they will say that it is the offspring of two quite separate, quite independent movements, both of which con­spired to make the citizens of this country utterly discontented with the fiscal system under which we have now for two genera­tions carried out our national work. What were these two streams of tendency? The first was one which convinced observers that foreign countries were becoming rivals of this country in their productive manufactures in a manner which had never been conceived, or could be conceived by the statesmen and economists of sixty years ago - (hear, hear) - and that foreign Governments were using their power, not merely in the way of seeing that their citizens possessed the opportunities of fair trade, of fair competition, with their rivals in other countries, but that their whole fiscal organisation was directed to the end of injuring the trade of their rivals and assisting the trade of those whom, rightly enough, they regarded as their clients. (Applause.) You know well enough what forms that Governmental action took. You know well enough the weak­nesses which our traditional system imposed upon the Foreign Office for the time being in carrying out negotiations with regard to treaties. We found ourselves one of many productive countries, all rivals in the same markets, all fully equipped for the great industrial warfare, a\u000a\u000and we found that while other countries were making with each other treaties for their own benefit, we were helpless in all negotiations, and had no safeguard for our interests at all, except the feeble and elusive safeguard given us by the most-favoured­-nation clause. We found also that behind the wall of tariffs which it had pleased our com­mercial rivals to erect round their respective countries, they were organising, intentionally or unintentionally, a machinery by which, in times of indifferent trade, in times of sinking trade, in times of bad trade, they could dump down upon our shores goods manufactured at a cost at least as great as those which we had to undergo, but which they were able to put down in rivalry with our manufactures at a less cost than that which we had to undergo. (\u2018Shame.\u2019) I am not quarrelling with them. My quarrel is not with foreign countries. (Hear, hear.) My quarrel is with those who, after we have had experience of the result of offering up our national industries unarmed to this kind of attack, refuse to put on the armour which they have at their disposal. (Applause.) That represents one current of opinion. I told you there were two. The other current of opinion is that which arises from the fact that in the last two generations our colonies have in the first place become great self-governing communities; and, in the second place, while that process of growth was going on, the consciousness that they belonged to a great Empire has been growing also. (Applause.) And they felt that, as members of that Empire, it was becoming to them as citizens to see that the great productive forces of this community - this Imperial community, of which we are all citizens - those productive forces should not be used with that inter­national impartiality which was the idol of the economists sixty or seventy years ago, but which, I think, in the face of modern developments, is absolutely antiquated at the present time. (Cheers.)Free Trade within the Empire\u000a\u000at;Now, so far as I am concerned, I have always thought that this idea of promotion of Free Trade within the Empire - (hear, hear) - is not only the most important of all to our commercial interests, but appeals most directly and immediately to the heart of every man who believes that he is mot merely an Englishman, a Scotchman, or an Irish­man - not merely a citizen of the United Kingdom, but that he is a member of a worldwide Empire. (Cheers.) Well, I personally have always felt that. I quite admit that until the recent conference I entertained serious doubts as to whether this great policy could be carried through in the face of the great difficulties which must surround any course of action which requires the co-operation of a large number of independent units. (Hear, hear.) And I think that those fears, though I believe them to be unfounded, were not irrational. (Hear, hear.) What I think is irrational is that these fears should still be entertained after we have experience of what occurred at the last conference. (Cheers.) I observe that members of the Government allude with a compla­cency that I am utterly unable to understand to the figure which they cut - (\u2018Hear, hear,\u2019 and laughter) - at the debate which occurred between them and the Prime Ministers of our great self-governing colonies. (Laughter.) I thought they cut a very poor figure. (Hear, hear.) At all events, of this I am sure - that every impartial spectator must have come to two conclusions. The first was that at the beginning of this year the temper of our self-governing colonies was such that it would have been easy for the British Government to make an arrangement with them, by which this Imperial inter-communication of commerce could have been enormously promoted. (Hear, hear.) Even if they could not do much they might have expressed sympathy. (Hear, hear.) Even if they could not do all that Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa desired, they might have said, \u2018We recognise the great­ness of your aims, we sympathise with your ideals, and insofar as we can do it consistently with the revenue needs of our country, we will endeavour to meet you.\u2019 (Cheers.)A Missed OpportunityThey held out not the smallest hope. (\u2018Shame!\u2019) They told those gentlemen that, insofar as they could speak for one of the great parties in the State, they rejected absolutely any offers they could make. (\u2018Shame!\u2019) And I suppose it would be rash now to say that there will ever again be an opportunity as great as that which was wantonly and recklessly thrown away by the present Government, (\u2018Hear, hear,\u2019 and applause.) Suppose our colonies now choose to say, \u2018The mother country has rejected our offers; they have, in language sometimes polite, sometimes not so polite, explained that they will have nothing to do with our commercial schemes; we will proceed, therefore, to do what we are invited to do, which is to pursue a commercial policy in which the interests of the mother country have no place at all, in which we treat Great Britain, are invited to treat Great Britain, no better than we treat those who are great com­mercial rivals of Great Britain\u2019s.\u2019 Should we in such circumstances have any right to complain? (\u2018No.\u2019) I trow not. And as I cannot foresee what course colonial policy will take, until such time as the country may recall us to power - (\u2018Hear, hear\u2019 and applause) - I can make no sure fore­cast of what the future is. But this I know - that were we, by the wave of some magician\u2019s wand, installed in office tomorrow, clearly our first duty would be to summon again that conference - (loud and prolonged cheers) - which was so hastily dis­solved. (A Voice: \u2018We won\u2019t slam the door.\u2019) We would open that door which was so rashly slammed, and see if we could not again do some­thing towards that great ideal of Imperial unity - (hear, hear) - in which every statesman, every re­sponsible statesman, of the colonies has borne a share, in which the late Government were warm sympathisers, and towards which no man has done so much as my right hon. friend the late Colonial Secretary. (Loud applause.) Time is passing­ - (\u2018No, no!\u2019) - and I have still a great deal to say to you. (Applause.) But I will condense as much as I can. (\u2018No, no!\u2019) On this question of fiscal reform - (cheers) - I do not think there is a better text to be taken than that which is given me by the resolution moved by my friend Mr. Chaplin - (cheers) - and passed, not merely unanimously, but with enthusiastic acclamation - (applause) - by the whole body of representatives. (Hear, hear.) That resolution divides the question into four heads - broadening the basis of taxation - (hear, hear) - safeguarding our great productive industries from unfair competition - (hear, hear) - strengthening our position for the purpose of negotiation in foreign markets - (hear, hear) - and establishing preferential commercial arrangements with the colonies, and securing for British producers and workmen a further advantage over foreign com­petitors in the colonial markets.Four Incontrovertible PropositionsNow to that programme of fiscal reform, taken, I believe, from a speech which I delivered to the Council of this Union - (hear, hear) - to that pro­gramme of fiscal reform, taken from that speech of mine, among others - (laughter) - I need not say I heartily subscribe. (Applause.) But the in­teresting point is not that, because that, I hope, is obvious enough - but the interesting point I think about it is this: At first sight you might sup­pose that those four propositions, however excel­lent in themselves, were separate and isolated, with no logical connection, and not to be advanced by any single fiscal policy. Now, I don\u2019t agree with that. I think you may approach these four propositions - broadening the basis of taxation, safeguarding productive industries, strengthening our position in foreign markets, and colonial preference - you might, I say, approach the whole policy from any one of those four propositions, and I believe you would arrive at the same prac­tical result. (Hear, hear.) The policy which is good for one is good for the other. Through the policy by which one can be promoted the other can be advanced, and we can confidently say that any fiscal changes we carry out would not merely be independent efforts to deal first with that proposition and then with the other, but that a comprehensive scheme by which all four of those great causes might be equally ad­vanced. (Applause.) Well, if it be a matter of indifference - and I think it is - from which of those propositions you approach the whole policy, let us, for the sake first of all of brevity, approach it from the revenue side, from the point of view which is represented by the resolution which deals with the basis of taxation. I might approach it from the others, but I will approach it from that. You will see in a moment or two why I choose that avenue of approach rather than any of the three others equally open to me. I will for the moment assume what I am subsequently going to prove - that a broadening of the basis of taxation is absolutely necessary in my judgment for revenue purposes \u2013 (hear, hear) - and that if we had no Colonies, and if there were no such thing in existence as a commercial treaty, and if no industrial phenomenon such as dumping had ever been seen or heard of, it would still be necessary for us, for the purposes of revenue and the purposes of revenue alone, to broaden the basis of taxation. There are four principles which may be laid down as practically incon­trovertible, or, at all events, which I am prepared to support by argument if necessary. The first is that your duties should be widespread, the second is that they should be small, the third is that they should not touch raw material. (Hear, hear.) The fourth is that they should not alter the proportion in which the working classes are asked to contribute to the cost of govern­ment. (Applause.) They should be small, because it is small duties which do not interfere with the natural course either of production or of consumption. They should be numerous, because if you require revenue, and if your duties are small, you must have many articles of consump­tion subject to those duties. Need I argue the other two questions - the question as to whether they should be applied to raw material or whether they should be used to alter the balance of Imperial burdens upon the working classes. Those require no argument. They have always been both the commonplaces of the Unionist party in this controversy and the subject of the grossest mis­representation by gentlemen who differ from us in opinion. (Applause.) And in my judgment, while those are four conditions which should govern any reform in our fiscal system, it would be folly for us to go beyond them, and to exclude from any redistribution or any alteration which, subject to those conditions, it might be necessary to make in our fiscal system, any articles of import whatever. Let our general import system be subject to revision and consideration. I, for my part, never have consented, and never will consent, either to bind myself or to suggest to any friend of mine that he should bind himself to exclude from this redistribution, this alteration of taxation, any article of import whatever \u2013 provided - (\u2018Ah! That\u2019s it!\u2019 and laughter) - firstly, that it is not raw material - (hear, hear) - and, secondly, that the tax put upon it is not a tax which would augment the proportion paid by the working man to the general taxation of the country. (Cheers.) Now, observe, that in this general scheme - I may say, incidentally, that I am not going to be bullied by our opponents - (cheers) - into doing what they never think of doing, which is to give an account of the precise details of their procedure some years ahead - I have laid down these general propositions. Their character is unmistakable, they are perfectly plain, they are perfectly precise, and while I reserve to myself the right to ask the gentlemen questions - the Chancellor of the Exchequer and others - (laughter) - to ask them some questions before the autumn campaign is over - (laughter and \u2018Hear, hear\u2019) - I consider that they are paid £5,000 a year to answer questions - (laughter and cheers) - the most they can ask of me is to lay down the principles on which I should propose to act were I again called to the councils of my Sovereign. (Cheers.)Not Backward, But ForwardBefore I pass to some of the things I am bound to talk to you about tonight, I must deal with one commentary which I hear perpetually echoed and re-echoed from more or less responsible quarters. I am told that in this policy I am recommending a return to some antiquated and discredited fiscal system. I am doing nothing of the kind. (Cheers.) I do not ask you to go back; I ask you to go forward. (Cheers.) I do not ask you to take to yourselves bows and arrows and Brown Bess and all the antiquated machinery of a system which may have suited its own day, but does not suit ours. (Hear, hear.) What I am asking you to do is to abandon a system which itself is antiquated - (hear, hear) - which was started when the industrial world was framed on wholly different lines from that which we see determining its character at the present moment. When the fiscal system under which we now suffer - (cheers) - was originally started there was no question in the minds of any public man or any economist about markets. The difficulty of finding markets for British goods was not one that suggested itself, or could suggest itself to anybody. (Hear, hear.) Would anybody say that that is the state of things at the present time? (\u2018No!\u2019) Would anybody say that the whole forces of industrial development in the world at the present moment are not tending towards making it more and more difficult for us to find the outlet for our manufactured goods which is essential to our national existence? (Cheers.) The second observation I have to make is that the diplomatic difficulty of commercial treaties was never thought of two generations ago. There were not these commercial treaties. The Foreign Office was not called upon to deal day by day with commercial rivals without having anything in its hand either to give or to withhold. That is a new fact. It is a fact that ought never to be forgotten. (Hear, hear.) Well, the colonies? When our vaunted system of taxation was established the British colonies were not merely in their infancy \u2013 they were in their cradle. (Hear, hear.) It never occurred to anybody that they were the great nations of the future, that it was to our interest as well as our duty to make commercial arrangements, and the whole colonial aspect is absolutely of novel growth within the memory of almost every man and woman I am addressing, born, indeed, within the last fifteen years, and in no sense present to the minds of the economists and legislators of the time of Sir Robert Peel. Take corn, again. The old theory of British economics on corn was based on the fact of what economists called the law of diminishing returns, which meant that as a community increased in numbers the pressure on the means of subsistence would increase also, and various consequences, of which I will not speak now, would ensue. But that is no longer the law governing wheat. Wheat is now subject, not to the law of increasing cost, it is subject to the law of diminishing cost, and the enormous strides which the growth of wheat in Canada, Argentina, and elsewhere, the enormous improvements in transport - however unfortunate to the farming class to which I belong - (laughter and applause) - absolutely destroy the whole basis of the economic argument familiar to our forefathers. The last point is the point of revenue. When our present basis of taxation was started, it was easy to get all the revenue you required from the sources which we now strain almost to the breaking point. (Hear, hear.) Is it easy now? (\u2018No.\u2019) Will the Chancellor of the Exchequer say it is easy now? (\u2018No.\u2019) Here are four points, and they are the pivots of the whole argu­ment I have addressed to you tonight, and of every argument I have ever addressed to any public meet­ing. I say that no one single point of those four, the governing consideration of the whole argument, were present to the great men - their greatness I do not minimise or desire to minimise - or could be present to the great men who were the founders of our present fiscal system. (Hear, hear.) I leave it to the Radical Party to bow down in this abject submission to a dead authority. (Cheers.) I leave it to them to base their whole policy upon conditions which once existed but which exist no longer - (hear, hear) - and to show their love of progress - (laughter) - their consciousness of the changing needs of an ever-developing society by binding themselves, now and for all time, to the dead formulae of the great men who would have been the first to scorn the action they are taking. (Cheers.) Well, ladies and gentlemen, I know of only one possible answer to the argument that I have laid before you, and it is this: It may be said the present system of taxation, at all events, is adequate for our needs; what the country wants it can get from the present sources open to the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Is that true? (\u2018No!\u2019) Is there the smallest prospect of it? (\u2018No!\u2019) Observe that this was a point on which it was very difficult - almost impossible, I think - to pronounce a conclusive opinion before a popular audience until the present Chancellor of the Exchequer had had the opportunity of pre­senting two Budgets to the nation. He has pre­sented two Budgets, and nothing could be more certain that while we are all desirous, and for the best of reasons, to promote national economy, it is quite impossible that we should carry out the ordinary duties of national and Imperial defence and the other duties incumbent upon a Government, and also pursue a policy of social reform - (hear, hear) - unless we have some possi­bility of increasing the sources from which our public expenditure must ultimately come.Socialism versus Social ReformI observe that the Chancellor of the Ex­chequer devoted a speech the other day, or the large part of a speech, to the discussion of social reform and Socialism. Everybody will admit - everybody in this room, I think will admit - that while social reform has always been a cardinal element in the Unionist programme, the growth of Socialism is a disquieting phenomenon at the present time. Well, the Chancellor of the Ex­chequer is very naturally fidgety and nervous about being confused with those Socialists who are alienating some of his best supporters - (laughter) - and he very properly desires to clear his character before the world. I read a speech in which he cleared his character. Perhaps you will allow me to read the central extract from his speech. It is quite worth it. (Laughter.) This is what Mr. Asquith said: \u2018If they asked him at what point it was that Liberalism and what was called Socialism in the true strict sense of the term parted company, be would answer when liberty in its positive and not merely in its negative sense was threatened.\u2019 (Laughter.) I am told, ladies and gentlemen, that there are people uncritical enough to accuse me of an over-subtlety of statement. (Laughter.) But mere plain men - (laughter) - as the Prime Minister described them last night - mere plain men, when they set themselves to the task, have an extraordinary gift of ambiguity. (Hear, hear.) \u2018When liberty in its positive and not merely in its negative sense is threatened.\u2019 (Laughter.) That is the point at which Liberalism ceases to be Liberalism and becomes Socialism - (laughter and cheers) - and Socialism becomes no longer Liberalism. Now it is my happy destiny to sit opposite the crowded benches of the Government side, filling not merely the right hand part of the House of Commons, but extending to the Independent Labour Party, who sit below the gangway on our own side. When I return next session I shall look with the greatest curiosity to see where this fissure occurs. (Laughter.)What Socialism IsI shall pass my eye from the amiable and comfort­able capitalists and landowners - (Laughter) - who sit behind the Treasury Bench, down across the gangway, and then up on the left-hand side to the Speaker, and I shall ask myself where the precise division occurs between the gentlemen who interfere with liberty on its negative side - (laughter) - who threaten liberty on its negative side, and those who threaten liberty on its positive side. (\u2018Hear, hear,\u2019 and applause.) It would be a very interesting subject of investigation. (Laughter.) And as we are asking questions of each other from platform to platform, I should like to have the Chancellor of the Exchequer\u2019s views on the precise point where this unhappy division between Liberalism and Socialism occurs. (Laughter.) But, in truth, ladies and gentlemen, it seems to me that there is no difficulty or ambiguity about the subject at all. Socialism has one meaning, and one meaning only. (Hear, hear.) Socialism means, and can mean, nothing else than that the community or the State is to take all the means of production into its own hands, that private enterprise and private pro­perty are to come to an end, and all that private enterprise and private property carry with them. That is Socialism, and nothing else is Socialism. (Applause.) Social reform is when the State, based upon private enterprise, based upon private property, recognising that the best productive results can only be attained by respect­ing private property and encouraging private enterprise - (applause) - asks them to contribute towards great national, social, and public ob­jects. That is Social reform. (Hear, hear.) There is, there can be, or ought to be, no ambiguity between the two, and we need not discuss either liberty in its positive or liberty in its negative sense when we are dealing with this plain pro­position. Now I have one observation to make upon the social aspect, upon the effect on the State of these two plans. Socialism I believe to be absolutely ruinous - (hear, hear) - not to the possessors of property principally or chiefly, but to the whole community, which depends not upon dividing the wealth of those who are above the average, but upon increasing the production of the whole community. (Hear, hear) It is upon the productive activity, the inventiveness, the enterprise, the knowledge, the readiness to run risks and to bear the result of risks when they go wrong - (hear, hear) - it is on these that a great community depends, and on these alone, for the wealth it can use. As regards social reform, I admit the difficulty. I admit that there is nothing in the world which more tries the statesmanship of those entrusted with office than really to carry out something which is not merely to figure as social reform on a platform, but which is to make the lot of the unfortunate and the toiler and the aged better, happier, healthier. The only con­dition which is to be kept in mind in that connec­tion is that if you ask from the community at large too great a contribution, even for the best of objects, you defeat your own end - (hear, hear) - by destroying the productive efficiency of the com­munity on which alone all your philanthropic efforts must ultimately be based. Very well, I ask now how is Mr. Asquith going to find the money for his social reform on the present basis of taxation? He is fond of asking questions of those who have no responsibility for the present conduct of affairs. I ask him, who has responsibility, how he means to do it? (Hear, hear.) I cannot con­ceive it. (Hear, hear.) Ladies and gentlemen, social reform has long been the work of the Unionist Party - (applause) - as distinguished from the Radical or Socialist Party. I was amused in reading in this very speech of Mr. Asquith a statement that we are all in favour of social reform, which some call erroneously Socialism, and that nobody would care to go back upon such great changes in our system as that involved in free education, the labour laws, the Factory Acts, the Housing Acts, and other great feats of social reform of the past. Nobody will go back on them. But who did them? (\u2018Hear hear,\u2019 and applause.) Was it Mr. Asquith\u2019s friends or predecessors - (\u2018No!\u2019) - or was it the party of which we all here are members?  (\u2018Yes.\u2019)The Real Social ReformersGo back sixty years, trace the course of ameliora­tive legislation through all that period, and you will find the stamp of the Unionist party upon every serious effort. You will find that the men who are, in the Chancellor of the Exchequer\u2019s view, entangled in the desire to support this or that privilege, this or that class - that these men, these class politicians, are the only ones who have found time, while they were in office, really to carry out the work of social reform, of which the Radical party can present us nothing except perorations. (Laughter.) We passed the Acts; they give us a sort of general survey of British history from which you suppose that everything had been done by them. As a matter of fact, nothing has been done by them - nothing or next to nothing. (Applause.) And why? For a reason given you by the Prime Minister last night, which is only an echo of similar reasons, given by a long line of his distinguished predecessors. The Prime Minister cannot give social reform because he has got to destroy the House of Lords. (Laughter and applause.) I am not travestying his argument. I believe I have quoted him literally. That is exactly what they have always said. The Radical, when he is face to face with a social problem, says, \u2018An excellent object, an object to which we may all devote the whole efforts of our great and historic party - (laughter) - but before we do so we must destroy this or that institution. (Hear, hear.) We must carry out this or that political reform, and the welfare of the worker, the happiness of the crowded centres of our great towns, the conditions of industry - they must wait until we have reformed the Constitution and provided the machinery by which we can effectively carry into practice all the great professions with which for fifty years we have tickled the ears of the public.\u2019 (Laughter and \u2018Hear, hear.\u2019) My lords and gentlemen, we are a more modest party. We think the machinery provided for us by our ancestors is not inadequate to the task of carrying out social reform. (Hear, hear.) We think that in addition to all that has been done for the housing of the working classes in the great towns, there may yet be remedies found, and that we may be privileged to find them. (Hear, hear.) We think that in addition to all we have done to increase small ownership - (hear, hear) - agricultural and urban, and in addition to all that has been done - and it has all been done by our party - (hear, hear) - in addition to all that, yet more can be done. (Hear, hear.) This idea, that you are going to improve the agricultural position of Great Britain by handing over the management of smallholdings, either to county councils or a bureaucracy in Edinburgh - (laughter) - and by depriving the holders of the stimulus which ownership in every period of history and every part of the world has always given to agri­cultural progress - we think that wholly and utterly absurd. (Hear, hear.) We think that if the conditions of labour are to be improved, above all if there is to be a great reform of the Poor Laws - (hear, hear) and all causes analogous to relief but outside relief, such as provision for old age - (hear, hear) - that if those are to be carried out it will not be aided by wasting some years in a great political revolution, of which the result is to destroy one of the immemorial ele­ments of the British Constitution. (Hear, hear) We have before us a great task. I asked you at the beginning of my speech now, I am sorry to say, a very long time ago - (\u2018No!\u2019) - I asked you at the beginning of my speech, whether the Unionist party had or had not that great sense of public obligation and public mission which alone makes it worthwhile organising and re­organising, and spending such efforts as those of  which you have all been witnesses today. Can anyone doubt that we have such a mission? We have the great cause of fiscal reform - (cheers) - in all its branches, the revenue branch, the foreign branch, the colonial branch - we have it in all those branches before us to deal with.The Work before the PartyWe have the great cause of social reform, deal­ing, as I have said, with the condition of the workers, the condition of the livers in urban and rural districts, the increase of small ownership, the complete remodelling of the Poor Law - (cheers) - and the attempt to deal with the mighty problem of the whole. All these we have before us, for we are untrammelled with the necessity of abolishing anything or anybody - (cheers) - except abolishing the present majority in the House of Commons. (Cheers.) Surely, my lords, ladies and gentlemen, that is a prospect which should inspire the heart of every Unionist, should fill him with enthusiasm, should make him equal to any effort, should make him feel that his patriotic task is one worthy of the highest efforts of which he is capable, and all the talents of which God has made him master. (Applause.) May I appeal to you, who come from all the various constituencies in England, to carry to your respective regions the message which I have, however imperfectly, endeavoured to give you? May I appeal to you to fill them with enthusiasm for these great objects of national endeavour, and if, as I doubt not, you fulfil that mission, if you use the enthusiasm which you have shown today, both in the proceedings of this afternoon and this evening, if you use that enthusiasm in propagating the great cause of which we are the guardians, can anybody doubt, can any human being doubt, that the time is not far distant when we shall be able to resume the thread of Imperial Government and social reform, interrupted briefly by a dark episode, but inter­rupted only to make the original cause shine out more clearly and more resplendently - (applause) - and that many of the annual meetings of this great company will not occur before I, or someone standing in my place, will be able to tell yon that the great task is taken in hand not merely as a matter of theory or speculation, but as the work of a responsible Government, having behind it the confidence of a great people. (Prolonged cheers.)

aVI remember very well, almost ten years ago, coming here to speak at a meeting held under the auspices of the National Liberal Federation. We were then on the eve, amid considerable party difficulties, of electing Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman to be our leader in the House of Commons. I find myself tonight once more face to face with a great gathering called under the same auspices, very soon after he has passed to his rest and it is but natural and fitting at such a moment that before we do anything else, we should recall the work that he did, the example that he set, in those intervening years of strenuous and disinterested labour, by which he won for himself not only the attachment of his own party, but the respect and the confidence of the whole nation. Mr. Chairman, as the man who has been chosen to be his immediate successor, I should be failing in my duty if I did not take this opportunity of acknow­ledging that the dislocation and the delays which are inevitable in any transfer of leadership have in this instance been to a large, I believe to an unexampled, degree mitigated and indeed removed by the unselfish loyalty of my colleagues, and the unstinted good will of the party both in the House of Commons and in the country.The Government RecordI have not come here tonight to promulgate any new pro­gramme; the aims which for the last three years we have followed, and the spirit in which we have followed them, continue to be the purposes and the inspiration of our policy. I shall not, Sir, attempt any detailed retrospect of these three years; two or three words, however, I will permit myself to say about them. In the sphere of legislation you have only got to look at the Statute book to see how much has been accomplished of useful and too-long ­delayed reform; but I am sure I need not remind you that, for reasons upon which it is not necessary for the moment to dilate, the Statute book - many and valuable as are the chapters that have been added to it - the Statute book is no adequate or trustworthy measure of that which we have attempted. Gentlemen, it is a commonplace among the less well informed of our Tory critics - and they are very numerous - to say when the Liberal party is in power it devotes all the time and the energy of Parliament to tinkering with constitutional changes to the sacrifice, or at any rate the postponement, of social reform. Well, now, looking back upon those three years, I can only recall one measure introduced by us which could be described fairly or unfairly as coming within that category, and that is a measure of which my colleagues and I are not in the least degree ashamed - or of the time and the labour which were unavailingly expended on the Bill for the abolition of plural voting, which was contemptuously rejected on its second reading by the House of Lords. This was a Bill, I say, embodying a reform in our opinion not only urgent, but indispensable, if the object of our electoral system is, as it ought to be, to provide a true and not a distorted reflection of the genuine opinion of the constituencies of the country.Social ReformBut, ladies and gentlemen, as a matter of fact, as the Statute book shows, and will continue to show, our main energies have been during these three years to measures of social reform. I will give you two or three illustrations. Workmen\u2019s compensation; we have admitted to the benefit of the law millions of workpeople who under the legislation of the late Government were excluded from it. And small-holdings; we have for the first time set up a really practical machinery for bringing within the reach of those who demand it - and there are many in all parts of the country - the opportunity of acquiring and of working small-holdings for them­selves. And criminal appeal; we have obliterated a blot - for it was a blot - upon our judicial system by giving to everyone con­victed of crime the same opportunity which a person mulcted for damages in a civil case has always had of having his case reheard and his sentence reviewed. And this year, in the case of old age pensions, we continue the same work upon the same lines. Why do I mention these things? Ladies and gentlemen, these are all things about which the Tories have been talking, and preaching, and gesticulating, and perorating for years. We have carried them into law.Administration - FinanceAnd if I may say one word about the other sphere, the equally important sphere of administration, I will take only two illustrations. First of all, I will venture to take that with which I myself have been personally associated - the domain of finance. What have we been doing there? Paying off the liabilities incurred by pre­decessors. We have brought back the National Debt to what it was twenty years ago; we have reduced and we are reducing the taxes upon tea and sugar - necessaries of life; we have made the income-tax at the same time more equitable and more productive. In that way I claim for us, that without deviating one hair\u2019s breadth from the principles of Free Trade, we have set free the finances and have re-established the credit of this country to a degree which will make it able to meet any legitimate calls - and such calls will be many - which are made upon it for the exigencies of social reform.South African PolicyThe other illustration I will take is derived from a totally different sphere - I refer to our policy in South Africa. You will remember - well, every politician in this hall remembers - the con­fident predictions made when we came into office, that what with our unhappy pledges on Chinese labour, and what with our rash policy and plea of immediate autonomy, our ship was certain, sooner or later, and sooner rather than later, either to founder among the shoals, or be shot among the rocks of repatriation of the Chinese. It was said to be midsummer madness. It would lead to irreplaceable shortness in the labour needed for the mines, and cause in South Africa financial and industrial collapse, and here in England and in Scotland widespread ruin among innocent widows and orphans - those innocent widows and orphans whose little all at that time was largely invested in the faith of the continuance of Chinese labour, but since that time appears to have been shifted. How arguments repeat themselves! As to self-government, the notion of placing power in the hands of the unreconciled, irreconcilable enemies of this country was only worthy of faddists and fanatics, who were prepared to contemplate the permanent estrangement of the two races and the ultimate loss of South Africa to the Empire. How does it all look after twelve months of actual experience? The Chinese are going, before many months are over the last of them will have re-embarked for his native shore, but the mines are prosperous, the labour supply is abundant and increasing, and the output of gold is larger than it ever was at any time. And as regards the constitutional question in the Transvaal and the Orange River Colony, you have two Ministries in power recruited largely, indeed mainly, from those who only a few years ago were bearing arms against us in the field, and whose loyalty no one now ventures to impeach, under whose wise and statesmanlike rule racial divi­sions are rapidly being obliterated, and a way is being paved for the natural evolution of parties on ordinary lines. Never in the whole history of our Empire has the policy of Liberalism been more rapidly and more completely vindicated by our party.Tariff ReformBut, gentlemen, I am not going to speak of the past, for you will naturally expect me, and it is my duty, to say something both of the present and of the future. Before I sit down I shall say a word or two on the legislation which is now before the House of Commons. But before I do that I want, if I may, to recall you for a few moments to the issue raised here in this city five years ago, which for three years dominated public interest and public controversy, and which some people - I myself was never one - believed to have been settled for a generation by the election of 1906. Gentlemen, what is called Tariff Reform is in these days not much talked about in the House of Commons. We have every Session one full dress debate which, I am afraid, to be absolutely faithful, I must say cuts a very sorry figure. It is not much written about in the Press, but in the constituencies it is the object, never forget, of an unceasing and a ceaseless propaganda. In my opinion, it is every whit as necessary now as it was five or as it was three years ago, that the case for Free Trade should be constantly presented to our fellow countrymen, not only in its broad and general aspects, but in its application to particular industries and particular districts, and with special reference to the chameleon colourings, to the ever-shifting variations of the fallacies which are always at the service of the cause of Tariff Reform. You must have noticed during the last few months considerable change in the temper and spirits of the Tariff Reformers. While our over-sea trade was booming they were, to use a homely expression, down in the dumps. But they are beginning to recover their spirits under the stimulus of a monthly decrease in the Board of Trade returns. It is no wonder that they were a little depressed, for every assumption which they took for granted, every prediction which they hazarded five years ago, has been woefully falsified by the facts.Some Tariff Reform Assumptions   I do not think I am wasting your time if I recall to your recollection one or two of those assumptions. It will not take me very long. In the first place, you will remember well that they told us that one of our greatest dangers as an industrial nation was the appalling rate at which the dumping foreigner was pouring his goods, and particularly his manufactured goods, into our markets and underselling the home producer, driving British labour out of employment. Well, what are the facts? In the extraordinary development, the enormous development, during the four years that followed, of our overseas trade, the one item which showed the least elasticity was the imports into this country of foreign manufactured goods. In 1902, the foreign manufactured goods imported and retained were valued at 115 millions. In 1907, notwithstanding the enormous expansion, as I have said, that had gone on in the interval, they had only risen to 128 millions, or a rise of 11 per cent. Now come to the other - second - danger, and the most interesting and edifying contrast it presents. The second danger alleged was the relative inelasticity of our own export trade, particularly in regard, again, to manufactured goods. What are the facts? There in 1902 we exported of manufactured goods of British produce 227 millions, in 1907, 344 millions, an increase of 50 per cent. The imports of foreign manufactured goods here rose 11 per cent, our exports of British goods rose 50 per cent. Finally, I would give you one other illustration, and one other only. We were told of the growing relative importance of our colonial as compared with our foreign trade. What were the facts about that? In 1902, foreign trade was 61 per cent, in 1907 it had risen to nearly 68 per cent, and the colonial trade, which in 1902 was 38 per cent, had dwindled in 1907 to little more than 32 per cent. That is in regard to the past; but they are now fixing their hopes on the declining trade, which is common to us and to every country in the world. Well, if Free Trade stood, as it has stood, the test of abounding prosperity throughout the whole of the industrial world, still more, I venture to predict, will it stand the test of declining prosperity. For depend upon it, the less prosperous your trade and other people\u2019s trade becomes, the more need you have here in this country for the cheap and unimpeded inflow of all materials for food and industry.\u2018Not a Diamond, but a Formula\u2019I must, before I leave this question, ask again a question. I have often asked it before. What is the remedy which the Tariff Reformers have to offer? Are we any nearer understanding it than we were three years ago? I do not know whether you noticed  some proceedings which have been going on in Paris this week in regard to an alleged invention of a process for producing artificial diamonds. The professed discoverer of this valuable secret was allowed his time to give a concrete demonstration, of its efficacy. The time expired; the appointed hour struck; the discoverer failed to appear, and he seems to have left behind him, not on a half-sheet of notepaper, but in an envelope, not a diamond, but a formula. Yes, and the formula is a delightfully simple one. You are to take some carbon; put it in a crucible; heat it till it crystallises; then apply the requisite pressure, and, as the formula runs, \u2018it remains only to take out the diamond.\u2019 I am not surprised to read in the papers this morning that the experts to whom the practical trial of this process has been referred report that the consequences are not wholly satisfactory. After all, this formula is just as lucid, and I think just as likely to yield the desired result, as is the formula of our friends who propose to give us a sort of scientific tariff.What is the Formula of a Scientific Tariff?What is the formula of a scientific tariff? Take a lot of import duties; make them low enough to bring in an abounding revenue; make them at the same time high enough to exclude the unfair competition of foreign goods, and you have a scientific tariff. That is the formula of what may be called the full-blown and full\u2011blooded Tariff Reform. But so far we have only the formula. When we ask for the diamond - I mean the tariff - they say, as Mr. Bonar Law, one of the cleverest of them, said in the hearing of many of us in the House of Commons the other day, \u2018Oh! wait till I am Chancellor of the Exchequer.\u2019 That is the way in which history repeats itself. But there is another formula, also invented in Birmingham - an older formula, offered, I think, in this very place where we are now, less than a year ago, by Mr. Balfour. (Some cheers.) I am quite prepared to join in that tribute, because I think what has happened in our time, even in Birmingham, has done the Liberal party quite as much good.Mr. Balfour\u2019s Formula Mr. Balfour has not wholly committed himself, apparently to the Protective side of Tariff Reform, but he has a formula of his own, a very simple one, today, a lot of small duties, but they are not to be put on raw material - not, for instance, upon hops - and they are not to increase the burden on the poor, or the cost of the necessaries of life. Gentlemen, this is the mildest, most diluted version of Tariff Reform - the authorised, orthodox version, which affects to regard it as merely an instrument for raising revenue. Is it an easier one to apply in practice than the other? I do not think it is. As a method of raising revenue it is open to a crowd of objections, of which I will mention two. First of all, experience shows, our own experience in this country especially, that a network of small duties is of all fiscal expedients the most costly, the most irritating, the most obstructive to trade, and the most unproductive in the end. That is what the fine phrase of \u2018broadening the basis of taxation\u2019 comes to when you translate it into actual practice. The next objection I make is this. The wit of man has not yet succeeded, and what is more never will succeed, in evolving a workable definition of raw material. For you can never escape from this plain and simple proposition, that which is the finished product of one industry is the raw material of the next.     What About Colonial Preference?Well, gentlemen, there are two questions which I should still like to put to Tariff Reformers who think for the twentieth time that they have captured Mr. Balfour, and are content for the moment to adopt his formula as a shibboleth. The first is: What about Colonial Preference? You are not going to tax raw material, and you are not going to tax food, at any rate in such a way as to increase the cost of the necessaries of living of the working classes in this country. Your Colonies export nothing but raw material, and how, under those governing conditions, are you going to give them a preference? Another question, and it is equally relevant, I ask these Tariff Reformers - Are they content with a tariff such as Mr. Balfour proposes, which is not framed, and avowedly not framed, to increase the employment of labour in this city? But Tariff Reformers are very angry now when you tell them that Tariff Reform is represented as a panacea for unemployment; yet it is not so very long since their vans, and posters, and daily organs in the Press bore that as a conspicuous motto, and I would venture to refer in this connection to Mr. Chamberlain\u2019s own declarations, written, I think, from Birmingham, in September 1905, when he said: \u2018All we want is fair play in foreign trade; to treat our friends and kinsmen across the seas better than the stranger outside the gates. Yes, and then there will be full employment for all, work for all, and with full employment will come a rise in wages and in the standard of living.\u2019 That is the sacred text - are we to understand that it no longer forms part of the economical scriptures?       \u2018Who Fares Better Than We? - Who Suffers Less?\u2019Gentlemen, I have one word more, and only one word more, to say upon this subject, but it is a subject which I entreat you to bear in mind and constantly to impress upon your fellow electors, and on those whom you come across in this country. Put to them this question - with whom would you like the people of England to change places fiscally? With which of the protectionist countries? With the United States of America, which is slowly recovering from a financial and commercial crisis that has inflicted untold loss both upon capital and upon labour? With Germany, which has suspended its sinking fund, which is borrowing enormous sums year after year to defray its annual and normal expenditure - Germany whose statesmen, in the full enjoyment be it remembered of a scientifically broadened basis of taxation, are at this moment at their wits\u2019 end to discover new sources of revenue? No, gentlemen, say to your fellow countrymen what is true, that when the world\u2019s trade is prosperous - ask them this - who fares better than we do? When the world\u2019s trade is slack and depressed, who suffers less? Tell them Free Trade is the open secret and the well-tried safeguard both of your financial and industrial stability.An Education SettlementI must pass from that; and while we ought not to forget - and I have endeavoured in what I have said to impress it upon you \u2011 while we ought not to forget the continued urgency of the call to maintain and defend Free Trade, our main energies are being given this year to pushing forward at Westminster three great measures of social reform. First of all, with regard to education, we have not abandoned, and we do not intend to abandon it. Our two great fundamental unchangeable principles - popular control where public money goes, and in the national system of education at no stage and upon no rung of the ladder - anything in the nature of a denominational test - they have got to be recognised, not in letter but in spirit. In any settlement that may be arrived at of this problem - and that I believe is becoming now a matter of common acknowledgment - subject to that overruling condition, but subject always to that, we can afford to be reasonable in matters of detail. For which of us is there, what man or woman of this great audience whom I am now addressing, which of us is there who does not feel that the time has come in this matter for men of all parties, and women too, to demand that the interest of the children shall dominate, and shall drown the clamour of the section?The Licensing BillLet me say a word now with regard to the Licensing Bill. That certainly is a Bill for which I myself am primarily responsible;  I staked my own political fortunes, and so far as I could I staked the fortunes of the Government and the party upon it. We were told it was a very foolhardy thing to do. We shall see. For my part I believe we never did a wiser thing. Of the Bill I will venture to say two things tonight. In the first place, on the one side it represents the latest phase of the perpetual conflict which, generation after generation, the Liberal party has been waging to assert the paramount supremacy of public over private and of general over particular interests. The second thing which I venture to say to you is this - that upon the other side it is the boldest and the most thorough-going attempt that has yet been made to attack at its very source the most potent of all the causes of poverty and of crime. I do not pretend to forecast either its Parliamentary or its electoral fortune; but whatever course they may take, we shall persevere with it.Old Age PensionsThe last of the three measures to which I am going to refer is that which is at present under discussion in the House of Commons - the Bill for the establishment of a system of old age pensions. Let me, if you will bear with me for two or three minutes, discuss very briefly one or two arguments that are used, not, indeed, in opposition, for there are very few people who have ventured to oppose it, but in criticism and disparagement of our Bill. It is said that such a system of old age pensions as I proposed in my Budget speech will in the long run, if it is not fatal to it, at any rate will discourage the practice of thrift among the working classes of this country. I wish people who use arguments like this would descend from their studies and their lecture-rooms into the  streets and lanes. What do they find? They would find a man - this is a typical and normal case, as I am sure almost every man here would admit - they would find over and over again a man who is receiving a weekly wage in precarious and not settled employment. He has first of all to maintain a home for himself and for his children. Very often he has also to support his parents, who have passed the years of work, or at least to contribute to their support. He has further, if he is a prudent man, to make provision against sickness and against unemployment. And upon the top of that to say that unless thrift is to be discouraged he has further to make provision for old age, and that this comparatively paltry sum of five shillings per week given to people over seventy years of age, will sap at the very sources of prudence, self-reliance, and independence. The argument needs only to be stated in order to refute itself.The Objections to a Contributory SchemeThere is another criticism which you see very much used, and which passed muster, I think, lately, if not entirely, in the same quarter - the criticism that we have adopted what is called the non-contributory plan. What are the objections that to my mind will be absolutely fatal to what is called a contributory scheme of provision for old age? In the first place, it involves delay. It will put outside the beneficent operations of the scheme practically all old people now living in this country. In the second place, if carried out fairly, it requires compulsion, and that the British working man, if I know him, is not prepared to stand. In the next place it would imply uneven discrimination as between different forms of thrift. Are you to give a preference to the man who pays contributions into a friendly society or trade union, over one who bought a house for himself, or helps to build a house for himself, or indulges in any form of investment which thrift can procure? And, last, what condemns it entirely to my mind, and makes it wholly irrelevant, makes it out of place, the need is greatest when opportunity and means of contribution do not exist at all.Essentially a Provisional SchemeI have said, and my colleagues have said, and it cannot be too fully realised by all friends and supporters in the country, that the scheme which we have put forward is in all its aspects in the nature of a provisional scheme. You can get a thousand cases of hardship out of it, I agree. There is the limit of age. It is hard that the man of sixty-nine cannot have a pension. There is the limit of income. It is hard that a man with 1ls. should not get a pension where the man with 10s. a week should. There is the question of the exclusion of paupers. It is very hard that the poor old man of seventy years of age, who has been receiving 2s. or 3s. a week in the shape of out-relief during the last twelve months, should for the moment be shut out from the benefit scheme. They are all cases of hardship. I could multiply them indefinitely, and no one knows better than I do and my colleagues how many, and how severe, they are. But you have to put this thing upon its legs. You must make a beginning. If you wait to evolve a perfect scheme which shall be no hardship to any one, you will have to wait till the day of judgment, if not later, and the net result of this scheme - provisional as I admit it to be, full of neces­sary anomalies as I admit it to be - the net result of the scheme, do not forget that, is that next year there will be over half-a-­million of these old people in receipt of pensions, who will be receiving the provision for old age which the law has never before made for them.The Children and Housing BillsThese three great measures do not stand alone. They are part of a large social programme, with at least two further instalments of which we hope to make progress this Session, though others must be left over to the next and the following years. I refer to the Children Bill, now nearly emerging from the Grand Committee, and the Housing Bill of that wise and strenuous democratic statesman, my friend and colleague John Burns. The object of that measure, as you know, is to secure for our people, both in town and country, decent, healthy, habitable homes, a reform both urgent and beneficent, though I certainly agree with those who think its necessary complement is a reconstruction, a complete reconstruction, of our valua­tion and rating system.The Governing Object of the Government ProgrammeThere is one final question I should like to put to you and to my fellow Liberals everywhere. What is the governing object, what is the ultimate purpose, of this social programme in all its various ramifications and development - improved housing, rating of site values, increased facilities for the acquisition of land both in agricultural and public purposes, the systematised protection, in all its stages, of child life, a genuine national system of education, a more stringent control of the liquor traffic, and a certain and sure pro­vision for old age? Cynics will tell you that this is a mere assort­ment of baits of varying colour and attractiveness with which to carry on the ignoble sport of angling for votes. You know better. The object which runs through them all is this, to diffuse and, so far as may be, to equalise the burdens, to make life brighter, easier, richer, more fruitful for the bulk of our fellow countrymen, to break through and break down the present environment of squalor and temptation, and to banish, if we can, and in so far as we can, the shadow of anxiety for the future which, to so many of them, darkens every stage of the journey from youth to old age. That, as we believe, as we Liberals believe, is the way, and the only way in which to make the best of each in the interests of all - to create and sustain, in the only worthy sense of the word, a community of free men in a free state.

aVI thank you with all my heart for the kindness of your greeting. It is, I think, now something like five years since I last had the opportunity of addressing an audience in Southport. We were then on the eve of what proved to be a momentous and decisive election, and it was a great satisfaction to be able to come here and say a few words in support of the claims upon the confidence of the electors of Southport of my friend Mr. Astbury. No Liberal member returned at that election has more faithfully redeemed his pledges, or better deserved the confidence of his constituents; and it is to us, his friends and colleagues in the House of Commons, as I am sure it must be to you, the electors of Southport, a matter of infinite regret that considerations of health, and of health alone, require him to retire for a time, and we hope only for a time, from the active discharge of the duties of public life. I am glad to recog­nise that I am confronted tonight by an audience which is not drawn only from Southport, but from all parts of the United Kingdom. There can be no greater pleasure for those of us whose working days and nights are spent at Westminster than from time to time to meet the men and women who in the different constituencies of the country are doing the hard everyday work of Liberalism - if I may venture to adopt the current phraseology of the hour, those who are ripening undeveloped opinion, those who are winning un-gotten votes to add to, as we hope and believe, and to enlarge the patrimony of our party.The Assassination of Sir Curzon WyllieNow, before I get to controversial topics, I think I should only be doing justice to your feelings and my own if in a sentence I give expression to the horror felt everywhere in this country at a detestable crime which was yesterday committed in London. A distinguished officer of the State, a man of blameless character, after a long record of eminent service, was struck down by the hand of an assassin. We mourn his loss, and we give our sympathy, our heartfelt sympathy, to those whom he has left behind. And I will only add this, that you have here a startling and emphatic piece of evidence as to the character and the methods of the conspiracy, happily confined to a small number of people, but desperate and determined in its methods, which I felt it my duty a few days ago to describe in the House of Commons.South African UnionOn an occasion like this, when we have more or less to take stock at the end of twelve months of the political situation, we naturally and appropriately extend our vision in the first instance beyond the limits of our own purely domestic concerns. I am not going to say anything to you tonight about what are called foreign politics; but in such a survey there are, I think we shall agree, two outstanding points. In the first place - and the chair­man has already referred to it - there is the accomplishment of the Union of South Africa. The statesmen of the different communities who have become parties to the great and memorable compact are now on their way to this country with Lord Selborne as their pioneer - Lord Selborne, whose invaluable services at every stage of this momentous enterprise I highly appraise, and am glad to have the opportunity of warmly acknowledging. But what is the lesson which we, and we Liberals in particular, have to draw from this great event? What is it that has made union in South Africa possible? Why is it that that which a generation ago seemed to be a generous but impracticable aspiration, that which only five years ago seemed to have been indefinitely postponed, if not irretrievably lost - why is it that it has now passed not only into the domain of the possible but of the real? The answer is a very simple one; it is because we have applied in South Africa that which is the saving and sovereign principle of British rule - the union of freedom with responsibility. We had the same problem, in conditions which were almost equally arduous and difficult, in Canada as we are in the way of solving now in South Africa. That long racial conflict, with its chequered annals of ascendancy and humiliation, within recent days its memories of rival heroism on the stricken field - that controversy has been appeased and, as we hope and believe, put for ever to an end by applying there, as I trust and hope we shall apply everywhere where similar conditions and difficulties arise, the doctrine - it is more than a doctrine, it is a rule of action with us British Liberals - the doctrine that you trust the people to govern themselves according to their own ideas.Imperial DefenceAnother matter of a not purely domestic kind to which I should like to make one moment\u2019s allusion is the forthcoming Conference on Imperial Defence. I am told, gentlemen, that in your interest­ing, stimulating, and thoroughly harmonious proceedings in the course of the last two days you have had a speech from an hon. friend of mine which stirred your emotions, and, I think, appealed to the general assent in favour of disarmament. Yes, there is no body of men in this world who have more reason to desire disarma­ment - a cessation of this miserable, this heartbreaking, competition between the different so-called civilisations of the world - than those who are for the time responsible for the conduct of the Government. But in the meantime we here, whether we look at our extraneous or our domestic Imperial conditions, cannot afford to depart from the command of the sea. In these islands, as time goes on, our waste places have been more and more filled up by an industrial and enterprising population, transformed by a course of events from an almost purely agricultural to a mainly urban and manu­facturing community, dependent therefore every year more and more not only for its material prosperity but for its national life itself upon the free influx of food and of materials from across the seas. But simultaneously we have been extending our borders, building up an Empire which, unlike almost every other Empire recorded in the annals of history, is not confined within the boundaries of its territorial area but is scattered over the length and breadth of the globe. To secure a continuance of such a union naval strength and union is as the essence of life. That security is being exposed now, not necessarily from deliberate hostility, but from the natural development of other nations. This has been the more striking during the course of the last few months; and we have received manifestations from fellow subjects in almost every part of the globe that they are conscious of the common end, and are not only pre­pared but willing and eager to share its difficulties and its burdens. In these circumstances it appeared to his Majesty\u2019s Government that the time was ripe to bring all the great communities that con­stitute our self-governing Empire together to consider their relative responsibility. They have cordially responded to our invitation, and we look forward with hope and with confidence to the result of those common deliberations.The Old Age Pensions Act and the Licensing BillBut now I come a little nearer home and look at our domestic history during the same time. It seems to me again that there are two events which not only strike the imagination but which will be graven indelibly on the pages of history. The first is the passing into law of the Old Age Pensions Act - the most conspicuous land­mark, I do not hesitate to say, on the road of social progress since another Liberal Government forty years ago passed the Education Act of 1870; the second is the history, which has not such a happy termination, of the Licensing Bill. That was a Bill, as you know, which was debated for weeks and for months and passed through the House of Commons with sustained and unexampled majorities. When it reached \u2018another place,\u2019 what was its fate? It was re­jected without even any pretence of consideration of its details, it was rejected in pursuance of a pre-concerted party resolution, it was rejected with every circumstance of contumely and contempt. I will not pause to dwell upon, certainly not to praise, the provisions of the Licensing Bill, which, I may say, was to some extent my own handiwork. But in regard to its rejection I will say that it has made two things - that rejection and the circumstances preceding, following, and attending it have made two things - abundantly plain. The first is that it has ruined the prospects of any really effective temperance reform on anything like a large and comprehen­sive scale during the lifetime of the present Parliament. I will say next the circumstances of that rejection have brought into greater prominence than ever before the fact that our constitutional system is, or at least that it can be made to be, not the embodiment, but the caricature of a representative and responsible Government. And the question of the relations between the two Houses of Parliament must be, for us Liberals at any rate, as I described it at the time, the dominant issue in our programme.An Unusual BudgetBut for the moment our attention is concentrated, and naturally and necessarily concentrated, neither upon the past nor upon the future, but upon the great struggle which is being waged in regard to the Budget. Now I do not quarrel with those who say that this is a very unusual Budget - so unusual that it may possibly require a more than ordinary expenditure of time and consideration before it passes into law. Parenthetically I may say that, so far, it is re­ceiving, and receiving in full measure, very full tribute. The dis­cussion so far as the first clause was concerned in Committee occupied no less than five-and-a-half days before this tyrannical Government, the well-known enemy of free speech, ventured to apply the closure. A more ridiculous contention than that there has been anything like suppression or curtailment of debate with re­gard to the Budget has never been put forward by any sane poli­tician.New Fiscal GroundI said the Budget was unusual; and by that I mean it has two special and exceptional features. The first is in the amount for which it has to make provision, and which everybody agrees to be necessary and which has to be provided somewhere and somehow. Its second exceptional feature is in certain of the applications - I mean what are called the taxes on land, in regard to which I admit, and I not only admit, but I claim, it strikes new fiscal ground. It is not as if the principle upon which these taxes are based is in any sense a novel principle. On the contrary, it has been perfectly familiar to instructed politicians for many years past; it has been discussed and debated and approved by all the greatest economists during the last 50 or 100 years; it has been put, as you all know by this time, in one form or another, into practical operation, not only on the Continent of Europe but in several of our own Colonies. What is new is this - it is the applica­tion of a well-understood and thoroughly-sifted problem, as an instrument of Imperial taxation, to a land system and to economic conditions such as are to be found in this country.What the Land Values Taxes Really AreNow, as I observe that the attacks upon the Budget are mainly, if not exclusively, confined to these taxes, I think you will perhaps bear with me if for a few moments I seek to direct your attention and that of others to what they really mean. In the first place, let me repeat an observation which I made a week ago at the Holborn Restaurant - that these taxes, though popularly and con­veniently described as taxes upon land, are not in the strict sense of the term taxes upon land at all. What are they? A very dis­tinguished economist, a professor of political economy at Cambridge, writing in the Times today, says that the proper description of them would be taxes upon windfalls, and that is really what they are. That is to say, what the State is doing is not putting a tax upon land as such - nothing of the kind. What it is doing is this: it is saying to the landowner, the owners of certain classes or cate­gories of land, \u2018When your land acquires through causes for which you are not responsible, and to which you have not contributed, but which result from the growth of the community and the action of the community - when your land under these conditions, and these conditions only, acquires an increment of value either actually realised or conveniently realisable, the State will step in and exact a toll.\u2019Revenue Small, but ProgressiveThe next observation of a general kind which I should like to make on these taxes is that their primary object is to raise revenue, which ought, I think, to be the primary object of every tax that any Chancellor of the Exchequer proposes for the accept­ance of the House of Commons. From the very nature of the case - as any one will see who has even an elementary acquaintance with the facts - from the very nature of the case the revenue so raised from taxes of this description cannot be very large in the first year, or even in the first few years. Take the taxation upon increment and upon reversions. With those taxes the yield will only be realised when the increment comes to hand or the reversion falls in. But in either case the revenue will be but a small fraction of the fiscal system of the country. It will be progressive in its operations. It was precisely the same with the succession duties proposed by Mr. Gladstone in his great Budget of 1853 with a complexity of machinery and detail to which nothing in this Budget affords any parallel at all - those succession duties, which in course of time, amplified and developed as they were by Sir William Harcourt, now form, not only one of the most productive sources of our Imperial revenue, but, be it observed, an instrument for raising revenue which no Tory Chancellor of the Exchequer has for a moment ventured to tamper with.\u2018Where the Shoe Pinches\u2019 \u2013 ValuationMy third and my last general observation in regard to these taxes is this - that they are taxes none of which can be justly or even practically levied without some preliminary valuation. It is impossible - as my hon. friends will agree with me who sit in the House of Commons - it is impossible to have followed these debates without seeing that this is where the shoe pinches. There has been an astonishing indisposition on the part of many - I am glad to say not of all - of those who profess to speak in the name of the landed interest in this country to have the land valued by some indepen­dent and competent authority. All this random talk that you hear upon the platform or read in the newspapers about their being at the tender mercies of a despotic department - all this random talk betrays to my mind an uneasy consciousness and an uncomfortable apprehension: an uneasy consciousness that this class of land is at the present moment very much under-valued and an uncomfortable apprehension that if it ever comes to be valued for these taxes at its true market value that valuation may possibly be taken advantage of for some other purpose.The Increment TaxNow, I should like to deal a little more closely with these taxes in detail. It is a dull subject, but it is very important. I am sure you will bear with me if I have to descend or ascend to technicalities. I will take first of all the increment tax. As I said a few moments ago, this is a duty imposed not upon land, but upon the added value which accrues to land, not from the efforts of its owner or from those interested, but from social causes. Now, no one, so far as I know, out of a lunatic asylum has ever contended that land in this country steadily and normally increases in value. I have seen the statement attributed to myself. I need hardly say I never made it. What I have said, and what I believe to be perfectly true, though there is an exception here and there, is that there is such an increase in this class of land on which these particular taxes, this increment tax, will fall.Agricultural LandIt is not true, I quite agree, for instance, to make the thing clear, it is not true of agricultural land as a whole; but what do you mean by agricultural land? I mean by agricultural land not land which is locally situated in what is technically called a rural area, but I mean by agricultural land - land which is actually and at the same time properly and economically applied to agricultural purposes. Land of that kind may rise in value from a variety of causes - it may rise in value, for instance, from the enterprise and expenditure of landlord and tenant, either or both. It may rise in value from causes which are common to the agriculture of the country and to a large extent of the world. No rise of that kind falls or was intended to fall within the increment taxation.Land and PopulationLet me contrast the land which lies within the fringe of a growing and naturally created population - I do not care whether it is a rural or an urban area - take land of that kind which in virtue of that population, its expanse, and its growth, even in virtue of the expenditure made for communal purposes for that population, increases in value steadily, regularly, continuously, and acquires a special market price. That is the windfall of the Cambridge pro­fessor; and I ask this question, and I will ask it of any audience of my fellow countrymen, I do not care whether they are Liberals or Conservatives as long as they are fair-minded and just men and women - I ask, \u2018Is it unfair or impolitic that the State should have a share of the increase so produced?\u2019Increment on Other Kinds of PropertyAs I have said before, no answer has ever been given to the question. The only answer which has been made is one which the lawyers call the answer by way of confession and avoidance. It is this - it may be true, it may be right - but, they say, there are other forms of property in which you may discern the same increment due to the same or to similar causes, and you don\u2019t propose to tax them. I have never denied that there may be and there are occasional cases apart from land in which an added value is given to property by social causes, but they are very rare and exceptional, and I believe some of them are taxed already through the income tax or some other tax of our fiscal arrangement. This does not fall in the same category as land, for the reason that land is limited in quantity, and its use in the interests of the community is a matter of vital moment to every man, woman, and child in this country. How can you put into the same category as that the fact that a doctor\u2019s practice may have risen because a colliery village has suddenly grown up in what was previously a rural district, or the fact that a Holbein or Velasquez has risen in market value at Christie\u2019s in consequence of the scarcity of the supply and of the growth of taste? The doctor pays his income tax on the increased sum which he makes out of his new patients, and as to the Holbein and Velasquez we may leave them to themselves. It is a matter of very little moment after all; and anxious as I am myself, as all of us are, to retain them in this country, it is a matter of very little importance whether they belong to this man or that.The Case of Land Altogether ExceptionalBut when you come to land, land on the outskirts of a growing community, land the holding up of which may throttle and cripple the development of its industries, may destroy the health and even the long life of its population, it is mere trifling, unworthy even of an academic dialectician, to speak of land as though in these vital respects it stood upon the same footing as other forms of property; and let me add that it is no answer to say to a dweller on the out­skirts of London, for instance, there is plenty of land in the Hebrides. What London needs and every other community, every growing community, needs, is not to know that somewhere or other on the face of the globe or within the ambit of this United Kingdom there is land available. What they want is land in their own neighbourhood, land upon which they can ex­pand and extend themselves and carry on their industries and their local and their social life. Yes, and for the purpose of this tax, remember, it is the owner of the land, the man who finds himself happily circumstanced in the possession of land where it is wanted and not where it is not wanted, he is the person, we say, who in policy and justice ought to contribute to the State.What the Tax on Undeveloped Land MeansLet me pass now in a few words to the other tax, the tax on undeveloped land. There is much misapprehension on this subject, and as it is some time before we can possibly reach it in Committee upon the Bill, I do not think I shall be wasting a few moments of your time if I endeavour to state clearly and distinctly what this tax really means. This is a tax of a halfpenny in the pound on the capital value of undeveloped land. It applies only to unbuilt-on land which is not being bona fide used for any business, trade, or industry other than agriculture.Agricultural Land and Other ExemptionsLet us see how it affects agricultural land. All land the site value of which does not exceed £50 an acre is exempt, and that will exclude a great part of the agricultural land of this country. And with regard to land, and there is some purely agricultural land the site value of which exceeds £50 - even in regard to that the tax is only to be charged on the amount by which the building value exceeds the agricultural value. Let me further point out to you, because there are perpetual mistakes on these points, that there are exempted altogether from the operation of the tax lands owned by municipalities and other rating authorities; land occupied and used for public or charitable purposes, parks, gardens, or open spaces to which reasonable access is given to the public, when such access contributes, as it almost always does, to the amenity of the locality; land let under an agreement of not less than five years - we are obliged to put in some safeguard - for games or for recreation; private gardens up to an acre (private gardens between one and two acres being allowed one acre duty free); and, lastly, land held on agricultural leases of not more than twenty-one years entered into before the Budget statement. Well, of course, we are open to argument, but have we not there shown a disposition to exclude from the operation of this duty all land in which under present conditions of user it may be said the public has really an interest of its own? If any other such purposes can be suggested, if any reasonable extension of these exemptions consistent with the principle of the tax can be made good, I can assure you the Government and the majority in the House of Commons are perfectly prepared to entertain them. That is the scope of the tax and its general effect.Land that is Being Held UpLet me point out to you that, like the increment duty, with which I have already dealt, it is in its intention, and it will be in its effect, primarily a fiscal instrument - namely, a means of raising revenue for the Exchequer. It merely says - and here again I think we come down to an almost elementary principle of social justice - it merely says that those classes of land shall be taxed now on the basis of real as distinguished from a perfectly fictitious value. Such land is under-rented - that is to say, for a number of reasons, reasons which are satisfactory to the owner, it is bringing a lower yield than it would, if put into the market, bring in and ought to bring in. Take the case of land which can be sold for immediate development, but which is being held up, and legitimately held up, in the hope of getting a higher price in the future. Such land can command a definite economic rent, and is capable of producing an income. That land ought to form part of the taxable income of the country. The landowner does not take the rent, but chooses to forgo it, and the source of revenue is reduced pro tanto, and the national income reduced so much. He does this for his own purpose, and with the hope of future profit, and it is clearly fair and just that the State should apply to him rather than to other taxpayers to make up the deficiency.The Undeveloped Land Duty and the Sale of LandNow it is said that one of the effects of this undeveloped land duty will be to put pressure on landowners to sell their land. Perhaps it will. Is that a calamity to the community? Is that a contingency which we ought to regard with horror and aversion, and against which we ought to take all possible precautions and safeguards? Remember this - we hear a great deal about the with­drawal of capital from this country. It is quite true that capital can be withdrawn from one area to another, and sometimes that transference is beneficial to the other area; but land cannot be removed, and even if this terrible calamity should happen, and there should be a transference of ownership, the land is there, and the community will continue to enjoy it.The Duties Economically Sound and Socially JustThe truth is, and I may sum up what I have been saying as regards the increment tax, and the same thing is true of rever­sions, it only takes part of the windfall, as and when it falls. In regard to the tax on undeveloped land, it only taxes a man on an income which he might enjoy, but chooses for the time being, for purposes of his own, to forgo. I maintain that taxation which seeks these ends by these means is taxation which is not only sound in economic principle, but which conforms to the eternal and immutable principles of social justice. I am afraid I have dealt at great length with these technical matters, but I have tried to present clearly what is the scope and purpose of this new form of taxation.What is the Alternative?Now let me, before I come to a close, ask once more the question with which I mean to conclude every speech I make upon this sub­ject until I get a satisfactory answer to it. The question is: You have got to provide this money; the purposes for which it is to be provided are purposes of importance and urgency, and the necessity of which no party in the State disputes - how otherwise are you going to provide it? I put that question a week ago in the Holborn Restaurant, after a very menacing demonstration on the previous day, when the bankers of the City of London met; I put that ques­tion to the Free Traders among the protesters, and particularly Lord Avebury, an eminent man, who has rendered great service to the cause of Free Trade.Lord Avebury\u2019s Alternative BudgetWhat is Lord Avebury\u2019s reply? He has produced, perhaps, the most marvellous exercise in fiscal arithmetic which has yet entered into the mind or wit of man, either to talk about, or to put upon paper. He squared Mr. Lloyd George\u2019s Budget for him, leaving out the land taxes and other objectionable schemes - what he con­sidered to be Socialism - by a simple process of attributing to this year\u2019s income the yield from the income tax and indirect taxes which cannot possibly be received until the year after. Thus, when the matter comes to be examined you will find there is no escape from the conclusion that under Lord Avebury\u2019s Free Trade alternative Budget we should be landed on March 31st next year with a deficit of no less than three million sterling. That is not a very hopeful alternative.Lord Cromer\u2019s Alternative BudgetThen there is Lord Cromer, another very eminent man and also a strong Free Trader whose service to that cause is well known. What has Lord Cromer to say? Lord Cromer says he would get out of the difficulty first of all by re-imposing what I believe to be the most objectionable tax we have had in this country for many years - the sugar duty, which I reduced last year because it presses so heavily, not only upon the food of the people, but upon the raw material of some of our industries. He would re-impose that most objectionable tax, and the balance for naval expenditure he would meet by a most improvident addition to the National Debt. I am afraid that we must admit that our Free Trade friends have broken down in their attempts to provide an alternative Budget.What Has Become of Tariff Reform?And what of the other? What has become of Tariff Reform? I scarcely ever hear it mentioned. Only a few months ago those gentlemen were so vocal upon all the platforms of the country, but now their tongues are tied in what looks like a concerted unanimity of silence. The truth is they don\u2019t wish, at this moment it would not be convenient, that the country should realise what is the choice that actually lies before it.The Choice a Very Simple OneThe choice is a very simple one - here you have, in addition to taxes to which I have referred to, the indirect taxation of spirits and tobacco, the income taxes, the death duties, and the tax for the first time imposed upon that great monopoly, the tax on liquor licences. You have, in addition to those, the additional tax on land, the equity, fairness, and justice of which I have, I hope, demonstrated tonight. We know we are directly within the limits of Free Trade, we are imposing no additional burdens on the neces­saries of life. What is the choice the other way? They are very quiet about it, but we know what it is. It means the introduction under the guise of Colonial preference of a tariff upon foreign goods. It means the introduction of taxes upon the simplest necessaries of life, upon your bread and your butter and your cheese, and the ordinary commodities which enter into the everyday consumption of the working classes of this country, and thus an enhancement of price to be cast upon the shoulders of those who are least able to bear the burden. That is the alternative which really lies before the electors of the country.Why the Budget should be SupportedAnd I ask you and my fellow countrymen who are Liberals to support this Budget both for what it does and what it does not do, both for the taxes which it imposes and for the tariff which it avoids. I say to them, support it because for the first time it is making some of the richest monopolists in this country contribute their fair share to the common weal; support it because it calls upon all classes, rich and poor alike, to join in making provision for our national necessities; I say support it, last and most of all, because it opens the gate and paves the road to social reform.

aVLadies and Gentlemen, - It is a great pleasure and privilege to me to find myself at such a moment face to face with so large and representative a gathering not only of the Liberals of Hull and the East Riding, but of the delegates from the National Liberal Federation who throughout the length and breadth of England and Wales are the staff officers of the Liberal army. For some months you have been condemned, for what I believe to be good reasons, to enforced inaction, but the time for truce and parleying is over. Within three days Parliament will be dissolved, and by the end of next week you will find yourselves in one of the most momentous political struggles in the annals of British history. I rejoice to know from the reports that reach me from all quarters that whatever may be the case elsewhere, our party is in good heart. There is no division of aim, there is no competition between sections, there is no rivalry of persons. There is everywhere unity, discipline, loyalty, and faith.A Tory FictionWe are told that this Dissolution is the wanton and unscrupulous manoeuvre of a desperate and discredited Government, that we are springing it upon the country in order that we may extort, without adequate discussion, from a dazed and bewildered electorate a pre­cipitate assent to a revolutionary scheme for setting up Single-Chamber government. That is a fiction which is widely current and seems to have played a conspicuous part in the recent debate in the House of Lords. Let us just for a moment or two see how the matter really stands, and how far we can be justly charged with rushing a Dissolution upon an unprepared and uninformed nation.The Issue at last General ElectionIt is barely a year ago since the last Parliament was dissolved. What was the cause of the Dissolution? The rejection, for the first time in our history, of the Budget by the House of Lords, and I speak within the recollection of all of you when I say that, not indeed the sole issue, but the main and dominating issue at that election was upon these two points - first, Shall the veto of the Lords in regard to finance be altogether put an end to; and, next, Shall the veto of the Lords in regard to our legislation be limited and cut down? That was the issue which was debated upon a thousand platforms throughout the length and breadth or the United Kingdom for more than six weeks.The Result of last General ElectionWhat was the result? You had a House of Commons returned to Westminster in which there was a majority against the continuance of the Veto of the Lords of something like 120. And if you look to Great Britain alone a majority against the continuance of the Veto of over 60. We are told that we are trying, by means of Irish votes, to thrust our policy down the reluctant throats of the British electorate, and I see the Tories have now got a new motto or war-cry from Mr. Balfour, \u2018Great Britain shall manage the affairs of Great Britain.\u2019 I have always thought, being a better Unionist than many who call themselves by that title, that the Budget was not an affair that concerned Great Britain alone. I have always thought that the Constitution was not an affair that concerned Great Britain alone, and that we are living now in a United Kingdom. But if we are to look to Great Britain alone, the result of the last election was that by an emphatic and decisive majority of over 60 the electorate of Great Britain declared itself in favour of the Budget and against the Veto of the House of Lords.Why the Tories had no Alternative PolicyBut we are told there was then no alternative policy before the country. Whose fault was that? It was hardly our business to produce an alternative policy, and the reason why there was no alternative policy was this, that at the time the discovery had not been made by our Tory friends that the House of Lords, as it exists, is a decayed and crumbling structure which has got to be rebuilt from its very basement to its roof. No, that was the heyday of those peers, who went by the name - poor innocent men - of the Backwoodsmen, who must now in their remote retreats be rubbing incredulous eyes when they read every morning of what is going on at Westminster. I must not be tempted into unbecoming flippancy. I have been rebuked, urbi et orbi, by no less a personage than the Archbishop of Canterbury, because I ventured, by the citation of an almost classical passage from one of the most classical of English works, Boswell\u2019s Life of Johnson, to import levity into the discussion of so sacred a theme as the House of Lords. Indeed my case is even worse. I have got into trouble with both the Archbishops. The one complains of my pleasantries and the other of my metaphors, so I am going to be careful and try to mend my ways, but at the same time, respectfully observing that it is not I and my friends, but Lord Rosebery and his associates, who, within the last fortnight, have pronounced sentence of death upon the House of Lords, and are now casting about to see if they can find somebody who can take up the succession. But a year ago, ignorant of what was in store for them, the rank and file of the House of Lords, who, after all, constitute a very large numerical majority in the body, were, with the benediction of their leaders, going about from platform to platform trumpeting its virtues and relying, above all, upon its last and supreme achievement - the salvation of the country from the iniquities of a Socialistic Budget.Misrepresentation of the Government\u2019s PolicyThere was no alternative policy then. But let me follow the matter out through its later stages. The new House of Commons met, and there has been so much misunderstanding and so much misrepresenta­tion of the declared policy of the Government that I will venture to read to you what I said within a week or ten days after the meeting of the House of Commons on February 28 last. This is what I then said. I said on behalf of the Government in the new Parliament: \u2018If the House should assent to our Veto proposals, a Bill to give effect to them will, without delay, be introduced. The Bill will give effect to the operative part of the Resolutions, but\u2019 - and observe these words - \u2018but without waiting for the Bill to pass through all its stages in this House we have come to the conclusion that, in order to avoid waste of time and labour and to bring the main issue to trial and con­clusion at the earliest possible moment, the resolutions so assented to by this House shall be submitted to the House of Lords.\u2019 We refused, we deliberately refused, and I think we rightly refused, to go on with an operation which used to be known by the name of ploughing the sands to pass a Bill through all its stages in the House of Commons - First Reading, Second Reading, Committee Stage, and Third Reading - involving an infinite waste of time and labour when, during the whole process, perfectly aware that at the moment it reached another place it would be ignominiously repelled and rejected.The Conference and AfterThose resolutions received the assent of the House of Commons after an exhaustive discussion on April 14 last, and in due course of time and but for unforeseen events they would, with as little delay as possible, have been submitted to the House of Lords. There intervened that most lamentable event, the death of our beloved Monarch. It was followed, as was natural, by something in the nature of a political truce and by an experiment which was new in our political history but which, I think, though it has for the moment failed, was well worth trying. We sought to discover by Conference between representative leaders of both great parties in the State if it were possible to find some common basis of agreement for settlement by consent. Those efforts having failed, I would like to know who would suggest that we might have done or ought to have done other than that we are doing. Ought we to have prorogued Parliament? Ought we to have reintroduced in another Session our Resolutions and our Bill? Ought we to have wasted another twelve months of the time of the country over a futile and impossible enterprise? Why, we should have lost, and deservedly lost, the confidence of our friends and the respect of the country.\u2018Dissolution was necessary\u2019Dissolution was necessary, and I cite and commend to the attention of the Tory platform orators, the Tory writers in the Press - I commend words their own leader used in the House of Commons in the hearing of many of us only a week ago when he said in reply to me - I quote his exact words - \u2018I agree it is almost certain that a General Election could not be deferred for more than a relatively small number of weeks or months. That I grant.\u2019 Well, if Mr. Balfour thinks so, if he agrees with us that a situation had been arrived at from which the only outlet was to be found in an immediate, or at any rate a near, General Election, what becomes of all this hollow cry against the Government for having rushed upon the country wantonly and unscrupulously an election which it did not require?Another Tory FictionThen there comes the other fiction - namely, that we are rushing a Dissolution in order that the Lords might have no opportunity of pre­senting their case and that, at the same time, we might avoid submitting our Budget to the House of Commons. And this nefarious stratagem is supposed to have been defeated by Lord Lansdowne\u2019s masterly and patriotic counter-stroke of asking that the Parliament Bill should be introduced into the House of Lords. There is no word of truth in the story. The Government never had any such intention. They had made up their minds before Parliament reassembled that they would present their Budget in all its essential features for the assent of the House of Commons and that the House of Lords should have any opportunity they desired, either of criticising our Veto proposals or of putting forward proposals of their own. That intention never varied for a moment, and it was literally carried into effect. I do not think anybody will dispute that the case for the House of Lords, such as it is, has been presented in the course of the last ten days with adequate fullness of exposition and argument to the country.\u2018Afraid of the People\u2019 Yet DissolvingThey are always telling us we are afraid of the people. The motive of our scheme is supposed to be to enable the House of Commons to steal a march on its constituents and to carry out revolutionary measures in the teeth of those who elected them. Well, it is curious if that is so we should be dissolving now. We have got an ample majority in the present House of Commons for all the ordinary purposes of government and legislation, and yet we, who were supposed to be so afraid of the people, supposed to cling to office by any desperate device that imagination can conceive, I say, we who were supposed to be so afraid of the people, are dissolving - and why? Because we are pledged to get this question out of the way before we proceed with Liberal legislation, which, under existing conditions, is a perfectly hopeless task. The only and, at the same time, the effectual method of getting it out of the way is to ask and to obtain the judgment of the country.The Question for the ElectorsSo much for that; but what is the question which the electors have to put to themselves and to answer in the course of the next fortnight or three weeks? They have to determine whether we are to continue to carry on the King\u2019s Government, or to hand over the duty to our opponents. It is hardly necessary to say that the electors, at any rate, are free agents; they are not under the domination of Mr. John Redmond. They are not compelled to toe any particular line. There is another thing to be observed about the electors - they know precisely what the consequences of giving us a majority will be. There is our plan in black and white, and everyone can understand it. The question for them simply is, Do they, or do they not, authorise us to carry it into law? I believe they will.If the Tories WonBut, as it is above all things desirable that they should come to their decision, whatever it is, with their eyes open, let me try for a few moments, if you will bear with me, to trace the consequences of a vote adverse to the present Government and putting the Tory Party into power. In imagination, at any rate, we can try and trace it out. I say nothing tonight, or nothing in detail, though I shall in course of the election, of the effect of such a change on the general policy of the country, on its administration, on its finance. I say nothing, or I only mention it in passing, of the certainty that such a change would bring sooner or later in its train under the guise of Tariff Reform a return to that system of Protection which less than a year ago was emphatically and decisively repudiated by all our great industrial districts. But the sole point to which I want to direct your attention is the effect that such a change would have on the settlement of the Constitutional question; and this brings me to examine - it is time that it should be done - examine at rather close quarters what we now know to be the alternative policy. It is well worthy of examination.What about the Backwoodsmen?Let me first point out without any imputation upon anybody\u2019s good faith that it is at least doubtful how much of the crude and complex scheme - for it is both crude and complex - which has been so pre­cipitately put together during the last week will ever travel even within measurable distance towards the Statute Book. The House of Lords, I know, has carried all these proposals without a division in hot haste, and on the eve of a Dissolution, but if and when it should come to real business, I am not sure that those backwoodsmen, of whom I spoke a moment ago and who, I have said, are a majority of the House of Lords, will be found to be such a negligible and moribund factor as they have been made to appear during all the discussions of the last week.     The Country would be Worse Off under the Lords\u2019 SchemeNor is it easy to believe that a House of Commons with a real Tory majority, if you can conceive such a thing, would let this scheme through without large and even vital modifications. Indeed, Lord Rosebery has already, I see, last night put in a caveat that they must only be taken to have associated themselves with the general spirit and trend of the vote. There is much virtue in the word \u2018trend,\u2019 but let us take the scheme as now presented to the country as illustrative of their policy and assume that it is going to be carried into law. The proposition which I lay before you and which I lay tonight before my fellow countrymen is this - that the country would be no better off, that in some respects it would be materially worse off, than under the existing system, which every one now admits to be utterly intolerable. The New Second Chamber   What is this plan or scheme which is now presented to the country as the solution of the Constitutional problem? In the first place, what is the new Second Chamber which is to be substituted for our ancient, venerable, and historic House of Lords? In the Second Chamber of the future there are to be three classes of peers, hereditary peers, official or qualified peers, and peers who are chosen - nobody knows by whom, nobody knows from whom, but peers who are chosen. What is to be the size? What is to be the proportion between these different elements, or factors, which make it up? How and by whom and by what process are the chosen ones to be admitted? All these so-called details are left open for future manipulation. But I think we can easily foresee the general result if the process of adjustment is to be in the hands - as, upon the assumption I am now making, it would be - of a Tory House of Commons, with the supervising counsel and judgment of a Tory House of Lords. In the present House of Lords the proportion of Tory to Liberal is something like twelve to one. For effective voting purposes it is about five or six to one. The party predominance in the new Second Chamber may be less odiously and offensively marked, but with such an absurdly wide margin of superiority you can afford to be generous and to give away a good deal - but does any rational man doubt that, on the basis of this scheme of Lord Rosebery\u2019s, according to the views of a Tory House of Commons and House of Lords, you will have a Second Chamber which will be overwhelmingly and permanently Conservative? And, in the meantime - for this is the very essence of the scheme - you will have sacrificed the Royal prerogative of the creation of peers. In a word, you will be confronted once more with the old problem, the problem of chronic or recurring deadlocks between the two Chambers, the one Chamber responsible to the people and the other Chamber composed of - Heaven knows what elements - and the knowledge that a possible outlet for such deadlocks will be permanently blocked.The Proposed Joint SessionLet us come to another point. Let us examine this alternative proposal in all its aspects. These deadlocks, we are told, between the reconstituted House of Lords and the representative House of Commons, are to be solved by a Joint Session. Speaking for myself, I have always thought, and have more than once said, that, given a Second Chamber moderate in size and constituted on popular lines - that is a very important qualification - I would not exclude, certainly would not brush aside, procedure by conference and Joint Session as a possible and even hopeful expedient for the avoidance of deadlocks. But the crucial question here is left entirely and purposely untouched in Lord Lansdowne\u2019s proposals. Under what conditions is this Joint Session going to take place? In what relative proportions are the two Houses going to sit in it? - and remember the whole thing only comes into operation when you have a Liberal majority in the House of Commons. When a Tory majority is there the whole machinery falls into abeyance. The question is this, it goes to the very root foundation of the whole scheme - the question I ask is, What kind and what size of Liberal majority in your scheme is to have an effective voice in legislation? Is it to be 50? or must it be 100? or must it be so? Until this is settled the proposal for a Joint Session from our point of view is wholly meaningless and nugatory. It is, in effect, nothing more than an invitation to substitute one set of shackles for another, when the nation has deliberately decided at the polls to entrust its fortunes and the shaping of its legislation to the party of progress.What are Measures of \u2018Great Gravity\u2019?But one step forward still. There comes in here a doubt - it is more than a doubt - what is meant by the exception from the operation of Joint Sessions of questions of \u2018great gravity\u2019? They are not to be decided by a Joint Session, but they are to be submitted by Referen­dum to the people. What are questions of great gravity? Who is going to decide? Obviously neither one House nor the other. What may seem to be grave to the House of Commons may seem to be trivial to the House of Lords, and vice versa. Are you going to call in a judicial tribunal? Are you going to bring in the Courts of Law? I earnestly trust no one will suggest that. And, if not, you must condescend to particulars and you must tell us what is the criterion and what are the categories of questions of great gravity. I presume Home Rule is a question of great gravity. Is Disestablishment? Well, I do not know - I mean in the opinion of Lord Lansdowne and his friends. Is the abolition of plural voting? Above all and most important of all is the question of a Tariff?The Tories and the ReferendumWhat are the subjects - surely we are entitled to ask - in regard to which Parliament is to be deprived of its omnipotence and compelled to resort to a plebiscite? Since when and why have the Tories become converts to the principle of a Referendum? It is one of the most remarkable and one of the most rapid instances of conversion in the whole of political history. I have never denied that there were rare but quite conceivable cases in which some such proceeding must be resorted to. Here we have the Conservative, the Unionist, the Constitutional Party advocating that a device that has been adopted with disappointing results in some of the modern States of the world shall become an integral part of the British Constitution.The Referendum and DissolutionAs such I protest against it, and I hope you will resist it, and I will tell you briefly the grounds. There are three on which I base my protest. In the first place, in effect it would, as regards all important legislation - these questions of \u2018great gravity\u2019 - by statute give to the House of Lords the power, which it already claims, and which we strenuously deny to it, to compel, when it differs from the popular House, what would be to all intents and purposes a Dissolution and a General Election. Of course, on trivial matters, if you had a Referen­dum, as has been found in America, in Canada, and in Australia, people would not take the trouble to vote, and the result of such an appeal would be no index to the true state of popular opinion. If you come to really great questions, questions like Home Rule or the Tariff, does anyone suppose that such an appeal would not be attended by all the tumult of a General Election? The Parliamentary machine would be set at work, members and intending candidates would come down to their constituencies to address meetings, canvassing, placarding, the circulation of literature, all the operations of an electoral campaign such as we are contemplating, some of us with mixed feelings, would be in full swing, and the country would be to all intents and purposes involved in all the expense and turmoil of a General Election. And then suppose on a vital question like that the decision went against the Government of the day. Could the Government continue in office? Clearly not. They must either resign or dissolve. If they resigned and their opponents came into power they would have to dissolve, and you would have two Dissolutions, two General Elections, two appeals to the electorate in regard to every vital question of national policy and legislation.The Referendum and Parliamentary ResponsibilityBut I have an even stronger objection to the use of the Referendum as a part of the Constitution - that it would impair, if it would not entirely destroy, the sense of Parliamentary responsibility. You send your Members to the House of Commons to give there the best of their judgment and the best of their ability to the transaction of the affairs of the nation on the lines and within the limits of the princi­ples and pledges which they have professed to you, and on which they sought your confidence. You do not want a Member of Parlia­ment to go there an irresponsible item, to say, \u2018I will vote against this or for that, because my vote does not matter, because the thing has got to go back to the electorate, and I am here as an irresponsible delegate and not here to represent, to the best what I believe to be, the con­sidered judgment of the nation.\u2019 You are sterilising the sense of responsibility, which is the very soul of Parliamentary Government.The Referendum and Representative GovernmentAt the same time - and this is the third point - you are really destroying the principle of government by representation, which is the great invention of the modern world. Democracy without represen­tation very soon degenerates into anarchy or Caesarism - one or the other. The only machinery which the genius of man has yet discovered which will enable democratic government to be made into a working concern is the adoption, the amplification, the development of that principle of representation. I speak not as a party man for a moment, but as a convinced democrat and one who wishes to see democratic government made increasingly efficient and capable. When the Tory Party are tumbling over one another helter-skelter, pell-mell, in their zeal and affection for this new-fangled discovery of the Referendum, I ask my fellow countrymen, in the interests not of one party or another, but in the interests of those larger and more permanent concerns which are the common property of us all, to hesitate before, in order to find a plausible way to escape from difficulties which can be otherwise solved, they strike a deadly blow at the very foundation of representative government in this country.The Two Alternative PoliciesI am sorry to have kept you so long with these, though they are not minor points, but I want at the outset of the coming struggle the country to realise clearly what are the two alternative policies placed before them. I can sum them up in a couple of sentences. How shall we stand if this alternative policy now put forward by the House of Lords is approved by the country and its legislative definition and embodiment entrusted to the Tory majority in the new House of Commons? In the first place, you will have a Second Chamber which, from its composition and character, gives us at any rate no greater security against a deadlock than we already possess. In the second place, when deadlocks occur, you will have no greater security than now that the will of the popular Chamber will be predominant, or that its will may not be over and over again, frustrated and delayed by the Second and nominally subordinate Chamber, compelling the country to pronounce a second verdict in addition to the first. That is all they have to offer on the other side, and I venture to say our plan holds the field. Ours is not a plan for Single-Chamber Government. It is not put forward, as is sometimes represented, as though verbally inspired. It is not presented - as I said myself in the House of Commons in moving the Veto Resolutions - as a final solution of all our Constitutional problems. But it is submitted to the country as what is necessary, as the least that is necessary here and now, if we are to make real progress with any of the great enterprises, whether of social or political change, to which the Liberal Party stands committed.\u2018American Dollars\u2019 and Home RuleIn a speech I made at the Albert Hall nearly a year ago I dwelt on some of the causes that we believe are in our keeping. I adhere to everything which I said then. I spoke of Welsh disestablishment, the abolition of plural voting, of a better licensing system, of a truly national education. I spoke, and - in view of the shameful things which are being said, I feel bound to emphasise that point - I spoke of our views of the proper solution of the problem of Irish self-government. What I then said I repeat; to it I adhere, and I believe the Liberal Party adheres. I do not in the least grudge the Tory Party any electioneering capital that they can extract from Mr. Redmond\u2019s American dollars. The American dollars would seem to be, in a substantial pro­portion at any rate, contributed by our Canadian fellow subjects. But whether they are subscribed by that great Imperial statesman, Sir Wilfrid Laurier, or by the poorest Irish exile in Chicago or Milwaukee, I see no cause for shame either in those who give or those who take. There is, indeed, a great deal of significance in it. In our efforts to secure self-government for Ireland in the future - efforts which I hope will be followed by further efforts to set free the Imperial Parliament from much of the local work which congests its machinery and which of necessity it does so ill - we shall have with us I believe the sympathy of the overwhelming majority of the great Dominions overseas, who have learned how easy it is to combine local autonomy with Imperial loyalty. But for the moment, and this shall be the last thing I say to you, let us concentrate on the first and the greatest task, the task that lies right to our hands, the task that we are pledged to perform, the task of winning fair play for Liberal legislation and of securing for our people through their own chosen representatives the power of making and of moulding the laws under which they live.

aVMr. Chairman, my Lords, Ladies, and Gentlemen, I thank you from my heart for the warmth of this reception, but if I am to proceed I shall not speak of it; I shall try not to think of it. I have in my time made many political speeches, but never have I felt so much need of the indulgence of my audience, and never have I been so certain that I should receive it. (Hear, hear and cheers.) My first duty is to express on my own behalf - after the resolution which has been read it is unnecessary to express it on yours - my deep regret at the retirement of the chief who has led us so long. I have always felt, and I feel now, an admiration, not only for the towering intellect - the adjective is none too strong - but for the character of Mr. Balfour which it is impossible for me to exaggerate. (Hear, hear.) No truer words were ever said of any man than the words used the other day by Sir Oliver Lodge about him. I shall read the exact words:Other men, he said could lead a party, but not every one could take the wide survey of human know­ledge, or bring to profound questions the trained intelligence, the critical acumen, and the comprehensive grasp of Mr. Balfour.I see it has been suggested in the Radical Press that the message sent to Mr. Balfour by the Unionist members, though suffi­ciently cordial, contained no invitation to return. Let there be no misunderstanding, ladies and gentlemen. The leaders of the party knew with absolute certainty that he could not reconsider his decision, and that was the reason, and the sole reason, why we did not urge our old leader to return to his old position. (Cheers.) I see also that the kindly suggestion has been made that when Mr. Balfour returns to the House of Com­mons, and asserts again, as he will assert, his old supremacy over the Assembly which he has dominated so long, it will be awkward for me. (Laughter and cheers.) Don\u2019t imagine that such a thought ever enters my mind. (Hear, hear.) Whatever my weaknesses, jealousy is not one of them. (Cheers.) And jealousy on my part towards Mr. Balfour would be ridiculous.There is no one who rejoices more than I in the thought that in the coming struggle for the unity of our country we shall have at our side the man who last led us to victory in the same fight, and who will, I believe, play no small part in securing the victory which will again be ours. (Cheers.) Next to Mr. Balfour, I should like to say that I have seen Lord Lansdowne, the leader of our party in the House of Lords, and I can assure you that no one will work with him more heartily or more willingly for the success of the cause for which we are responsible than I shall do in the future. (Cheers.) Now, ladies and gentlemen, I am sure your attention has been called to it before, and I feel bound to call your attention to it again.Self-Sacrificing ColleaguesIn the whole personal history of the Conservative Party, or indeed in any party, there is nothing of which we have more reason to feel proud than the spirit of self-sacrifice - (hear, hear) - which was shown by Mr. Austen Chamberlain­ (cheers) - who, as you know from the letter which you have just heard read, would have been with us tonight had he not been fighting our battle elsewhere, and by Mr. Walter Long - (cheers) - who is beside me now. As soon as the proposed solution of the leadership was mentioned to me, I at once saw both of those gentle­men. They received me with a generosity which I shall never forget. I should never have undertaken the duties of my new position if I had not known, as I do know, that they had made the proposal not only in the interests of the party, but with a feeling of goodwill and of personal friendship towards myself­ - (cheers) - personal friendship which I am sure will last as long as we live. (Hear, hear.) Now, ladies and gentlemen, I have been received in the same way by all my colleagues on the Front Bench. I cannot mention them all. But I should like to say that from no one have I received a more whole-hearted promise of support than from Sir Edward Carson - (cheers) - and from no one do I value it more. (Hear, hear.)Now, ladies and gentlemen, one word more only on this personal aspect. When I returned to the House of Commons in my new position I received a welcome from our old friends which, when in time difficulties arise, as they will arise, will always be in my mind to call to my recollection how sincere their welcome was towards me. I received also a welcome from my political opponents which touched me. (Hear, hear.) It is not to their interests that our leadership should be effective, and to any one who does not know the House of Commons their welcome might not have seemed a good omen for my success. (Laughter.)I have been long enough a member to know how generous are the instincts of the House of Commons - (hear, hear) - and I was not discouraged. The Radical Press, too, has treated me on the whole not ungenerously. But I have had my attention called to some passages not entirely friendly, and I read them with pleasure. (Laughter.) They have also given me some advice. I am, I think, by nature tolerant of differences of opinion, and I have always believed, and believe now, that it is possible to dislike, even to detest, opinions, whilst still respecting the man who honestly holds those opinions.It is with reference to that subject that the advice was given. It was that in the House of Commons in the future I should not be so rude - (laughter) - as I have been in the past. It is possibly good advice, and I shall at least remember it. (Laughter.) But in the severe, and, I am afraid, bitter fight which lies before us - a fight for everything which we hold dear - (cheers) - I have really no hope of acting in such a way as to satisfy the giver of that advice.First Duty of the PartyI said at the outset that I needed your indulgence. In any case under the circumstances in which we are met here tonight I could not expect to cover the whole field of current political controversy, but I have more than that to say. If anyone supposes that because there has been a change in the leader in the House of Commons there is going to be a new programme he will be disappointed. I do not believe in elaborate, still less in varying programmes. Our opponents tried it. During their period of opposition they had a new programme for every new year. (Laughter.) It was not very successful. Do not let us imitate them.If I can be of any service to the party it will be simply by urging that party to move straightforward without haste, but without rest, to the goal which lies before it. (Loud cheers.) The goal is in the first place to get rid of the present Government - (hear, hear, and laughter) - which from the beginning has been a danger to our country - (hear, hear) - and which now is tearing down the destructive path with ever-increas­ing rapidity.When that is accomplished it will be our duty to face the new problems which new conditions and a new age have brought by new, but by Conservative methods. (Hear, hear.) No Government of which I or my colleagues on this platform are members would ever be a Government purely of reaction. It is quite possible, and I think it probable, that without regard to our merits or demerits if we give the Government a little more rope we may step into their place. (Laughter and cheers.)Under such circumstances there would be a temptation to form a Government simply of resistance, but what would be the result? It would be like building a dam against which the waters would pile themselves in ever-increasing volume. Sooner or later that dam would burst, and the floods would flow with irresistible force, carrying ruin and devastation throughout the land. That is not what we propose. It was once said by Burke, \u2018The desire to preserve and the ability to improve, taken together, would be my standard of a statesman.\u2019 (Hear, hear.) If ever our countrymen entrust us with power it is in the spirit of those words that we shall undertake that trust. (Cheers.)Welsh DisestablishmentNow, ladies and gentlemen, the first of the destruc­tive proposals of the Government to which I shall refer is their determination to destroy the Church of England in Wales. (Hear, hear.) That proposal we shall resist to the utmost of our power. (Cheers.) It is a proposal which has, in my judgment, nothing to justify it - (hear, hear) - which has nothing even to ex­plain it, except prejudice and bigotry. (Cheers.) We have had in Scotland an experience of what disendow­ment means, which, while familiar to me, is probably new to you.There was a Church there called the Free Church of Scotland, which was founded in support of the principle of the State establishment of religion. A few years ago that Church joined with a voluntary Church in Scotland. After the union the courts of law decided that the resources belonged to the small minority which still adhered to the old principle. And what happened? It was felt by every one that if that decision held, a great institution which was doing a great work in Scotland would be crippled.And the British Government, and a Conservative Government - I am proud to have been a member of it - a Conservative Government actually passed through an Act to return to the majority the share of the funds which had legally been taken from it. Now, there is an analogy. Parliament in that case intervened to prevent the weakening of a great Church by depriving it of its resources; Parliament is asked now to intervene for the very reverse purpose - to de­prive a great Church of the resources of which it stands in absolute need. (Cheers.)Ladies and gentlemen, in an age of materialism, and, as I believe, in an age of growing materialism, when any of my friends, for instance, who live in Lon­don, or any of you who visit London, if you choose to go to Hyde Park, will find many orators - always with good voices - (laughter) - advocating many causes, but you will find always that the advocate who has the largest audience is he who proclaims that there is no God. In such an age I cannot understand how any Christian, to whatever denomination he belongs - how any man can desire to weaken, if not destroy, a Church - (hear, hear) - which has undoubtedly been doing a great work, and doing it with ever-increasing efficiency - a work not only in the interests of Christianity, but in the interests of humanity. (Cheers.)A Move in the Home Rule GameThe next subject to which I shall turn is the question of Home Rule, with which is connected a constitu­tional question; for, so far as the present Government have dealt with the Constitutional question, they have dealt with it simply as a move in the Home Rule game. (Hear, hear.) The keynote of the policy of the present Government, since the January election a year ago, has been not merely that they are dependent upon, but that they are absolutely dominated by a small faction in the House of Commons, and a faction which, small as it is, is far larger than it ought to be in comparison. (Cheers.)It is due to that domination that now - at this hour, probably - the Insurance Bill, which affects the vital interests of almost every man, woman, and child in this country, is passing mechanically through the House of Commons without discussion, without the possibility of those whose interests are affected having the opportunity of having their objections, even con­sidered. (Hear, hear.)The vital interests, the most direct and personal in­terests of the whole population of these islands, are being sacrificed today. Why? In order to clear the line for the Home Rule express. (Hear, hear and \u2018Shame.\u2019) It is also due, I believe, to the necessity under which the Government felt of retaining the Irish vote at all costs. It is due to that, and, in my belief, to that alone, that the Conference last year was not carried to a successful issue. (Hear, hear.) Now, ladies and gentlemen, it may be said - it has been said to me in the House of Commons \u2013 \u2018You are pretty Unionists to discriminate between members of the House because they come from different parts of the United Kingdom.\u2019That sounds plausible, but its plausibility disappears the moment you examine it. If Irish members judged British questions and voted on British questions on their merits they would have as much right as anyone else to let their in­fluence be felt on British questions. They do nothing of the kind. (Hear, hear.) They do not pretend to do anything of the kind. (Hear, hear.) I myself heard the leader of the Nationalist party in the House of Commons say practically this - I have his exact words in my pocket if anybody wants to hear them­ - (laughter) - that neither he nor his friends knew anything or cared anything about British political ques­tions.Mr. Asquith in Other DaysWell, ladies and gentlemen, that is all very well for them, but what about us? If they know nothing and care nothing about British politics then it is utterly in­tolerable that they should dominate British politics (Loud cheers.) The views which I have just expressed were once held by the Prime Minister - (laughter) - not many years ago when he was in opposition, when his mind was less biased, when he was free to consider it on its merits. (Laughter and cheers.) He said the Liberal party ought never to assume the respon­sibility of office except with an independent majority. He does not say that now. (Laughter.) Why? Because he has yielded to the temptation which Mr. Gladstone foresaw - (hear, hear.) - the most insidious temptation which can come in the way (under our political system) to any statesman - the temptation of sacrificing his own judgment, and, unconsciously, I am sure, but not less really, sacrificing not only his own judgment but sacrificing the interest of his country - (hear, hear) - not for his own sake - Mr. Asquith would not do that - but for the sake of the interests of the party of which he is a member. (Cheers.)Well, ladies and gentlemen, we are living today under a provisional Constitution. That is admitted. The Prime Minister said a week or two ago that in due course - whatever that may mean - (laughter) - they will establish a proper Second Chamber. Well, they tell us that at the last election they received a mandate for the Parliament Bill. But the Parliament Bill had two proposals, one to adjust the relations be­tween the two houses, the other to reform the Second Chamber. If they had a mandate for the one they had equally a mandate for the other. (Hear, hear.) They have done the one \u2013 they have left the other undone.Now, look at this from the plain, common-sense, business standpoint to which our Chairmen has re­ferred. Everyone knows that nothing can be worse for trade and industry than political uncertainty. (Hear, hear.) The Government have these two great changes, two great reforms, as they call them, to make. Surely, common sense should have taught them that they should be made together - that they should at least arrive at a settlement which has some possibility of permanence. No Government, surely - not even the present Government - is so much in love with revolution for its own sake that when they have the choice they deliberately prefer two revolutions rather than one.Why the Constitution was SuspendedWhy have they adopted this course? They have given one explanation; they have all given one explana­tion only. They say - I am sure we in the House of Commons have all heard it a dozen times - there is no use passing a Bill to reform the House of Lords which the House of Lords would have rejected; we must have power of retaliation, negotiating powers - phrases which we have heard before - (laughter) - in order to carry through our reform of the House of Lords. Now examine that explanation. By what means did they carry one half of their proposals through the House of Lords? They carried them by what Mr. Balfour described in words which were not too strong, \u2018a felon stroke\u2019 - (cheers) - by a gross outrage not only on the spirit, but, as I believe, on the letter of our Constitution. (Cheers.)Does anyone doubt that the same means which enabled them to pass half their proposals world not have enabled them to pass the whole of them? Dees anyone doubt that it would not have been less of a constitutional outrage, less of a breach with the past to have reformed than to have destroyed the House of Lords? (Hear, hear.) That is not an explanation, it is an excuse. (Hear, hear.) The explanation is very different, and we all know it. The head of the Government gave them no alternative.Mr. Redmond knows just as well as Mr. Asquith knows that if Home Rule were submitted to the people of this country as a clear issue, the same answer would be returned in the same decisive way in which it has been given twice before. (Cheers.) Mr. Redmond knows also, just as Mr. Asquith knows, that if we had an effective Second Chamber, no matter how it was constituted, however democratic it might be, if there were an effective Chamber of any kind, a great change like this would not be permitted to pass until there was clear proof that the people of this country desired it. (Hear, hear.)That is why our Constitution is suspended. We know now what due course means. Due course may arrive after Home Rule is carried. They may perhaps be quite willing after the steed has fled, carefully to lock the stable door. I am not going tonight into the general argument on the subject of Home Rule. I wish to impress upon you one aspect of that question, and one only, and that is whether it is right to carry a great change like this while our Constitution is in suspense, and while it is at least doubtful whether the majority of the people of this country desire the change. (Hear, hear.)That it is doubtful ought to be conceded, even if we admit for the sake of argument the claim of the Government that they received a mandate for Home Rule at the last election - a claim which I utterly repudiate - (cheers) - even if we admitted it, there would still be doubt. Mr. Gladstone fought the election of 1892 on Home Rule. He told us the Bill of 1886 was dead, but declined to tell us what was going to take its place. He won the election, but his proposals had then to be defined. They were discussed. They were submitted to the country, and in spite of his victory on the words Home Rule, they were defeated by an overwhelming majority. (Cheers.)Can anyone pretend that the same thing might not happen now? Can anyone maintain that on a vital question like this the people of this country have not the right to decide not on frail, but clear and definite proposals? Now, Mr. Chairman, the sole ground, so far as I can under­stand, on which Home Rule is justified is the nationality of Ireland, but people do not become a nation because they happen to live in the same island. If there is one nation in Ireland there are two nations in Ireland - (cheers) - two nations separated from each other far more acutely than either of them is separated from the people of Great Britain. We do not suggest that the minority should dominate the majority.\u2018An Intolerable Curse\u2019No! But we say it is equally unjust that a majority, because it is in Ireland, should dominate a minority because it is also in Ireland. They are both - majority and minority alike - not only inhabitants of Ireland, but citizens of the United Kingdom. (Hear, hear.) And both can rely on obtaining justice in a way in which neither perhaps can rely on receiving it from the other - from the British House of Commons, in which both are represented. (Cheers.) Now, ladies and gentlemen, to one of these sections Home Rule comes perhaps as a boon. To the other it comes not merely as a grievance, but as an intolerable curse. (Hear, hear.)They may be quite wrong. The Nationalists may be the most tolerant people who ever existed in the world - (laughter) - and to judge by Mr. Redmond\u2019s speeches now - he has not always spoken quite in the same way - but to judge by his speeches now, the whole characteristic of himself and of those whom he repre­sents, their one burning ambition is when they are smitten on one cheek to turn the other to the smiter. (Laughter.) That may be their characteristic, but the minority don\u2019t think so. (Laughter and hear, hear.) And what is that minority? It is important from the point of view even of numbers, for it comprises at least a quarter, more than a quarter, of the whole population of Ireland. It is far more important from every other point of view, and its power and its real weight is enormously increased by the way in which that minority is concentrated.Well, these people, not accepting strictly and literally Mr. Redmond\u2019s present declaration, have de­clared that under existing conditions they will not submit to such a government. Their moral force in taking up that attitude is increased to an extent which is simply incalculable by the fact that they will say, and that they will be entitled to say, that this intolerable tyranny, as they regard it, is being forced upon them against the will of the majority of their fellow citizens in the United Kingdom. (Cheers.) Now, I said in one of the debates in the House of Commons, and I venture to repeat it here, that in my belief, the Government, under Irish domination, have not only destroyed our Constitu­tion, but they are putting in danger our whole system of representative government.On what does that representative government rest? It rests on a convention, and nothing more. It rests on the convention that a majority at any given time represents the balance of forces in the country. But majorities are not always stronger than minorities, and that convention can only continue to be respected so long as the majority uses its powers with moderation - (hear, hear) - and with a due regard to the convictions and the strength of those to whom they are opposed. (Hear, hear.) It cannot continue if a majority - and a small majority - tries to ride rough-shod over the minority. (Hear, hear.) If the Government, there­fore, really try to carry out - I think they are beginning to realise its difficulties - if they really try to carry out the programme which they have so light-heartedly sketched, then in my belief - and this will be my last word to you on this subject - in my belief they will strain our Parliamentary institutions to the breaking-point. (Loud cheers.)Social Condition of the PeopleI should like to speak to you now, with your permission - (a Voice: \u2018Go on!\u2019) - on the social condi­tion of the people of this country, with special reference to Tariff Reform. (Loud and prolonged cheers.) Each kind of government has its own kind of dangers. In the old days of despotic rule, one of the greatest enemies of the people was the King\u2019s friend, who played upon the weaknesses of his Sovereign for his own advantage. Under new conditions the same evil appears in a new form. The King\u2019s flatterers have become the flatterers of the mob - (hear, hear) - for under democratic institu­tions in every age and in every country the greatest enemy of the democracy has always been the demagogue. (Cheers.) How easy it is to make eloquent or at least rhetorical speeches based on the glaring anomalies, the glaring contrasts, between the luxuries of the rich and the hardships of the poor. (Hear, hear.) How easy it is, and how successfully it has been done - (laughter) - to represent the political conflict in which we have been recently engaged as a struggle between Peers and people. How easy it is to repre­sent us as the party of privilege and class, and as the party of the rich. We are not, ladies and gentlemen, the party of privilege. It is our aim, as it was the aim of Disraeli throughout his long life - (cheers)­ - to be the party not of a class, but a party of the nation. We realise as strongly as any man that the greatness of a nation does not depend upon the trade, but upon the character of its people. (Cheers.)But we know that character cannot be formed except under good social conditions. There is, as our Chairman has reminded us, a great feeling of labour unrest, which is not confined to this country, which is to be found elsewhere. And to whatever extent it is wide­spread it means simply this - your Chairman has said the same thing - that the working classes think they are entitled to have, and they want to try to obtain, a larger share of the profits of industry. Ladies and gentlemen, in this country there are two special causes which have accentuated that feeling. One of these is the Budget campaign of two years ago. (Hear, hear.) That campaign stirred every constituency - almost every family in the kingdom - and did undoubtedly induce the poor to believe that the passing of the Budget would be for them the beginning of a golden age. (Laughter.)Well, the Budget is passed, and the outbreak last August, an outbreak of a kind unprecedented in this country, is, in my belief, simply the ripening fruit of the seed that was sown two years ago. (Cheers.) That is one cause, but there is another. During the last ten years there has been a considerable increase in the total wealth of this country.But in that period the condition of the working classes has not improved; it has actually deteriorated. (\u2018Quite right.\u2019) From information supplied by the Board of Trade, we know that during that period the cost of living has gone up almost 10 per cent, and wages have remained stationary. That is a cause, and a sufficient explanation of a good deal of discontent. (Hear, hear.) I said a minute or two ago, that the working classes thought they were entitled to a larger share. I go further, and I say now that in my belief, so far as I can judge, all classes, including employers - and what your Chairman said confirms for his part what I am now going to say - all classes would like the working classes to have as large a share of industry as is compatible with the success of that industry. (Cheers.)How is that result to be obtained? There is one method - the method adopted by the Government. It is to take from the rich in taxes and to hand it to the poor in doles. That is a very simple way. But it has its dangers. If you attack capital suddenly and unexpec­tedly, it is apt to fly beyond your reach. The Prime Minister, whose economic views are at least original - (laughter) - has told us that the more capital flies from this country to be invested abroad, the better for us.If he is right, we never have had benefactors like the present Government. (Laughter.) During the short time they have been in office the amount of capital that has gone abroad for investment, as shown even in the very imperfect returns of the Inland Revenue Commissioners, is greater, taking the ave­rage of the five-year period, than in the twenty years before they came into office. (Hear, hear.) That is one fact. But there is another. We have been passing through a period which, so far as statistics can guide us, is a period of good trade. And in spite of that good trade there has been a steady, an enormous emigration from our shores. (Hear, hear.)Do you think there is no connection between these two facts? I think there is. If you attack capital, as I said a moment ago, unexpectedly, if you attack it vindictively - (cheers) - and - what is worse far than any­thing they have done, actually done - if the men at the head of the Government speak of those who have accumulated wealth as if they were outcasts, treat them as if they were beasts of prey to be shot at sight - (hear, hear) - well, you will indeed injure the capitalist, but you will injure far more vitally the man whose only capital is his skill and his industry, and who has to depend for the employment of that capital of his not only on accumulated wealth, but on the energy of the men who are capable of accumulating that wealth. (Hear, hear.) That is one method; there is another.Change of Fiscal SystemIn my belief the greatest of all possible social reforms would be to raise the standard of wages throughout this country - (hear, hear) - for in that way you would not so much help the working classes directly as put them in a position to help themselves. (Hear, hear.) For many years now I have advocated a change in our fiscal system but in advocating that change, however mis­taken I may have been, I have never, and I hope I never shall, make any claim in which I do not in my heart believe. We do not pretend that a change in our fiscal system would cure all evils; but we do contend that such a change would do much to help what is the greatest of all our social evils - chronic unemployment. (Loud cheers.) In making this claim we have some­thing at least to justify us. A rise in the cost of living, without any corresponding rise in wages, is found in this country.It is not found elsewhere. In Germany, for instance, there has been a rise perhaps as great, certainly not greater, but as we know from the authoritative report of our own Consul to this Government, there has been a rise in wages which more than compensates for the increased cost of living. (Cheers.) Now, ladies and gentlemen, I do believe that Tariff Reform would tend to raise the level of wages, but I am sure of this, that without some change in our fiscal system a general rise in the level of wages is absolutely impossible. (Cheers.) In proof of this take the Insurance Bill, to which I have already referred. That Bill, whatever its merits - (laughter) - and I hope it has some merit greater than fourpence for ninepence­ (loud laughter) - perhaps my slip was nearer the truth than I thought - whatever its merits it does add a new burden to industry in this country.I have taken a great deal of trouble to find out what is the extent of this burden, and it is a very heavy one. I have examined returns from more than a hundred em­ployers in different trades, and the employers\u2019 contribu­tion alone, without counting the workmen\u2019s, means, when stated in terms of additional income tax, a new burden varying in some cases from less than a shilling to in other cases more than twenty shillings in the pound. Now, that is a heavy burden, especially the twenty shillings in the pound. (Laughter and hear, hear.) Can anyone suggest that the whole of that burden ought to be borne by the producer? Should not part of it at least fall on the consumer? (Hear, hear.) Even Mr. Lloyd George has himself suggested that the consumer should bear part - (hear, hear) - but under our existing fiscal system how is that possible? (Hear, hear.) Of all the manufactured goods consumed in this country some­thing like 10 per cent come from abroad. That is not a large proportion, you may say, but there is no businessman in this room who does not know that it is quite a largo enough proportion to regulate prices. (Hear, hear.)The Example of GermanyIf you impose a new burden on the home product, and no corresponding burden on the foreign product, is it not evident - is it not certain - that the intensity, the severity, and the extent of that foreign competition must be increased (Cheers.) Mr. Lloyd George, I am glad to admit, is improving. (Laughter.) After passing his old age pension scheme, he took a voyage across the North Sea, where, incidentally, he discovered Germany - (laughter) - in order to examine the pension scheme there.He has done better in regard to the insurance scheme; he took his journey before and not after passing the Bill. But in spite of that improvement, he has missed the one lesson which German experience should have taught him. It was Prince Bismarck who passed the insurance scheme for Germany, but it was Prince Bismarck who gave to the German workman security in the German market - (hear, hear) - and it was the change in the fiscal system, and not the insurance scheme, which came first. (Loud cheers.) He first stopped the leak which was sinking the ship, and afterwards it was easy to improve her sailing quali­ties.We must do the same. (Hear, hear.) If we do not, then most certainly Bills introduced, with the best intentions, perhaps, for helping the poor, for helping unemployment, will inevitably turn out to be Bills to increase the number of the poor and to create unemployment. (Loud cheers.)The Canadian ElectionsThe last subject on which I should like to speak to you tonight is the general election which has just taken place in Canada. (Cheers.) That election was described by Mr. Balfour as the great event of the year in the history of the British Empire. It may prove to be - and I believe it will prove to be - a landmark in the history of the world. (Hear, hear.) In common with the other leaders of our party, while the result was in suspense I never said a word in criticism of Sir Wilfrid Laurier\u2019s Government. To have does so would have been the height of folly, for however much the question concerned us it concerned Canada more, and it was for them and not for us to decide. (Hear, hear.) It would have been not only the height of folly, it would have been really the height of ingratitude. For we must never forget - and this is not by any means the only occasion that I have recalled that it was the Government of Sir Wilfrid Laurier which gave to the work of our people at home a preference on the Canadian market. (Cheers.) We are grateful to him for that, but we are grateful to him also for this, that the example which was set by him has now been followed by every one of the self-governing Dominions. (Hear, hear.) Let us remember, also, that while the British Government defended that treaty on the ground that it would destroy Preference, Sir Wilfrid Laurier defended it always because in his belief it would not injure Preference. I differed from him, but that difference did not weaken in any way my respect for him, and has not lessened the admiration which I feel for his great intellect and his great eloquence. But now that the Canadian people have decided, we have the right to rejoice in their decision. (Hear, hear.)If you wish to understand what these elec­tions really mean you must not look at what Radical speakers or Radical newspapers say about it now. Look at what they said about it when they thought the result was going to be different. (Hear, hear.) We were told then that this treaty was a great step towards Free Trade. If that were true, then the rejection of the treaty is not a step, it is a leap backwards from what they call Free Trade. We were told that it was a death-blow - ­not the first by many - (laughter) - a death-blow to the cause of Preference. If that were true then the rejec­tion of the treaty gives new life to the cause of Prefer­ence. We were told that the treaty was just another proof that trade must be governed by natural laws and controlled by natural forces. That is true, but the rejection of the treaty proves what our opponents always forget, viz., that the greatest natural forces are human character and human sentiment. (Cheers.) The real meaning of the rejection of that treaty was simply this - that Canadian people believed, and I agree with them, that President Taft was right when he said it was a case of now or never, because they believed that that election would decide, and perhaps finally decide, whether Canada was to continue to grow as an autonomous nation more closely bound to the British Empire, or whether it was to be more and more closely united socially, economically, and ultimately politically with the great friendly nation lying to the South. They tell us that it has no bearing upon the question of Preference. A more ignorant claim was never made. (Cheers.)Reciprocal PreferenceFor many years at every opportunity the Colonial Prime Ministers of every self-governing Colony have urged upon the Mother Country the policy of reciprocal Preference, which means simply this - that each part of the Empire should give to every other different terms and better terms than those given to the rest of the world. (Hear, hear.) And the Canadian election is supply an emphatic re­minder to us that that is still the policy of the self-governing dominions of the Crown. (Cheers.) I re­ferred the other day to an incident in my own experi­ence which I shall repeat to you tonight. A friend of mine, who was a candidate for the House of Com­mons at the last election, was in Canada while the elec­tions were going on. As soon as they were over this, he tells me, was the message that was everywhere given to him: \u2018We have done our part; it is up to the old country now.\u2019 (Cheers.) It is up to the old country now. (Hear, hear.) We have thrown away many opportunities. We are fortunate. We shall have one other opportunity and one only, and at the next elec­tion, I am satisfied that we shall not throw it away.Ladies and gentlemen, as you probably know, most of you, I was born in Canada. (Cheers.) I spent the early years of my life there. Among the many dis­qualifications for the position which I now hold - and no one feels them more strongly than myself - that is not a disqualification. (Cheers.) It is an advantage. (Cheers.) For 25 years the determination to maintain the integrity of the United Kingdom has given a name to our party. We are the Unionist party. (Hear, hear.) But ours is now a larger Union. It is for us not only to preserve; it is for us also to create. It is for us to maintain, and we shall maintain, in spite of the lowering clouds which now threaten us, the integrity of the United Kingdom. But it is for us also, it is for the men of this generation, to guard the vital Union of the British Empire. (Loud cheers, during which the right hon. gentleman resumed his seat, having spoken for an hour and ten minutes.)

aVBefore I enter, as I shall in a moment, the controversial arena of domestic politics, I think it right to say a word in regard to the international situation. It is a fortnight since, at the Guildhall, I endeavoured to define in clear and precise terms the attitude of this country and, as I then believed and still believe, that of the other Great Powers, in face of the war which is unhappily still raging in Eastern Europe. That attitude has not, so far as I know, been in any way changed or modified. We are all anxious to stop the further effusion of blood between the actual combatants. We are even more anxious to limit and circumscribe the field of possible conflict. The Powers are working together to that end, and I repeat today, and I am glad to be able to do so, that while we and others retain with unabated constancy our friendships and understandings, we are satisfied that there is no division of wish or purpose in the co-operative policy of all; and that it is in the best interests of peace and of ultimate stability that special and particular questions should, as far as possible, be reserved to be dealt with when the time comes, as part of the general and definitive settlement.Tory Attitude Towards Past and Present Liberal LeadersIt is twenty-five years exactly since, as one of the rank and file of the Liberal party, I addressed a meeting of the National Liberal Federation here in Nottingham. Mr. Gladstone, our then illustrious leader, was present, and we were in the first stage of the campaign which we are today bringing to a close. I feel that I do not deserve many of the kind things that you were good enough to say of me, but they are a welcome change from much of the language which I am accustomed both to hear and to read. So long as I possess the confidence of my friends, I am indifferent to what is said on the other side. I am constantly told - indeed, it is one of the platitudes of Tory invective - that I am a past master in the art of political chicanery. I remember well that, at the time to which I have just referred, exactly the same thing used to be said, from exactly the same quarters, of Mr. Gladstone. Now, in these days, if Mr. Gladstone is not actually canonised in the Tory calendar, his name is rarely invoked except to contrast his patriotism and straight­forwardness with the partisanship and the obliquities of his decadent and degenerate successors. I do not presume, and never shall, to measure myself with that great man, but I am not without hope that, when the time comes for me to seek and to obtain repose, and to hand over the leadership of the Liberal party to still darker and more dangerous spirits, as the years roll by, and the past recedes, and the mists accumulate, I may soften into a gracious legendary figure, and some Tory orator of the future, some yet unborn Carson, will be found laying a belated wreath of rhetorical immortelles upon my humble tomb.The Presence of Mr. RedmondI am quite sure of this, that if the cup of my offences was not already full to overflowing, the last necessary drop will be supplied by the presence tonight on this platform of Mr. John Redmond. Whether our appearance here tonight is to be represented as an act of subservience on my part or an act of subservience on Mr. Redmond\u2019s part depends entirely on whether the picture is intended to be exhibited in Great Britain or in Ireland. We Liberals - and I am sure I am speaking in your name - are heartily glad to see him here, and we perceive nothing unnatural, nothing derogatory to the best traditions of our political life, in the fact that there should be co-operation on the platform as well as in the House of Commons between those who are carrying on in concert, and without the sacrifice of conviction or principle, either on the one side or on the other, a common campaign for a great and a worthy cause.The Finance of the Home Rule BillIf you ask me how that cause is faring at Westminster, my answer is, \u2018Very well.\u2019 We are now in the midst of what is in some ways the most intricate and difficult part of the Home Rule Bill, the financial clauses, the active supervision of which I have largely delegated to the most capable hands of the Chancellor of the Exchequer and Mr. Herbert Samuel, with the ever ready help of our two brilliant Law Officers, and with, as always - and perhaps in this controversy it is our most invaluable personal asset - the genial and unfailing sagacity of Mr. Birrell. In all its essential features, and I am sure Mr. Redmond will agree with me here, our financial scheme is weathering the storm of criticism. It becomes more and more apparent, in fact, as discussion proceeds, that the only real alternative to it is the continuance and development of the present vicious system of giving Ireland, year by year, a constantly swelling stream of doles and gifts from the British Exchequer, while leaving untouched, without any motive or incentive to retrenchment, the extravagant costliness of Irish administration.A \u2018Momentary and Accidental Reverse\u2019It is true that last week in this matter of Irish finance we suffered a momentary and accidental reverse, which involved the loss of valuable time. So much nonsense has been talked and written with regard to this incident and our method of dealing with it that I must once more, in as few words as possible, state the plain facts. On Thursday in the previous week our financial resolution was carried in Committee, after a full debate, by a majority of no fewer than 121. On the following Monday, after a perfunctory discussion of less than half an hour on an amendment of which no notice had ever been given, that amendment, which made the whole resolution futile and unworkable, was carried by a majority of 21. It was obvious that the two decisions could not be reconciled, and it was plainly necessary, unless the Government thought fit, as they did not, to abandon the Bill and resign office, that steps should be taken without delay to ascertain which of the two contradictory votes represented the considered judgment of the House of Commons.The Government\u2019s \u2018Simple and Direct\u2019 ProposalThe case was a wholly exceptional one; conflicting and opposite decisions had been given on the same point in the course of a single week. It seemed to us, and I think we were perfectly right, that the simple and direct course, well warranted by Parliamentary precedent, a course which would have been adopted in any other assembly of business men, was to ask the House to cancel the second vote and to restore the first. We hear a great deal about the sacro-sanctity of our Parliamentary forms and the procedure which has been consecrated by the usages of 300 years. It is curious to recall that only ten years ago Mr. Balfour, the Leader of the Tory party, pro­posed to abolish all discussion on these money resolutions - they were to be decided upon without amendment or debate. If that plan had been adopted there could have been no Banbury amendment at all. So you see there is nothing so very sacrosanct after all about these Parliamentary forms.A \u2018Scene of Disorder and Violence\u2019But what was the result? The result was a scene of disorder and violence which happily has few parallels in the history of the House of Commons. The Speaker made an appeal, and in response to his appeal we adopted a more circuitous method of obtaining precisely the same result. That result has been obtained, the obnoxious amendment has been wiped out, the original resolution has been restored in all its essential details by practically the same majority by which it was in the first instance passed. In other words, the second division in the House has proved to be wholly misleading, and the first to represent the true judgment of an overwhelming majority. I see that in some quarters this result is represented as a triumph for the Opposition and a humiliation for the Government - a triumph for them, when we accomplished our purpose; a humilia­tion for us, when its accomplishment was not prevented but delayed by the degradation of the House of Commons! I gladly make them a present of the only triumph they can claim - namely, the consump­tion and loss of four or five days of Parliamentary time.The Price of this \u2018Barren Victory\u2019But there is something much more serious than that. Have they reflected, do they reflect, at what a price this barren victory has been purchased? I deprecate disorder, either outside or inside the House of Commons, by whomsoever it is originated, because I believe it to be fatal to the first principles of Parliamentary and Constitutional Government. I warned the Tory party six weeks ago that their Blenheim and Ulster performances earlier in the autumn would leave them without one shred of moral title to resist any course the majority of the Irish people might take in the event - happily in the highest degree improbable - of a denial of Home Rule. Now, this demonstration, conceived upon the same lines and in the same spirit, that a minority can, by shouting and tumult, bring the Parliamentary machine to a standstill, will not fail to be remembered and cited in the future if, when the Tory party is in power with a majority, not subject, as we are, to the restrictions of the Parliament Act, but capable of registering upon the Statute book any of its decrees at will through the automatic compliance of a partisan House of Lords - if, I say, with such a majority in power, the minority should be so ill-advised as to follow their example. That is the strange pass to which the party of law and order has been reduced.The Tory Theory of the Parliament ActThe whole theory upon which the Opposition, not only to the Home Rule Bill, but to all our measures, has been conducted rests upon this assumption - the assumption that, having passed the Parliament Act after strenuous controversy and after a General Election it had been approved by a large majority of the electorate, we are constitutionally debarred, after all we have said and done, from making any effective use of it. That is a very peculiar position, when you come to examine it, to take up. All this time, all this labour, all this controversy has been expended for absolutely nothing. The latter-day Tory seems to spend a large part of his working hours in hunting for our broken pledges. It is becoming an obsession with him, and the results are sometimes pathetic, but more frequently grotesque. I shall have to consider later, in view of their own promises, what are the moral qualifications of these gentlemen to complain of broken pledges.The Charge of \u2018Election Trickery\u2019First, you will allow me to examine very briefly and dispose of - not for the first time - the charges they bring against us, which by frequent repetition may obtain credence in the minds of people of short memory. The first is - I am almost ashamed to go back upon it, but I am obliged to - the charge of what is called \u2018election trickery\u2019; in other words, that we carefully concealed from the electors in November and December, 1910, that Home Rule was an issue, and, consequently, that our introduction of the Home Rule Bill was a fraud upon the constituencies. I should like on that point before I say a word about the actual facts, to quote a rather remarkable passage from a speech made by Mr. Balfour at Manchester towards the end of his term of office in January, 1905. He used some very striking words. He said: \u2018What is the charge? It is that the present Government are in office immorally and illegitimately, that the election was taken upon a particular issue\u2019 - that was the war, you will remember - \u2018that one question was before the country at the time and absorbed men\u2019s attention, and that consequently all legislation outside that one issue is legislation for which\u2026 we are without a mandate.\u2019 What did Mr. Balfour say about that? \u2018That is an entirely new constitutional theory; and it is not only new, but it is fundamentally, essentially, a vicious theory; and, much more than that, it is a theory invented by the Opposition quite late in the day when they began to think it would be convenient to get rid of the present Government.\u2019 That is what Mr. Balfour said in 1905. Even if we had said nothing at the Election about our intentions as to Home Rule, we should have been doing, after all, no worse than the Government which, after the khaki election, introduced the Education Bill; and we should be well within the shelter of Mr. Balfour\u2019s constitutional principle.Lord Lansdowne\u2019s EvidenceAs a matter of fact, we did nothing of the kind. We gave the fullest and most explicit notice; and the evidence is overwhelming that at the General Election of 1910 it was universally recognised and understood. I made it perfectly plain the year before - in my speech at the Albert Hall in December, 1909 - and whatever may be said of us now, we were certainly not dependent on the Irish vote then. I repeated it in the clearest and plainest terms at the commencement of the Election of 1910, addressing the delegates of this Federation at Hull. It is just as well in these matters to take unimpeachable testimony, and I will not go to any partisan authority. On November 30th, before a vote had been given in the Election of 1910, Lord Lansdowne, the Leader then as now of the Tory Party in the House of Lords, speaking at Portsmouth, said: \u2018Mr. Asquith\u2019 - that is me - \u2018to my mind has made it perfectly clear\u2019 - not a matter of inference, to be drawn from circum­stances, but that I, the Leader of the Liberal Party, then as now the Prime Minister of the country, had made it clear - what? \u2018That the first step that will be taken will be to deal with the question of Home Rule.\u2019 I am quite content with that testimony; it remains on record, and it cannot be contradicted. It is impossible to explain it away.The Allegation as to Immediate Reform of the House of LordsNow let us come to the second charge. It is this - that we have failed to perform what is, I think, properly described as a debt of honour - the carrying out of the intention declared in the preamble of the Parliament Act. In other words, that if we kept faith with the electors we ought to be devoting this Session to a scheme for the reconstruction of the House of Lords. I undertake to say that if you look at the records of the General Election of December, 1910, there was not a single speaker on either side who ever said or suggested anything of the kind, nor was there a single elector who gave his vote either on one side or the other upon that hypothesis I said in the House of Commons, when this ridiculous charge was first put forward at the beginning of the present Session, speaking on February 20th, \u2018I want to know by whom, when, and where was any promise ever given that in the next Session after the passing of the Parliament Act the Government would proceed with proposals for the reconstitution of the Second Chamber.\u2019 \u2018That,\u2019 I said, \u2018is a very specific question and it demands a specific answer, and the answer is - Nowhere, at no time, and by nobody.\u2019What the Preamble of the Parliament Act SaysIndeed, these people have not read the preamble of the Parliament Act. What does it say? It recites an intention to substitute for the present House of Lords a new Second Chamber, and it goes on to say that such substitution cannot be immediately brought into operation. Further, it says, \u2018And whereas pro­vision will require hereafter to be made by Parliament in a measure effecting such substitution for limiting and defining the powers of the new Second Chamber, but it is expedient to make such pro­vision as in this Act appears for restricting the existing powers of the House of Lords.\u2019 Could anything more clearly indicate an intervening period between the passing of the Act and the re­constitution of the Second Chamber? And it provides what in the interval is to be done to restrict the existing powers of the present House of Lords. I may tell those gentlemen who are so solicitous about the redemption of our debt of honour that the Government is engaged in the careful consideration of the reconstruction promised in the preamble, and in due course our proposals will be submitted for Parliamentary discussion.The \u2018Suspension\u2019 of the ConstitutionThey talk about the suspension of the Constitution! The Constitution is much more rational now than it has ever been within the lifetime of any one of us, more rational in the sense that it is less uneven between the two parties in the State, but it still leaves a great deal to be desired. We are still handicapped, we are still under this disability - we cannot pass a Liberal measure into law of a controversial kind, and of the first importance, if it has not been through three Sessions of the House of Commons and been two years before Parliament; and in the meantime we are absolutely at the mercy of an irresponsible and partisan assembly. If the Tories come into power tomorrow the Parliament Act dis­appears completely. They can pass any measure they please in the course of a single Session. Therefore, if ever there was a party which had a direct interest in putting an end to that state of things, and in bringing the Second Chamber into something like harmony with the principles of justice and equity, it is the Liberal Party.Not More Than One Controversial Bill a SessionI am sorry to keep you so long, but it is necessary to run these things to earth. The Opposition has recently discovered, or professes to have discovered, that I gave something in the nature of a pledge that we would not introduce more than one Bill, or more than one controversial Bill, in one Session. That suggestion was never dreamt of in the earlier months of the year, never even hinted when we introduced into the House of Commons, in the spring and the summer, first the Home Rule Bill, then the Welsh Church Bill, and then the Franchise Bill. It has been unearthed by what I cannot help thinking a very misplaced industry in the course of the Autumn Sitting, and unearthed for the purpose of prejudicing the Welsh Church Bill. Let us examine it for a moment, though really it is a mare\u2019s nest of a most absurd and grotesque kind.Lack of Foundation for this AllegationWhat really happened was this. In the course of the discussion last year, when the Parliament Bill was in Committee, Mr. Peel, as he was then, moved an amendment providing that the provisions of the Parliament Act should only apply to one Bill in a Session - the very thing to which I am now supposed to have pledged myself. I was representing the Government; I got up and opposed the amendment, and it was rejected by a majority of 83. The imaginary picture the mover of the amendment drew was that we or some other Government might \u2018pile up\u2019 a great number of Bills, \u2018deluge\u2019 the country, and overwork the House of Commons. I said that was an alarming but a perfectly unfounded representation of what was likely to happen. I said the limits to the power of human and Parlia­mentary endurance afforded adequate safeguards, and I said we could not accept any artificial limit to the right of the House of Commons to pass more than one Bill in one Session. See how it was interpreted at the time. Mr. Long said he was not surprised at what I said, because it was quite obvious that three measures in one Session would be the minimum to meet the requirements of the Government in order to give satisfaction to the different sections which supported them. Another, unofficial, Tory member, in order to clinch the matter got up and said, \u2018I presume the Prime Minister will not deny that next Session the Government will introduce a Home Rule Bill, a Scottish Land Bill, and a Welsh Disestablishment Bill. He has got to do so.\u2019The Tories and Their Referendum PledgeBut let us turn from our own misdeeds and make a short incur­sion into the enemy\u2019s territory. I am going to ask you to consider a very serious matter. What, in this matter of the redemption of electoral pledges, is the record of those gentlemen who are day and night bringing charges against us? You will remember the con­troversy which raged at the time of the last election in regard to what was called the Referendum. In 1907, when Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman\u2019s resolution was before the House of Commons, Mr. Balfour said the Referendum was alien to our traditions. But before long he gave, as you know, a rapid and complete consent to the greatest innovation that has been proposed in our time in our Parliamentary and constitutional system. The Referendum began by being commended as a solvent for disputes between the Houses, but it was soon found to be capable of, as it was then thought, other and more convenient applications.Mr. Balfour\u2019s Albert Hall PledgesAt the General Election of December, 1910, it was all-important for the Tory party to secure the Unionist Free Trade vote, and, accordingly, at the very beginning of the election, on November 29th, in the Albert Hall, Mr. Balfour used these remarkable words: \u2018I frankly say that without any question Tariff Reform is a great change. I admit that this election - or any election perhaps, cer­tainly this election - cannot be described as taken upon Tariff Reform simply, but I have not the least objection to submit the principles of Tariff Reform to a Referendum.\u2019 You will remember the enthusiasm in the Tory ranks - broken, I admit, by a few dissentient murmurs - following that memorable declaration. The audience said almost to a man: \u2018This has won the election for us.\u2019 The very same day, or the next day, Lord Lansdowne used words to the same effect; and Mr. Bonar Law, who was not then the Leader of the Unionist party, and who was fighting a very hard fight in Manchester, where the Unionist Free Traders are an im­portant element, said early in December that their leader had given a pledge that Unionists would not pass a Tariff Reform measure until the people were given an opportunity of saying whether they desired it. Much as he believed in Tariff Reform, if they found by a Referendum that the people did not want it, then he would not wish to force it upon them. Lord Milner the same day, with the air of moral superiority which our opponents so commonly assume, said: \u2018He (Mr. Balfour) is not going to carry it by a side-wind. There is something which comes even before Tariff Reform, and that is straight dealing in public life.\u2019 This was followed - and it is interesting in another connection - by the assurance of Mr. Balfour and Lord Lansdowne that not only was there to be a Referendum, but a Referendum from which plural voting was to be entirely absent. \u2018Each voter,\u2019 said Mr. Balfour, \u2018will have a right to give one vote and no more. There is no plural voting, and the gross inequalities in the size of constituencies will be avoided.\u2019This Pledge Remained After the ElectionThe election took place, the majority was not secured, but the pledge remained. I say that not on my own authority, and not merely as a matter of inference, but I say it by virtue of the declara­tion of Lord Lansdowne himself. Lord Lansdowne, speaking in the House of Lords after the election, in March, 1911, made a special reference to this case and said, speaking of Mr. Balfour\u2019s memorable announcement at the Albert Hall, \u2018That pledge will, of course, be fulfilled whenever we have an opportunity of fulfilling it.\u2019This Pledge Now WithdrawnYes, but how do we stand today? These are the people who talk about broken pledges. Why, just a week ago, in the Albert Hall, we have this very same Lord Lansdowne, with the assent of Mr. Bonar Law - the presumed assent - saying: \u2018We pro­posed a Referendum as a means of settling the differences between the two Houses. Our scheme was not accepted at the polls. I suggest to you that from that moment we regained our freedom. To apply it any longer to Tariff Reform is not a business proposi­tion.\u2019 It is not a business proposition to keep a pledge, deliberately given, which, as Lord Milner said, was essential to straight dealing in public life, and which, after the election was over, Lord Lans­downe had recognised as a matter of course as a pledge which would be fulfilled whenever they had any opportunity of fulfilling it. I think the less they say about broken faith, the better for their reputation - for anything but hypocrisy.The Tories and Tariff ReformNow that brings me to say - if you will bear with me - two or three words upon this very matter of Tariff Reform. It has been carefully kept in the background in the by-elections in great indus­trial constituencies such as Manchester and Mid Lothian, and today at Bolton, but nevertheless, as is clear from what Lord Lansdowne and his colleagues said in the Albert Hall, it is the intention of the leaders of the Tory party, if they can obtain a majority in the next General Election, without any Referendum or anything of the kind, to incorporate Tariff Reform as part of the fiscal system in the Statute book of this country. They have tried to minimise its effects; they have told you that the increases will be small, and that, as Mr. Balfour said in 1910, and as they repeat today, there shall be no increase in the cost of living, due to any change in these taxes on consumption, which shall fall on the working man\u2019s budget with increased severity, because, as he said, we have the power, and the power will be exercised, of reducing other indirect taxes - the taxes, for example, on tea and sugar; at all events, the taxes on the consumption of the working man.The Consumers and the Tariff Reform TaxesThat is the statement which is presented, and upon the strength of which the votes of the constituencies are going to be invited. That brings us to very familiar ground. Let us see what it really comes to. First, it is an admission that the results of the new taxation - taxation upon corn, meat, upon dairy produce - will, or at any rate may, fall upon the consumer. I need not point out to any body of intelligent men, that if a tax is paid by the foreign producer or importer no assurance for the readjustment of the burden on the shoulders of the working classes is in the least degree necessary. That is the first point.The Exchequer and the Tariff Reform TaxesThe second is this, and I cannot state it better than by quoting the language used by Mr. Chamberlain himself when he opened his fiscal campaign in Glasgow nine years ago. He said this, and it is perfectly true: \u2018The Exchequer, when it reduces tea or sugar, loses the amount of the tax on the whole consumption\u2019 - that is perfectly clear \u2013 \u2018but when it imposes a tax on corn or upon meat it only gains the duty on a part of the consumption, since it does not collect it either upon the Colonial or upon the home production.\u2019 So that - assuming Colonial corn came in free, which is no longer to be the case - the taxes you are invited to remit are taxes the whole benefit of which goes into the Exchequer, but the new burdens, as com­pensation for which the remission is to take place, are burdens not measured by that amount of the tax that is going into the Ex­chequer, but measured by the increased price of the whole supply.How the Tariff Reform Scheme Works OutYou see how that works out in practice. It is very important to bring these things clearly home to the minds of the people. We have no greater, or I think more trustworthy, authority in the actual working out of these problems than my honourable friend, Mr. Chiozza Money. I see that he has actually worked out a sum - I do not, of course, though I have the greatest respect for his judg­ment and his accuracy, commit myself to his precise figures - you cannot predict with anything approaching accurate precision what will be the exact effect in pounds, shillings, and pence, or any other form of numbers, of any fiscal change. He says that if you take the import duties proposed by Mr. Chamberlain\u2019s friends upon cereals and upon meat and dairy produce, taking the higher duty upon the foreign supply and the lower duty upon the colonial supply - he calculates that in 1912 the duty received by the Exchequer would not be more than eight millions, whereas the cost to the consumer in the increased price of the whole supply would be no less than eighteen millions. If you look at the duties, the whole benefit of which flow directly into the Exchequer, the duties on tea, sugar, cocoa, and coffee - they come in all to about 10½ millions - by a very simple calculation you will see that if the time should ever come for the redemption of this pledge that the burden to be imposed upon the consumer by the new taxes upon imported food is to be met by a diminution or some readjustment of existing taxation on food which we now consume - that it is a pledge which it is abso­lutely impossible for any Government or any party to fulfil.On What Would the Tories Fight an Immediate General Election?If we were to have a dissolution of Parliament tomorrow, what is the topic to which two-thirds of the Tory orators would devote themselves? Would it be Home Rule? No. Would it be Welsh Disestablishment? No. Would it even be Tariff Reform? That perhaps the least of any of the three. No; it would be an appeal dilating upon the hardships and grievances of the Insurance Act; and a majority so obtained, acting on the principle so clearly laid down by Mr. Balfour in the speech I quoted, would be used to carry Tariff Reform, with its burden of infinite suffering and loss on the working classes and upon the industries of this country, in defiance, as I still believe, of the opinion of the vast majority of the electors. I am giving my own deliberate judgment when I say to you that I think that is the greatest danger that threatens this country at the present moment.The Threefold Duty of the Liberal PartyI have thought it necessary to go in some detail and at some length into this, and I hope you will agree it is not inappropriate that I should come back before I finish to the point at which I began. What is the duty of the Liberal party at this moment in the House of Commons and outside? On that question my answer is threefold. It is to persist without haste, but without rest, in the programme which we have laid down; to obtain all those great measures of reform upon which for a generation past the aspirations and the hopes of the progressive party in this country and in Ireland have been fixed; and to claim for those measures what they have never had before, fair play and the possibility of passing into law. We are not going to lay aside any part of the programme. We are not going to desert the cause either of Ireland or of Wales. We are going to do our best, and I believe our best will be a successful best, to secure such reform in our franchise law as will make the House of Commons a truer and more accurate reflection of the mind and will of the people. If those tasks are to be accomplished they will involve undoubtedly a long and ex­hausting Session, great effort, and much sacrifice on the part particularly of members of Parliament, and we have good reason to recognise not only with appreciation but with the warmest gratitude the splendid constancy with which all the ranks of the Progressive Party, without distinction, have, amidst almost un­exampled exigencies, responded to the exceptional calls that have been made upon them.We Shall Persist to the EndOur divisions during this Autumn Sitting have, as a whole, surpassed anything during the present Parliament, and I believe it will be generally agreed that there never was a time in our political and Parliamentary history when there was such a good spirit, such strong, I might say sturdy, determination of the rank-and-file, of all those who support us, that these sacrifices shall not be thrown away. No great campaign was ever carried on without occasional checks and delays. It is part of the fortune of war, and we are not discouraged by the passing incidents which come today and which are forgotten tomorrow. As far as we at Westminster are con­cerned, we mean to persist to the end, and we rely upon you, whom, I believe, we represent in this matter, to give us the sympathy, support, and loyalty which has never yet failed us. If we have - and I believe you will see that we have - concentration of purpose, unity of spirit, and unshaken firmness of resolve, then, long and stormy though the voyage may have been before it comes to an end, the ship will find her way with a full cargo into the desired haven.

aVIt is a great pleasure to me to find myself amongst so many old and tried friends, and to learn that, both as regards the number of the delegates and the spirit which has animated their proceedings from first to last, this has been one of the record gatherings of the National Liberal Federation. Let me thank you, in the name of the Government, for your general verdict of approval of a legislative and administrative record which, as the Chairman has said, now goes back for eight years. I am quite content to put it side by side with that of any Govern­ment that has held office for anything like the same space of time in this country within the memory of man.We have, by universal admission, contributed at least our share to the maintenance of the peace of the world. We have drawn more closely than they were ever drawn before, and by measures consonant with the best traditions of Liberal policy in the past, the ties which unite us to our great self-governing Dominions. We have dealt with two of the greatest and most urgent of our social problems - the provision for old age and insurance against sickness and infirmity. We are about to take in hand on the same broad and generous lines a third - I mean the whole group of grievances, urban and rural, which are connected with the ownership and use of land. It is true that we were thwarted in our efforts to deal with such matters as education and licensing questions, the urgency of which I need not tell you we have not forgotten. But the obstacle which confronted us in the early days of our Ministerial life has now, happily, been removed, and we have succeeded in carrying into effect that which, for the lifetime of a whole generation, has been the aspiration of the Liberal Party - the establishment of the constitutional authority of the representative House of the Legislature.Expenditure on ArmamentsThere is, so far as I know, only one aspect of our administrative work which chequers your satisfaction as you survey the past. It is your disquietude at the growth of the national expenditure, and in particular of that part of it which is devoted to the fighting services. Do not suppose that I do not share that disquietude. If I cite one or two figures it may, I think, help to put the position of this country in its true perspective. In the first place, let me remind you, as the Chairman has already done, that since we have been responsible for the national finances we have reduced the indebtedness of the State by an amount which at the close of the present financial year we hope will not fall far short, if, indeed, it falls short at all, of one hundred millions sterling. The great bulk of the debt which has been so redeemed, as I need hardly remind you, was incurred for war expenditure in the past. We have been meeting the bill which our ancestors drew upon posterity, and at the same time we have been endeavouring to avoid their bad example by paying our own way and curtailing, within the narrowest possible limits, borrowing for such purposes.Roughly speaking, the expenditure on the Army during the last eight years has been fairly constant. It has neither risen nor fallen, while that on the Navy has risen something like fourteen millions. But what has been happening at the same time on the Continent of Europe? If you take the five great Continental Powers, and make the reservation one must for the difficulty of precise comparison owing to the different methods in which the accounts are kept, I estimate that in the five years - I do not go further back than five years - in the five years from 1908-9 to 1913-14 their military expenditure has risen by at least eighty millions, and their naval expenditure by at least thirty-five. Those are figures which should be borne in mind when you are estimating the relative proportion of the additional burden which this kind of expenditure has caused the several nations of the world. And there is another basis of comparison which in fairness ought not to he left out of sight - I mean the relative share which our expen­diture on armaments bears to the rest of our expenditure here at home in the present and in past years. I have had the figures carefully taken out, and I will give you just two or three. I am excluding from both sides of the account debt charges, on the one side, debt incurred for the Army and Navy; and, on the other side, debt incurred for civil expenditure and payments for the National Debt; and I include in the civil expenditure the expen­diture on the Post Office. Thirty years ago the Army and Navy, or, as I call it, armament expenditure, was 49.4% of the whole, and civil expenditure 50.6%. That was in 1883. In 1906-7, the first year that we were in office, the two were exactly, or almost exactly, equal - 50 per cent upon each. For the current year, 1913-14, the percentage of expenditure upon armaments has fallen to 42.7, and the civil expenditure has risen to 57.3.A Drain on the Resources for Social ProgressThose figures are worth bearing in mind, and you will see that great and lamentable - no one would, if he were at liberty, use stronger language than I could - great and lamentable as has been the increase in our own and other nations\u2019 expenditure for the purpose of armament, yet the percentage of the expenditure to the rest is substantially less in this country than it was thirty years ago. We - and when I say we I mean my colleagues in the Government and myself, every one of them, without exception - we lament as much as any man in this hall this huge diversion all over the world of national wealth into non-productive channels. A Ministry of this country which, out of wantonness or levity, in a spirit of vainglorious rivalry, or of reckless provocation, added as much as a pound to our expenditure upon these purposes would commit a national crime. We cannot plead guilty to that reproach. We are charged with a solemn trust, and in its perform­ance it is our duty to maintain a vigilant watch on what the rest of the nations are doing, and to have always steadily and constantly in view the worldwide interests of which, for the time being, we are the stewards. But you may ask, and ask it rightly - Are these things to go on for ever until by this ever-increasing leakage - for such it is - the material resources for social progress are drained ever drier and more dry?I took the opportunity a fortnight ago, at the Lord Mayor\u2019s banquet, to address a warning and an appeal both to the statesmen and business men of the world. But you may say to me, \u2018Words are well enough, but what is to be done?\u2019 My answer is - and I am neither a rhetorician, as you know, nor a sentimentalist, so I am told, and I am afraid it is true - that nothing can really effectually be done without the co-operation of the Great Powers of the world, brought about by the demands of their peoples. I believe myself that every growing stress and strain of new taxation and of swelling indebtedness may accomplish, may succeed in accomplishing, what philanthropists and idealists have so far failed to do. Speaking for my colleagues and myself, what I say to you is that you may rest assured that we shall seize eagerly every opportunity that we can discover or create to promote a concerted alleviation of the burden and waste which press upon the hopes and aspirations of mankind.The Opposition and Home RuleGentlemen, if you survey our domestic political situation, perhaps its most striking feature at this moment is the unanimity with which our political opponents are pressing for an immediate General Election. For the case which they put forward - I will try to state it fairly - is this: They tell us that a Home Rule Bill, which may and probably will lead to a civil war, is about to be carried, through the automatic operation of the Parliament Act, behind the backs of the British people. \u2018So long,\u2019 they say to us, \u2018as you had a majority independent of the Irish you never took up Home Rule seriously. You deliberately burked it during the whole Parliament of 1906, you only brought it back into your pro­gramme when you needed the Irish vote, and even so when you had made your compact with the Irish you successfully hoodwinked the British electorate and kept them in the dark. Let them now pronounce upon it, and if they are in your favour, we\u2019 - and this is a great concession \u2013 \u2018we will withdraw the countenance which we are now giving the contingent armed rebellion, and if Ulster fights, Ulster will have to fight alone.\u2019 Now, gentlemen, that is the legend which is current. It is seriously put forward, as lately as last week, by speakers of the authority of Lord Lansdowne, and by dint of constant reiteration and industrious circulation, it is probably by this time widely believed. I am, therefore, under the painful necessity of occupying your time for a few moments with a short historical recital of facts which are perfectly familiar to you, and which ought to be equally familiar - and I hope will be tomorrow - to the authors of this singularly audacious myth.Let us go back for a moment to the General Election of 1906. At that time, as we all remember, there was one great dominant issue before the electorate - the issue of Free Trade. The leaders of the Liberal Party, and of all sections of the Liberal Party - feeling that we were standing at a crisis in our national history, when, if the verdict of the electorate went wrong, it was, I won\u2019t say the end, but the most serious menace to our industrial supremacy, and even of our national existence - urged upon the electorate to concentrate entirely upon that point. And we solemnly pledged ourselves before the country that if we obtained a majority in that Parliament, we would not use it for the purpose of carrying Home Rule. That is a simple historical fact. We got a majority, and we are now taunted for not having violated our pledges, and used it for the very purpose which in advance we repudiated. We should have had very good precedent for doing so. Most people here, I suppose, remember the election of 1900, and the patriotic appeals which were then made to Nonconformists and others to sink everything in their determination to present a united front to the enemies of their country and bring the war in South Africa to a successful determination. And what followed? Within two years a Bill was introduced, passed through the House of Commons, passed into law with the connivance, the dumb connivance, of the House of Lords, behind the backs, as we now know, against the will of the vast majority of the electorate of England, completely revolutionising the foundations of our system of national education.When the Referendum was Undreamed ofWe did not use to hear much in those days of the Referendum. I will undertake to say that the average Conservative citizen in 1902 would have been more than surprised if he had been told that this - which he no doubt then regarded as a new-fangled ultra-demo­cratic expedient with a barbarous foreign name - that this in the course of ten years was to become one of the principal arrows in the party quiver of his Tory associates. The Referendum was never dreamed of so long as the House of Lords had its old power unchecked. All Tory legislation could go through, while Liberal legislation could not without any fresh appeal to the people. The result was that, considering ourselves bound in honour to fulfil the pledges we had given, we, in the Parliament of 1906, proposed, as our only legislative measure dealing with the government of Ireland, the Irish Councils Bill - a Bill, in my opinion, of administrative importance, but a Bill which had by the admission alike of friends and opponents left untouched the fundamental underlying problems of Irish government. But we were not content with that. In March, 1908, when that Parliament had been in existence only two years, Mr. Redmond brought forward a motion in the House of Commons to the effect that the solution of the problem of Irish Government could only be attained by giving to the Irish people legislative and executive control of purely Irish affairs, and there was added to it, at the instance of my friend the present Attorney-General, \u2018sub­ject to the supreme authority of the Imperial Parliament.\u2019 That was on the 30th of March, 1908, and this was in the Parliament in which we were supposed to have burked Home Rule, because we were not then dependent upon the Irish vote.A Home Rule Declaration in 1908I spoke on behalf of the Government on that motion. It was almost within a week, certainly within a fortnight of my becoming Prime Minister, but I was speaking in the regrettable absence, through illness, of Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman. I was speaking on behalf of the Cabinet and of the Liberal Party. And I should just like to quote to you two sentences from what I then said. They tell us that we never took up Home Rule until we had become dependent on the Irish vote. We had then a majority of about 200 over any possible combination of all the parties there. This is what I said:'For twenty years, and more than twenty years, I and many of my colleagues have steadily and consistently voted for propositions which, while explicitly safeguarding the supreme authority of the Imperial Parliament, declared that the ultimate solution of the Irish problem could only be found in a system of self-government in regard to local affairs.'From that opinion I have never receded, and I hold it just as strongly tonight as ever I did. And I went on to say, if you will forgive me quoting one more sentence - because these are not my words only, they are the words of the Government - I said:'I have always regarded what is called Home Rule in Ireland as part and parcel - a most urgent part, I agree, in point both of policy and time - of a more comprehensive change. The Constitutional problem is to set free the Imperial Parliament for Imperial affairs, and in matters purely local to rely more and more on local option and local machinery.'\u2018Ireland,\u2019 I added, \u2018is by far the most urgent case because it is the one undeniable failure of British statesmanship.\u2019 Well, gentlemen, that is the kind of language we are using today, and I challenge any critic to discover one hair\u2019s breadth of difference from the policy which, speaking on behalf of my colleagues and the Party, I then declared to be the settled policy of Liberalism, when we were in a majority transcending all parties in the State - to discover one hair\u2019s breadth of difference between the policy then enunciated and the policy we are now seeking to carry into law.Another Declaration in 1910A year afterwards, when the House of Lords had rejected the Budget, we advised the King to dissolve Parliament, and, as you know, another General Election took place in January 1910. I was then leader of the Party and Prime Minister, and I went to the Albert Hall, and at a representative meeting pointed out to them and to my fellow Liberals throughout the country that the Parlia­ment Bill - for it was then only a Bill - was regarded by us, not as an end, but as a means to an end. To what end? The attainment of long-delayed Liberal reforms. I enumerated what seemed to me, and seem to us, to be the principal of those reforms, and, coming to the Irish question, I referred to the speech I have already quoted, and I used these words - \u2018I repeat here tonight\u2019 - it was before the General Election; we still had the unimpaired integrity of the then existing House of Commons and a majority over all the other parties in the State - \u2018I repeat here tonight that the solution of the problem is to be found only in one way - by a policy which, while explicitly safeguarding the supreme authority of the Imperial Parliament, will set up in Ireland a system of full self-government in regard to purely Irish affairs.\u2019 And I added, to make the matter perfectly clear: \u2018For reasons which I believe to be adequate the present Parliament was disabled in advance from proposing any such solution, but in the new House of Commons the hands of the Liberal Government, and of the Liberal majority, will in this matter be entirely free.\u2019 Now, in view of these declarations, is it con­ceivable that anyone who voted even in the General Election of 1910 for the Liberal party, and for the passing of the Parliament Bill, did not do so with a full knowledge that it was our intention to make use of the power which the House of Commons had obtained to grant self-government to Ireland?We had another election in December of the same year. What happened then? I will not go through the familiar tale, but I will just recall to your recollection what was said at the time by Lord Lansdowne. In the course of the strain of that election, Lord Lansdowne, referring to myself, said to a great public meeting: \u2018Mr. Asquith has made it perfectly clear that if the Parliament Bill is carried, the first use of it will be applied in the carrying of Home Rule.\u2019 I wonder what they think the electors were really voting for in 1910? Apparently for a series of referenda or, alter­natively, for a series of general elections. No Ground for Demanding a General ElectionThe facts which I have recited, and which are absolutely beyond the reach of contradiction and dispute, are quite sufficient for my purpose to show that this demand for a General Election, in so far as it is based upon the hypothesis that the electors did not give their votes with a full and complete knowledge that the Home Rule Bill would be introduced upon the lines I then laid down, is one of the idlest demands that was ever put forward. No; there is no ground for demanding a General Election. And if a General Election were held, how much further would it advance matters? Is there anyone in this room or outside it credulous enough and ignorant enough to suppose that that election would be fought or could be fought upon the single issue of Home Rule? What about the Welsh Church? They want a Referendum or a General Election all to itself upon that, for it is perfectly certain that the Welsh Church would be brought into the controversy, and would play as conspicuous a part as the indefatigable advocates of the Welsh Church could persuade the English electors to allow it to do - not perhaps a very serious one.What about Tariff Reform? We have just been told in the most explicit terms by Mr. Bonar Law that if he and his friends are returned to power, although they are precluded for the moment from what is called the full-blown policy, yet they are going to start with a 10 per cent import duty - an average 10 per cent, remember that - upon manufactured goods, the proceeds of which, or some part of the proceeds, are going to be handed over to the farmers to compensate them for not getting their food taxes. Do you suppose you and I are going to allow a General Election to be fought without bringing that up, that we are going to have Tariff Reform or the first stage of Tariff Reform smuggled upon the Statute Book under the disguise of a Home Rule election? It is the right and bounden duty of every elector to take all these things into account, and to remember that under the Constitution in this country - which in this respect I trust will remain unchanged - and of every country which acknowledges the principles of represen­tative government, you send a House of Commons, you send a People\u2019s Chamber, for a term of years to represent you, and make laws for you, and not to be perpetually going back like agents with a limited authority to ask whether or not they may pass these par­ticular laws. I see, then, no ground whatever for this demand for a General Election, and, so far as I am concerned, you may take it from me I shall not advise any such course.The Irish Problem and \u2018Settlement by Consent\u2019Setting aside this plea for a General Election, as neither consti­tutionally necessary nor practically expedient, let me for a few moments approach the much-debated problem, of which you read a great deal in the newspapers, of the possibility of a settlement of the Irish question by consent. There are two points in this con­nection which I wish, in view of constantly recurring misconstructions or misunderstandings, to make perfectly clear. I am sup­posed, as you know, to have had a recent lapse into ambiguity or obscurity of statement. In the first place, if, as is the case, we have shown ourselves ready to consider the possibility of settlement by consent, it is not because we are in any way whatsoever dis­satisfied with the Government of Ireland Bill as it stands. Mr. Birrell said very truly, in a speech I think he made this week, that we do not claim for it verbal inspiration. Like all or most of the products of human intelligence or human energy, it is no doubt susceptible to improvement. If the House of Lords, instead of twice in succession curtly rejecting it on Second Reading, had con­descended to exercise in regard to it the appropriate functions of a Second Chamber in a democratic country - the function, I mean, of revision, of amendment, or of suggestion - it may very well be quite possible that some of the problems which are now exercising men\u2019s minds would by this time have been cleared out of the way.But I am bound to say to you, in view of the things that are said, and apparently believed, that we consider the Government of Ireland Bill to be a well-conceived and carefully constructed measure, with adequate safeguards against anything in the nature of either religious or political persecution. It is specially designed to meet the exceptional historic and economic conditions of Ireland, and we do not say, and we have never contended - I have con­stantly disavowed any such position - that the system which it sets up in Ireland could be applied without substantial modifications to other parts of the United Kingdom. We look upon it as the first and the most urgent step in a process of devolution which will in time set free the Imperial Parliament for purely Imperial concerns, but in each successive step that is taken a similar regard must be paid to the special conditions of the particular constituent part of the United Kingdom with which you are dealing. Devolution is not a merely mechanical problem, and in a country so complex and so varied as ours, if I may use the expression, you cannot standardise Home Rule. That is my first observation.The \u2018Gospel of Anarchy\u2019The next is this: We are not going - I am sure you do not need the assurance - but we are not going to be frightened, or arrested, or deflected in the pursuit of that which we believe to be right and politic by the menace of civil war. It is threats of this kind - I am speaking in all sobriety and seriousness when I say so - coupled and reinforced by hints such as even Lord Lansdowne thought it proper to give the other day of their possible effect on the British Army, which are in my deliberate opinion the most formidable obstacle at this moment to anything in the nature of an agreed settlement. In many of the recent utterances, even of responsible statesmen like Lord Lansdowne, there is expressed or implied what I described some time ago as the whole gospel of anarchy. If, gentlemen, you once lay down that the individual citizen has in his own bosom a dispensing authority which entitles him to offer armed resistance to the law of the land, and, further, that the servants of the State - be they soldiers or police, be they officers or men - may discriminate at will between the binding force of the various orders which from time to time they receive from those above them - I say, and I say it with all solemnity, once accept such a doctrine as that, do not be blind enough to suppose that its application will be confined to a particular case. I hope it is not necessary, and I won\u2019t give possible illustrations which will occur to every one, but I say, by such a doctrine as that, deli­berately put forward by men of responsible authority, you are undermining, both by your arguments and by your example, the very foundations of democratic government and of civil society.And let me add that, great as my respect is for Sir Edward Carson - and I say quite unfeignedly that I believe him to be an absolutely single-minded man - great as my respect is for him, I think I know the British people better than he does. And I say to him, and others who act with him, that such an attitude as I have described is not in the least degree in the long run likely to impress either the imagination or the judgment of my fellow countrymen. You can appeal with confidence to their sense of justice, and with equal confidence to their generosity. You can appeal without hesitation to their common sense, to their hatred of extremes, and to their ingrained political wisdom. But the one appeal to them that is sure to fail is an appeal to their fears. I say once more, as I said the other day at Ladybank, and I repeat it here today in the plainest possible terms, that our attitude - and when I say ours I mean that of the Government, and I believe I may speak for my friends and followers in the party - our attitude in this matter now or hereafter has not been, and will not be affected by a moment\u2019s doubt either as to the duty or as to the power of the State to ensure obedience to the law of the land.The First Essential of a SettlementNow, gentlemen, those two misapprehensions being cleared once and for all, I repeat another thing which I said to my constitu­ents the other day - that in my opinion, which is also that of my colleagues, it is from the point of view both of Ireland and of Great Britain of high importance if such a result can be secured that the new system in Ireland should not start upon the basis of civil strife, with the apparent victory of one section or the apparent defeat of another. It is equally important, again, if it is possible without the sacrifice or surrender of some essential principle, that the de­cision come to should be not, indeed, beyond the reach of amend­ment which subsequent working experience may show to be neces­sary, but it should be regarded, if it be possible, by both sides, and in all quarters, as in substance a settlement, and to repeat the words I used the other day, beyond the risks of electoral and Parliamentary vicissitudes. Otherwise, the Irish question will continue to be the football of our party politics to the infinite injury of both Ireland herself and of the United Kingdom as a whole. It was in that spirit, from a sense of the weight of these considera­tions, that I invited, that I took upon myself to invite, not a con­ference of party leaders nor anything in the nature of formal nego­tiations, but a free and unprejudiced interchange, from all sides, of views and suggestions.The Door Still OpenI have no reason to complain of the spirit in which that invitation was received by, amongst others, the responsible leaders of the Opposition. Suggestive considerations have already come forward from many quarters; though I should be deceiving you, and deceiv­ing myself, if I were to say that I saw at this moment a prospect of agreement. But I cannot at all concur with some of our impatient critics who say that time has been, and is being, wasted. I must, however, take serious exception to such phrases as were used the other night by Mr. Austen Chamberlain in a speech, to the general moderation of which I am anxious to, and do, bear most willing testimony. He is reported to have said that it is not for the Oppo­sition to solve difficulties created by the Government, or to help them out of the dangers they have provoked. Difficulties created and dangers provoked by the Government! Does anyone suppose that if the Government and their plan had never come into existence, or were wiped out of existence tomorrow, the diffi­culties and dangers would not have arisen or would disappear? They are not of our creation. They are the legacy of centuries of misunderstanding and mismanagement. They are the biggest blot on the scutcheon of the British Empire, and until they are met in a large and liberal spirit, Ireland will remain the one hiatus in our Imperial unity - a reproach to our political genius, the unsolved riddle of British statesmanship. We are constantly being pressed by the case of the minority, a case which I have never denied deserves the most careful and sympathetic consideration. But what of the majority? Do you suppose, can anyone suppose, that if their hopes were to be, which God forbid, frustrated on the eve of fruition, if their Constitutional demand were to he indefinitely postponed or mocked by some half-hearted and unsatisfying com­promise, does anyone suppose you would have got rid of the Irish difficulty? But there would remain the difficulty in a form far more menacing and formidable than ever.I entirely agree with one observation that fell the other night from Mr. Bonar Law - that no good could possibly result from any party leaders shouting alternative suggestions from rival platforms. Such a method of procedure is doomed to sterility and failure, and I certainly am not going to take part in anything of the kind. But you will understand, from what I have said, that it shall not be said with truth, either now or hereafter, that my hand has closed any door which opens upon a reasonable and an honour­able way of peace.A Cabinet United and of Fixed PurposeAnd now, gentlemen, before I sit down you will allow me to make a few final observations. The first is this: There is not a shadow of foundation for the statements which have been brought to my notice that in this matter, or indeed in any other, we are a divided Cabinet. The stories which you read do much more credit to the imaginations of those who invent them than to the judgment of those who accept them. We have had a free and frank inter­change of opinions, conducted under the most favourable con­ditions. That is the function of a Cabinet, and in my opinion a function of the highest utility. But there is no difference of opinion among us whatsoever, either as to the present or as to the future. The last thing I wish to say is this - I said it at Ladybank, and I must say it again - we are not going to make, either upon our own initiative or at the suggestion of others, any surrender of principle. We mean to see this thing through. We took up the Irish cause from a conviction which time has strengthened and deepened, that as a matter of right Home Rule was due to Ireland, and as a matter of policy it was sanctioned by the highest interests of our Parliament and our Imperial development. The Irish members, representing the vast majority of the Irish people, have trusted us with a loyalty that has never wavered. For that loyalty we hope to show a worthy counterpart, and that trust we shall most certainly not betray.

aVI am heartily glad to find myself once more here in Bradford, and as the invited guest of our great independent party organisation, the National Liberal Federation. It is almost exactly a year since I addressed your annual meeting in Birmingham. The horizon even then was overclouded, but I think I may say it was brightness itself compared with the outlook, both international and domestic, which we have to confront today.At the General Election of December, 1918, we were told that the problems of reconstruction, both at home and abroad, were of such a character that they could only satisfactorily be faced and solved by retaining and developing the machinery of the Coalition, to which, under the stress and for the purposes, and only for the purposes, of the war we had had to resort. The old party lines were for the time being, perhaps for an indefinite time, to be obliterated; the odd party spirit was to be exorcised as an evil influence until the time to come when the foundations of the New Jerusalem had been well and truly laid.\u2018Credulous Electors\u2019 DeludedThe credulous electors of that day, many of them exercising the vote for the first time - the credulous electors, I say, of that day - were deluded by those plausible sophistries, and they gave a free hand to the Coalition. What was the immediate result?The Irish Constitutional Nationalist Party was swept out of Parliamentary existence. The Free Liberals were reduced to a fragment of our old party representation - reduced to a condition in the House of Commons of impotence in point of numbers, though not, I am glad to say, in any sense impotent in fighting strength. All honour to Sir Donald Maclean and to those who, under his gallant leadership, held the fort in the darkest days of our party fortunes. The majority of the new House of Commons - and that remains the case today - was a Tory majority independent in its single strength of the combined vote of all other sections.The Government, in a word, so far as Parliament was con­cerned, was able to do practically what it liked. That was the immediate result of the General Election, and now, after two years, we are able to take stock of what have been its larger developments.The Financial SituationNow, for the purpose of what I am going to say to you this afternoon, I shall not attempt any general survey of the ground - it is too large and too wide an area to cover in a single speech - but I shall try to concentrate both my and your attention on the two most important, significant, and urgent aspects of the situation which we have reached.First of all, I must say a few words as to our economic and financial condition. I dealt with this matter in some detail in a speech I made two or three weeks ago, but I am going to ask you, for a moment or two, to focus your minds on the salient facts. The expenditure, the gross national expenditure of the country, is in this financial year between five and six times what it was in the year before the war. The taxation which is imposed for the purpose of meeting that expenditure is also between five and six times what it then was per head of the population. The cost of our fighting forces - two years, mind you, after actual or, at any rate, ostensible hostilities have ceased - is between three and four times what it was in the last year of peace before the war.Wasted MillionsThe annual surplus for principal and for interest on the National Debt and funded debt is half as much again as the whole expenditure of the country in the year before the war, and we have a floating debt - a thing then unknown, at any rate insignificant - that remains today after all the fumbling and futile expedients resorted to reduce it, at the appalling total of 1,300 millions sterling.Now, that is a summary of our financial situation. The fact that a large proportion of the increase in our expenditure is due directly, or indirectly, to the necessities of the war and the increased cost of living made two duties more than ever incum­bent upon the stewards of our finances - the Government of the day. What were those duties? The first was rigorously to eschew and repress new and costly adventures, and to accelerate by all practical means the opening out of the markets of the world. The first necessity of mankind when the war came to an end was that the continuous and growing destructive expendi­ture of the years of the war should come decisively and finally to an end.Costly Military AdventuresWhat, in fact, have we done? We have spent the best part of a year in financing, at the hands of the British taxpayer, military adventures in Russia, directed against the Bolshevist Government of that country, which from first to last have cost us certainly not less - I myself think a great deal more - than one hundred millions sterling - pure waste.In Mesopotamia, where we had promised that the Arabs should be established - where we had entered the country as emancipators, pacificators, missionaries for Arab autonomy - in Mesopotamia we have an army which, at this moment, amounts to over 100,000 men; which, when the Estimates were produced to Parliament this year, we were promised should be decreased by one-half, but which in fact - now in November - has been raised by more than one-half. What is it there for? There have been large and terrible casualties, both on the one side and the other. There has been an indefinite expansion and prolongation of our military and semi-military expenditure, and we seem as far as ever - I hope we are not further than ever - from persuad­ing the Arabs that we went there to enable the Arabs to govern themselves.Economic State of Central EuropeTake again the case of Poland. Since hostilities have ceased in that prolonged and disastrous encounter between Poland and Russia, we have not spent much in money - or in life - but that prolonged campaign might, in my opinion, as I have endea­voured to say in the House of Commons and elsewhere, have well been averted. The postponement which has resulted from it of anything in the nature of economic re-establishment and the opening of free markets in the whole of Central Europe, might have been prevented if we had taken the Covenant of the League of Nations to heart, and if we had insisted - as we ought to and could have insisted - if we had made our will and authority felt at the moment, with conscientiousness - in having those matters referred at the first moment to the arbitrament of that great international authority.Some people talk a great deal, but not so much as they did at the General Election, about reparations and indemnities. We all agree that for many of the wrongs which were done - wanton and wicked wrongs - by our late enemies in Belgium, and in the North of France and elsewhere, reparation is needed, and ought to be forthcoming. But there again, if our councils had been presided over by wise and far-seeing statesmanship, we should not have left for months, and indeed now for years, the burden, indefinite in duration and amount, hanging around the necks of those vast populations. We should have fixed the sum; we should have prescribed, I won\u2019t say upon generous, but upon reasonable terms, the length of time over which it was to be extended, and we should have been in a far better position than we are now to get any reparation at all.The Economic BarriersEven more important than that, we ought to have insisted, as we could have insisted from the first, not as a matter of philanthropy or of idealism, but as a matter of pure business, that the economic barriers between all these different countries should be broken down, and that we, and the rest of the world, America and Europe, should - as they might have done twelve months ago - establish a free, unrestricted, unimpeded current of commercial and business intercourse. That is one aspect of the matter, what I might call the external and international aspect.To come nearer home - if those gigantic new obligations which we have incurred were to be met adequately it could be only in one way. We have reached, or very nearly reached, the limit of taxation. We have reached, or very nearly reached, the limit of possible borrowing. And that being the case, every con­sideration of prudence and of business prescribed that we should ruthlessly cut dawn unnecessary domestic expenditure. What have we done in fact?Results of Government ControlI am not going this afternoon into an analysis of detail. We have created new Ministries, we have overstaffed old Ministries - we have an unexampled establishment of persons directly or indirectly in the service of the State. So much so, that at this moment there are, for the purposes of our civil and military administration - I am not talking of soldiers and sailors; I am talking of the actual working administration - there are 90,000 men more in the employ of the State than there were when war broke out.All that results from the continuance - which ceased to be necessary when the conditions of the war had disappeared - continuance of Government control over the industries of the country. And what has been the result? Look around you. Unemployment is growing in every direction. The swollen national expenditure met out of taxation means an increased cost of production, not only of the necessaries of life, but of all the great commodities in which we deal. We have short time - you have it here in Bradford - we know it in all the great industrial centres of the country. The capital which is needed for the maintenance of existing and the development of new industries is not forthcoming. The men who have become accustomed - as they did become accustomed during the war - to trade on borrowed money, find that they are at the end of their tether.Retrenchment a Liberal PlankThey find that credit is drying up, and sooner or later we shall have to face this and to cut our losses. I am not sure if any class in the community is sufficiently impressed with the gravity of that situation, but I am perfectly sure that the Government is not. Look at the Liberal Party in the House of Commons. They are a small and relatively impotent band, and superiority in debate counts for nothing in the Assembly. To sum up this aspect of the matter, the first piece of advice I venture to give to the National Liberal Federation, and to those great organisations throughout the country of which it is the focus and centre, is that they should throw all their energies into this campaign. Make retrenchment, as it was in the old days, one of the great planks of the Liberal platform.The Case of IrelandNow I come to another, and, in my judgment, in some ways an even more urgent aspect of our domestic situation. I refer to the case of Ireland. In the last two years things in Ireland have gone from bad to worse. There was a fateful and - alas! - a decisive moment when a good judgment might have been fruitful of the most beneficent results, but when, unhappily, a bad judgment was taken - I mean the morrow of the report of the Irish Convention. For the first time in the history of our relations with that country there seemed to be a real, genuine, hopeful, even a fruit­ful prospect of reconciliation upon lines of agreement.The Coalition Government, with short-sightedness - nay, I would use a stronger expression, with fatuity - selected that very moment to seek to impose on Ireland compulsory military service. It was no use - it did nothing for the successful prosecution of the war. It was accompanied by a promise of a large measure of extended self-government, and while the coercive proposals took their place on the Statute Book - where they remained a dead letter - that promise of self-government was delayed for months and months, for the best part of two years. When finally an attempt was made to redeem it, it was made in a form which the Irish nation with unanimity repudiated and condemned. What is the situation as regards Irish self-government today?The Home Rule BillThe Home Rule Act of 1914, for the attainment of which we of the Liberal Party suffered exclusion from office and power for years - for which we fought, first under Mr. Gladstone, then under Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, and subsequently under my own leadership, under which we passed the Parliament Act - is now about to be repealed, and for it is to be substituted, as the House of Lords appears to have decided yesterday, a scheme which no one in Ireland demands; for which only last week no single Irish member in the House of Commons - not even those who are members of the Government - could be induced to vote; and under which three-fourths of Ireland, in area and population, are going to be reduced (for everybody knows they will not work it and will not accept it) to the status of a Crown Colony and governed by the official Executive.That shows the worthlessness of what I may call the remedial side of the Coalition policy. Meanwhile, what is going on? Ireland is being given up, has been given up for the best part of six months, to the worst excesses of civil war. The Chief Secretary (Sir Hamar Greenwood) two or three nights ago ended up a speech in defence of the Government policy with this declaration: \u2018The question is, as it appears to me, \u201cWho is for Ireland and the Empire, and who is for the assassins?\u201d\u2019 A more insolent piece of rodomontade never in my memory pro­ceeded from the mouth of any responsible Minister. Who is he? A Liberal? (A Voice: \u2018A coward.\u2019) He is returned, at any rate, as a Liberal for an English constituency. Who is he to say to you and me who are carrying on what he has deserted - the great Gladstonian tradition - who is he to charge us with sympathy with the assassins? The assassins! The assassins - ­ah! Is that a charge which can he made from one side without reflecting on the other?What is the Liberal Attitude? What is the Liberal attitude in regard to this matter? To say that we have any sympathy with, or any disposition to condone the foul and cowardly attacks on the police and the military, such as those which culminated in the brutal murders last Sunday in Dublin - to say that you and I, or those whom we represent in the country, have anything to say, I won\u2019t say in sympathy, but in condonation or extenuation of those acts, is a vile and malignant calumny.We Liberals believe - we who still hold to the old Liberal faith - that these excesses, the more inexcusable they are, the wickeder they are, the more disastrous they are in the results they produce, the more necessary they make it that the Executive, while sparing no effort to detect and to punish the guilty, should keep its own hands scrupulously clean.To suppress, or to attempt to suppress, crime by crime, to retaliate upon murder by murder, to visit the sins of the guilty on the innocent, to make the unoffending and law-abiding pay in life and property for the misdeeds of undetected malefactors, is to substitute vengeance for justice.It is to step down from the judgment seat and to engage in competition with the organs and the ministers of crime. That is a degradation of government against which those who detest crime the most, whatever its motives may be, should be the first and the loudest to protest.The Government and ReprisalsWhat is the Government attitude in regard to this matter of reprisals? I listened to the speech of the Chief Secretary the other night. I should like to see it - I won\u2019t say in extenso, but in substance - circulated by all the Liberal Associations of the country, for it will appear, the more you examine it - whatever lip-service the official exponents and apologists for the Govern­ment policy may offer - in effect they are not only condoning, but they are encouraging a policy of reprisals.I believe, and I am glad to hear that you have had today ­and you could not have had it from a more authoritative source - from my right honourable and learned friend, Sir John Simon - a detailed exposure of what has been taking place. I should like, although it is not my purpose to go into details today, to detail one aspect of the case - what has been done by the forces of the Crown, military and constabulary, in relation to the creameries in Ireland. I have never heard a more astounding defence than that of Sir Hamar Greenwood. He tells us there are 710 creameries in Ireland, and the total number wholly or partially destroyed is only 41. Good heavens! Is not 41 enough? Is it not more than enough?The Police and the CreameriesThey told us only a few weeks ago that there was not a tittle of evidence that the military or police had been engaged in the destruction of a single creamery. It has now been proved and admitted that a fortnight before that statement was made in the House of Commons there were in Dublin Castle, sufficiently well known to be given out to the Press, reports from the police themselves describing in detail the destruction of one or two of these creameries by officers of the Crown. They talk about our information coming from tainted sources. I am sorry to say that there is no more tainted source at this moment than the information that comes from Dublin Castle.We could not have a better illustration of the attitude of mind of the Chief Secretary, which, of course, percolates and conveys itself to his subordinates throughout the length and breadth of Ireland, than the perfectly astounding statement which I heard him make with my own ears: \u2018I can assure you if there is one creamery in Ireland which is a rendezvous of the Irish Republican Army, or one manager a member of that army, that manager and that creamery are in peril.\u2019An Anarchic DoctrineWhat does that mean? It means that if there is but a single manager of one of those creameries suspected of being a Sinn Feiner, or a member of the Republican Army, in the view of the Chief of the Executive in Ireland, without investiga­tion, without evidence, without trial, that creamery is to be subjected to the blind and indiscriminate vengeance and de­struction of the officers of the law. I have never heard, and nobody has ever heard, since England became a free country - not even in the worst days of Lord North or of Lord Sidmouth, the worst days of reaction - we have never heard, I undertake to say, from a Minister of the Crown a doctrine so anarchic and so subversive of the very foundation of government.Well, only two nights ago, I asked the House of Commons, in a motion I made myself, to condemn this policy. We had with us only 83 supporters. I might parody the old rhyme and say, \u2018He is a slave who dare not be in the right with 83.\u2019 But we were only 83 - a disgraceful indication, for the case was an unanswerable case, and the doctrine which the majority must he deemed to have accepted was the doctrine laid down in the passage I have just quoted from the speech of the Chief Secretary.Where Were the Coalition Liberals?We had two Tory Coalition Members with us; all honour to them, but where were the Coalition Liberals, those who were elected as Coalition Liberals? Some had the grace to abstain and hide themselves. Over 70 of them went into the Lobby in opposition to our motion and in support of the doctrines and declarations of the Chief Secretary.If you want to have clear and conclusive proof of the impor­tance of keeping free and independent Liberalism by itself, and rejecting all those more or less plausible, though not very insidious, overtures which go by the name of reconciliation, ask them first these questions: \u2018When and where and in what company did you unlearn the doctrines which are the life-blood of the Liberal faith? What inducement or reason is there for us, as self-respecting politicians, who still believe those doc­trines, who are prepared to maintain them through good and evil report, to join your company and abandon our principles as you have done yours?\u2019I am reminded that there is one honourable friend - my col­league Mr. Johnstone, of Renfrew - who of the whole band alone remained true to the old traditions of Liberalism.The Only RemedyI want to pass from that to ask you this question: Are we to continue to look on exasperated, humiliated, indignant but impotent, at this method of Irish government? Depend upon it, the prospect grows not better but worse every day. There is, in my judgment, as you know, one remedy, and one remedy only - to give to the Irish people the fullest form of self-govern­ment which is compatible with our safety, and the fuller, the ampler and the more unfettered form which that self-govern­ment assumes, the fewer in number and the rarer in occurrence will be the occasions for friction between the Irish Government and ourselves.Remember that you are dealing today in many respects with a new Ireland. It is a different country from what it was 50 years ago, different in many ways from what it was when Gladstone first proposed Home Rule, and carried it on. It is a prosperous country. The present tillers of the soil have been made, by beneficent legislation, owners of their holdings, or potential owners of their holdings. The stream of emigration which for two, and even three, generations after the famine drained away the young manhood of Ireland to America and the Colonies - that stream has been checked.You have in Ireland now, self-contained, staying at home, working on their holdings and in various forms of in­dustry - in these creameries, for instance, and other aspects of the co-operative movement - a body of virile young men, and middle-aged men, such as you see in the best parts of rural England and Scotland. And, side by side with that economic change and distribution of the population, you have seen grow­ing up - through propaganda, partly literary, historical, if you like - a far keener and more intimate sense of nationhood than ever existed in Ireland before. And it is not confined to one class or to one area.The Feeling in IrelandNothing is more remarkable than that through the length and breadth of Ireland, with the exception of a small - important I grant you - almost secluded corner in the North-East of Ulster the feeling of a common nationality, common fraternity, common interests, both historical and actual, is far more wide­spread and deep-seated in Ireland today than it ever was at any period in her history.That is the Ireland you have to deal with. There is no quarrel, except an historical quarrel. Its interests and those of ourselves, economically, socially, commercially, and, indeed, politically, are so absolutely interlaced and interdependent that the very idea of permanent separation is inconceivable and becoming as inconceivable to them as it is to us.It is a country in that situation, with those tendencies con­stantly at work, which has now been so reduced by the follies, fatuities, and misunderstandings and misrepresentations of the so-called statesmen to this appalling condition of tragic civil war.Give Ireland FreedomGive it freedom - freedom upon the largest scale with the fewest irritating restrictions and restraints - and, unless all our reading of history and Liberal traditions and convictions is at fault, freedom will produce there, as elsewhere, its own fruit in reconciliation of the best kind, and in the creation of a new sense of unity and brotherhood.I have put forward, as you know, my own - I will not call it a plan, because it is not a plan - my own outline of the way in which this great task can be accomplished.Dominion Home RuleI would give to Ireland Dominion Home Rule. I would place her on the same footing as the great self-governing Dominions of the Crown. I am glad to think that in putting forward that view I am in complete sympathy with my noble friend Lord Grey. I am speaking here, deliberately, to Liberals, some of whom may have doubts and misgivings. Let us see how far we travel together on the same road.In the first place, we would give to Ireland complete fiscal autonomy, which is denied to her by the Bill of the Government now being foisted on her. In the next place we would give to her the most generous treatment in the adjustment of our relations in regard to finance, to payment and contribution to the Imperial Exchequer. There are great arrears which we owe to Ireland; not perhaps on an accountant\u2019s statement of debtor and creditor, but in point of justice.The Army BogeyAgain, as regards foreign relations, Lord Grey says, as I have said: \u2018Put Ireland on the same footing as all the other Dominions.\u2019 They don\u2019t ask for a separate foreign policy of their own. They do ask, and we would give them and give to Ireland also, a freer and fuller consultation in regard to our Imperial and external relations.         The Army is a bogey, one of the most ridiculous bogeys that has ever been raised in the history of this controversy. The Premier tells us that they might raise an Army of 500,000 men in Ireland. For what purpose? Self-governing Ireland, which has no quarrel with England, to raise an Army of 500,000 men to be a constant menace to us, and expose us to the hazards of conscription! That is midsummer madness.The Question of the NavyWhat is left outstanding? - the question of the Navy. I have said from the first, and I repeat, that I do not believe that any sane Irishmen, apart from those who are avowedly in favour of separation, desire to have a Navy of their own at all. Why should they? It is a grotesque and futile waste of money.Our Dominions we have allowed to have Navies of their own under a very stringent condition, which makes them, in an emergency, part and parcel of the British Navy, subject to the commands of the Admiralty.I quite agree the geographical situation of Ireland - and I am not going to take any risks, as I have said over and over again, any risks of any sort or kind to our strategical security - I agree the geographical situation is different from that of any other Dominion.I am perfectly satisfied - nor would I consent to the application of Dominion Home Rule for Ireland on any other terms - that any navy raised in Ireland should be auxiliary to the Royal Navy and subject to its orders.No Difference with Lord Grey As far as Lord Grey and I are concerned there is, I believe, no difference in our opinions. I want to get all Liberals, if I can, to unite in that view, because as I have told you before, and as I repeat now, it is only by giving to Ireland, or offering to her - it is for her to take or leave, but offering to her - in the fullest and freest sense, the same powers of self-government you have given to all your other Dominions that you can possibly get rid of this secular atmosphere of suspicion and persuade the Irish that you mean in good faith to make that country part and parcel of the British Empire. I hope the members of the National Liberal Federation will take the same view.Liberals should Face the Facts with CourageWhat I want to put to you finally is this. It is a very serious matter. Let us Liberals, of all people, face the full facts of this tragic situation, not concealing from ourselves their gravity - that we ought not to do - not underestimating either the uncer­tainties or the dangers of the future, but let us face that situation with courage in the true temper and spirit of the Liberal faith.We have found in the past in the grant of liberty and the creation of that which goes with liberty, the sense of responsi­bility, the solvent for problems of equal, if not even of greater danger and difficulty.It was never anywhere more necessary to emancipate our­selves from convention, from catchwords, from superficial and time-serving expedients, and get into living contact with realities. Great and growing is the reproach of failure. Great and enduring would be the reward of success.The Strength of LiberalismI have confined what I have to say today to those two topics; but I am glad to recognise in the meetings of your Federation, and in the evidence which comes to me from all parts of the country, a new temper, hope, and indeed a certainty, in the ranks of our party. We have been during these last two years in the trough of the wave, and I cannot express with too much emphasis, or sincerity, my own feeling of admiration and grati­tude for the strength and the vitality which the Liberalism, of the country has shown in that most trying and testing experience.We have seen it proved in many ways, and I think in none - I feel bound to mention it - in none more significant than in the strenuous loyalty to principle and party which has been shown by our agents, who, in spite of the most tempting inducements and allurements, sacrificed their own personal interests in order to remain members of the staff of the great army of Liberalism. All honour to them! And let us, to whatever rank in the army we belong, follow the example which they have so nobly set.\u2018Do not be Daunted\u2019There is nothing to he got by being a Liberal today. It is not a profitable or a remunerative career. There is very little, I can assure you, after a year\u2019s experience, pleasure or advantage to be got by sitting on the side of my right honourable friend, Sir Donald Maclean, night after night, on the Front Opposition Bench of the House of Commons. But if we had the tongues of men and of angels - I am afraid we can hardly claim to have both of them; but if I had the tongue of a man and he the tongue of an angel, in the ears of the people who sit opposite, they would be but as sounding brass and tinkling cymbals. Very little can be done except to keep your end up. With the support of a most valiant band of indomitable colleagues we do our best to maintain the position, but the future lies with you outside.       I make this last appeal to you - not to be daunted, discouraged or damped in spirit by the adverse vicissitudes of party and political fortune in the last two or three years.    The Certainty of the Future  Do not lower your flag. Do not be tempted or led astray by plausible temptations to compromise or adjustment. Maintain - and you never had a better opportunity than on these two issues of economy and Irish self-government, don\u2019t be tempted to flinch for a moment - your hold on those good old Liberal doctrines of retrenchment and self-government. Be assured that, however long the struggle, however varying may be its fortunes, from day to day, or even from year to year, you have the certainty of the future.

aVIt is always a great refreshment to me to come to this annual meeting of the National Liberal Federation wherever it may be held; but it is a special pleasure to come to it today, when it is held in Newcastle, which, in spite of occasional lapses and backslidings, is still regarded as one of the sacred places of Liberalism. Toryism also has its hallowed spots, none, I suppose, more than Liverpool. Liverpool only last week was the scene of a gathering drawn, like this, from chosen delegates throughout England and Wales, but brought together in a very different frame of mind, and for a very different purpose; to avert, if that were possible, or, if that were not-possible, at any rate to postpone, a party split. It was a very instructive spectacle, for the resolution which was proposed, and the amendment which was carried by an overwhelming majority, were respectively an amendment which would have been rejected, and a resolution which would have been adopted, twelve months ago, with enthusiastic unanimity.Dominion Home Rule was then - yes - and much later than then - a dangerous form of political dementia. To rub shoulders with the leaders of the \u2018murder gang\u2019 was an unthink­able form of political contamination. We do not complain of the change. Why should we? It was sudden, no doubt, but to all appearance it has been happily complete. In the twinkling of an eye the Ethiopian has become whiter than snow. There are some people, especially innocent followers of Colonel Gretton and his associates, who are full of surprise, and even of bewilderment, at what has taken place. It only shows that they have either short memories, or a very superficial acquaint­ance with the facts of history.Turncoats and DiehardsThere is nothing new, and there ought to be nothing unex­pected about it. It is a phenomenon which recurs in the history of the Tory Party with the periodicity of a comet or an eclipse. It happened nearly a century ago over Catholic emancipation. Twenty years later it happened again over Protection, when Mr. Disraeli described Sir Robert Peel, the then leader of the Tories, as having caught the Whigs bathing and stolen their clothes. After another twenty years it happened again over Household franchise, when Lord Derby, the Tory Prime Minister of that day with a slight softening down of the metaphor from larceny to chicanery, declared with pride that he and his party had dished the Whigs. It happened again after another twenty years over Free educa­tion, and it was almost overdue when it happened this year over Ireland. People talk as if the Diehards were a latter-day political breed, the birth of the twentieth century. They are nothing of the kind. They have quite an ancient, and even a distinguished pedigree. Mr. Disraeli was a Diehard in 1846, when, with Lord George Bentinck, he led the famous procession of the old Protectionists into the \u2018No\u2019 Lobby when Sir Robert Peel had gone over to the Free Trade camp. The late Lord Salisbury was a Diehard when, in 1867, he denounced Mr. Disraeli\u2019s Reform Bill as a \u2018political betrayal without parallel in our annals.\u2019 In these rapid evolutions of Toryism there is always a rearguard left behind: though I must add, to do them justice, we generally find that in the long run they make up for lost time.The Progressive VarnishI have spoken of what is happening, what we are witness­ing, as characteristic of the Tory Party, for I regret to say that it would he a travesty of the facts to represent that this latest volte-face could be put down to the so-called Liberal wing of the Coalition. We are still in the dark as to a great deal of these recent happenings, but it is clear from Mr. Austen Chamberlain\u2019s declarations that the new and the deciding move did not come from that quarter. Why should it? It was one of their number, a political neighbour of yours, who was Chief Secretary for Ireland, and as Chief Secretary was for months the principal agent, and I agree a clumsy and maladroit, but still the daily official apologist, of a policy which has now been abandoned by his colleagues as an abject and disastrous failure. That policy, the policy of retaliation and reprisals, of answering crime with crime, was a systematic negation of the first principles of Liberalism. Where were the Liberal members of the Coalition, who were put there to give it a varnish - a progressive varnish? Where were they during all that time? What is their record? They stood by, they approved, they defended all that was being done, and I will just read - it is instructive in view of what is happening and the claims that are being made - I will read a passage which ought not to be forgotten. It is a classic in the records of political ineptitude, from a speech made by Sir Hamar Greenwood, Chief Secretary for Ireland, in the House of Commons, as lately as February 21st in the present year. These are the crucial words:'A policy of calculated and brutal arson and murder with all its ghastly consequences remains uncondemned by Mr. de Valera and the Sinn Fein leaders.'He omitted to add that a similar policy remained uncon­demned by the Prime Minister and the leaders of the Coalition.'The authors of that policy hope to terrorise into sub­mission the British people and the British Government. It is the policy of the assassin we are fighting. It is watched by sinister eyes in Great Britain, in Egypt, in India, and throughout the world. Its success would mean the break-up of the Empire and of civilisation. I submit that there are only two alternatives. One is to surrender to the assassins. The other is to fight. I am for fighting the assassins.'How does that sound today? We Liberals are most anxious for the success of this new and, as we think, wise departure. Is there a Liberal here in this great gathering - and I will put the same question to any gathering of Liberals whom I might meet in any part of Great Britain - who does not share my satis­faction that our hands at any rate are clean of all responsibility, that from the first to the last at every step and in every stage we denounced with the same energy and sincerity - yes, and with added indignation - crimes done in the name of the Execu­tive as crimes done in the name of Sinn Fein, and that we insistently pointed out from first to last the more excellent way, that tardily, but now at last is being pursued? I will only say one word about the negotiations which are still going on. I say it on behalf of the Liberal Party. We have not receded from any pledge - certainly I have not - which we have given against the forcible coercion of this Ulster minority. But I repeat, and I ask all Liberals to assent to this, what I said a short time ago at Glasgow - that it is equally true that we are not going to be parties at the instance, or for the sake, of a corner of Ulster, to the coercion of the great mass of the Irish people.Paisley PolicyBut it is not only in relation to Ireland that our criticisms have been justified; and I may add that our policy has been appropriated, apparently without any sense of obligation, and certainly without any expression of gratitude. The Lord Chancellor this week described himself and his colleagues as having \u2018staggered from crisis to crisis\u2019 as though they lied been the hapless victims of hostile fortune. The successive crises - I quite agree with his description - into which they have staggered, and they are not yet over, have been to a large extent crises of their own creation, and what is more, they have staggered into them with their eyes open, and in defiance of the most definite warnings. I have here a little volume - and though I am not an advertising agent of my own compositions, yet having dipped into this during the last two or three days, I am disposed to make an exception in its favour. It was published little less than two years ago, and is entitled \u2018The Paisley Policy,\u2019 and if it ever reaches a second edition I should be disposed to add a second title, \u2018The Coalitionists\u2019 Vade-Mecum.\u2019 I do not claim any copyright in the ideas which are here embodied. In fact, the more they are pirated the better shall be pleased. I am going to use it as an illustration of one or two salient points in regard to the policy of our present rulers.The first thing which the Coalition did, after the electoral period of pledges and professions and promises and perorations, and which it continued to do for two years, was to indulge in an orgy of inflated and misdirected expenditure. A maxim which I believe to be universally true is that public extravagance is the offspring of bad policy and bad management. Both those two factors were here at work. In the first place, we had wild, ill-thought-out, and costly adventures in Russia, in Mesopotamia, denounced as they were in this little volume, and now, after the mischief has been done and the harvest is being gathered in, definitely and almost repentantly abandoned.MesopotamiaI mentioned Mesopotamia, and I should like to recall to life, although I fear it is at present dead and buried in oblivion, another dictum of a prominent member of the Coalition: the date was December 6th, either just before or in the middle of the General Election of 1918. He was defending a policy of annexations, and he used these remarkable and prescient words: \u2018Why should we give up Mesopotamia that is so rich a country that it might almost pay for the war?\u2019 Mesopotamia, inhabited by three millions of people on pretty bad terms with one another, liable to constant incursions and irruptions from the Kurdish tribes, and possessing, if it does possess, a highly speculative and contingent commercial proposition in the shape of oil. Mesopotamia, which has cost us over £100,000,000 - perhaps £120,000,000 - on which, in the pursuit of a belated but prudent recantation, the Government are now adopting exactly the policy which I recommended at Paisley two years ago. That is to say they are retiring our forces and allowing the people to look after themselves, and Mr. Churchill, who has assumed responsibility for these matters, is actually claiming credit in the House of Commons for a reduction of £20,000,000 sterling in the expenditure next year for pursuing that very policy which, if it had been adopted when I recommended it, would have saved the spilling both of blood and treasure.Extravagance At HomeOf course, there is another side, which is of very great prac­tical importance, to this branch of Coalition policy. The gross inflation of our national annual expenditure was due not only to adventures abroad, but to the ruinous and ridiculous exten­sion of bureaucratic control at home. We watched the process. I was not at the first beginnings in the House of Commons, but Sir Donald Maclean was, and with the insight, foresight, and courage which have characterised his conduct during the whole of these years, he at once raised a protest, and he, and I with him, have since renewed the protest at every stage.How were our protests treated? They were brushed aside by the highest authorities, the Prime Minister and the then Chancellor of the Exchequer - I use their own words - as the \u2018rant of party platforms\u2019 and the \u2018screaming of political epileptics.\u2019 Here again we have not had long to wait for our justification.There is a secret conclave set up, superseding both the Cabinet and the House of Commons, presided over, by an irony, by the arch-prodigal, Sir Eric Geddes - it is like appointing Captain Macheath to be head of the police - with instructions that, in Milton\u2019s phrase, like \u2018the blind fury with the abhorred shears,\u2019 they shall hew and slash at the Depart­ments. I await with curiosity, but; I am bound to add, with chastened expectations, the fruit of their labours.For the rest, what has happened? Time has been spent, largely spent, in passing Acts in haste and repealing them at leisure. And during this very session, the session which has just come to a close, when the problem of unemployment was growing month by month more menacing and more urgent, whole weeks were squandered in passing through the Bill which now goes by the name of the Safeguarding of Industries Act, a measure for introducing into our foreign trade a maximum of wanton confusion, friction, and incon­venience, without any compensating advantage to anybody in the world. It is safe to predict, as I predict today, that, whether by repeal or otherwise, it will sooner or later, and sooner rather than later, join the long and weary procession on its way to the scrap-heap.What Liberalism Has DoneIt is the first duty of an Opposition to oppose and to with­stand bad policies, not by mere negations, but by offering better alternatives. That is a duty which, as is proved by the illustrations I have given to you just now, we may claim to have diligently and efficiently discharged. But I am not going to leave it at that. A great party, with a great past, and as it believes, and as I believe, with a great future, has a larger mission than that of mere opposition. What are our credentials for that undertaking? I saw the other day that one of the present Ministers had gone down, I think to Cambridge, explaining to the young men there the fundamental differences between Liberalism and Toryism. He told them that Liberalism was too busy catching votes to do anything for uplifting the life of the people. (A voice: \u2018Hear, hear.) Apparently there are two people, at any rate, who share that opinion here, and I am very glad they are here, because I am going, to reason with them. Let us see. Do not let us take refuge - it is not neces­sary - in ancient history.I will confine myself for two or three minutes to what we have done, or attempted to do, within the memory of all but the youngest in this theatre. Take the seven or eight years which immediately preceded the outbreak of the war. We were engaged in those years in one of the greatest constitutional struggles in our history. We were asserting, and it took a long time to do it, the legislative supremacy of the House of Commons, as against the House of Lords. We went through two General Elections in 1910 on that issue, and as a result we were able to carry the Home Rule Act and the Welsh Disestab­lishment Act. What is more, we made one of the greatest achievements in the free development of our free Empire. We gave a free constitution to our late enemies in South Africa. It was denounced by Tory leaders and the Tory party of the day as a mischievous and even a fatal surrender; and what Liberal did not read with satisfaction, in the report of what took place at Liverpool last week, the manly and honourable recanta­tion of Mr. Austen Chamberlain, speaking, as I hope and believe, not for himself alone, but for all the intelligent opinion of his Party, when he described it - regretting and indeed repenting the attitude he had then assumed - as a great and daring act of political faith which had been abundantly justified?Yes, but that is only half the story. What about uplifting the life of the people? Now -(disturbance in the gallery) - I am coming to my friend there. Here we are closer home. What about uplifting the life of the people? We reduced the National Debt and remitted taxation upon an unprecedented scale. We set up old age pensions. We established a system of National Insurance against ill-health and unemployment. We brought into existence and operation Trade Boards, to deal with the conditions of industry where, through sweating and other circumstances, the workers were unable to protect themselves. We brought in and passed through the House of Commons - it would have passed into law but for the action of the House of Lords - a Licensing Act, which, if it had been now in operation would have been found to solve the great question of temperance in this country.For all these I say we found time in the middle of great constitutional struggles, and when the war broke out in 1914 we had developed, and were about to present to Parliament, a land policy to make the best use of our internal resources, not only as a source of national revenue, though that is a very important aspect of it, but to secure a happier, a better housed, better instructed, and more prosperous population. These are our credentials, and let any party, the Tory Party or any other, produce, if it can, a similar record.What the Liberal Party Would Now DoThat task was suspended necessarily, but only suspended, by the war. It has now to be taken up under conditions which the war has profoundly modified, and in many respects com­pletely transformed. What is the change that the war has brought about? I think I can sum it up in a single sentence. The war, which has impoverished the whole world to an unex­ampled degree, has at the same time intensified the interde­pendence of all its parts. It is a moral as well as an economic interdependence, and as such it finds expression in a new instrument, as we hope, of ever-growing authority, the League of Nations.But look for a moment at the economic side. The impoverishment of which I have spoken takes many forms and degrees. In Russia you see famine and starvation, in Central Europe millions of people still underfed, in France a large devastated area, still only in the early stages of reconstruction; and even in countries like ours and the United States, which escaped the actual ravages of war, unemployment with the unmerited suffering which it brings in its train. No country in these days lives to or for itself, and that is one of the reasons why domestic remedies for unemployment, whether they take the form of relief works, or the much more objectionable form of doles, are a palliative which does not go down to the roots. What is needed is something much deeper and more far-reach­ing than any of these expedients. What is needed is a common effort on the part of all the nations concerned for the economic reconstruction of Europe.There are, as I have indicated more than once during the last three years, indeed over and over again - and I want to repeat them here to my fellow Liberals this afternoon - there are three preliminary steps which are needed to clear the way.In the first place, you must have a complete revision of the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles with regard to reparations and indemnities I put that forward at Paisley. I was then represented as a pro-German, but everybody now knows that we are not going to pay for our ravages and losses in the war by a miraculous influx of German commodities. But even now everybody does not yet understand or realise the difference between Traffic and Tribute. Traffic is a normal condition of free interchange between nations. Tribute is an abnormal disturbing factor, which may he equally injurious to those who receive and to those who pay, and which in the interests of all you ought to eliminate as soon as you can from the international problem. It is a wise reciprocal self-interest which requires the complete revision and the speedy extinction of the policy of reparations and indemnity.The next point is to cancel the Allied indebtedness inter se of the European States. When those two burdens are alleviated, and ultimately gone, the flow of normal international exchange will be set free. And thirdly, and finally, what is almost equally important is the removal of tariff walls. The post-war period has unfortunately seen the setting-up of some new barriers and the raising of others, and we ourselves, by our foolish and short­-sighted Safeguarding of Industries Act, have excited, provoked, and at any rate condoned, what other nations have done.The Choice of PartiesI would like to say one last word particularly to the younger people among you. You have got to choose to which party you will, in the days that are coming upon us, entrust your political allegiance. (Voices: \u2018The Labour Party,\u2019 \u2018The Communist Party.\u2019) No one, least of all my friends up there, can regard this disintegrating and moribund Coalition as a real competitor for your choice. It was born in a fit of delirium. Its life has been spent, as the Lord Chancellor tells us, in staggering from crisis to crisis, and the parties to it, especially the predominant party, some with unconcealed eagerness, others with more or less sombre resignation, are awaiting the day when it will be finally wound up. Let us wipe that off the slate.What about Labour? What is the Labour Party? (A voice: \u2018What is the Liberal Party?\u2019) I have been telling you what the Liberal Party is, and shown you what it has done. What of the Labour Party? Let us come to close quarters with that. It was described the other day, and not, I think, unjustly described, by Lord Robert Cecil - who, whatever he may call himself, is, so far as I can discern, in complete sympathy with us on the vital issues of the day - it was described by him as a Coalition. Yes, it is a Coalition. There are a large number of its members who are pursuing the same ends as ourselves - although not, as I venture to think, by equally practical and efficient means. There are others, not an inconsiderable section, for aught I know they may be the dominant section, who agree neither with us, nor with one another. That is my answer to my friend there who asked me, What about the Labour Party? In fact, the only real bond of union between them - I am going to tell them the truth - the only real bond between these warring and discrepant sections is as my right honourable friend Sir John Simon said, with great truth, I think only a week ago - the only real bond of union between them is a bond of class consciousness. That is what unites the Labour Party.The Liberal Party is not today, it never has been, and so long as I have any connection with it, it never will be, the party of any class, rich or poor, great or small, numerous or sparse in its composition. We are a party of no class. We believe - and that is why I am talking to these young people and asking them to consider these matters in the light of history and of reason - the Liberal Party believes - it is the essence of its creed, both at home and in international affairs - as I am never tired of repeating - the Liberal Party believes that the good of each is to be found, and to be found only, in the good of all. It excludes no one who is at one with it on that fundamental principle which ought to govern our public policy. It invites their co-operation. It will welcome their association in its counsels and in its work, but upon those principles it admits of no compromise. In the course now of a long public career it has been my fortune to be at the head, at one time and indeed for a long time, of an army of many legions, which could command victory both at the poll and in the House of Commons, and which, as I have shown you, used its strength to carry out its principles. I am now at the head, so far as the House of Commons is concerned, of a handful, insignificant or relatively insignificant in numbers, but supported by a vast and a growing body of opinion which, as we have seen during these three years, with all its Parliamentary disadvantages, can bend and break the policy of the Coalition. I believe, then, as firmly and as fervently as I ever did, in the persistence and the indomitable vitality of our creed. I have spent in its allegiance, without pause and without deviation, all the years of my political life, and for whatever length of days may be allotted to me, I shall persevere in the same faith to the end.

aVIt is a great gratification to me to find myself face to face with a really representative gathering of the Liberalism of the country, and to have side by side with me on this platform, with one or two exceptions, all the surviving colleagues with whom I fought in the long and strenuous struggle from 1908 to 1916. We miss indeed the venerable figure of Lord Bryce, one of the most accomplished and gifted of our public men and of our writers - one who never deviated by a hair\u2019s breadth from the Liberalism which he had adopted, not as a tradition or an inheritance, but as the result of a profound study of history and of the reasoned convictions of a highly endowed intelligence. Only two or three days ago I received from him a letter, written with all his old, and it seemed to me then his youthful, vigour, in which, being heavily engaged as he was on some literary work in the country, he expressed his regret that he could not be with us tonight and his hearty and complete sympathy with the objects of this meeting.Welcome to Lord GreyIt is a peculiar pleasure to me to welcome here on behalf of the whole Liberal Party a statesman to whom it owes an immeasurable debt of gratitude, and whom physical disability alone has kept for some time past out of our fighting ranks. Lord Grey is almost my oldest political friend. We have sat together and worked together, and shared responsibilities which few can imagine together, during more than thirty-five years, and casting my memory back on the past I cannot remember that we ever had a serious difference that lasted more than a quarter of an hour. You all know that he brings with him not only a sane and finely balanced judgment, but the resources of an unrivalled experience in the conduct of international affairs.When the history of this time comes to be written, the record of Lord Grey as a peacemaker will stand out. For the best part of ten years, in the precarious and ever-menacing conditions of the international situation, he kept the peace of Europe, and it was no fault of his that the peace was ultimately broken. The return of such a man to our public life - I do not speak of it from the party point of view; Lord Grey is something much more than a party politician - the return of such a man at such a moment as this is the restoration to us of a national asset of incalculable value.The AbsenteesI said a moment ago that as I surveyed the ranks of my old colleagues there were one or two, not many, notable absentees. (A voice \u2018For ever, I hope.\u2019) They have been engaged, in the course of last week, addressing an audience. Of what elements it was composed, whence it came, and how it was recruited, I confess I do not know. That it had any claim of any sort to represent the Liberal rank and file is, of course, a transparent fiction. I am told that out of some 400 repre­sentative and freely elected Liberal organisations in England, not less than 320 have openly declared themselves with us. It is difficult to realise it now, but these gentlemen a very few years ago were in the forefront fighting with us for the land taxes, and facing with us two successive General Elections in a single year in order to assert the supremacy of the House of Commons and to secure the passing into law of such great constitutional changes as Home Rule and Welsh Dis­establishment. The land taxes, where are they? Under a Coalition Government they have been wiped off the Statute Book, and the Parliament Act itself appears to be in considerable danger. I am not, as you know, fond of personal references in politics, but there is not one of these men, or, I may add, of the majority of those whose names are known to me who sat beside them last week on this platform, from whom in those days and much later I have not received professions of devoted loyalty and even of affection.I have not changed, Liberal principles have not changed, and yet the Prime Minister thought it seemly on Saturday to indulge in a number of personal gibes directed against myself. I am not going to quote them because it is just the sort of stuff some of us can remember in the General Election of 1910 in the leaflets and broadsheets of the less scrupulous of the Tory candidates, and these stale jocularities are brought again to life by my old colleague and fellow-fighter in those days, now the Prime Minister of England, and are reported to have been received with appreciative laughter by those repre­sentative Liberal delegates. I am sorry for my old friend. I am too old and perhaps too disillusioned to look for anything like gratitude in politics, nor, unhappily, is it possible to teach some people good taste and good manners.The General ElectionAt the time when this meeting was summoned there was a widespread belief that we were going to be plunged into a February General Election. I see the Prime Minister asks with indignant and ingenuous amazement, \u2018Who started all this?\u2019 and he assures us that he did not. Then who did? Someone must have done. It was not a case of what the naturalists call spontaneous generation. At any rate, the kite was vigorously flown with the benediction, if not with the manipulation, of the Prime Minister\u2019s well-known hench­men in the Press and elsewhere.And after floating for a week or two in what the poet calls the azure deeps of the air, and dominating the whole political horizon, it came down with a heavy bump. The odd thing is no one is bold enough to claim any property in the frag­ments. You remember the old nursery rhyme, \u2018Who killed Cock Robin? I, said the sparrow.\u2019 We know well who played the part of the sparrow. My old friend Sir George Younger - unlike the whippers-in of the phantasmal delegates who were in this place last week - is the master of many legions. When the kite was soaring at its highest I was asked by some of my political friends for my own forecast. I said I thought there would be no election, and I will confide to you that I even went so far as to back my own opinion. I do not want to compromise anybody\u2019s character but my own, and so I will not hint with whom the transaction took place.\u2018A General Election,\u2019 I said - and it turns out I was right \u2013 \u2018at this moment would, of course, be a profligate political gamble in which grave national interests would be subordinated to personal and to party necessities.\u2019 That would not be decisive. There was another consideration, which was it would split the Coalition into fragments and would justify a coroner\u2019s verdict of felo de se. I said then, and I say again today, that we Free Liberals can afford to regard a dissolution whenever it comes with the most perfect equanimity. No word of protest came, or will come, from us. We have no interest and no desire to delay by a single day the national assize upon the Coalition.Coalition ClaimsSpeeches, intended, I presume, for Liberal consumption, at the meeting last week were all directed to prove that the Coalition Liberals had been justified by events in being in the Coalition, and - so long as their presence is tolerated - in remaining there. I want to examine this claim. By way of illustration we will take one or two crucial matters in the domestic sphere. Take these two crucial instances - things about which they are pluming themselves most at the present moment - Ireland and retrenchment. Their claim, when we come to analyse it, amounts to this - that in both cases they are now doing under the stress of circumstances - under electoral necessity, actual or contingent - things which they might have done, which they could have done, which they ought to have done two or three years ago, and what is even more important, to the doing of which they have by their own policy or want of policy them­selves interposed the most formidable obstacle.They are now in search of a motto, or, indeed, of a series of mottoes. The Prime Minister has found one in the New Testament; the Attorney-General, as befits a subordinate member of the Government, takes a lower, a more modest course, and pro­poses to appropriate to the Coalition the time-honoured Liberal formula - peace, retrenchment, and reform. If the Coalition could live on mottoes, how happy its state would be. Un­fortunately, in this sublunary world, a party has got not only to live on mottoes, but to live up to them. Let us see what title they have to the inheritance of the oldest of Liberal watchwords. They are all lyrical, and even dithyrambic, over the Irish settle­ment. No one has more reason than we have to rejoice over the Irish settlement. No one welcomes more heartily the agreement, which is published today, between the North and the South. I myself have been urging for more than two years - and particularly from the moment the truce was called and the hideous civil war ended and real negotiations began - that we free Liberals should give the most cordial and open encouragement to such negotiations; and we have not said one word from first to last that would embarrass their conduct or prejudice their success.But what were the Coalition doing in Ireland fifteen months, twelve months, even nine months ago? Where were they - the Hewarts, the Fishers, the Churchills, and the Liberal Prime Minister - when the Liberal Chief Secretary was letting loose his Black and Tans in their retaliatory campaign of arson and out­rage? Did they ever raise a finger of resistance? No. For what we know they were dumb, except when they turned on the stream of their eloquence in the denunciation of Dominion Home Rule. And when the Prime Minister came forward - we now know from Mr. Chamberlain\u2019s public announcement - it was not they, it was the leader of the Unionist wing in the Cabinet who pointed out to the Prime Minister the necessity of kennelling the dogs of war and coming into free and open parley with the leaders of the \u2018assassins.\u2019It is better to be converted late than not to be converted at all, but to claim that this is a triumph for men who now repre­sent themselves as following in the footsteps of, and carrying on the traditions of, Mr. Gladstone is nothing short of a piece of political effrontery.I could tell you if time permitted some things in regard to retrenchment. We are all now, so the Prime Minister tells us, ruthless economists - economists of what and applied to what? In a large part to the profligate expenditure which in an impoverished and devastated world they themselves have since the war - not during the war - created, to develop inflated wild indulgences and costly, vast, top-heavy, lop-sided and hopelessly incompetent bureaucratic experiments at home. They are all abandoned now, all on the scrapheap; though when Sir Donald Maclean and I were denouncing them we were derided - and it is only two years ago - for epileptic screaming and economic rant. Now, when it is to a large extent too late, comes the pure cream of the Coalition milk. Now, do not let me be mis­understood. I do not in the least object to policies wise and sound which I and others have advocated being borrowed or even stolen, as they have been, in regard to Ireland, to retrench­ment, to a large though still undefined degree in regard to reparations and indemnities.I have no disposition to cry \u2018Stop thief!\u2019 and send for the police, but when these people having nakedly and openly appropriated the only means for removing the difficulties which their own policy has created or aggravated - when they ask the world to ignore their past and to acclaim, as the Prime Minister does, the Heaven-sent wisdom of their belated resort to common sense, they are, I think, imposing too heavy a tax on the presumed ignorance and credulity of the British people.Free TradeI will apply one more criterion to the claim of these old associates of ours that they are upholding in the Coalition the Liberal banner of peace, retrenchment, and reform. I speak, as you will readily guess, of Free Trade. It is very amusing to a cynical observer to read the way in which they have handled in their public speeches the Safeguarding of Industries Act. They all speak of it today with bated breath and in perfunctory and apologetic parentheses. It happens to be one of the very few legislative measures of the Coalition which remains, which has not been repealed altogether or completely eviscerated. The Prime Minister described it as a temporary measure to meet abnormal conditions - a totally inaccurate description, as a study of its provisions would have shown him, and he somewhat faintly advanced the ridiculous pretext, the falsity of which has been repeatedly exposed by Lord Crewe and myself, that it is in some way countenanced by the Paris Resolutions. Sir Gordon Hewart tells us that the Act is an unsatisfactory measure and that he is an uncompromising and unrepentant Free-trader. I am going to suggest what President Wilson used to call an acid test.At the next election, a question which the electors ought to put to every one of these Coalition Liberals who supported that Bill is: \u2018Are you prepared to vote for the immediate and unconditional repeal of the Safeguarding of Industries Act?\u2019 I am not familiar with the intricacies of the Attorney-General\u2019s conscience, but some of those candidates will say \u2018Yes.\u2019 It will be their only way of making a pretence of Liberalism upon the platform. But it is too late. The mischief is done. The industries of this country in a number of small, but not un­important, cases are embarrassed, hindered, and penalised every week and every month because this Act is upon the Statute Book, to which, if those gentlemen had acted upon their real convictions, it never would, and never could, have found its way.StabilityMr. Churchill, in a verbose treatise on things in general delivered here last week, late in his discourse got hold of an illuminating idea, or, at any rate, of what he conceived to be a captivating caption. What was it? \u2018Stability!\u2019 He repeated many times that stability is a great boon which has been brought to us by the Coalition Administration. Let us look at it. We had a great Education Bill from Mr. Fisher which has now been rendered administratively largely nugatory in many parts of it. The housing policy of the unfortunate Dr. Addison has been thrown with its author to the wolves. The Agriculture Act which was to revive rural England by guaranteeing prices to the farmer and establishing minimum wages for the labourer - what has become of it? It was repealed within six months of its enactment.Stability! There have been at least three different, distinct, and irreconcilable policies with regard to coal, and finally - though that does not exhaust the list - the Ministry of Trans­port with its vast staff of salaried thinkers, who as a result of prolonged and secluded meditations were to give us cheap and uniform transport - after a short and costly life - is now in liquidation. That is a pretty good catalogue of the variety of ways in which the Coalition Government may give the country the benefits of stability. These are hard, incontrovertible facts, worth tons of rhetoric and cataracts of sentiment. In face of them, what is the use of the Prime Minister and others reiterating platitudes about the evils of party strife and the need of national unity?No Administration that ever existed - certainly no Adminis­tration that ever played ducks and drakes as this has done with the fortunes of the Empire - has been less embarrassed by factions and party strife than this Coalition. I myself have been constantly reproached by my friends - good, candid friends - for over-tenderness to them. What this country needs is not the extinction or suspension of party - necessary as it was in the war. What the country needs is good government. Not a Government by spasms and zigzags, not a Government of expedients and experiments - coercing Ireland one day, and the next conceding all her claims, indulging for two years in costly adventures, and then bowing the knee and the neck in abject servility to the blows of the Geddes axe. Real Govern­ment, a Government that the country can trust, and which is a fitting trustee of the country\u2019s fortunes - such a Government you cannot get from a Coalition. What the country needs, almost as much as an Administration with steady and coherent principles, is a vigilant and well-organised Opposition - to assist, to criticise, and, sacrilegious as the idea seems to Mr. Lloyd George and his friends, even in case of need to oppose.Get Rid of the Coalition\u2018Measures, not men,\u2019 Sir Gordon Hewart described as an old Liberal doctrine. Where does he get it? Do you know its origin and history? It was invented in the reign of George III by a little knot of corrupt place-hunting politicians who went by the name of \u2018King\u2019s friends,\u2019 and whose one object was to destroy the Whig Party, and, if they could, to overthrow the Constitution. I will read from Burke\u2019s famous tract on \u2018Present Discontents.\u2019 He says: \u2018It is an advantage to all narrow wisdom and narrow morals that their maxims have a plausible air, and on a cursory view appear equal to first principles. They are light and portable, they are as current as copper coin, and they are at least as useful to the worst as to the best. Of this stamp is the cant of not men, but measures.\u2019Our position, at any rate, is perfectly clear. We believe that the need of the country is to get rid of the Coalition. We are as eager as any organisation for peace and the restoration of international confidence. We are for free trade, the cutting down of tariffs, the opening up of markets, the curtailment of unproductive expenditure, the consequent possible reduction of taxation, and a drastic policy of disarmament. We had an industrial policy outlined at Newcastle the other day which we believe will be far more effective in securing the real interests of the co-partners in industry than any amount of barking and baying at the spectre of Socialism. We desire to see, and we are indeed pledged to attempt, a better constituted Second Chamber; but whatever changes may be made in its composi­tion its functions must be so defined as to make it abundantly and absolutely clear, that it is not to be allowed to usurp the authority of the directly elected representatives of the people. What we want is to see a definite policy - a policy upon settled lines, pursued by men of real conviction, worthy of the tradi­tion and imbued with the spirit of the great Liberals of the past.

aVLast year, that optimistic prophet and calculator, Sir. Sidney Webb, told you from this chair that by 1926 the Labour Party would have a majority and be in office. We cheered, but, I am sure, as we cheered; we doubted. Had he told you that he had made a calculation or had had a vision that within seven months of his addressing you your representatives in Parliament would form the Government, and that the next time you would be called together the Chairman\u2019s address would be delivered by a Prime Minister and the front chairs on the platform occupied by heads of Departments your comments, I am sure, would have been of the nature of \u2018Poor old Webb,\u2019 and in the evening you would has filled your glasses to drink to his memory. And yet that apparently insane miracle has happened. As a matter of fact it was one of the most likely of things to follow an election whenever it came.Progress in Spite of HumbugMr. Baldwin precipitated the events by a miscalculation of the strength of his Party and of Protection, and dissolved Parliament. A hurried union of the divided Liberal force followed. Although we were the official Opposition at the time, throughout the critical part of the election the Press seemed to have conspired to say the very minimum about us. Our meetings were hardly reported. When the success of our campaign became disquieting and some notice had to be taken of us, you will remember that false reporting became the rule and forecasts of the most discouraging kind appeared from our constituencies. spite of such a campaign, with all its loud speakers, lobster tin cans, and the mobilisation of all the humbug that could be brought together to deceive the electors, we won 47 seats, and brought our representation from 144 to 191, truly a satisfactory achievement gained almost exclusively owing to the confidence we had earned whilst acting as the responsible Opposition. There is some comfort in the assurance thus given to us that there is a fixed limit to the influence of tricky conspiracies and resourceful demagogues.The Conservative Party was well under half the House of Commons; we came next with a clear lead over the Liberals. No coalition was possible; the Labour Party, if it thought it desirable to take office, must; under the circumstances, very soon have had a chance of taking office.When the opportunity came, so far as I was concerned I never had a moment's hesitation as to what we should do. To have shirked responsibility would have been cowardly, and this country does not like cowards; it would have put us into a bad Parliamentary fix. Altogether it would have shown the spirit of shivering fear rather than that of trustful gallantry and the latter is the spirit of the Labour Party.The Need for Firm FoundationsBut there was another call also in the situation. We honestly believed that the country was in bad hands and that its policy was not well directed. Could we manage to do something to mould national policy in new shapes? Some things we should like to do we saw quite plainly we could not do, and in these we had to face boldly a little disappointment amongst our own people and a violent attack from the other parties. But, my friends, let there be no doubt about this. To ask a party to undergo the discipline and the loyalty of confessing that it has not been able to create or command the power and the conditions necessary for success on this great issue and on that, to get our rank and file to understand that the bigger and more enduring the structure the greater is the preparation required for laying its foundations and for beginning it, that, my friends, is essential to the gathering together of a movement that will not be blown hither and thither by every fair or troublesome wind.British Labour Gives the Lead   Other things we thought we could do. We believed that the very fact of our existence would have an encouraging influence upon movements and political ideals similar to ours all over the world. We believed that we could make our country stand for something inspiring and attractive to the other nations. We had no hope of a new world created by magic. We had hope of the old world beginning to show a response to a new creative spirit. I think we have succeeded in that.Some of our work had to be frankly patchwork. Problems like unemployment, an essential feature in the economic system and one that was aggravated by the political, financial and industrial disturbances of the war, and perhaps even more by the hot-headed follies of the peace, present an intricate system of adjustments that have to be dealt with in detail, involving labour, thought, experiment and change in supporting opinion.Tory NeglectFor real constructive work practically no preparation had been made by our predecessors, whose assumption seemed to have been that, after a few years \u2013 I think they generally thought months \u2013 of relief work, conditions would become normal. Thus it was that relief work, which ought to be employed as a reserve by men striving to effect economic changes, was used by our opponents as a fund to be exhausted whilst they were whistling for the change of wind, and they did not get it. We came in when the reserve was getting pretty low down, and obviously whilst we turned to consider the best schemes for reconstruction we had to see to it that the relief work reserve was added to and used economically, whilst the Insurance Funds were better adapted to the needs of the unemployed. A cure for unemployment is not yet, but I can claim that no Government has done more than this, under such unprecedented conditions, to alleviate the hard lot of the victims of unemployment.Housing Problem SolvedSo with housing. Again we found a policy being pursued, the benefits of which directly affected only a stratum of our people either at the top of the wage-earning classes or even above that. To that we offer no opposition. None whatever. The professional man in a small way and the whole class of people with modestly good incomes have a right to be housed, but that alone leaves untouched the great mass of wage-earners whose incomes are low and intermittent. They had been left out of account because the problem of how to house them is by far and away the most difficult part of the housing shortage to solve. There again we have brought new ideas to our assistance, and not merely more money. A combination of capital and labour, an organisation of the whole trade for the service of the community, is the most promising industrial development that has taken place in recent years, under Government influence. I appeal to every section to make it a success. The machinery may have to be adjusted, adapted and re-adapted. Rome was not built in a day, as the homely proverb runs, but the possibilities and evolution of Mr. Wheatley\u2019s expedient are unlimited.The People\u2019s BudgetIn national finance we have been doing equally distinctive work. A Budget, which took 6d. off Income Tax and a 1d. off beer, was followed by one of ours which took 1¼d. off a pound of sugar and 3d. to 4d. off tea, and put £30,000,000 into the pockets of the consumers of the country, and whilst it did that it took other burdens off the backs of the middle classes. That is business, and the next Labour Budget will carry on this good work. That reflection is, perhaps, the real explanation of our present difficulties. A second Labour Budget would jeopardise the lives of the two other parties.In a different field the Government has also been striving against very troublesome forces.When we took office I determined to take upon my own back a double burden, not that I was unmindful of the weakness of human flesh or ignorant of the weight and the worry I was taking upon myself, but I was convinced that if our country was to pull its full weight the authority of the Premiership would have to be cast into the same scale as that of the Foreign Secretaryship. So I made my will and took up my burdens, leaving one of those burdens, and that a very considerable one, on the capable shoulders of Mr. Clynes. The circumstances which called for this were exceptional; national interests asked for it, and we responded. What was the situation?Out of the Old RutsThe world was steadily falling back into the old ruts of alliance and pact, and force and its organisation, without the nations being made fully aware of what was happening, were creeping back into the minds of statesmen as, the only bulwark upon which they could lean for security. We found waiting for us a draft Treaty of Mutual Guarantee, in some ways a great advance on what had none before, marked in several of its provisions by the hand of men who undoubtedly had laboured hard and sincerely for peace, but yet a great menace to the League of Nations, and essentially a war preparation document. By persistent propaganda and pressure the question of national security had become exclusively one of armed force. Young nations born in the war, old nations exhausted by the war, were beginning to look round and in the sky of each they saw a cloud of menace, set there mostly by their own hands.The Psychology of PeaceOnce international policy was determined by that psychology, then farewell to peace; then limitation of armaments is nothing but an easement of burdens of taxation, it is not a measure of peace. Peace is something different from a mere limitation in preparation for war. Peace is not an interlude of apparent quiet in a germinating war policy. Peace has its own natural policy and organisation, its own method of handling questions, its own mentality, its own standards of justice, of right and of wrong. We came in just at the moment when the future was being settled. In that future alone we shall be able to see with what measure of success our work has been attended. A good fight has been put up, but we must scrutinise with almost meticulous care every proposal that is being made lest the germs of the old-world minds of militarism cling to them, for these germs will destroy them if they are there. We are not to be rushed. This is a job which has to be done in an efficient and workmanlike way, and it has to be done bit by bit as the nations find increasing security in a ruling justice. Of this I am sure. The work of the Labour Dele­gation at Geneva last month may give pride to all the men and women who, longing for the security of peace, have joined the Labour Party in search of it. Sometimes when I see the facts from the inside, I am never quite sure whether I should be indignant with the chicanery or wild with the ignorance of people who imagine that the war has left us in the position we were in before it broke out, and that all we have got to do is to wait for it to drift back into the old condition.The Problem of ReparationsIn all this unmaking and remaking of Europe - and, indeed, of the whole world - there is involved a disquieting upsetting of old trade conditions. To this natural dislocation has been added the purely gratuitous one of Reparations imposed in such ways as to show sublime ignorance of, the most elementary facts of economics. This error has been woven so closely into the peace settlement that no Government can, by employing the simple method of a pair of scissors, return to a sound position, either for itself or for the rest of the world. We were fortunate in that the Experts\u2019 Report gave us an opportunity of creating a machinery of control which I hope will in the end bring us back to wisdom. But meantime we must pass through some troubled waters before we get out of our present conditions, which we inherited from the war and the peacemakers.Punishing Ourselves by Punishing GermanyOur method of punishing Germany has, as a matter of simple fact contributed to her efficiency as a competitor, whilst it has weakened ourselves; and we must face for some time the pressure of Germany as an exporter. Our predecessors wasted valuable years after the armistice either in pursuing policies that were short-sighted or in doing nothing to direct our industry and to save our people. I know as a matter of fact that they were warned again and again by, friends both at home and abroad of what was coming, but all that happened was that the Tariff Reformer enjoyed some facilities to tinker with legislation. Mr. Baldwin with commendable courage - whatever the result may have been to his party - did produce his nostrum. It was no good. He said it was his only cure, but he has now dropped it. For ourselves we have asked the guidance of some of the most repre­sentative business men and workers - the two sides equally efficiently represented - and we shall be vigilant in protecting our interests.The Great DangerThe greatest danger to the industrial life of a nation is conservatism - the state of mind which has done far more damage to our agricultural interests than even the English climate - and with conservatism I put indolence, and the aim of Socialism is to get at the hearts of men, because we cannot survive unless we discover how to produce the willing worker and not merely the man who toils for reward. We have been too long thinking and speaking as though the spirit of artistic production was different in kind from the spirit required for manual production. Those of us who drank early from the refreshing springs which William Morris made to flow in a dull and deadening generation never held that heresy and never will. Men live by their generosities, by their loyalties; not by their interests, and their self-regarding impulses. And until somehow or other, by a change of heart and of condition, or both, we can put our industry on the footing of the willing gift of service, we shall have nothing but quarrels and the sacrifice of the common weal. It is the aim of getting our industry on that footing, that is the aim of the Socialist inspiration that gives us power in our Labour Movement.I Am No CommunistFor that reason I am no Communist. Pettifogging conspiracy, secret associations, backstair wire-pulling, mischievous stirring up of strife are neither in method nor in ideal the Socialism that has built up our Labour Party. They were detestable to our honoured founders like Hardie and Morris. They respected opinions with which they did not agree, but they kept them at arms\u2019 length. When they had enemies they preferred to have them outside, rather than open the door to have them inside. Never was it more necessary for our Labour .Movement to raise as its own flag the banner of democracy, of freedom, of progress by reason and of condemnation of tyranny by power. The war has threatened to make the world safe for dictatorships, for conspiracy, for mischief, for force coercing both the bodies and the minds of men. Unless we are prepared to engage upon a crusade against that, we had better put up our shutters and declare that we have wearied in well-doing. Communism, as we know it has nothing practical in common with us. It is a product of Czarism and war mentality, and as such we have nothing in common with it.The Only Way to PeaceThe only practical policy that could be adopted under these circumstances in order to try and bring peace on the one hand and create natural conditions of work on the other was to take Europe just as we found it with all its engagements and arrangements, and begin from what we found to straighten out point after point, one after another. That has been our aim. For instance, had Labour been at Paris, Reparations would have been very different from that they are, but the general agreement of the nations - Germany included - now is to accept the Experts\u2019 Report and see how it is to work, watching its effects almost from day to day and being prepared by the systems of arbitration and checks provided by the London Conference and the Report itself, to adjust expectations to facts. It is very sad that you have got to teach leading statesmen theoretical economics through the pockets of other people. I wish it were their own pockets that were bearing the financial consequences of their mistakes and blunders that you unfortunately are bearing. Against one thing I would warn the Movement. The German employers are using the fact that these Reparations have to be paid as a reason for reducing the wages, increasing the hours, and intensifying the slavery of the German workers. Whatever may be the ill effects of the Experts\u2019 Report, that is certainly not one of them, and I hope that the Labour Movement in this and in other countries will not be induced to fall into the trap thus laid for them and lend their countenance to one of the ordinary excuses which capitalism is always seeking to increase its grip on the lives of the workers.The Common MenaceThe whole Trade Union Movement of the World is morally bound to support German Trade Unions struggling to recover lost ground, for so long as the deterioration in social conditions in Germany which followed the Micum Agreement and the occupation of the Ruhr in particular lasts, low industrial standards will be a common menace not only to the political tranquillity of Central Europe, but to the standards of life of every competing country. So far as I know, every International Labour Organisation has passed resolutions asking for a trial to be given to the Experts\u2019 Report, and that has been the attitude of the Labour Government in this country.Recognising RussiaIn pursuance of the Government\u2019s policy of pacification, we recognised the Government of Russia because it is the Government of Russia, for exactly the same reason that Christian Foreign Secretaries have recognised Mohammedans and people whose religious persuasions were of somewhat more doubtful quality even than that. If my colleagues and my friends are to be accused of being Bolsheviks because we recognised Russia, of what an infinity of crimes and misdemeanours is my predecessor in office - the pre-eminently respectable Marquis Curzon - to be accused for having come to an agreement with Turkey. Immediately after the recognition of the Russian Government we proceeded to negotiate Treaties which would regularise our relations. The results are before the country now, and, as there was ample evidence whilst the negotiations were still proceeding, there are interests in the country prepared in the most bitter way to sacrifice every national concern for themselves.Lloyd George\u2019s Short MemorySometimes I have time to read speeches. I am now getting into the habit of making an opportunity, whatever the difficulties may be, of reading the speeches of those who are opposed to the Russian Treaty, and the reason is this. When I went into Downing Street, I was unable to take any novels and light literature with me. I was half way through an old Scotch novel, and in the course of a week or two I had finished it ,and then I was stranded. I used to have to go to bed with no preparation for sleep beyond a dip into Hansard or some Blue Book or something of that kind, and the result was that the strain upon my moral character was getting excessive. Then the Russian Treaties came out. Then the speeches against them began to be delivered, and then I had an ample supply of the literature of which I had been so long deprived. I hope Mr. Lloyd George is going on. It would be a great grief to me if his speech of last night were the last of its kind.The Need for Calm ReasonBut seriously, at a time when calm reason should be enlisted, if the country is to recover its feet, we hate the spectacle of wild endeavours to overwhelm opinion in earthquakes and tidal waves of heaving ignorant emotionalism. The destructive Plutos of society - not us, but respectable people, bankers like Mr. Grenfell and so on - shake the earth by scare headings, false news, and wild ravings, and whoever wishes to help the State by reflective common sense and reasonable endeavour is encompassed in mad upheavals of fear and passion. The criticisms on the Treaties have gone through various stages of perfervid excitement and no suggestion yet of calm examination. That perhaps, will come when we get them into operation, and no more sobering exercise could be undertaken by you than to turn up files of newspapers for the last two months and see the fluctuating and contradictory arguments and statements that have gone to upset public opinion.Mob Passion or the Public WillThey seek to turn popular government into the rule of mob passion rather than that of the public will. Men for a time overwhelmed in that have an uncanny habit of returning again in increased strength. Malignity and ignorance are the life, not the death, of what they attack. I refer to the stunt performances, not to certain criticisms made by the better type of journalists; but it is quite evident that so far as the other two parties are concerned, their one interest regarding the Russian Treaties is to prevent us from doing the work that the nation - and especially the working classes - requires. In so far as the Treaties come short of a really satisfactory settlement, that is due to the fact that the blunders and escapades of our predecessors still hang like poison clouds over all our endeavours. They may be wrecked, and then in years to come a troubled and out-manoeuvred nation will reflect with regret upon that, as it now reflects upon Denikin decorations, Koltchak calamities and Archangel asininities.The Dignity of GovernmentFor some days now the political situation has been causing us some little concern. When Mr. Asquith made that first speech of his after the Election, at the National Liberal Club, both my colleagues and myself took it as a plain intimation that if and when we took office we should have to eat out of his hand. Men who have any right to hold high State offices must, from their very nature, resent and repudiate such a relationship. That speech, unfor­tunately, settled for good the relations between us, and was the beginning of a policy which has been unwinding its unworthy course ever since then. Its latest phase demands a definite stand on our part. They have decided to have an election in three weeks, if they can force it. In preparation for it they are laying their traps, and when I saw in the newspapers this morning, and especially the Liberal Press, the shaking of heads about an election I really wondered did they think that all their readers were fools: There has been a trumped up stunt about the dropping of a certain Prosecution. What a chance for a worry! What a chance for a humiliation! What a chance for the wiles of a pettifogging lawyer!The Country Wants Our WorkEveryone knows that the country wishes us to go on with our work and not disturb and distract it yet with an election. We are perfectly willing to do our best - perfectly willing. We have never sought a rupture. We are not seeking it now. But the nation has never respected a Government without spirit or self-respect. The nation does not ask us to go on with our work under conditions that would lower the dignity of future Governments and cheapen the whole conception of the Cabinet. Every watchful person knows that we are in the midst of work -which cannot be interrupted except to the grave disadvantage of the nation, but which at the same time cannot be carried on except by men whose authority, in the eyes of the foreigner and of our own people, is respected by Parliament. If the challenge came on large issues, very well no one could complain - the Government least of all. But every member of any Government who has held office since the Irish troubles just before the war knows that if our Government had done everything of which it has been accused regarding this prosecution it could seek justification in what its predecessors have done.Satan Condemning SinSatan reproving sin! That is totally inadequate. Reproving! Why, it is Satan pretending to condemn sin, and to be the judge of the sin; after he himself has lived a sinful life through eternal years. If this were a mere disconnected blunder, a mere disconnected unfortunate incident, that, of course, would be no cause for anything more. But it is not that, and every man and woman who goes into the lobby for us or against us tomorrow knows perfectly well that it is not that. Every man and woman who refers to this question in the country may use words to deceive the electors, but if they tell the truth that is in themselves, they know it is not that. It is part of a scheme which in three weeks\u2019 time is designed to force a humiliated Government to the country. That is the situation. There is a dishonesty, an obliqueness, in the whole business. The Conservatives have a straightforward motion of censure down. I hear they are going to run away from it and vote against it. They are so afraid of us. To kill 192 needs all the wits and wiles and elastic conscience of 423. One of the most enjoyable spectacles to be witnessed would be, if I am spared till tomorrow night, to see the Conservatives running away from their vote of censure.Why an Election?But we understand a vote of censure, however. That we understand. That is straight fighting, though the poor victimised nation may well want to know what really is the occasion for it. How many Tory Governments would have survived votes of censure properly passed upon them for wire-pulling the law in their own governmental and party interests? I am not at all sure, however, that this is not a vote of censure caused by the shadow of our success upon their partisan prospects. The amendment, which in its form and origin must be treated equally as a vote of censure, is conceived in the spirit of medieval crookedness and torture. The Government is not to be censured. It is only to be insulted. It is not to be executed; it is, in the words of one of the Liberal papers, to be put on the rack. It is to be suspended as you suspend one of your clerks when suspected of a misdemeanour. You tell him to go away till the end of the week until you have inquired into it. At the end of that time, without hearing what he has to say about himself, you decide whether he is going to be discharged. It is to be suspended, as it were whilst a packed committee, consisting of seven sworn opponents and three defenders - none of whom can come from our front bench, whilst the other front benches can choose their strongest partisans - are to have a roving commission of injudicial inquiry, and are to report in censure on the Government - for I know the document is already drawn up - and then this is going to be published, with a minority report signed by our three members, on the eve of the election, which then they will force on some other issue.How the Plan WorksThis is how the plan works. Tomorrow night seven men out of ten to be appointed will go into the lobby condemning us, and the next day they will be appointed as judges to consider our case impartially.Our opponents are to pretend on the one hand that no election is required, and that we should go on with our work, at the same time as they rob us of the virtue of respect and lay us open to a charge, which it is their game to make at the end of this week, that when our usefulness as a Government has been destroyed we are mean-spirited enough to cling to office after we had received our death wound. If we go, they will pretend that we have caused the election; if we stay, they will accuse us of being limpets on £5,000 a year. They propose to drive us into the jails of their Inquisition, whilst the special pleaders and the executioners at their leisure prepare the biased indictment, the rack and the block. What a gorgeous game!Liberal Party\u2019s Grave ErrorBy this little manoeuvre we are to go down, and the fortunes of the Liberal Party are to be restored. They mistake their men. It. remains to be seen if the inheritance of principle and tradition, which still retain for the Liberal Party the allegiance of many worthy people, is to regard small tactics as Liberal principle and partisanship as Liberal, tradition. It also remains to be seen how the decently minded members of the Conservative Party will relish being made tools of in this kind of strategy by opponents whom they profess to hold in contempt. But before this Conference is over we shall know what the Fates have in store for us. Depend upon this - we shall surrender nothing of the rights of a Government. If there be an election, the responsibility is not ours. It will be caused by partisan abuse of Parliamentary votes, and the resentment against this chicanery, which will be in the heart of every Labour supporter in the country, will make our victories all the more numerous when the country is allowed to judge our work. Some fresh, clean fighting in the constituencies may clear the air and give us strength in the House of Commons which will make us independent of partisan interest.Attack!I hope that in its deliberations the Conference will remember what is at stake, that it will guard with special vigilance the spirit and the principles of our Movement, and when it is time for it to dissolve, the thousand men and women here gathered together will return to their posts and sleep in their armour until the word is given forth that the Labour Party is to take the field, not to defend itself, but to attack its enemies.

aVLORD OXFORD, who was very enthusiastically received, said that since he last had the honour of addressing the annual gathering of the Federation at Brighton last year a great change had taken place in the apparent distribution and still more in the Parliamentary representation of political parties. Incidentally he was one of the victims of the change. He thought it his duty to accept the gracious invitation of the Sovereign as offering him the best and probably the only effective opportunity of still serv­ing, for such time as might remain, his party and the State. What was much more important than this merely personal mat­ter, the Liberal representation in the House of Commons had been during the same year reduced from over 150 to less than 50 - a grotesque travesty, as they all knew, of the real electoral facts, and of many condemnations perhaps the most striking and com­plete in our time of our existing representative system. The redress of this dangerous abuse and the reconstruction of our electoral machinery, the defects in which made its recurrence pos­sible, was a reform of vital and even of primary urgency in the interests not merely of the Liberal party, but in the best interests of democratic government itself.Though, as they were grateful to know, the Liberal Party in the present Parliament was a dominant, and even a predominant, factor in debate, they could make no effective protest in the divi­sion lobby.  He earnestly trusted that the National Liberal Federa­tion, in all its units and branches, would not be slow or slack in organising the great forces to which it appealed to bring to the earliest possible end that caricature of democracy.The BudgetAt the last election people thought the country was going to secure some of Mr. Bonar Law\u2019s ideal of stabilised tranquillity, but those who imagined that politics were about to be reduced, for a time at any rate, to the commonplace and the humdrum, must have already realised that they were living in a fool\u2019s para­dise. \u2018I spoke of tranquillity,\u2019 continued Lord Oxford. \u2018Would it have been possible, apart from the introduction of a general tariff - which is for the time barred, or at any rate deferred, by election pledges - to have devised in a Budget any taxation more provocative in itself and more unwarranted by our situation than Mr. Churchill\u2019s new duties? I call them his. One set are his own progeny, and the other set are a little group of cast-off children whom he has adopted into his family.'Referring to the new miscalled McKenna duties and the new tax on silk, Lord Oxford said he would not labour the topic; it would be slaying the slain - unnecessary and almost vindictive cruelty. It was a monstrous thing for the Chancellor of the Exchequer to play this game of battledore and shuttlecock, because it unsettled trade. It was fatal to what was all important to our fiscal system - stability. To take industries like these and single them out from all other industries of the country for specially protective treatment was not a thing they would have expected from a Free Trade Chancellor.The Silk DutiesWith regard to the duty on silk, he could only say, with the fullest deliberation and with some small knowledge derived from experience of national finance, that he could net conceive an import duty possessing more vices. It was a tax on raw materials, and it was not only discouraging the growth of trade, but in­directly it would, if carried into law, have a very damaging effect on the whole of the textile industries of Great Britain. It was always the case when they began with one trade they would find half-a-dozen other trades were involved. It would further, by increasing the cost of articles, hamper our British manufacturers in competition with foreign producers in the extraneous markets of the world.Lord Oxford proceeded to inquire what was the need for the duties in question. The need, or the supposed need, he said, was because it was necessary to balance the Budget. That meant in plain language because it was necessary to provide money to meet expenditure. The capital figures involved in those duties were something like three million pounds in one case and seven million pounds in the other. Even if they could be realised, those figures were comparatively insignificant in these days.Our National ExpenditureWhat was far more important was the scale of the national expenditure. It was to meet that expenditure that the best part of seven hundred million pounds was to be exacted this year from the taxpayers of this country. That meant a gigantic de­pletion of the resources which would otherwise have been avail­able for the replacement and extension of capital, for the de­velopment of existing and of new industries, and - what was of vital importance to us at this moment - for a shrinkage in the ranks of unemployment.He wished to impress upon his fellow Liberals that what was needed in these days was not new taxation. \u2018The taxation we have got is hard enough to bear, and niggling expedients are nothing to the point. I say in all earnestness there is only one way of escape from our financial difficulties and dangers, and that is not by imposing taxation, but by cutting down expendi­ture.\u2019Lord Oxford described the expenditure on the Singapore base as panic-stricken. Singapore, he said, was turned down by the Labour Government, but even it succumbed to the construction of cruisers.The Pensions SchemeTurning to the Government\u2019s proposals for extending the pensions system, Lord Oxford said that Liberals had no hostility to the extension and completion of the pensions system. It was their system in every one of its branches. It was devised by Liberal statesmen and carried out by Liberal Houses of Commons. Why, therefore, should they be hostile?In the first glace he thought widows\u2019 pensions ought to be confined to widows with dependent children, but when they came to dependent children and orphan children he thought the scale proposed in the Government Bill was quite inadequate. He further thought it was open to grave doubt - perhaps more than doubt - whether the provision should cease at the age of 14. Certainly there was a strong case for continuing it to 16 if they were satisfied that during those two years the child was attending a really approved and recognised educational institution.The scheme was on a contributory basis, but for the time being to impose a fresh burden on industry was a very serious matter, and he should be quite prepared to accept a temporary abeyance of contribution and that the scheme should for the time being be financed by the State.The Country\u2019s NeedIt appeared to him that for the moment their problem as a party was twofold. In the first place it was to seek out and to discharge their function not of a Liberal Government, but of a Liberal Opposition. In the second place it was to prepare the electorate, by propaganda, by organisation, by ceaseless and well-combined work in the constituencies, to replace a Liberal Govern­ment in power and to give to that Government the strength to renew its suspended and interrupted tasks of whole-hearted Liberal policy.Therein lay the supreme and capital importance of building up their Million Fund. The immediate practical problem was to work for the reduction of every unnecessary and unproductive item in our national expenditure; next to resist at every stage any attempt, avowed or veiled, to foster British trade by the spurious stimulant and the impoverishing devices of Protection.The primary need at this moment was the revival of our ex­port trade. It could never be revived by crippling and curtailing exports.\u2018Piecemeal Protection is just as noxious as piecemeal Social­ism,\u2019 concluded Lord Oxford. \u2018Away with them both, and pre­serve for the country the freedom which it has won so dearly in every department, and not least in the department of industry - the freedom which is won so dearly, and which is the only enduring safeguard either for the wealth or for the happiness of our people.\u2019

aV\u2018It seems but a short time since we met at Brighton - and how much has happened since then - and this meeting comes most opportunely to enable me to meet the workers of our party gathered together in this beautiful town from all corners of the kingdom to give an account to you of our stewardship in the Govern­ment, to hear from you at first hand the result of your deliberations, embodying as they do the new ideas, the new ambitions, and the new aspirations of our great party.\u2019 What the Government had done during the last year formed a remarkable record, in the face of the unparalleled diffi­culties with which they had been faced. Dealing first with foreign policy, the Premier said the entry of Germany into the League of Nations, together with the ratification of the Locarno Treaty, had set the seal upon a great work, the first stages of which were actually in progress when they met last year. By that Treaty the principal nations of Europe, collectively and severally, guaranteed the inviolability of the frontiers between Germany and France, and Germany and Belgium, a con­summation which he regarded as a signal triumph for British diplomacy. He thought the Conference would share the pride of himself and his colleagues in the achieve­ments of the Foreign Secretary, and in the part which the representatives of this country had played in the promotion of peace in Europe.Falsified Predictions\u2018A year ago, you will remember,\u2019 he continued, \u2018we were vigorously attacked for our foreign policy towards Turkey. We were told we were leading the country into a disastrous war and the conduct of diplo­matic relations in the Near East was no longer safe in our hands. We knew the value to place upon such criticism. I tried a year ago to allay your fears, which I do not think were very great. (Laugh­ter.) We proceeded undisturbed in the policy we had laid down. What was the result? The Treaty of Angora was signed by the Turkish Government in June; rati­fications were exchanged in July. They will shortly be registered with the League of Nations. Our policy has been com­pletely successful. (Cheers.) We have succeeded in putting an end to the disturbed relations with Turkey that have existed ever since the conclusion of the war.\u2019In other spheres of foreign policy the administration of the Government had been no less successful. \u2018We have made satisfactory arrangements with France and Italy about their debts on terms which we believe, in all the circumstances, to be just, and the first payments have already been made.\u2019 (Cheers.)The only anxiety, perhaps, at the moment lay in the Far East, in China, where our interests had been wantonly damaged by some of the insurgent ele­ments in that disturbed country. \u2018But in consequence of the firm attitude adopted by the Government I trust our difficulties are in a fair way to solution - (cheers) - though I think it necessary to add that although we shall in no whit depart from our policy of conciliation and patience with China, we shall not hesitate to take whatever steps may be necessary to pro­tect the lives and property of our fellow countrymen.\u2019 (Cheers.)Imperial ConferenceHeavy Programme to be FacedTurning to Imperial affairs, the Pre­mier said: The most important event is the forthcoming Imperial Conference, which will begin on the 19th of the present month. It is a matter of profound satis­faction that the Prime Ministers of all the Dominions should have found it possible to attend in London, and I should like to add that the action whereby all parties in Canada, immediately after the General Election, have united to facilitate the presence of Mr. Mackenzie King is, to my mind, a remarkable illustration of that spirit by which all over the Empire endeavour is now made to place the interests of the Empire above the interests of local party politics.Empire FilmsThe work of the Conference will, as in past years, be heavy. It will include a general review of foreign policy, of de­fence, and of the questions to which these subjects give rise. Consideration will be given to the development and improvement of the system of communication and consultation between the Governments of the Empire on matters of importance and com­mon concern. I will not detail to you the other subjects which will come under review, but, of course, attention will have to be paid to the pressing question of over­seas settlement and inter-Imperial trade­ - (cheers) - including the work of the Econo­mic Conference of the Empire, Marketing Board, communications, which will include the work of the Imperial Shipping Commit­tee, and the question of Imperial air ser­vices. Then there come questions of research and a very important question, the exhibition in the Empire of Empire films. (Cheers.)We for our part shall enter the Confer­ence with one single object in view - to pro­mote to the utmost of our power wise development on the political side, consis­tent progress on the economic side and the relation between these many communi­ties which together make up the British Empire.Agricultural PolicySchemes Delayed By Labour DisputesComing to agriculture, which he termed a difficult subject, Mr. Baldwin said he thought it was well to spend a few minutes in considering the solid achievements, not spectacular, of the Government, and con­tinued: We made it clear at the beginning of this year that we are not prepared to lend ourselves to any kind of fantastic experiments. The industry has suffered enough from Government experiments during the last few years, and we have to remember that experiments, which involve large public expenditure, must necessarily be postponed, as I shall have occasion to show later, by the events which have taken place during this year.The system of subsidies, which was tried on so large a scale by the Coalition Government, failed, and I think the farmers have not forgotten their experience.We are definitely opposed as a Government to any form of compulsory control of cultivation by committees or by officials.It is contrary to the instincts and the traditions of our people, who naturally, and I venture to think rightly, prefer to manage their own business in their own way. (Hear, hear.) In the words of the White Paper, which we published early in the year, the right course in the best interests of the industry and of the nation is to proceed on the line of education and encouragement, rather than of coercion, to endeavour to create that confidence which is essential for progress, to stimu­late private enterprise, to assist those engaged in the industry to organise them­selves on an economic basis, and to protect them from the dislocation or the reversal of policy and from rash proposals which would impair progress and breed inse­curity.Practical AchievementsI know that is not the kind of policy which will commend itself to the Liberal party or the Labour party, but I would like to give you, by way of illustration, some of the practical things that we have done and are doing to help that indus­try. It is our policy to undertake reforms, some of them matters of detail, for which there is a genuine demand. They are very often matters of a technical char­acter, so that they may not be appreciated by the general public at their proper value, but that is of little consequence if we can give the agricultural community what they want. I would like just to mention, what many of you know, how much the Government has been helped by the Agricultural Committee of the party in the House of Commons, under the able chairmanship of my old friend, Sir George Courthope.We have made provision in the estimates for near three-quarters of a million in aid of agricultural education and research, and it is a great satisfaction to know that every year the advantages of scientific fanning are being better known and appre­ciated all over the country. A serious attempt has been made to improve the condition and the character of a great deal of water-logged and ill-drained land, which remains in this country, and a sum of £1,000,000, to be spent over five years, is being provided for grants in aid to ap­proved schemes carried out by statutory drainage authorities, and an Act has been passed to increase the powers of the County Councils for dealing with small drainage problems.Rating ReliefThe Rating and Valuation Act, passed at the close of last year, not only gave permanent relief to agricultural land to the extent of three-quarters of its rateable value, but for the first time in England and Wales provides that the farm build­ings, which are in effect part of the ordi­nary work and equipment of the farmer, shall be assessed on the same basis, a con­cession which, I believe, is much appre­ciated, and will afford material help. Some relief in rates has been given in rural dis­tricts by grants in aid. For this purpose £1,400,000 has been given this year from the Road Fund, which, as you know, de­rives its funds in turn from the proceeds of motor taxation.The policy of the Government in developing the growth of the new rural in­dustry, that of sugar beet, is meeting with great success in various parts of the country. Nine factories were working last winter, and four more are expected to start this autumn, and the acreage under culti­vation is already about 125,000 acres.I should like to mention two or three comparatively small Acts, just to show you the extent of the ground which has been covered in a year, both busy in the ordinary work of Parliament, and perhaps more full of anxiety and difficult problems for solution than any year in recent times. The Seeds Amendment Act will secure for the farmer that the potatoes he buys for seed purposes are true to description and variety. The Markets and Fairs Weigh­ing of Cattle Act secures for the farmer fair play in the sale of cattle, by providing that fat cattle must be weighed in market before sale. The Diseases of Animals Act enables the Government to pay compensa­tion for the slaughter of cattle suffering from the worst form of tuberculosis, and over 18,000 affected cattle have been elimi­nated from our herds within the last twelve months.Bills before ParliamentThe Horticultural Produce Sales and Provisions Bill will provide that commis­sion salesmen shall render proper accounts of their transactions, showing the prices they received for goods entrusted to them for sale, a measure which, I believe, all farmers and growers of market produce will find of great value.The Fertilisers and Foodstuffs Bill will protect farmers against fraud in the periods of fertilisation, where, as you know, it is difficult to detect fraud without expert analysis.There are two other measures before Parliament which will be carried into law in this year, the Smallholders\u2019 and Allotments Bill, which sets up a new system of smallholdings on the basis of ownership by fair annual instalments over a period of years. This Bill is of great importance to labour, because for the first time in a measure of this kind, its terms are applic­able to copyholding. Upon the same prin­ciple the labourer will acquire freehold, upon payment in annual instalments.The other Bill is the Merchandise Marks Bill. It is intended that all imported goods and agricultural products shall be labelled with the country of origin, and for the first time the public will be in a position to know whether they are really buying British or foreign goods.The crux of the agricultural position, of course, is the question of prices, and, as the experience of other countries shows, the farmers\u2019 hope of better prices lies mainly in improved methods of marketing. Like other businessmen they must organise their selling scientifically and study the requirements of the markets. The investigations carried out by the Minister of Agriculture are pointing the way. It remains for the farmers them­selves to take action on the lines suggested.The Empire Markets Board so realises the importance of this that they have granted the sum of £40,000 for further in­quiries into the marketing of home-grown produce, and I hope from that sum good and practical results may ensue.Housing ProgressBeginning to Catch Up the ArrearsA closely allied subject, one that touches the people throughout the country, is the question of housing - the policy of the Government in regard to housing, under the able administration of Mr. Neville Chamberlain. (Cheers.) As this question has baffled every Government since the war, I think here we may take a little credit to ourselves for what has been done. Not only are sufficient houses being built to meet the normal growth of the population, but at last we are beginning to catch up the arrears.I will give you one little illustration, which may be familiar to you, to give you an idea of what is being done. Since the Armistice there have been more houses built throughout the country than the whole of the private dwellings in Leeds, Sheffield, Birmingham, and Manchester put together. (Cheers.) What is more satisfactory is that the progress under Mr. Chamberlain\u2019s Act has been achieved at comparatively low cost to the Exchequer. Under his Act each house costs £6 a year to the State for twenty years, whereas, under the Socialist Act of 1924, the cost to the Exchequer is £9 a year for forty years, and under Dr. Addison\u2019s scheme £41 a year, of which a substantial part will con­tinue for sixty years. (Laughter.) During the twelve months ended on March 31 last, nearly three times as many houses of all classes were completed as the annual average for the three years before the war, and the greater progress continues to increase.I think, therefore, we may say, not only that success has attended the Government\u2019s efforts, but that the promises we gave on this subject at the general election have been literally and faithfully fulfilled. (Cheers.)In addition to that, you may have noticed a modest Bill introduced just before the recess to meet special cases of housing in agricultural districts, the need of which has never been adequately met by the out­put of houses under the Housing Acts. In many districts there is a serious shortage of cottages at a rent within the reach of the labourer, and, owing to the high cost of building, owners of estates are unable to provide all the cottages required on their land. On the other hand, much can be done by alteration and improvement of existing houses so as to bring them up to modern standards. The purpose of the Bill is to assist holders of agricultural land to undertake this work themselves. The operation of the Bill is strictly limited to cottages for bona fide farm workers. (Cheers.)Help to LeaseholdersA matter that might be of interest to business firms and shopkeepers in large towns and which deserves serious ex­amination, is the question of leasehold reform. Complaints are frequently made by tenants. For example, it not infre­quently happens that substantial improve­ment of the property made at the expense of the tenant passes to the landlord at the end of the term without payment to the tenant of any compensation. Sometimes a considerable business grows up in particular premises; during a lease. A valuable goodwill is created which is liable to be destroyed on the expiry of the lease if a renewal cannot be obtained on reasonable terms.This subject is one which bristles with difficulties, because ill-advised legislation might easily do more harm than good. We must be certain that any legislation proposed will not bring into existence greater evils than those which prevail. There are causes of legitimate grievance, and we are at present engaged in examining where it is possible to amend the law to meet those cases in which there is genuine need for reform. (Cheers.)Although I have tried to take you over very briefly the whole field of our activities during the last year, I don\u2019t think I ought to go further without reminding you that the contributory pensions scheme, which was passed into law in the first year of our office, is now in operation, and is working smoothly. Payments in respect of claims on the part of widows and orphans already cover more than 400,000 persons. In January of the year after next nearly half a million men and women between 65 and 70 will become entitled to old age pensions. A. very con­siderable degree of co-ordination has been secured in the administration of health and unemployment schemes. As a direct consequence of the passing of the Act, the calls on the poor law relief have been reduced by more than two millions a year.Security to the WorkerI think it is very important to remember this: that while the social services pro­vided by the State are today of an exten­sive character, they are at the same time consistent with the encouragement of thrift and forethought. Our party has always recognised the immense importance of maintaining these qualities, and therein, I think, lies one of the great distinctions between us and our political opponents. It is the consistent aim to offer such assistance from the State as is legitimate, and is within its economic resources without impairing the independence of the recipient.By their various schemes the Government hope to complete the security for the worker, security which will be mainly won by his own efforts, by his own self-sacrifice, though it will be substantially assisted by the help of employers and from the State.Cheap ElectricityOne word about a measure which shortly, I hope, will become law - the Electricity Bill. In view of misconceptions which seem still to prevail in some quarters, it is very desirable to explain that the Bill does not provide for nationalisation, nor is the State undertaking the supply of electricity. Owing to the parochial line upon which electricity has grown up in this country, Great Britain is far behind her competitors in the production of cheaply-generated elec­tricity, and, in consequence, its use for power purposes is far less than half of what it should be when you look at what has been accomplished in foreign countries.By the Bill, generating stations will be developed on the most suitable sites and on the most efficient lines, and will he linked up all over the country. The saving in capital charges and through the im­proved load factor will, I hope, enable current to be supplied to authorised undertakings at less than half the average present cost, and at a lower price than even the best installation can produce today.Careful provision is made in the Bill that the benefit of cheap generation shall be passed on to the consumer. The expert advisers, who have made a detached examination, assure the Government that the saving in capital expenditure during the next few years will be more than sufficient to pay for the whole cost of the transmission lines, and at the end of that period the annual saving in cost of gener­ating will be approximately £11,000,000 a year.Naturally, the amount spread over a vast multitude of consumers only means a small benefit to the individual, but the result of the benefit to the community at large is very great; and the reduction in costs should lead to a great extension in the use of electricity in industry, and render it possible to supply many rural districts which are at present outside the area of supply.I think that the broad outline which I have given you of achievements and of purposes is one which, without any undue complacency, we may feel proud.General StrikeSocialist Leaders\u2019 Lack of CourageI have only to mention the handicaps from which our efforts during the past year have suffered, and the setback, on which I shall say some words, the setback which social progress has received from the pro­tracted dispute in the coal industry and from the upheaval caused by the General Strike. The one, unhappily, is still with us, but, as regards the other, the time that has elapsed since its termination en­ables us to review it without passion, and I am glad to see that you have been in your Conference addressing your minds to some of the problems which it raised.Since the Great War no such threat has been made to the British community. (Hear, hear.) Nor did the war itself threaten in the same way the institutions upon which the life of our Commonwealth is based. (Cheers.) There are those of its apologists who would have us believe that this was a strike like any other strike, hav­ing economic ends in view; as if, indeed, the stoppage of a nation\u2019s life and the dis­location of its industry would add one penny to the miners\u2019 wages if that strike had lasted to the crack of doom. (Cheers.)But whatever may be urged on behalf of the economic character, the logic of that strike is plain. Had it been successful, it would have over-ridden the constituted Government of the country, and the will of the community as there represented, and brought to an end our Parliamentary institutions. It so happens that the people of this country are profoundly attached to their Parliamentary institu­tions - (cheers) - institutions which are the very child of the nation. When Kings came into collision with Parliament, it was the Kings who felt the shock and not Parliament. The genius of Oliver Crom­well only made a fugitive indent in the system, which he was able to suspend for a short period. He passed, and Parlia­mentary institutions remained. Can it be thought that the institutions of centuries, which have resisted assault from the highest quarters, assaults from men of genius, are going to fall down and collapse before such an attack as they were subject to last spring?What at the moment of that crisis was the attitude of the Parliamentary Labour Party, His Majesty\u2019s Opposition? There were men among them who, for a space, had formed His Majesty\u2019s Government, who had experience of government, the experience of the responsibilities of Parlia­ment to the people, and who had the wit to understand what the challenge meant, the challenge of the General Strike, to Parliamentary institutions.No Public ProtestI confess I was never more disappointed than at the lack of statesmanship and, still more, at the lack of courage. Though not responsible for calling the General Strike, they were nevertheless silent at a moment when courage on their part might have saved thousands of their followers from being led astray, and might have saved the country from the experiences of that unhappy experiment.There is a responsibility which rests on His Majesty\u2019s Opposition, as the alternative Government of the country, and I am con­fident that the country has taken note that the leaders of that party raised not a single word in protest in public, whatever their feelings in private, upon this challenge to the State, and at this time of crisis they were unequal to their responsibility.They had an opportunity to show that they stood for law and order in this coun­try, and to speak out boldly as their duty bade them. And what contribution did they make? Sectional criticism in the House of Commons, and bitter speeches in the country.The threat which the General Strike offered was one which the Government - or any Government - was bound to resist, and the spontaneous reaction of the com­munity was such as to win the reluctant admiration of the whole world. (Cheers.) Those who called the strike learned their theories abroad, but the material with which they had to work was British, and the strikers themselves behaved with a restraint and orderliness typical of our countrymen - (cheers) - and in strange contrast to the violent doctrines which, for the time being, they were used to give expression.In the very brief account of the struggle I give, I cannot pass over alluding to the restraint of the police and the protective forces of the country. I think you will all feel with me that the highest credit is due to the Home Secretary - (cheers) - for the way in which he combined the utmost pos­sible efficiency with the most considerate and temperate use of exceptional powers with which it was necessary to arm him for this exceptional period. (Cheers.)Now there is a great deal that might be said about the causes of these troubles through which we are passing, and I hope to speak of them at meetings in the course of the winter. But this is not the place, nor have we the time. I would say in a few words, and, of course, it will be for posterity to judge, but in my view the General Strike, and very largely the same is true of the coal strike, are the inevitable results of tendencies which appeared in this country before the war, and which have been greatly accelerated by the war and the years of peace.There is a very close parallel between the industrial situation and the situation of Europe before the war. In each case you have the agglomeration of masses of men with that curious mass psychology. You have vast bodies formed on either side in the industrial struggle; and leaders and human nature being what it is, the tempta­tions to try your strength is almost irre­sistible. Collision is bound to come, the appeal to force rather than the appeal to reason, and the mere massing together of those large bodies leads in the individual to a sense of apathy and to a loss of per­sonal responsibility among the rank and file, and a curious belief that it does not matter what you do, because the Govern­ment will always step in and make it right.Can Democracy Learn?Just as the masses of men in Europe, the big armies, the ambitious leaders, led to the inevitable catastrophe, so in industry the same phenomenon occurred. The ques­tion is: Are we going to have the wisdom to learn? The events of this last year have set all men thinking. We know that if democracy can learn, it can only learn by experiments. It has made the experiment. Has it the capacity to learn? There are many results left behind. I can only deal with two obvious ones.The first is one which I have touched on earlier in my speech, and it is this: That the last months through which we have passed have postponed for some time - and whatever Government is in power - any prospect of ameliorative legislation which requires money. It means a slow­ing down of such progress as would have been easy had the strike not taken place. Everyone realises that, and there is no doubt there are many who will use this as a stick to beat the Government with for not making more progress. The fact that progress cannot be made while the country is making up the losses which she has suf­fered will be used to keep alive that dis­content which the enemies of the country long to see among them.It will be our duty to combat that in argument, by speeches, and by education to the best of our ability. My own firm con­viction is that such arguments as I have referred to will be used by all the extremists. I believe that the vast majority of our people today can trace cause and effect in a way they have never done before. (Cheers.)Trade Union LawThe Difficult Problem to be SolvedThe second point that the events of the last few months have brought into the forefront is the necessity for a re-­examination of the existing law concern­ing trade unions. There is no need tonight for us to discuss, highly interesting as those are, the causes which brought trade unionism into existence; but it is worth remembering how much they owed in their earlier days to our party. (Cheers.)Our party, in fact, did more than any other to create and to consolidate the trade union movement, and those amongst you represent the most active element in the Party, who are the spearheads of our propaganda, don\u2019t you ever let it be for­gotten in the country.I think we have to remember this: That we are still in a state of society where collective bargaining is necessary, where society still needs trade unions. You cannot smash the system, and if you could it would be wrong. (Cheers.) But the country is greater than the masters of industry, or the trade unions. (Hear, hear.)A difficult problem we have to solve is to reconcile the rights of men in combination with the rights of individuals, and both of them in relation to the wider community of which they are only a part. (Cheers.)I think we must remember, in the words of Disraeli, that the popular liberty is something more substantial than the exercise of the sacred rights of sovereignty by political classes - a very pregnant saying.Now you have today passed a resolution, to the terms of which the Government will give, as is their duty, prompt - (cheers) - and careful consideration.You know how deeply preoccupied we have been in the last few months with the exist­ing situation, and you will, I know, be patient with me if I am not able to announce tonight a decision on the details of a Bill. (Laughter.) Let me only say this: we are conscious of the wishes of our loyal sup­porters in the country. We are fully alive to the importance of the question which is so much exciting your interest. As soon as we have completed our examination of the subject, we shall prepare a Bill and pro­ceed with it in Parliament. (Cheers.)When we are in a position to present that Bill we shall rely with confidence on you - (A Voice: \u2018And we will not betray you\u2019) - (Cheers) - for support.Nothing to DispiritAnd now it seems to me hardly necessary, in the presence of a gathering of this kind, to say there is nothing in the outlook to­day to dispirit us. There is nothing to make us lose courage. There is a good deal to make us exercise patience. The man who takes ephemeral views, somehow his views are always those who come to me and say that all that I and the Government have worked for in the last three years is now exploded and done with, and that the events which followed my refusal to press home our victory by adopting Mr. Macquisten\u2019s Bill have falsified my hopes, and proved I was wrong. Not at all.It was perfectly obvious to me when I began my campaign two or three years ago that so long as I tried to teach the people of the country on these lines it would bring out of his hiding place every extremist in the country. They knew at once that if the teaching I was trying to inculcate was successful, if it gripped the man in the street, their occupation would be gone. (Cheers.) It was bound to bring us that opposition. It was bound to excite the Minority Movement, and they have worked their best ever since. They have done what they never did in private life: they have worked overtime. (Laughter and cheers.)In exactly the same way, I was not sur­prised at that burst of organised ill-manners in the House of Commons, con­fined only to the extremists, regretted by many Members of the Labour party, but done with deliberate intention to try to make the Government look contemptible in the eyes of their supporters, to weaken our authority, to throw mud on us. Such tactics cannot succeed in this country, and they will not. But I feel that tonight I must just tell you, as my friends, that I regard such manifestations as merely a form of hysteria emanating from men who knew they were beaten.A Call to DutyWorking for the Good of the Country as a WholeI told you some time ago there was much thinking going on in the country. There is. I believe that employers are thinking. I believe that trade union leaders are thinking. I believe that the working men are thinking as they have never done be­fore.I believe there is a genuine desire, when these troubles are over, amongst many men, whose minds have not hitherto been turned in that direction, to see if we cannot come together to increase the production of this country, to get work going, so that we may get better wages and more prosperity. (Loud cheers.)1 take it as a good sign that today there are trade union leaders studying problems in America instead of in Russia, and be­fore I sit down I would like to remind you of a few words used by Disraeli more than eighty years ago in a situation not only dissimilar from that in which we find our­selves today, showing with what unerring instincts he laid his finger on the spot in 1844, showing that we, who represent the Government today, however feebly, are trying to follow in the direct succession and applying to the problems of this age the temper and spirit he would have applied in his time had he had the opportunity. He was speaking in Yorkshire:Disraeli\u2019s AppealWe are asked sometimes what we want. We want, in the first place, to impress on society that there is such a thing as duty. We do not do that in any spirit of conceit or arrogance. We do not pretend that we are any better than others, but that we are anxious to do our duty, and if so we think that we have a right to call on others, whether rich or poor, to do theirs. If that principle of duty has not been lost sight of for the last fifty years you would never have heard of the classes into which England is divided. We want to put an end to that political and social exclusiveness, which we believe to be the bane of this country.We don\u2019t come out like a pack of pedants to tell you that we are prepared to remedy every grievance by the square and rule. It is not so much to the action of laws as to the influence of manners that we must look, but how are manners to influence men if they are divided into classes, if the population of a country becomes a body of sections, a group of hostile garrisons. We see but little hope for this country so long as that spirit of faction that has been so rampant of late years is fostered and encouraged. We call it a spirit of faction, for the principles on which the parties which nominally divided this country were formed have worn out and ceased to exist, and the association of men, however powerful, without political principles, is not a party, but a faction. Of such a state of society the inevitable result is that public passions are excited for private ends, and popular improve­ment is lost sight of in particular aggrandisements.The Next ElectionThere, over eighty years ago, you have expressed in words far more eloquent than I can find exactly the points upon which our party during the last three years has been working and are working and will continue to work.We have passed in Western Europe in the last ten years through a whole century of experience and of change, and as a result the world is giddy. It is the same in religion and in politics. Those who remain in parties joined together by fixed principles are the minority, and the majority are driven about this way and that, the prey of every specious speaker, of every quack, whether in religion or in politics.No longer are all the electors members of a party or parties. The voters today under the extended franchise are almost in a minority, but we are, as Mr. Lane Fox said, the largest, the most cohesive body in the country, and power will only come to those who govern the country for the people, for the people who are not attached to party will follow the Govern­ment, which as a Government knows no class, but fights for what they believe to be the good of the country as a whole.It is particularly important in gather­ings of this kind to keep that constitu­tional idea before your mind. The appeal to the country must be made in two or three years. It will be for them to give a verdict upon our work, whether in their view it is good or bad. But I say, with three definite parties and the many politi­cal combinations that exist or may be possible, there is all the more necessity for us to see that we so govern, so try to educate the country that we may re­ceive that support from the men and women of this country, that support may be given to us, because they believe that we are trying to the best of our ability to govern the country for the good of the whole country and not for a class. It is only by that support that any Government today can come in and can have the re­quisite power behind it to govern in this country at all.So let us remember that, and insofar as we keep these ideals before us, always based on the great principles of our party, which have come to us straight from Disraeli, if we only go forward in that spirit we need have no fear but that we shall be able to cope with the difficulties which occur from day to day. We need have no fear that the country when asked will endorse our action and will confirm the verdict which they gave two years ago.

aVMR. LLOYD GEORGE, who was received with great enthusiasm, said it was a real relief to come from the turbulent assembly in the House of Commons at which he was present the previous night to the more serene atmosphere of the well-behaved people in Margate. His first pleasant duty was to congratulate the National Liberal Federation on the great success of its meetings. He saw signs on all sides that the old spirit was thrilling the Liberal Party again.The Chairman, in the course of an eloquent speech, said Mr. Lloyd George, reminded us that this is the fiftieth anniversary of the birth of the National Liberal Federation. My memory goes back as far as that, and a little further, added Mr. Lloyd George. It was a time when things were not going too well for the party. The leaders were not agreed. That has never happened since. There were people at that time who said the Liberal Party was out of power for at least twenty years - the very wise people said fifty years. That was in 1877. Three years later the party won the most remarkable triumph in its history up to that date. That was worth making a note of.The first meeting of the Federation he attended - if they would allow him to be reminiscent: it was the privilege of grey-hairs - was thirty-eight years ago, in Manchester, he believed. Mr. Gladstone, Mr. John Morley, Sir William Harcourt, Sir George Trevelyan, and all that brilliant array of Liberal leaders were there. That was the first meeting of the Federation he (Mr. Lloyd George) attended. He was present also at the meeting in 1892 at Newcastle, where the Federation forced a great constructive programme upon the leaders of the party, the items of that programme including Home Rule, Welsh Disestablishment, the abolition of plural voting, the veto of the Lords, payment of Members, allotments, and small-holdings, and local option. Every one of those items had been carried in whole or in part, because even local option had been carried for Scotland. They had tried it on the Scotsmen first, and they liked it - in principle. All those measures had been carried, and he was proud of the fact that, so far as the first four of them were con­cerned, he was the Minister who took a leading part in placing them on the Statute Book.The Chairman had told them what a difference it would have made had Home Rule been carried when first proposed by that great statesman Mr. Gladstone. There was one thing not clear to the minds of the people of this country, but which was nevertheless a fact - it was thoroughly known by those who were Liberal Ministers in August, 1914. He doubted if Home Rule had been on the Statute Book that we would have ever had the Great War. It was the quarrel over Home Rule, the divisions in the country, the threat of civil war as reported in Germany by the Ambassador that induced the German military staff to come to the conclusion that Britain was out of the reckoning, and, therefore, Germany could crush France and Belgium. Had Home Rule been on the Statute Book, and had the nation been united, Germany would have considered it, not once, but two or three times, before pre­cipitating Europe into a bloody conflict that brought ruin upon themselves. If the voice of the leaders of the Liberal Party had been listened to, it was counsel which would have saved the world from its greatest catastrophe for centuries.The Fortunes of LiberalismSince Home Rule was introduced, said Mr. Lloyd George, the Liberal Party had passed through many vicissitudes. They had had three or four major splits and a multitude of minor ones, but they were all happily healed. Mr. Lloyd George referred to the great success of the party in 1906, after the period of greatest dis­sensions in the party. Mr. Lloyd George said that as they swept the country then they would do it again. There are differences now, he proceeded. I do not mean differences among ourselves, but in the political situation. Then we had two parties. Now we have three. That has obvious disadvantages, but it has some advantages too. I will tell you one. It emphasises the fact that our party is the one party to secure safe and steady progress. One party is on the brink of the precipice here, and the other party is on the brink of the precipice there. We are the only party walking on the safe path.We have two years in which to work. It is not a bit too long. There are people who talk about an immediate general election. Naturally I do not know. I do not think Ministers themselves know. I doubt if the Prime Minister knows. He never knows many minutes in advance what he is going to do. I have heard people say that the Trade Unions Bill and the break with Russia mean a dissolution. Well, I think you had better wait until Market Bosworth comes in. I am making no prediction, but I shall be surprised if whatever the result is it will encourage the Tory Party towards a dissolution.The long drought is over. The Liberal Party has had two refreshing showers - Leith in the north and Southwark in the south. It has rained victories on the unjust for a long time. Now the just are going to have a shower. The cracks in the Liberal garden are beginning to disappear. The nation had arrived at a time of great emergency, and the nation would want the party it could trust to bring it through. The Tories had had a chance of doing what they liked, and the country had seen how it was done.Labour DissentionsThe Labour Party, said Mr. Lloyd George, were in office for a short time, but long enough to show that they had no message for a distracted nation. They were a party which voiced discontent, but a grumble was not a gospel. There were essentially two parties in the Labour Party - the Trade Union Party and the Socialist Party, and there was no real agreement between them on any remedies. They had no real common creed, but a faith cure without a faith. The country had seen enough when in difficulty, and when there were obstacles to surmount that would baffle the best brains in the country, that the Labour Party was not the one to call in. They might be called in in quiet times, when there was nothing doing.Conservative BlunderingAs for the Conservatives, continued Mr. Lloyd George, they were tumbling downstairs from blunder to blunder. The Prime Minister had preached \u2018Peace in our time, O Lord,\u2019 and then brought in a Trade Unions Bill which excited more class animosity than any Bill of modern times. The Bill is an example of extreme foolishness. Whatever might be thought of the Bill, to have brought it in when things were settling down, when there was a manifest improvement in the relations between capital and labour in many directions, and when there was a real desire to settle down, and co-operate, was an act of supreme foolishness. They had created a position in which there was one law for the capitalist and employer and another for the workmen - a fatal thing to do, and a disgraceful act on the part of any Government. The clause regarding the political levy was drafted in such a way as to give the impression that where there were associations of workmen the full force of the Act would tell against them; but it was not so clear that it would apply to such associations as that of the brewers or the Federation of British Industries, and bodies of that kind.Again, the Government expressed a desire for peace in the world, and had erected a new shrine to peace in the mountains of the Alps at Locarno. He was quite prepared to worship at that shrine, but, whilst they were building it, the Government quarrelled with two of the greatest countries in the world - countries which covered half Europe and half Asia and embraced one-third of the population of the world, namely, Russia and China.Even on the question of the gold standard, which was in itself quite a desirable thing, the Government acted precipitately and without consulting the various industries which would be affected. They never considered for a moment what the effect would be on our export trade.When there was trouble in the coal-mining the Government managed to act in such a way that English coal cost about 1s. 6d. a ton more than any other, and the consequence was that England was, therefore, thrust out of the world\u2019s coal market in many places. The whole thing was done in such a way as to precipitate a rupture. When the rupture came, the Government had a great lead from the Report issued by Sir Herbert Samuel. It was rather significant that when they got into a difficulty, the Government came to the Liberals to get them out of it; and three of the four men who assisted with the matter were Liberals.The Government were given a very definite lead by the Coal Commission. But what happened was that first the Government said they would do it; the next day they said they would not; the third day they said they would; and the next day they decided to half do it. In the meantime the stoppage went on month after month, and what should have taken at the most two or three months to settle lasted seven months. Everyone knew, and the speaker, who had had a good deal of experience in such matters knew, very well that in trade disputes the most important thing to do was to get on a clear, definite line as to the basis of settle­ment and what they were prepared to stand by.The Break with RussiaContinuing, Mr. Lloyd George said that Russia provided another good illustration of the Government\u2019s method, or lack of method. This, he said, is a very serious business. To have a diplomatic rupture with one of the greatest powers in the world is a very serious business. It is not a thing to throw caps about: it is a thing to bend the knees about. It is a quarrel between two of the biggest nations on earth - that is what it is. You never know what its repercussions will be, especially with a Govern­ment that is always slithering into positions which it never dreamed of getting into. There had been plenty of reasons for quarrelling with Russia in the past, had we wanted to. The country had the same reasons for quarrelling with her in 1921 and 1922, but he (Mr. Lloyd George) then decided that it was not good for the peace of the world or in the interests of Britain to do so. In 1923 there were plenty of reasons for quarrelling with Russia, but the Tory Government of the day - he thought Mr. Bonar Law was at its head - said, \u2018Although there are reasons for a quarrel, we don\u2019t think it wise to have one.\u2019 In 1924 the Labour Government came to the same conclusion. In 1925 the present Government also came to the same conclusion, and in February of this year, although they had plenty of reasons for quarrelling, they would not.Leaders of the Government in those days told the country that a quarrel in the then disturbed state of Europe was such a serious matter that they did not advise it. Nothing could be gained by it. Why had they quarrelled now? Quite frankly, they never intended it - they tumbled into it. The present trouble was an affair of the police. The Ministerial head of the police in the country has been made the director of the foreign policy of the country, and quite frankly he is not up to it. The most important decision made since August, 1914, was taken, and the Cabinet was never called together. Sir Austen Chamberlain was asked, the Home Secretary was asked, and the Prime Minister was asked about it, but not even those three were called together.          What an extraordinary Government, Mr. Lloyd George added. They decide upon a rupture with 150,000,000 of the most formidable people on earth, and only those who know what they did in the war, without arms, without rifles, without ammunition - they went into action against the greatest artillery in the world with sticks in their hands, and died valiantly at the word of their Czar - it is only those who read of them in dispatches at the time know what a formidable and what a valiant people they are.Mr. Lloyd, George referred to the agreement for which, with Sir Robert Horne, he was proud to have been responsible, and which made possible with Russia a trade of £180,000,000 per annum. In the House of Commons the previous night there was an admission by one of the directors of the Midland Bank that he had made arrangements to credit his English traders for orders to the extent of £10,000,000.           Disadvantages of the BreakRussia could not, said Mr. Lloyd George, be described as a trade rival of England. Russia was not producing the same things that we were. Russia was producing the raw materials which England could not produce and materials which we could not buy elsewhere - hides and cereals, and platinum, and timber, and flax, especially flax. He remembered what a shortage of flax there was immediately after the war. The Russians were supplying the very things that we needed, and we were producing the things that the Russians wanted.A VOICE: Does trade come before honour?MR. LLOYD GEORGE: Oh, no. Trade does not come before honour, but was not honour involved in 1923; was not honour involved in 1925; was not honour involved in 1926; and was not honour involved in February, 1927? And Lord Balfour - one of the most honourable men in this country - said then in the House of Lords, \u2018Although this trade agreement is broken, I say to you it is not in the interests of the peace of the world that you should have a rupture with this great people.\u2019  Now, said Mr. Lloyd George, a disturbing element had been introduced into the peace of the world, and that was the most serious thing of all. Russia could do us more harm than any other country, and there was no other country which was so invulnerable except the United States of America. Russia could do us more harm in China, on our frontier, and in India than any other country. Suppose, he said, they intensify their propaganda. Suppose they increase the difficulties which they are making for us in China and on our frontier. There is nothing more left for England to do. England could not send back the Russian Ambas­sador, because he had gone. We could not recall our Ambassador, because he was on his way back. We have shot the last bolt, said Mr. Lloyd George, except the thunderbolt of war. What folly, what madness. Without thought, without consultation, simply because the Government has made a mistake. They said, \u2018save our faces we will put the country in jeopardy.\u2019 A little more patience would have saved the situation.A Change NeededMr. Lloyd George went on to say that the Government had made blunders during the strike, and another blunder had been made in regard to tackling the China situation. But the Govern­ment were able to defend every blunder in turn. The servant who broke crockery could defend each particular case, but people came to the conclusion that they would rather have a change.Sir Herbert Samuel, said Mr. Lloyd George, had undertaken the great task of reorganising the Liberal forces. As I have said before, he declared, whatever service I can render to assist him I am entirely at his command. What is much more important, I state solemnly here that I will place no obstacle in his way.The annual gathering of the National Liberal Federation was not merely a festival. Work was wanted; it was a council of war. Those who could speak - and there were lots of them - should go out and do so.An Appeal for Liberal WorkersContinuing, Mr. Lloyd George said: We really want speakers to speak who will undertake to do what the speakers of the Labour Party do; not merely say, \u2018What sort of a meeting are we going to get?\u2019 \u2018What sort of a hall is it?\u2019 and \u2018Will my speech be reported?\u2019 Get your audience for yourself: I have had to do so many a time, though others do it for me now. Labour speakers get a chair or a soap-box and put it in a convenient, or rather an inconvenient, place, get a man and a boy to hear them start, and gradually, through curiosity, they get a crowd. Sunday after Sun­day, I have seen this sort of thing happen. With a reasonable class of language, which would pass muster with the police, the speakers denounced everybody, and at the last general election that party polled five million, five thousand votes.You must, Mr. Lloyd George added, get men and women to speak who are prepared to take the risk of not having a good meeting. The task is not a pleasant one. We ought to have, just as the Labour Party has, thousands, many thousands, of young men and women who are prepared to take these risks, who are prepared to take the gospel of Liberalism, which I think is the gospel which will save this country, into the highways and byways. Help; don\u2019t think it is merely your duty to cheer. Work; we are right with our programme, and it is a constructive one. That is not electioneering, it is business.The ablest thinkers and the best economists of today were members of the Liberal Party. When the Liberals went into office they wanted to make sure that they had a programme of repara­tion for the countryside, the cleansing of the slums and the mean streets that are not fit for men and women to live in, the re-housing of millions of men, women, and children, the reinstatement of our homes, and the reduction of useless armaments.If, said Mr. Lloyd George in conclusion, we work hard, and work conscientiously, and with the devotion of a noble effort, then generations unborn will bless the Liberal Party that came into being in the third decade of the twentieth century.

aVI have been in politics for forty years.  I have never known a party in better spirits or in finer fighting fettle.  (Loud cheers.)  They have confidence in themselves and confidence in next year - (A voice \u2013 \u2018And confidence in you, sir.\u2019) \u2013 and they have ample justification for it.  They have justification from two sides.  They remember the victory of four years ago.  They know that 412 Unionist members were returned.  They know all about the swing of the pendulum, the unpopularity of the Government, and the attack made on it, but we still have 406 members.  We have lost six seats in four years \u2013 one and a half a year \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 and, if mathematics be true, it will take one hundred and forty years to move us.  I said there was a two-fold reason for our confidence.  We are a party rich in traditions.  We are a national party which puts the needs of the nation before the needs of a class.  (Cheers.)  We are a party of union, whereas our opponents\u2019 are parties of disunion.  (Hear, hear.)  But the other reason for our confidence is the character and record of those who would fight us. (Laughter.)  Let us consider for a moment the Socialist Party.  During the last four years in Parliament their Parliamentary record is a record of lack of discipline, without which no party can succeed.  (Hear, hear.)  A record of weakness, of absence of statesmanship; and time after time they have subordinated broad and national considerations to the narrow interests of a certain class.  (Hear, hear.)  We have seen that at the time of the general strike.  We saw it during the whole of the coal stoppage, during both of which times their leaders, who disapproved of much of what was in the policy of many of those who were leading in those troublous times, never by word during those dreary months had the courage to say in public what they felt and knew in private.  We saw it at the time of the outbreak of trouble in China when Mr. George Hicks and Mr. Wheatley regretted the flaunting of a military display in China and said what did it matter because they were not bricklayers who were going to be killed.  They have claimed to have a monopoly in representing the interests of the working classes.  A more impudent claim was never made.  (Cheers.)  If we failed to represent those interests not one of us would be on this platform.  If we need proof of my contention has the country yet forgotten the campaign against the Trades Disputes Bill when it was proved that the attitude taken up in Parliament failed to represent the attitude of the workers of the country?  (Cheers.)The Labour PartyIn years to come the Labour Party may be a great party.  I hope for the sake of the country that it will, but they have a long way to go yet, and until they learn to oppose and expose their own extremists they will never secure the suffrages of the people of England.  We saw when they were in office how their leaders yielded to their extremists in the matter of the Russian treaty.  We saw it at the time of the general strike.  We saw it in the coal stoppage.  We saw it in China.  Indeed, we see today how hard they are striving to represent themselves before the country as that constitutional and moderate party - (laughter) - which alone, as they knew in their hearts, can never succeed as rivals to ourselves.  And what are they doing to achieve that result?  They have issued a declaration of policy, a document long-winded and nebulous in which no attempt is made to show how either their proposals would work in practice, how they would achieve the results claimed for them, or how the vast capital expenditure which they involve will be raised.  The only plank on which they seem firmly to stand is that of nationalisation.  Yet what welcome has been accorded to this programme by those for whose benefit it was devised? In the \u2018New Leader,\u2019 as soon as it appeared, I noticed that one gentleman happy in alliterative expression said: \u2018While there are good phrases and points in the programme they are buried in pages and pages of philanthropic poppycock.\u2019  (Loud laughter.)  Mr. Tom Johnson, for whom I confess a sneaking regard, described the programme as a sort of dog\u2019s breakfast, in which there were scraps for every palate.  (Laughter.)  Mr. Philip Snowden, always cautious and sometimes wise - (laughter) - said this:  \u2018The Conservative Party has never committed the folly of issuing a list of a few dozen items of reform which it proposes to carry out.\u2019  Nor will it ever do so as long as I am leader.  The editor of the \u2018Socialist Review,\u2019 who I gather from his style and sentiment belongs to that select body called the intellectuals says \u2013 it is almost impossible to read a page without a yawn \u2013 that it is not going to capture democracy.Labour\u2019s \u2018Little Differences\u2019Whether it be the issue or not of that programme, what has happened has been a complete split in their ranks, heralded by the manifesto of Mr. Cook and Mr. Maxton.  The significant feature of that is this, while the Labour Party are properly trying to purge their ranks of Communism and to become purely a constitutional party, you have Mr. Maxton\u2019s manifesto, approved by the National Council of the Independent Labour Party.  Now one hundred and twelve members out of the one hundred and fifty-eight Labour members in Parliament belong to the Independent Labour Party.  That shows you how much unity has at present been achieved, and while they talk of driving out the Communists Mr. William Adamson, one of the most respected members of the Labour Party, who has given a life\u2019s service to the miners in Scotland, has been thrown out of office in his own union by the Communists.  When these little differences are adjusted it will be time to tell the people of England that the Labour party is purged of Communism.The Liberal PartyNow by a natural process of transition in discussing our opponents we pass from the Labour Party to the Liberal.  That is a much more depressing subject.  (Laughter.)  The Labour Party is after all a party in the making \u2013 a much more cheerful picture than a party in the breaking.  There has never been so far as I am aware in the political history of this country a great party more disunited in policy and in leadership than the Liberal Party today.  There are some who accept as leader Mr. Lloyd George.  There are some who do not.  There are some who accept his land policy.  There are a great many who do not.  In Parliament, if that be any indication, they have voted every way and no way the last four years.  I have been at some pains to have the voting analysed for the last four years.  I find that 6,000 votes have been cast for us.  I find that 18,000 votes have been cast for the Socialists.  I find 37,000 votes have never been cast at all.  (Loud laughter.)  In other words \u2013 if I may put it mathematically \u2013 10 per cent of the Liberal votes have gone to the Unionists, 30 per cent to Labour, and 60 per cent \u2013 (laughter and a voice \u2018Gone to bed.\u2019)  When these things happen in Parliament what about the great revival outside?  The Liberal candidate has forfeited his deposit on no fewer than eight occasions at bye-elections since the General Election, and the party which numbered forty four years ago numbers thirty-nine today.  It is a happy augury that during our session in Yarmouth Cheltenham has once more hammered in the fact that even in a borough like Cheltenham, where there has always been a large Liberal vote, where so popular a man as Sir James Agg-Gardner could not always win and often got in by small majorities, even there at this time the Liberal poll has fallen beyond all hope of redemption.The Liberal ProgrammeWhat of their future and their programme?  I am informed \u2013 I do not know whether it is correct \u2013 that at their annual conference, which I understand is to follow ours, the resolutions which will be discussed are resolutions drafted by their Executive Committee.  It seems to me a strange procedure in these democratic days, and contrasting very vividly with our method of business, but still, it is their business, not mine.  I notice for the main part in social reform they advocate little which we are not doing ourselves.  I notice their only idea of economy is to strike forty millions off national defence without saying how or where, only one thing being certain, that that sum cannot be taken off national defence without impairing national security.  I notice they still stick to the old land values, of which I thought we had heard the last when we abolished the relics of the 1918 legislation.  They undertake to abolish preference and safeguarding.  They undertake to relieve the able-bodied poor out of the exchequer, which seems to me very much like nationalising the dole, and I notice that the Labour Party say of the Liberal programme that it is lifted bodily out of theirs, but that water has been substituted for their wine.  This confirms me in my conviction which I have held for some time that while Labour is Socialism with the courage of its convictions modern Liberalism is Socialism without the courage of its convictions.What Will They Do?But whatever their programme may be, the issue at the next election will be the challenge of Socialism against constitutionalism and individualism.  Now what do the rank-and-file Liberals think about that?  There is no Liberal in this country who looks for a Liberal majority.  He knows that any success of his party or of his vote helps the Socialist and the Socialist alone.  (Hear, hear.)  The utmost he can hope to do is to hold the balance after the next election.  He won\u2019t do it, but he hopes to.  (Cheers.)  What is he going to do then?  The British electors have the right to demand before the election what will Liberals do.  Will they put Labour in again or will they not?  We only want to know where we are.THE GOVERNMENT\u2019S RECORDTribute to Sir AustenI think I have devoted more time than it is worth with our opponents, and must say something about ourselves.  (Cheers.)  I notice Mr. Lloyd George recently asked:  What have we done?  I don\u2019t mind his asking that.  I have always been told he does not read very much.  (Laughter and cheers.)  I know that he has been in Parliament very little, and I understand from the newspapers that he has been devoting a lot of time to gardening.  (Laughter.)  I gather that because I notice that for two or three years he has been spending all his time in throwing stones into his neighbour\u2019s garden.  (Laughter and cheers.)  But I am glad to have the opportunity of telling him what we have done.  I am amazed at our record.  (Cheers.)  I make no excuse for speaking about it, and I want every member of Parliament and every candidate at the next election to rub it in, because people do not realise; and after all our people are very apt to judge by what has been done.  They say public memory and political memory is short.  That may be true; but at the same time the British people are generous to good work.  We have done good work, and we must make them understand it.  I want first of all to pay tribute to my colleague, Sir Austen Chamberlain.  (Loud cheers.)  The whole country, the whole of Europe, recognises the devotion and the skill, and the patience with which he has handled foreign affairs for four years.  I have every hope and belief that he will handle them for four years more.  (Cheers.)  At Locarno, in China, in Egypt, conciliation, firmness ,and the resolution to protect the interest, and in some cases the lives, of our own people, he has constantly pursued peace, and a great part of the credit of what has been done in Europe in that direction during these four years belongs fairly to him, and in that cause he has nearly worn himself out.  (Cheers.)  In the Dominions my friend, Mr. Amery, has for the first time laid, and rightly laid, a close and intimate personal intercourse between the Government at the centre of the Empire and the Governments in the Dominions.  (Hear, hear.)  His personal visit, his personal intercourse, his speeches, will all bear rich fruit in the future and while I just allude to him do not let us forget at this meeting the services to the Dominions, to the Mother Country, to the Empire rendered at the last Imperial Conference by Lord Balfour.  (Cheers.)  The work of the Empire Marketing Board will be more and more valuable as time goes on.  The work of overseas settlement, difficult for many reasons which I cannot go into tonight, is engaging the Secretary of State\u2019s personal attention, and will, I hope, also in its time bear good fruit.  But it is at home where the record of the achievements of the present Government will go down to history.  We have not talked as much as we have done things.  We had not been in office six months before we passed the Widows, Orphans and Old Age Pensions Act.  (Cheers.)  I would say nothing more of that at this moment than this, that the president of the Friendly Societies\u2019 Conference the other day in speaking of that Act gave these remarkable figures.  Over one quarter of a million widows, over 350,000 children, over 880,000 old age pensioners - a million and half in all - are drawing benefits from that Act who would have been drawing nothing had it not been passed.  (Cheers.)  The whole conception of that Act and the passing of it was the work of the present Government.Housing Problem on the Road to SolutionAnd now I want to say a word about the work of another of my colleagues, to whom I rejoice to hear you give a welcome this afternoon worthy of him.  In housing out of the 1,100,000 houses built since the Armistice, 700,000 have been built in the term of the present Government, and in the year ending on the 30th of last September, there were 273,000 houses built, which was more than twice the number that had ever been built before in that time.  I wish that Mr. Neville Chamberlain could be kept at the Ministry of Health for the rest of his life.  (Cheers.)  Nothing has been nearer his heart than slum clearance and many conversations have he and I had on that.  He is not satisfied with the progress that has been made and yet more schemes have been approved by him than by any other Government.  I think we may safely say this.  Now that the housing problem is on the road to solution and the houses that we wanted have been in so large a part built, we shall be able when we go back again next June or July - (cheers) - to go full steam ahead with slum clearance.  (Cheers.)Progress in EducationThere is another subject on which I want to speak for four or five minutes.  It is one that plays very little part at ordinary political meetings.  It is one on which I spoke a good deal myself before the last election, and that is education.  I want to pay a tribute tonight to what Lord Eustace Percy has done without advertisement, without any shouting, what he has done in the way of the fulfilment of the pledges we gave at the election.  We made three or four main points.  We promised to go in for the modernisation of the elementary school premises.  We promised to go in for a reduction of classes.  We promised to improve advanced education for children between eleven and fifteen.  We promised to increase the opportunities of young persons to get higher education if they proved themselves fitted for it \u2013 and mind you on all of these subjects depends in no small degree the efficiency and happiness of our country.  (Hear, hear.)  On all of these points we have made great progress.  There have been over two hundred new schools built.  Plans have been approved for more than eight hundred blacklisted schools, and more than half these plans have been carried out and executed.  Large classes have been reduced by one-third, and more than eight thousand of them cut down.  There are 3700 more certificated teachers, which bears out the fact that I have just related to you.  All the local authorities in this country have now put forward schemes for advanced instruction for children from eleven to fifteen \u2013 schemes for three years from 1927 to 1930, and they are now in the course of execution.  There are 63,000 more secondary school pupils sanctioned than a year ago, 25,000 more children in the secondary schools, an increase of 16 per cent in the free places.  That is very remarkable progress \u2013 (cheers) \u2013 and I do not mind confessing to you there is nothing lies nearer my heart and the hearts of my colleagues than to go on to help with the education and the health of our people, to try to convert them from a C 8 nation to an A 1 nation.  (Cheers.)  Medical services in the schools have been improved, and half a million more children are being inspected every year.  Schemes for crippled children for orthopaedic treatment have been passed and are in action.  And in conclusion \u2013 and I rejoice in this \u2013 for the first time all qualified teachers are secure under terms settled nationally and adopted by all the local authorities, and the Government stand, as they have always stood, for national settlement in these matters.The Electricity ActWe hear very little today about the Electricity Act.  There was much talk when the Labour Party were in about what they were going to do in electrifying England.  We did not talk \u2013 we passed the Electricity Act.  For the last two or three years all those concerned in administration have been putting in splendid work in preparation.  The contracts are beginning to be put out, and we can see a time not too far distant when cheap electricity will be available from one end of the country to the other.  I venture to think that in years to come when people look back on these times there is no Act which will stand out as having been more far-sighted, as having done more for the country as a whole, than the Electricity Act, passed in the lifetime of the present Government.New Women VotersWith regard to women and children we have found in times past several useful Acts in connexion with guardianship adoption and to meet certain hardships in regard to divorce.  We have given the franchise to women.  (Cheers.)  Other parties have talked about it \u2013 we have done it, and we have done it freely and in the firm conviction that the enfranchisement of women, together with the enfranchisement of men, will lead to stability in the affairs of this country, to a deep and profound interest in all affairs, domestic and Imperial, and that politics will be all the keener and cleaner for the addition that has been made to the electorate.  (Cheers.)Helping AgricultureWe found agriculture enjoying a fifty per cent relief of the rates.  Three years ago we increased it to 75 per cent, and we included in the rating relief the farm buildings.  We are now legislating for total relief for that industry.  (Cheers.)  We have passed a Credits Act, a very remarkable piece of legislation, which I believe will be of immense value.  We have encouraged the growth and manufacture of sugar beet.  We have passed Acts for the grading and marketing of produce, just as we passed the Merchandise Marks Act for the industry of this country, which has been taken advantage of by an increasing number of industries.Mr. Churchill\u2019s RecordI do not think that at a meeting like this we ought to separate without acknowledging and paying tribute to the courage and versatility of the Chancellor of the Exchequer - (cheers) - who in spite of the unparalleled financial disasters of 1926 has succeeded in maintaining the credit of the country, in balancing his Budget and in making certain welcome reductions of taxation to large sections of the Community.  The Unemployment Insurance has been placed upon a sound financial basis, and the Minister of Health has passed Acts in Parliament to prevent wanton, extravagant, and profligate expenditure by local authorities.  (Cheers.)  We have passed the Trades Disputes Act.  (Cheers.)  I think we may say we have laid the ghost of the general strike.  We see in the country today a spirit of greater confidence, not only confidence in our own country, but what I have longed to see \u2013 confidence in ourselves and confidence in our old ability to weather the storms that may come upon us.UNEMPLOYMENT AND RATING REFORM A New Feeling of HopeWe have still, in spite of the fact that more are at work than four years ago, to face unemployment.  That, of course, has caused us great anxiety, and we are in process now of carrying out a great deal of very difficult and complicated legislation in rating and Poor Law reform, which we believe will be of the greatest assistance to industry in this country for generations to come.  (Cheers.)  But I would say to all my friends in the House of Commons that it will make demands upon your time, demands that may seem hard, but this legislation has got to be got through for the sake of the country, and I am perfectly certain that there will be no slackening in the efforts of anyone that this legislation shall be law before we go to the country.  I say no more about it here, because I understand you have been discussing it this afternoon, and you have had the advantage of hearing some observations upon it by a man who is a past master of his subject \u2013 Mr. Neville Chamberlain.  I will only say this.  Our party at its best, as it is today, has always been a party that puts the condition of the people first.  Disraeli did it and we do it - (cheers) - and the great appeal that this Poor Law reform makes to me is that I am convinced that when once put through it will offer us and offer my friend Mr. Chamberlain a fresh jumping-off point for a further campaign on behalf of the health of the people in every way in which the health services can assist them and provide for them.  Now we have got to remember with regard to unemployment that the most serious place where unemployment exists is in the coal mines, and we have got to remember that unemployment is very largely the result of that very rationalisation \u2013 to use one of those long words so popular in the present day \u2013 which has been urged upon the coal trade by everyone who has studied their problems, and by none more than the Socialist leaders.  But whereas it has always been urged upon them it has been left for this Government to try and meet the critical situation caused by the unemployment resulting; and we realise as the country realises that the only thing that can be done for the men in that trade out of work is to obtain work in other industries, whether it be in this country or overseas, because within reasonable time at least it seems improbable that they can get work again for their old employment of coal mining.  It is having that fact in view, that the Ministry of Labour now are working with intense energy to place these men in situations throughout the country.  It is too early yet to judge of the success their efforts will have.  I am hopeful at least that the beginnings of a move may be made from these derelict districts, and there need be at any rate a new feeling of hope in the breasts of the men who live in these districts when they see the helping hand at least is being held out to them.  Lord Lovat is at this moment in the Dominions studying with Ministers overseas what ways can be devised for quickening and for expediting overseas settlement, and we shall wait with eagerness the result of his labours, and I hope to be able to act upon them.SUCCESS OF SAFEGUARDINGDo Not Go Too Far in Front of Public OpinionAnd then I want to say a few words about another weapon in our armour, and that is the weapon of safeguarding.  (Loud cheers and a Voice:  \u2018Good old Stanley.\u2019)  There have been since the war meetings of economists from the different countries at Geneva doing what they can to induce the countries of Europe to remove, or at any rate to reduce, the barriers which interfere with trade between one country and another in the shape of tariffs.  I am all in favour of these meetings.  I would like to see all the barriers down - ( hear, hear) - but in the meantime when the barriers exist in other places, when employment is affected at home by longer hours, by cheaper labour, by questions of currency, what is the Liberal Party going to do to meet these cases, and what is the Labour Party going to do?  The Liberal Party say they will do nothing, so we know exactly where we stand.  They are going to take away existing safeguarding.  The Labour Party officially say they will do nothing.  There is much uneasiness in the rank and file.  Voices have been heard saying licences for imports are far more drastic than safeguarding and more dangerous in many ways.  I see one Labour member in South Wales is advocating safeguarding \u2013 (hear, hear) \u2013 and he says whatever party comes into power will safeguard.  Safeguarding was introduced by the Coalition Government and it has been the law of the land for seven years.  I think we all agree that the experimental stage is passing away.  (Loud cheers.)  There are few in this country who would contend that success has not been achieved by such experiments in safeguarding as have hitherto been made, and I know there have been many members of our party who feel that progress has been too slow.  Let me remind you of this.  It is not wise in a democracy to go too far in front of public opinion.  (Hear, hear.)  The British people are slow to make up their minds on a new question, but they are thinking and thinking hard.  This question of safeguarding is an industrial question, a question which should be judged on its merits, and on its merits alone, and I put my own position as your leader and the position of my colleagues as the Government very clearly in a letter to the Chief Whip just before the recess.PLEDGE REPEATEDNo Tax on FoodWe are agreed that there will be no tax on food. (Applause.)  I repeat the pledge which I have given that safeguarding will not be used as a side door or back door by which to introduce a general tariff until the question of a general tariff has been submitted to the country \u2013 a purely democratic proceeding, and in view of our record, in view of our treatment of this question, the country will trust us and take our word.  I say this, that no industry will be barred from making its case and proving it if it can before the appropriate tribunal.  (Applause.)  I would add one thing.  If we are returned to power we have no doubt the procedure needs simplifying and shortening.  The too protracted enquiries are bad for business.  I remember Sir Alfred Mond as he then was when he was an apostle of Free Trade once said business could flourish with tariffs, business could flourish without tariffs, but business could not flourish with uncertainty.THE COMING CAMPAIGNTribute to Party\u2019s LoyaltyI want to say one word about our organisation.  We have tributes from opponents.  They have recognised that our organisation is the best of the three parties.  That is not as high praise as I should like to give you.  (Laughter.)  I have had forty years experience of politics, most of it in the rank-and-file.  There is nothing I ask you to do that I have not done myself.  I have marked off polling cards, I have addressed envelopes - (laughter) - and I have shepherded the last batch of voters from the public house.  (Cheers and laughter.)  I gained my experience in an old borough, and there is nothing you can teach me.  I merely preface by saying this \u2013 that I believe our organisation is better than it has ever been at headquarters and in the country.  I should like to thank my friend Mr. Davidson for what he has done.  I want to say a word of congratulation to the women\u2019s organisations.  (Cheers.)  They are doing wonders, and do not ever let us forget the Junior Imperial League.  Let us pay a tribute to our literature department, which has never been so effective as it is today.  A most remarkable thing I have seen \u2013 one of our pamphlets directed against the Liberals lifted bodily into a Labour pamphlet.  And I have seen all parties asking for our literature on the Trades Disputes Bill to learn what it actually meant.  I said to Mr. Davidson today I thought it would be very valuable before the election if we could have some very good leaflets giving some extracts from Mr. Lloyd George\u2019s articles in the foreign Press, written in times of difficulty at home.  (Applause.)  That will be attended to.  Today I see a closer co-operation between the central office and the local organisations than I ever remember.  And I see unlimited enthusiasm and ability.  From today work, organise, educate.  This is the last time I shall address you before the General Election.  I want to pay a tribute here to my team in the Cabinet.  (Applause.)  Looking back over four years, no Prime Minister has ever had more loyal and consistent support than I have.  There is not one Minister who has not more than fulfilled the expectations, high as they were on my part, with which I embarked in office in 1924.  There are some who by their devotion to their labours have impaired their health.  They are wearing themselves out in your service.  We shall all do that sooner or later, but in our party we have an unlimited reservoir of youth waiting to take their places.  We are no party of reaction \u2013 we go forward in the pursuit of ordered progress.  Our first aim is peace at home and abroad and throughout the world, a peace in which we can improve the conditions of life, of health, of education for our own people.  I am proud to lead such a party with such a tradition.  I sprang from the rank-and-file and they have supported me through good times and through bad.  They stood by me after the election of 1923, when many stout hearts wavered.  They have stood by me since.  They have followed my strategy without asking too many questions.  They have trusted me.  (Cheers.)  Once more in the coming fight I ask you to continue my trust in that leadership.  I am convinced that if you will give me that same confidence that I have in you, once more we shall rout our foes, combined or separate, as we routed them four years ago, and continue again for a further period of ordered progress in the traditions of that greatest of our leaders whom we are all so proud to follow \u2013 Lord Beaconsfield.

aVWe are here tonight as part of the army of 5,300,000 men and women who were mobilised under the Liberal flag a few weeks ago at the General Election, the largest poll ever recorded for the Liberal Party, and it will be bigger next time.It is true that the members of the House of Commons are no indication of the proportion of the electorate which we secured, for as some speakers pointed out here today, each member of the Liberal Party in the House represented three times as many votes as each member of the Labour Party. And it fills us with pride to realise that we are three times better men than either the Conservatives or Labour.The Socialist Government and its PredecessorWe have got a Socialist Government in power again. Who put them there? And what are they doing?I am going to deal more particularly with the first question. Although not very important at the moment it will be very much more important in a year or two. When driving about the country during the last election I saw great posters which said \u2018The Liberals put the Socialists in in 1924. They will do the same thing again.\u2019They did not. Who put them in? There was an Anti-Socialist majority of six millions. Mr. Baldwin knew that, but he was in such a hurry to put his Socialist friends in that he could not wait, for 24 hours even, to consult with the representatives of 5,300,000 non-Socialist electors who had voted Liberal. If the Socialists succeed - well, we shall have to thank Mr. Baldwin. But he would not get the credit. If they failed there would be another poster \u2018He put the Socialists into power\u2019 and at the end \u2018Vote Liberal.\u2019The next question was \u2018How are they doing?\u2019 It was early days yet. They had been singularly fortunate in their predecessors. He read a very witty article in an independent Conservative paper that week. \u2018We do not for one moment believe (ran the article) that this is the best of all Governments. We are uncertain in spite of what it has accomplished. It is a good Government, but let Mr. Chamberlain make no mistake, it is a magnificent Government com­pared with the last.\u2019The Conservative paper concludes: \u2018The country has no certainty that it is going to live happy ever afterwards in a Socialistic regime, but, quite frankly, it has felt a lot better since putting the last Government out.\u2019\u2018But still,\u2019 continued Mr. Lloyd George, \u2018we must not forget what the last Government was like. You must not speak evil of the dead, but if the dead expect to come back to life in another couple of years, and afflict us again, it\u2019s just as well you should examine something of their record.It was the poorest thing in the way of a government I had seen in my time. No department tackled its jobs - mines, agricul­ture, trade, the department of health, labour, go through them one by one, transport - they never tackled a single job. They never faced a single problem.They did not even seem to realise what was going on. All the staple industries of the country were suffering - textiles, coal, engineering, shipbuilding - go through them all. They were quite oblivious. The crushing taxation, the estrangement with America, the prestige of the country going down throughout the world. They had no conception.They thought things were going fine, and they said: \u2018See what we are doing.\u2019The fact of the matter is, it was not so much a Cabinet as a kind of opium den. Drowsy, dreamy, oblivious to all realities; supinely and stupidly happy, thinking all things were well; very pleased with themselves! It is only now when it is over that they have collapsed.And even now the fumes have not evaporated.Read that speech of Mr. Neville Chamberlain\u2019s, who said: \u2018It\u2019s all right: if they misbehave I will slap them.\u2019Take the Bank rate. It all had its origin in that foolish settlement by Mr. Baldwin of the American debt - which burdened us with £38,000,000 gold payment every year before we had made any settlement for the moneys that were due to us from others.We have already paid over £200,000,000 in gold. The French waited for a better opportunity. The result is they have £300,000,000 of gold now and we have £130,000,000, and it was coming down rapidly.It is well that the public should keep in mind the fact that the members of the late Government believe that they are the only alternative to the Labour Government. In 1924 the country had had no experience of a Conservative Government. They have now had five years\u2019 experience, and they know what it is like, so that when the Socialists\u2019 time is come for them to put in their ticket, the country must be taught to look for something better to succeed them than the late Tory administration.The Government\u2019s Foreign PolicyHow are the Tories\u2019 successors shaping? I am going to talk fairly and quite frankly about that. Take what they have done. If you take what was done at The Hague, I have nothing but unqualified commendation, praise and admiration for that. The Liberal Party first raised the issue in the House of Commons, but still that does not rob Mr. Snowden of his share of the credit.Mr. Lloyd George went on to say that Mr. Snowden showed great courage and resolution in face of great difficulties. \u2018And perhaps the greatest difficulties of all did not come from foreign Powers but from much nearer home.I am glad he did it because of the selfish French policy which was damaging British credit. So I give him full marks for that.Now with regard to the Optional Clause, that ought to have gone through before. There should have been no hesitation about it. It was part of our programme at the last election, and I cannot conceive of any hesitation. I am delighted that it was achieved.As to evacuation - by the Treaty of Versailles - and I do know something about that because I was there for months framing it - the French, the Belgians and ourselves were to evacuate the Rhine­land the moment Germany was carrying out the Treaty.She was carrying out the Treaty - and it is acknowledged she was - when she was permitted to enter the League of Nations. It was a dishonourable thing to have remained there a single hour after that. And there again - full marks!Tribute to Herr StresemannMay I just in passing say with what deep distress I heard of the death of Herr Stresemann. I never had the privilege of meet­ing him. I think there were three great European figures I never had the honour of meeting. Herr Stresemann, Mussolini and that other great figure - you may disagree with me - Lenin.He was a great man, Herr Stresemann. He was a man who faced great unpopularity, faced the taunt that he was unpatriotic when he was struggling for European peace. He faced it bravely when his health was completely broken, and he fought right to the end. May God rest his soul.RussiaAs to Russia - well, I am glad that they have repaired the blunder - the silly blunder committed by the late Government. You cannot expect quite the same rule of conduct from a revolutionary Government as you can from a settled Government. You cannot expect men in a fever to behave quite normally. It is in the interests of the peoples of the world not merely in the interests of the peoples of Russia, but of all nations, that you should bring them into the comity of nations and gradually accustom them to the methods of a more normal civilisation. Therefore it would have been wisdom on our part to overlook a few errors of judgment - he would not call them breaches of faith. The French are doing it, the Poles are doing it, the Germans are doing it.But all I can say is why did not the present Government do it two or three months ago?They entered into the negotiations with regard to questions which had not been settled. Why did they not go on with this and other outstanding questions. I am glad that Mr. Henderson has repaired the error of Sir Joynson Hicks and also his own blunder. Not quite full marks for that!Misgivings about EgyptThen there was Egypt. He was full of misgivings about that settlement. It had had the effect of adding another desert which they had got to occupy, and there was the effect it would have when, later, they would have to enter into negotiations with the great people of Hindustan. Neither would it make Sir John Simon\u2019s task as easy as if they had not been so precipitate in dealing with a position of that character.India and the Simon CommissionI would also like to issue one word of warning about India itself. I see in the Daily News of Thursday that there is some talk of dominion status for India, and there is a letter from the Secretary of State for India which is a rather remarkable and disturbing letter. He says he has been working hard daily for four months, going over the ground, and he thinks he will be able to contribute something to Indian policy which is in harmony with the ideals of the Labour Party. And he says he has a united Cabinet behind him.Well, you must bear in mind that there is a very important and influential commission with Sir John Simon, one of the ablest jurists in the Empire, at the head of it. It was appointed with the full consent of the Labour Party. They placed two members on that Commission. They have worked hard in the face of very real and dangerous risks to their own lives.They are now approaching the stage when they will come to some definite conclusions and recommend them to the Govern­ment. Surely the Government will not form their judgment or make their contribution according to Labour ideals until first of all they have heard what is the report of this influential and able Commission.Well now, I thought it necessary just to say one word upon that, and we will suspend our marks until we see what they do.PalestineWith regard to Palestine, they were undoubtedly caught napping, and I am not disposed to criticise them very severely for that reason. They had not been in power very long before the trouble began, but they were undoubtedly unprepared. I am much more inclined to blame their predecessors.Had not a small mobile force, which was not expensive, been taken away, he thought there would have been no disturbances, or at any rate no massacre.This question was of great international character. There were Jews in every country, and the Commission of Enquiry should command not only the confidence of people at home, but from its constitution and membership the respect and confidence of other nations as well. The report of the Commission would probably be the basis of action in the future. It was a great pity they had appointed a weak Commission instead of taking time to confer with other parties, because, after all, they were a minority Government.DisarmamentDealing with disarmament, Mr. Lloyd George said that he rejoiced heartily in the steps that had been taken in re-establishing good relations with the United States of America, and from the bottom of his heart wished well to the mission of the Prime Minister. The whole peace of the world depended upon whether disarmament was a reality and not a sham.First of all there was naval disarmament. It was vital that there should be an understanding between the two greatest naval powers in the world - the British Empire, and the United States of America. The success of the efforts at such disarmament did not, however, depend on the mission to America, but on the Five Powers\u2019 Conference which would take place a few months hence.A more important part of disarmament to which he called attention last year at Yarmouth, was the land and air armaments. He then pointed out that the victorious Powers had given an undertaking that if Germany reduced her forces to the figure in the Treaty of Versailles, i.e., 100,000, they would reduce their forces alike to the lowest proportions consistent with security. That was 10 years ago. What reductions had been effected?We proceeded at once to carry out our part, and also entered into negotiations with America for the reducing of naval armaments and at that conference such armaments were reduced by 1,800,000 tons. What had been done beyond that? Let people examine the position in regard to men. Germany had reduced her gigantic army of millions to 100,000, and at the present moment had 98,000. France\u2019s total effective peace establishment was 614,000, but her reserves of trained men were 3,000,000, so that in the event of war she would have 3,614,000, and Germany 100,000. That was what was called reducing the Army to the minimum consistent with security.Now let us turn to munitions. No army is of any use as a fighting machine unless effectively equipped - thus the possession of equipment is a vital factor in war, and the reduction or absence of equipment an equally vital factor for peace.The Russian Army was one of the bravest in the field. There had never been anything to exceed their gallant daring. They went with sticks in their hands to fight those with rifles, bayonets, and machine guns under the terrible cannons of Germany. What happened? Although they were trained, although their bravery was superlative and their sacrifices were enormous, they were beaten down. It was two years after we entered the war that we could equip those men. Had we been able to equip the Russian Army the war would have been over in 1916.At the beginning of the war we had 1,955 machine guns, and during the war we manufactured 210,000. At the beginning we had 800,000 rifles, and at the end we had 5,316,000. Except those that were destroyed in the war, they were all there now. At the Armistice Germany handed over 107,000 machine guns, 6,000,000 rifles, and 83,000 cannon. They were all broken into scrap iron, and the rest ought to be. The French equipment was almost as great as the German was formerly, and the Italian equipment was also enormous. What was still worse, this machinery of destruction had been \u2018perfected\u2019 since the war.All this in spite of the fact that the Treaty of Versailles, and the Covenant of the League of Nations, which were signed by all the great powers of the world, and which dictated conditions to Germany as to her disarmament, contained a pledge that if Germany observed the conditions imposed upon her the other parties to these documents would reduce their armaments to the minimum compatible with security.They call this \u2018reducing armaments to the minimum.\u2019 It was a farce, a dishonour, and a menace. Viscount Cecil had put up a gallant fight for disarmament at Geneva. He had met great opposition and the abuse of the Continental Press. It was after Mr. Macdonald and Mr. Henderson had left, but they ought to have put up that fight. He was not in the least disparaging Lord Cecil, for he was a man for whom he had a very great respect.He had ability, a great courage, and was respected by all parties in the country, in Europe as well, and in America. But he held no official position, for he only represented the Government in the sense that he was a delegate sent there. The Prime Minister should have dealt with this before he left the conference.It is a case that ought to have been presented with the full force and influence of the British Government. It was a British Prime Minister who signed that undertaking. The Prime Ministers of the Dominions signed it. The British Parliament passed it and inscribed it on the Statute Book of the realm.All parties to the Treaty were bound equally in honour. A wrong has been committed against one party to the Treaty and no man who cannot speak with authority in the name of the nation can see that wrong righted, can see that pledge redeemed, can see the British name and the British honour is untarnished.You must all take risks for the purpose of seeing that our honour is kept untarnished. As long as those gigantic guns are ready to be rolled into the battlefield, those rattling machine-guns that crackle death - as long as they are there peace is a very poor thing.Do you think they are going to refer vital issues to arbitration when they have got 4,000,000 men behind them and 50,000 heavy guns, and only 100,000 on the other side and no guns?It means, I tell you, that so long as the deadly instruments of war exist there will be no peace on earth or goodwill amongst men. It is too serious to criticise the Government.I say here in this Liberal meeting that I appeal to the Government, to its head and to the Foreign Minister, not to leave the matter merely to Lord Cecil but to back him up in his effort.Home Affairs - Unemployment, etc.Turning to home affairs, Mr. Lloyd George said here the Government had not done so well. The Labour Conference apparently agreed with the National Liberal Federation as to their failure on the home front.Proceeding, Mr. Lloyd George said that Socialism would not eliminate or provide remedies for the great troubles of the nation. There was unemployment. It had increased by 62,000 since the Socialist Government came into power. Unemployment is a terrible curse. There was the question of the congested areas in our great cities to be dealt with. Then there was the question of the mines - aggravated by the refusal to accept the Liberal Party\u2019s practical proposals made several times during the last ten years.Mr. Lloyd George suggested his hearers should look back at their old newspapers and find out what was offered in 1919, 1920, 1921, and afterwards in 1925 by the Samuel Commission.And look at what they are getting from the Labour Government - after great schemes which would have put the whole situation of the mines right had been repeatedly rejected by the Labour Party who had said \u2018No, we will have nothing but nationalisation!\u2019The Labour Government is not going to propose Nationalisation, but is going to propose something which will be less than they could have had but rejected ten years ago.Then there was the problem of the decay of the countryside, the great and growing difficulty of the traffic on our roads, improvements in the efficiency of our industries, and the great problem of making the best use of the natural resources of this country in men and material.It was the one issue that we concentrated upon during the War - how we were to make the best use of our men and material for war. When are we going to put the same question to ourselves in peace?Mr. Thomas took the lead at the General Election in abusing the Liberal plans. He called them juggling, cheating, and lying, excelling himself in the language he used. And there\u2019s no man who can use such language so well. He\u2019s strong in language, but very weak in action.Mr. Thomas had not the courage to admit he was wrong, and the Liberals were right, but each day he would realise more and more that the Liberal plans were not improvised, that we had consulted the best business men and the best experts, and we had put them forward after years of consideration. He won\u2019t admit it, and the result is he is going blindly headlong to destruction.\u2018Our plan,\u2019 said Mr. Lloyd George in conclusion, \u2018holds the field. If they refuse to adopt it they will inevitably fail. If they accept it they will succeed, if they know how to carry it out, and we will demand to know why they abused it at the election.Meanwhile, we shall continue in the House of Commons with the very able party we have got there - and when the time comes we shall ask with confidence the electors of this country to return to power the only party that thought out the real remedies for dealing with the great social and economic evils that has afflicted this country, one of the greatest of which is the crying evil of unemployment.\u2019

aVI thank you most warmly for the cordiality of your greeting. I take it that your welcome is meant not only for me but for all my colleagues who sit upon this platform.I believe that our action in withdrawing from the Government at this juncture meets with the almost universal approval of the organisa­tions and the members of the Liberal Party throughout the length and breadth of the land. When we joined the Government fourteen months ago, although there were some doubts expressed here and there, on the whole there was a large measure of unanimity then. When the Prime Minister resolved upon a General Election then, indeed, there was some difference as to the course that we ought to pursue. I can only express my own conviction, which is fallible; I may be wrong; but to me it is very clear that if we had resigned from the Government at that time, in that crisis, and fought the Election on Party lines, Liberalism would have been split from top to bottom. The Free Trade issue would have been overlaid by the financial crisis. Some injury would have been done by our action to national interests, but Liberalism would have been brought to complete disaster.It is one of the conditions of a coalition that the minority are compelled to acquiesce in many things they greatly dislike. Others before me have experienced that. I shall have something to say later this evening about disarmament. A letter was published yesterday with regard to which I shall only make one observation. It takes two to make a quarrel, and I shall not be the second one. That is all that I shall say on that topic tonight or at any time.I am more concerned to convince the country, as we are ourselves convinced, that our action in withdrawing from the Government now was necessary in the best interests of the nation and of the Empire. The main task for which we joined was accomplished. Mr. Baldwin, speaking a few days ago at Blackpool, bore testimony to that. He said that, although the conditions today were not without anxiety, the general financial position has improved beyond all belief. We have effected a wonderful conversion and we no longer suffer any anxiety about our currency. Those were the objects which we set out to achieve; and, although no doubt there are many and grave difficulties surrounding our nation and afflicting the whole world, still they can be dealt with in the ordinary course of government.In January we accepted the agreement to differ, and of late some of our opponents have done me the honour to quote statements of mine made earlier in the year defending our action then, and they ask why it should not be continued now. But they omitted one quotation. I used these words when speaking last March of that situation. I said: \u2018It may be unavoidable for us to leave the Government in spite of all its disadvantages if some further division should arise in the Cabinet on a matter of large and permanent importance.\u2019 What was foreseen in March has occurred in September, and we should be false to sound principles of politics and to all the honourable traditions of British public life if we consented to suppress or to conceal or to mitigate our differences with regard to these Ottawa Agreements, or if we failed to leave a Cabinet which was resolved upon so disastrous a policy.For any Minister it is a sacrifice to lay down a high office of State. For my part, I greatly regret that I must forgo the opportunity in the next Session of introducing a comprehensive measure of Penal Reform which, as Home Secretary, I had planned; but, after all, I have had the privilege of holding responsible offices of State at home and abroad for as many as seventeen years. But for my colleagues who, for the first time, have had experience of the absorbing interest and the wide opportunities which ministerial office presents - for them the sacrifice is far greater. Sir Archibald Sinclair, Mr. Isaac Foot, Lord Lothian, Sir Robert Hamilton, Mr. Graham White, all of whom have conducted with remarkable efficiency and success the affairs of their several offices; and our admirable band of Whips: Mr. Rea, Sir Murdoch McKenzie Wood, Mr. Harcourt Johnstone, Lord Allendale: all of them with complete unanimity forewent the offices which they held and made the sacrifices which public duty required.Liberal Nationals and Liberal UnionistsI have no doubt that this common action, this unanimity, would have been approved by our great leaders of earlier days, whose example we seek to follow: Campbell-Bannerman and Asquith, and would most certainly have had the concurrence of our dear friend and colleague, Donald Maclean. I am sorry that we have not got companionship in this action from all those Members of the Government who in the past have borne the Liberal name. When you consider the events of the last twelve or fourteen months and are inclined sometimes to criticise our action, bear in mind, if I may venture to ask it, how our hands were weakened by the action of those Liberal Members of the House of Commons who accepted completely and without demur the whole Protectionist policy of the Conservative Party: two in the Cabinet; four or five in the Government - there are several more now; another twenty in the House of Commons. At every stage, at every crisis, their abstention almost halved the efficacy of our action. But our hands were upheld by the rank and file of the Party throughout the country and by every one without exception of its central and district organisations.I have repeatedly uttered a warning that the Liberal Nationals of today are treading the path of the Liberal Unionists of a generation ago. Now that is confirmed completely from another source, more authoritative, if I may quote once more Mr. Baldwin. He has made an interesting and a very useful speech, which we shall have occasion to quote somewhat often. He said at Blackpool the other day: \u2018The situation reminds me very much of that which I remember so vividly when I was a boy at the time of the defeat of Mr. Gladstone\u2019s Home Rule, and the Liberal Unionist Party under Mr. Chamberlain\u2026 We worked for them; we did not oppose them, and in a few years looking back there was not a member of the Tory Party which did not rejoice at that infusion of fresh blood and fresh strength. I assure you that none of those who support the Ottawa Bill right through must suffer from it at the election.\u2019 I wonder whether the Liberal Associations who adopted those Members, and the Liberal electors who supported them, approve of and rejoice in this cordial welcome to them by Mr. Baldwin, as bringing an infusion of fresh blood and fresh strength to the Tory Party. Perhaps it was not kind and not tactful of Mr. Baldwin to have been so frank so soon.As for the policy embodied in the Ottawa Agreements, we have given in our letter of resignation the reasons for our condemnation of them, and I shall not repeat them. I shall limit myself now to giving some answer to the replies which have been attempted by those who defend the Agreements.The Dangers of Hard BargainingBy far the most important of our objections to the Ottawa Agree­ments is the view that we hold that they do damage to Imperial interests and imperil the whole future of the British Empire.This process of hard bargaining is very dangerous. Mr, Neville Chamberlain takes exception to our use of the words \u2018hard bargain­ing.\u2019 Speaking at Blackpool, he said: \u2018\u201cHard bargaining\u201d was a word invented by Free Traders in order to create prejudice.\u2019 In our letter it appears, but within quotation marks. It is taken from a letter to the Times, of September 5th, describing the Ottawa Conference, signed with the name of Mr. Amery. I am afraid that Mr. Amery\u2019s feelings will be hurt that his Protectionist colleague in Birmingham should describe a phrase of his as \u2018having been invented by Free Traders in order to create prejudice.\u2019 Hard bargaining there was, and much injury it has done, and this is the gravest aspect, I repeat, of the whole business.I am one of those who believe, and I feel sure that the great majority of you share the view, that on the whole, in spite of many failures, many blunders, and some follies, the existence of the British Common­wealth of Nations is a service to the world at large. Over a quarter of the whole globe there is mutual peace, and, as a rule, goodwill, and that quarter of the earth does influence for good the other three-quarters of mankind. It is untrue that Liberals have been indifferent to the problems of Empire. Our Commonwealth has been built up on Liberal principles. But for them it could not have endured, and never has more eloquent or more sincere expression been given to a noble and a wise Imperial patriotism than fell again and again from the lips of Gladstone. Indeed, I am one of those who would wish that the rest of mankind should imitate the principles of this Commonwealth of Nations. When we find at Geneva 60 nations gathered together endeavouring to frame some common policy the difficulties are very great. If only there could be groupings or federations, with full local autonomy, with full scope for variety of national characteristics; if that 60 could be reduced to 16, or even to 6, I believe that that would conduce to the welfare of mankind. But for the opposite to take place, for our own Commonwealth, as it is, to break up and dissolve, that would indeed be a disaster for us and an injury to the world. But that, according to Mr. Neville Chamberlain, was in prospect but for Ottawa. We must have this watery cement of tariffs and quotas, or the Empire will fall to pieces.Here I would draw your very special attention - because this goes to the very crux of the matter, to the very essence of the difference between us - I would draw your attention to these sentences from Mr. Neville Chamberlain\u2019s speech, and, after all, he is the hereditary high priest of this policy. \u2018When he first got to Ottawa,\u2019 he said, \u2018he had the impression that the ties binding the Empire had begun to get dangerously frayed, and if something were not done to change the tendency of recent years the time would come when disruption of the Empire would actually begin. He believed that great danger had been averted at Ottawa.\u2019 Is there one man in this country who would say that he would cast off the Dominions if they did not reserve their markets for our trade? Not one. Then why accuse the Dominions that they would cast loose from us if we would not reserve our markets for their trade? Why suggest that the love of the Dominions and Colonies for the Motherland is nothing more than cupboard love?The Conference of 1930 broke down on these trade matters. Did the Dominion representatives go away angry, resentful, filled with thoughts of separation? By no means. They said their policy was Canada first, or Australia first, and they understood fully that the Mother country had a complete right to consider also its own economic interests. I have no use for this new brand of pseudo-patriotism. I am one of those who regard it as a degradation of religion to consider it as based upon some personal benefit to be obtained whether in this world or in some other, and so it is a degradation of patriotism to make it dependent on a material advantage to be got out of it.\u2018St. George for the Meat Quota!\u2019If this is to be our doctrine we may roll up the colours of our regiments; we may haul down the White Ensign from our ships, we may lower the Union Jack on the Houses of Parliament, and adopt a new flag with a glorious device, the words: \u2018Tariff preference.\u2019 St. George for the Meat Quota! Rule Britannia, provided always there is 2s. a quarter duty on wheat! We shall have, no doubt, long and vehement discussions upon these Agreements, but I hope we shall hear no more of this commercialised prostitution of patriotic ideals.There have been set on foot political discussions that can only be harmful in many parts of the Empire. In Australia, Mr. Scullin, the Leader of the Opposition and ex-Prime Minister, looking at the matter from the opposite standpoint to that from which we look at it, has declared formally that he and his Party if they come into power will not regard these Agreements as valid.In Canada, Mr. Mackenzie King, the ex-Premier and Leader of the Opposition, criticises the Agreements most vehemently, and has declared that the attempt to establish them for five years and make them un­alterable is, in his view, and to use his own words, \u2018fundamentally wrong.\u2019He proposes a completely different plan, and his policy has been remarkably vindicated at a striking test by-election which took place in Canada only a few days ago. Here, in this country, both the Liberal and the Labour Parties contest the constitutional right of the present Government to try to make these Agreements unalterable by Parliament. This is not the occasion to argue in detail the constitutional aspect of what we regard as a grave departure; we shall do that from our places in Parliament, and we shall substantiate there our assertion that it is con­trary to the spirit and to the practice of our Constitution to deprive Parliament of the right to lower or to alter any of the duties which it imposes unless the assent has been obtained of His Majesty\u2019s Govern­ments in other parts of the Empire. The Liberals of an earlier day did not fight, as they did fight, to establish self-government for the Colonies, free from Downing Street control, as it used to be called, in order to establish the converse - that Ottawa or Canberra, Wellington or Pretoria, should control the actions of the Imperial Parliament at Westminster.The Slender \u2018Advantages\u2019 of the AgreementsSome trade advantages for our industries these Agreements un­doubtedly will bring. Mr. Neville Chamberlain says that we have declared them to be worthless. That is not an epithet we have used. On the contrary, in our letter of resignation we said that they would undoubtedly bring some benefit to some branches of our trade; but we assert that those benefits are comparatively small and often doubtful. The Agreements in all their details will be published tomorrow. You will see as their most conspicuous feature that they involve a flat refusal of anything approaching Empire Free Trade. The Australian Agree­ment, you will observe, fully justifies the statement of Mr. Bruce, the principal Australian delegate at Ottawa, that it involves no radical departure from Australia\u2019s fiscal policy, and we know what that is. In Canada, you will observe that the staple branches of our textile trades get practically no advantages, while the iron and steel concessions were arranged outside the Ottawa Conference by agreement between the industries concerned; and although there is a formula which appears to give some assurance for equal treatment for British goods in competition with the Dominions in their industries, that is vitiated by one most formidable exception. Any industry is taken right out of that provision and may be granted any protection, no matter how high, \u2018if\u2019 (and these are the words of the Agreement) \u2018it is not fully established and has reasonable prospects of success.\u2019 What industry in the Dominions is there which would not claim that it is not fully established and has reasonable prospects of success? We know well these infant industries in protected countries; infant industries forty years old, weighing 15 stone, but still wearing baby clothes and calling out for \u2018Nurse.\u2019 All of these are wholly excepted from these provisions, which are supposed to give an equal chance for British industries, and whatever small advantages there might be, in our view the disadvantages are greater.There is a whole range of food taxes, and that we most vehemently oppose. Mr. Chamberlain tells us that the foreigner will pay for the privilege of entering our markets. We are told that the dear food cry is a mere bogy raised for political purposes, but sometimes we get words of candour coming to us from distant quarters. Yesterday the Times reported that Mr. Latham, the Federal Attorney-General of the Dominion of Australia, said that \u2018the Agreements offered very fair advantages to Australia, while for Great Britain they involved the imposition of taxes on food and restrictive arrangements which would increase food prices.\u2019 There is testimony from a wholly impartial source. How can any member of the present Parliament who gave pledges - and many members of all Parties gave pledges against food taxes, how can any who under­took to their constituents that they would vote against the taxation of the people\u2019s food now consent by their vote in the House of Commons to implement these Agreements? For my part, at the beginning of the last General Election campaign, opening the campaign in a speech at a great meeting at Bradford, I stated clearly and categorically that the Liberal Party was opposed to tariffs upon foodstuffs, and we shall oppose now such measures with all the energy at our command.It is true that world prices have been dropping during the last twelve months, and that has neutralised the rise in retail prices that would other­wise have taken effect, but, when world prices begin to rise, then there will be complaints of the dearness of the cost of living, and then these food taxes will be swept away. Already there are, it appears, some doubts. In February Mr. Neville Chamberlain said in the House of Commons that they were clearing the way for the restoration of pros­perity. Then all was bright and hopeful, but last week, in October, Mr. Baldwin said at Blackpool: \u2018If Protection fails I do not see our Party sticking to the carcase of dead policies.\u2019 And there are some whiffs already of an unpleasant odour.As for the three purposes which were declared last year to be the objects of the adoption of tariffs, we never hear mentioned today the question of the balance of trade; that is wholly forgotten; its name is never heard. As for revenue, these duties will provide very little, and I think it is true to say that Protection by hampering trade and business always destroys more revenue than it brings. The third was, Tariffs to lower tariffs. What a mockery! Next month we shall have the World Conference, at which the British Government is to give the lead for the reduction of tariffs and the abolition of quotas, while this month it will be passing a Bill through Parliament, every clause of which imposes additional duties or authorises further restrictions, and, worst of all, would make many of them permanent and unalterable for a period of five years, no matter what the World Conference may propose or may agree. So much for Ottawa.Peace and DisarmamentOur policy, the Liberal policy, must be laid plainly before the country. We must face in our own way the problems that surround us. We must lay before the country the distinctive Liberal view. And what, in any declaration of Liberal policy, must have pride of place, must come first and foremost, beyond compare and beyond challenge? There can only be one answer: Peace and disarmament. In the old watch­word of Liberalism peace came first. We see in these days in the League of Nations the only hope of the world. When I was at Geneva this summer for several weeks, as many of our friends who were there will testify, I laboured long days and often far into the night to endeavour to secure the maximum agreement for the maximum disarmament to which the nations could be brought to consent. Great and formidable are the difficulties in bringing countries into line when the feeling of goodwill and loyal confidence is not there; but the spirit of the Versailles Treaty and the Versailles undertakings, no matter what their letter may say, do undoubtedly require the general disarmament of all Europe. I shall rejoice in the strong expressions of public opinion from Liberals, and from men and women of all Parties, here and in all countries, in the Parliaments and out of them, which may help to save the Confer­ence from the grave dangers which do now threaten it, and will help to bring it to the full success which the hopes and the needs of mankind so imperatively require.Liberals are reformers. We exist to promote progress, to make head­way against poverty, to enlarge the opportunities for all men and women to live a full life. I care deeply for these things. I came into politics, now forty years ago, for the sake of social reform. If Liberalism does not stand for that I take no special interest in it. But social reformers are terribly handicapped in these days by the financial situation and by the immense and excessive burden of taxation. The war has made the whole country poorer. You cannot blow off into nothingness the value of ten thousand million pounds\u2019 worth of labour and not make any difference to all who are affected. Our first task has been to maintain financial stability; financial stability is the first condition of social pro­gress. We have restored it during the last twelve months with great difficulty and with much sacrifice. Our prime duty now is to see that that financial stability is not imperilled.The channels of trade must be freedThe World Conference may bring about monetary changes and bring help to a troubled world through those monetary changes; but they must be international, and with regard to them there is as yet no agreement. But there is universal agreement on one great world problem, and that is that it would be wise to free the channels of trade, that the choking of those channels of trade is the chief single cause of the world depression that is now pressing upon all the nations and throwing tens of millions of working people out of employment. There is universal agreement that the channels of trade must be freed. All say it, but the difference is that, while some are trying to get it done, others - and in this country perhaps more at this moment than anywhere else - are busy choking up yet more than before the very channels of trade it was their duty to clear. We should like to see this country enter into regional agreements for lower tariffs such as have already been entered into by Belgium and Holland. We should like to see us develop our trade with the one half of mankind that live in three countries, China, India and Russia. Large opportunities are there for the expansion of our trade and for bringing people into employment. Russia, with its 150 millions of population, in a state of active industrial development - their Government is their affair, not ours. We did not scruple to trade with the Russia of the Tsars. Why should we scruple to trade with the Russia of the Soviets?In this great matter of unemployment we see before our eyes, adver­tised in the press every day, the fact of enormous accumulations of un­used capital. The great conversions of War Loan so brilliantly successful give proof of it. They are a very good sign as to British credit, but a very bad sign as to British trade; they show that there is no active demand for money in industry and in commerce; and many of our industries, some that are more depressed, than any, like iron and steel and building, depend for their welfare upon the expenditure of capital which supplies a demand for their products and services. In our view the time has come when lending should not be discouraged but en­couraged, whether for private or for public enterprise - I draw no distinction between them - provided that no heavy burden is being imposed upon rates and taxes and that we do not run the risk of again having a great deficit in our Budget.Those are some lines upon which we believe that Liberal policy may proceed, and Liberalism must have an agricultural policy (A Voice: \u2018We have one.\u2019), active and definite, based upon science, upon marketing, upon land tenure reform, including the encouragement of small holdings. As one friend says, up in the Hall, \u2018We have one,\u2019 and a good programme it is, for England, Wales and Scotland, and the time will soon come when we should actively propagate it through­out the country. Industrial relations, the proposals in \u2018Britain\u2019s Industrial Future,\u2019 those must not be forgotten; and there is electoral reform at home, and in the Empire the building up that great edifice of self-government in India, of which Lord Lothian is one of the principal architects.Only in a few brief words have I been able to sketch out the policy which must be the main objective of Liberalism at headquarters and throughout the country in the months and years that are at hand. But let us be careful, in promulgating these ideas among the electorate, not to go one inch in promises beyond the prospects of fulfilment. Let us be scrupulous about it and understate our case rather than over­state it. The Labour Party has brought upon itself great discredit by the opposite course. It aroused high hopes among some of the keenest progressive minds in the country. Many of them have been discouraged by its adoption of an impracticable Socialism. I was one of those who hoped after the last Election that the lesson of that Election would have been learned, and that the Labour Party would adopt a carefully considered policy which would stand the test of practice, opening the possibility to some future co-operation between what are called the \u2018Parties of the Left.\u2019 That has not come about; the tendency has been just the opposite; and therefore on Liberals and on Liberals alone rests the duty of prudent, progressive leadership of the nation. So tonight I beg our friends to strengthen our organisations in the con­stituencies - now, in good time. By-elections may occur anywhere at any moment, and the next few by-elections within the next few months may have most important results upon the whole future of British politics. The date of a General Election is always uncertain. In politics it is always unsafe to prophesy, but I am inclined to think that, in view of the character of the last Election and the mandate given to this Parliament, it is unlikely that this Parliament will run its full term; it may fall very far short of it. Let us, then, heighten our zeal, expand our numbers, concentrate our ranks, say clearly what we mean to do, claim national support, and do it. We cannot rest with the country as it is. We in our generation must labour in order to restore to it its prosperity and its greatness, and make it worthy of its past.

aVMr. Baldwin, who was received with cheers, said another year had spent its course, and he had to congratulate them on having once more come through the great annual conference of the Party successfully, and in pretty good temper.  Once more they had discussed a number of subjects.  They had brought knowledge and skill to the elucidation of difficult questions, and he and those who were counted among the leaders of the Party were grateful to them for the clear manner in which they showed them of what they were thinking and where they would like them to go.He thought in many ways their conduct of business and the way in which they applied themselves to practical politics compared not unfavourably with what had taken place at the Socialist conference in the South of England.  (Laughter)  He had not yet been able to acquaint himself with all that passed that afternoon in their discussions on agriculture, but, without having done so, he would hazard a guess that in that great hall all who had heard him would feel that the Minister of Agriculture was the right man in the right place - (applause) - that for knowledge of his subject, sympathy with those for whom he had to work, rapidity of action when necessary, he would be hard to beat.Their other topics he had followed with much interest, but it might be that before he had finished they would consider he had dealt with the root of the problem which they discussed on the previous morning in a manner that he hoped would not be out of sympathy with their views.The Financial RecoveryAs usual, he had to cover a great deal of ground.  He had to indicate to them what, in his view, were the problems immediately facing the government of the country, and possibly to point out things which might have escaped their notice, but must be borne in mind and weighed in forming a judgment as to the line the Government should take on them.  If he omitted any subject of particular interest to any individual present, he hoped that he or she would remember that, after all, that was but one speech, that he would have many other opportunities of addressing audiences in the country, and not run away with the impression that because he did not refer to a subject or deal with it at any length, that subject was not of any importance, or one which he did not value or recognise.He wanted first of all, Mr. Baldwin continued, to say a word or two on the financial position of the country.  Of all the things which this Administration was put into the power to do, the first thing, the most clamant, the most urgent, the most necessary, was the restoration of the credit of the country. \u2018I claim without fear of contradiction,\u2019 said Mr. Baldwin, \u2018that now, at the expiration of two years, that task has been performed with a courage and skill that merits the gratitude of the country.\u2019  (Applause)Britain\u2019s CreditHe was saying this with less reserve because he was only an ordinary Minister in the Government and they had the Chancellor of the Exchequer there.  The credit of the country was his especial responsibility; and as would be admitted by his colleagues, by the House of Commons and by the country, he had established a revolution.\u2018Two years ago,\u2019 Mr. Baldwin reminded his audience, \u2018our credit had nearly gone. Today, in a world of much less wealth than that before the war, our credit stands high and as unassailable as it ever has done.  But here I would remind you that, with that task before us, everything had to make way for it.  Great Britain without credit is like Samson without his locks.  It was our credit that was the greatest asset to us and to our Allies during the long term of the war; and if you feel anxiety \u2013 and anxiety is not foreign to our breasts \u2013 as to our position with armaments, remember the balance of risks that had to be run.  We felt that at the time the financial risks were so grave, so serious for our country, that until we were in a position where we could feel that these risks no longer existed, everything must give way and must wait.  That has been the situation.A Long Way to Go\u2018Greatly as the financial situation has improved, it is bringing in its train what touches more nearly the homes of our people, and that is a trade and an industrial improvement.  I am never given, I hope, to words of extravagance.  I have spoken candidly in the past two years but with reserve \u2013 so much so, indeed, that if I ever say things might be worse those who indulge in the cult of headlines call me an optimist.  But I do say deliberately today that the trade of the country is better, it is much better, than twelve months ago, and I will add this \u2013 it is better than the trade in any other industrial country in the world today.\u2018That does not mean that it is all right yet.  We have a long way to go, but we are moving forward with hope, and knowing that our heads are in the right direction.\u2019European FearsHe wanted them to bear in mind that this was a country depending largely on export trade, and some time there would come a saturation point, a point when we had advanced in the direction of prosperity as far as we cold advance on our own without world improvement.\u2018And I want to say a very serious word or two on that question.  World conditions are not good.  They are affected largely by economic conditions, but there is a psychological cause over and above the economic \u2013 an absence of confidence.  I particularly want to put this to you because, living in this island, we do not always realise the psychology of foreign nations.  That want of confidence is largely the child of fear, and fear on the continent of Europe is the fear of war.  We have smiled at that, and felt that now this nation and now this suffering from undue apprehension.  It may be; it may not be; but you have the fact to recognise, and that is one reason \u2013 if, indeed, there were no other - why it is imperative, if it can be done, to bring about a disarmament convention.A Real Limitation\u2018I know there are many sections in our party who think lightly of these matters.  But I want them to think them out.  First of all, let me say this: When I spoke about disarmament convention I did not mean disarmament on the part of this country and not on the part of any other.  I mean a limitation of armaments, a real limitation, such a one that if we, by the many gestures we have made of disarmament, find ourselves on some lower rating than the figures in such a convention, and some other country has higher figures, that country has to come down and we go up until we meet.  (Applause)  No other form of convention would be negotiated by the Government; no other form of convention is in contemplation.  But even to get that may be difficult, and if it be attained, in my view \u2013 and I am sure you will agree with me \u2013 it will be of vital importance to see that every signatory to that convention carries out what is in that convention in the letter and in the spirit.Sanctity of Agreements\u2018I would only add this: If that convention be signed, the nation that breaks it will have no friend in this civilised world.  The same is true of any nation which deliberately prevents such an agreement being reached by putting forward demands which might be acceptable after a time, but which would not be accepted today to the other co-signatories. But \u2013 and really I apologise even for alluding to this \u2013 there is a fear in the world that our country has less regard than she had for the sanctity of agreements entered into since the war which might contribute to the peace of Europe.  I say this, and I take the Treaty of Locarno as the most typical one, that Great Britain has signed she will adhere to.  (Hear, hear)  She adhered to her signature in regard to Belgium; her signature in these agreements is sacred.\u2019  (Applause)The Penalty of FailureHe wished to say a word as to the possible failure of a Disarmament Convention.  Governments had to contemplate success or failure.  There were many people who believed quite sincerely that it would not make much difference to the world.  \u2018Well,\u2019 added Mr. Baldwin, \u2018it would make this difference: the fears of which I spoke in the event of failure to agree might well become panic in some countries, and if there were no prospect of the limitation of armaments there is no country but would put to itself the question, \u201cAre we secure with our present armaments?\u201d  And I think myself, with my knowledge of the world and of world politics, that the answer to that question today in many countries would be \u201cNo, we are not safe.\u201d\u2019\u2018I see that problem drawing nearer and nearer to us until it grips us by the throat, that problem of rearmament and all that it involves.  If rearmament began in Europe you may say \u201cgoodbye\u201d to any restoration of cuts and to any reduction of taxation for a generation.\u2019It was just as well to face these things, and realise what it was they were up against.  With many nations, or with some nations, the expenditure that would be involved in increasing armaments would bring them much nearer to financial catastrophe; it might even bankrupt some, and they might imagine from that what the effect would be on the trade of the world.  Psychologically they would be back in 1914, with more knowledge than they had then.\u2018I have never disguised my own view,\u2019 added Mr. Baldwin, \u2018that another war in Europe would be the end of the civilisation we know.  Few can be so careless, so ignorant as not to have noticed how the very foundation of our mid-European and Western-European civilisation have rocked in these last fifteen years.  They cannot stand a second explosion akin to the one that wrought such damage at that time.\u2019They could not wonder, said Mr. Baldwin, at the anxiety with which the government was endeavouring, in every way it could, to ensure some agreement with regard to the limitation of arms.  (Applause)There were many people who said: \u2018Well, cut away from Europe; cut out from Europe.\u2019  It always struck him that before the intention of the internal combustion engine that might have been an arguable proposition.  Today he thought it was both crude and childish.  Traffic in the air was only beginning. The air linked them to the Continent in a manner that would not have been thought of by their parents, but very often those who expressed their desire said at the same time: \u2018Let us devote our minds to our empire.\u2019\u2018That,\u2019 said Mr. Baldwin, amid cheers, \u2018we have been doing, and not without success.\u2019  He had much else to speak of that night, and he hoped to speak on those subjects later in the year but he would like to say in Birmingham that when he came back from Ottawa he told his friends it would be twelve months before they saw the results of their work.  He thought they were seeing the results, and not only the material results, which they had seen particularly in the increase in their Indian trade, but they had seen in the recent Budget in Australia a most welcome token of how the spirit of Ottawa, without which nothing could be done, was working in the financial policy of that great Dominion.The Fruits of OttawaRecalling what was done at Ottawa, Mr. Baldwin said the influence of statesmanship would be found in the decisions there, and as we went on decade after decade, generation after generation, drawing more closely together in our trade, in our methods, he hoped and believed that some would be able to look back to the work that was done at Ottawa and say that, although at the moment there was not much done that struck the imagination, yet the foundations that were laid there firmly, securely and well.  (Applause)There had been criticism of agreements that had been made by the Government with foreign nations.  \u2018You never hear criticism from the seller who is satisfied,\u2019 said Mr. Baldwin amidst cheers.  Many had benefited by these agreements, but it was true that in many agreements they made under the tariff system, they had to give something away to get something; and in giving something away somebody was a little less well off than he was before, but a great deal better off than he was two years ago before we had a tariff.  When they looked into one of the last of such agreements \u2013 that with the Argentine \u2013 they would feel that something substantial had been won by the process of bargaining.Conservative PrinciplesAt such a meeting, where they were all of one way thought \u2013 with minor differences \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 he would say a few words on a subject to which he had given a good deal of attention. He sometimes heard it said: \u2018Let us get down to Conservative principles.\u2019  When he wanted to now all about Conservative principles, he went back, and always had done, and always would, to Disraeli.  Disraeli, after all was the founder of modern Conservatism.  He breathed new life into the party after it had been broken up at the time of the introduction of Free Trade.  His words lived, his personality lived, his influence lived.  He never shrank from democracy; he never shrank from change.What he shrank from was stagnation, and he shrank from destruction of anything \u2013 sheer destruction.  \u2018His policy,\u2019 said Mr. Baldwin, \u2018our policy \u2013 sometimes neglected but always the base of the fundamental beliefs of our party \u2013 was the condition of our people, the Empire and the Constitution.  And, indeed, no more Liberal statesman in the true sense of the word than Disraeli ever lived.Memories of Mr. J. Chamberlain\u2018There was much criticism at the time of his extension of the borough franchise of 1867, but by that he brought in a vast body of the working people of this country to correct the influence of the bourgeoisie , and it is a remarkable fact, which I want you to bear in mind, that with the advent of the people into politics at that time those attacks of the intelligentsia on the Monarchy which had characterised the earlier years of the reign of Queen Victoria died away, and the Monarchy gradually took a place in the hearts and the souls and the minds of the British people more deep, more fervent than it had ever occupied before, a place which it occupies today.\u2019  (Applause)Disraeli was the first great statesman who took up the question of health.  He gave a charter to the trade unions.  He passed some of the earliest Acts in connection with housing, which were taken advantage of to the benefit of the city of Birmingham by the father of Mr. Neville Chamberlain.  (Applause)In that hall he could not omit reference to another man who, after Disraeli\u2019s death, breathed new life certainly into the younger men of the Conservative party.  He came to them from the Radicals, and his name was Joseph Chamberlain.  He rejoiced to think that Mr. Joseph Chamberlain found in the leaders of that day \u2013 Lord Salisbury, Mr. Balfour and Mr. W. H. Smith \u2013 men with whom he could work in perfect sympathy, and men who helped him and, with his aid, obtained for this country county councils and free education.Disraelian ConservatismHe would make no comparison with those days, but it was interesting to remember that Mr. Chamberlain then found more sympathy, more willingness to go forward and less desire to stagnate among the Tory leaders than among some of the rank and file.  (Laughter)Mr. Joseph Chamberlain protested against the tendency to sag into the old negative habits.  \u2018There is no tendency today, I am thankful to say,\u2019 said Mr. Baldwin, \u2018but remember those words: \u201cLong after I have gone, whoever is leading you, remember that when the old tendency to sag comes, kick the party into some kind of life and don\u2019t let \u2019em do it.\u201d\u2019Mr. Chamberlain knew that conventional Conservatism could never hold the country, and it could not.  It was Disraelian Conservatism that had as its main objects the well-being of the people of this country, their progress, their well-being in every direction, spiritual and material, and a devotion to Constitution with which they could always win, but if they sagged into the old negative habit they never would.Mr. Baldwin recalled the last speech of Mr. Chamberlain in Bingley Hall.  Mr. Chamberlain, he said, left with them a legacy of Tariff reform, and they had seen that policy carried with enthusiasm by the whole country and so established that it would endure for many years.ExperimentsA Conservative policy, he said, should never frighten our people if it meant change.  \u2018We are living in times when change is necessary, when it is essential.  We are going, as it were, through uncharted seas economically and industrially, and I myself would shrink from no methods \u2013 nor would my colleagues \u2013 if they felt they were methods that would help the country.\u2018You see these new methods being tried today.  You have had a discussion on them this afternoon with regard to agriculture.  We are experimenting; experiments must go on, and I am quite sure that all those who look back, as every Tory must look back, to Disraeli for inspiration will never be afraid to go forward, and will never shrink responsibility because it is not one that has been borne by someone else before.\u2019Proletarian Hitlerism\u2018And now, for a few moments,\u2019 said Mr. Baldwin, \u2018I wish to speak to you about the maintenance of the constitution.  In the last century, those of us engaged in political life \u2013 and I was in a humble sphere \u2013 used to speak of the maintenance of the Constitution; but really there was very little to threaten it.  There have been in the last century growls about the Monarchy, growls about the Second Chamber, but that is all.  And, indeed, it is curious to think that in this year of Grace our Constitution, of all others, should be challenged at all.\u2018Our Constitution is no ready-made article.  It has grown through the centuries, as native to our country and to our people as oak or ash or thorn.  It has seen changes; it has seen revolutions.  It has seen the country struggling against mighty forces; it has seen her triumph.\u2018It has given her people freedom and it has taught her people the difference between freedom and license.  And this is the Constitution that is being threatened today, not quite openly yet, but tendenciously, by the sketching of a course of action by the Socialist Party in their conference that, if it takes place, means destruction of the Constitution.\u2018You may disguise that as much as you like, but in effect, to take away executive power from the House of Commons is the way in which every tyranny starts.  It is a proletarian Hitlerism, and it is nothing else, and it can be nothing else.  I want you to realise it in time.Task for Rank and FileI have spoken about it already on the platform.  I warned the people some months ago, but I want to tell you this: This is an Inkerman, a rank and a file engagement.  The problems today are so continuous. So multifarious \u2013 what time have we to come down into the country and become continually talking on these subjects?  We cannot do it.  But does not it point out to you the absolute necessity of maintaining, of recreating, if necessary, your organisation, your associations right through the country, and equipping yourselves \u2013 don\u2019t go into this struggle unequipped \u2013 to deal with the arguments that will be used, and explaining what that kind of stuff which is being put out at Socialist conferences really means and what it will lead to if persisted in?  (Applause)\u2018In the defence, the maintenance of the Constitution, you will be fighting for one of the fundamental principles of the Conservatism, of Conservatism since there was such a thing politically.  But it is not only a fundamental principle of Conservatism; it is a principle deep down in the hearts of millions of Englishmen who do not belong to our party or any party.  Join hands with all of them who will fight that thing to the death, who will lay it out flat and beat it and knock it out.  (Cheers)These schemes are not of English origin.  They belong to countries who do not know what freedom means and who have not been able to maintain Parliamentary Government.  They are alien in their traditions, they are alien in their action.  And, for myself, I would only repeat the words of a great Englishman who lived in the seventeenth century, and of whom I am a great admirer.  In speaking of himself and his friends he said this: \u201cFor the earth of England he would rather die than see a spire of English grass trampled down by a foreign trespasser.  He thinketh there are a great many of his mind, for all plants are apt to his taste of the soil in which they grow, and we that grow here have a root that produceth in us a stalk of English juice which is not to be changed by grafting or foreign infusions.\u201d\u2019  (Loud cheers)

aVAt a meeting of this kind, it is essential for me to say a few words on the record of the present Government. I do this for this reason. Political memories are short - there is no gratitude in politics. All the same, if you are going to engage a gardener or a clerk, or even a trade union secretary, what is the first question you ask? What is his record? I am con­vinced from what I hear that the rank and file in the country do not realise the magnitude of the work that this Government has done. I beg of you, as those who, by your presence here tonight, prove your attachment to your party, your keenness for the political education of your countrymen and your country­women, to accomplish it, to polish up, if need be, the propaganda departments in all your constituencies, and to see to it that by the time the General Election comes no one who will register his or her vote shall be in ignorance of the remarkable achieve­ments during the last three years, and I hope, during the rest of our term, of this Government.First and foremost, I want to stress the subject which is close to the heart of everyone in this country, the one by which Government after Government has been, and will be, judged; that is the question of the employment of our people. Remember this - that just over three years ago, when the Government was formed, there were 9,300,000 people at work, and this August, 10,170,000 - 800,000 more people actually at work who would have been workless. In the state of the world that is an amazing achievement. But I, as you, am not yet content. I doubt, indeed, if I ever shall be content in my lifetime. But remember that our opponents have put it about that the recovery of trade in this country is of no credit to the Government because it is part of a world recovery. You have simply got to look; I do not refer you to any polemical figures, but to the official figures of the League of Nations.If you compare the industrial outlook and the figures of six years ago with the first six months of this year, in comparison with 1928 you will find the industrial outlook improved in com­parison with other countries. The industrial output is down in Germany by 15 per cent; Italy by 17 per cent; France by 19 per cent; Holland by 24 per cent; Belgium 20 per cent; United States 25 per cent; Poland 38 per cent; Czechoslovakia 32 per cent. In Great Britain it is 4 per cent up.We owe this excellent state of affairs to the tariffs granted. Those are the things for which many of us have worked so long during the dark years. And I think we may fairly say that, whatever happens now, no opponents of ours are going to abolish the existing tariffs. It would be wearisome to speak in detail of what they have accomplished, but if you take one of the greatest depressed industries, the steel production of the country has steadily reached over 700,000 tons a month against an average of 430,000 tons only three years ago. Those of you acquainted with the industries of this country will recognise that the pro­ductive and industrial efficiency of this country under the shelter of tariffs is now increasing in many of the industries of Great Britain.As I have here representatives from all parts of the country and many from the industrial areas, I will take a few minutes of your time in just alluding to one or two of the things which have been discussed for the benefit of industry, and the observa­tions heard about them. They all deal with employment. I think most of us would agree, and I ask you to give your con­sideration to these questions, that it is practically impossible to make the working of overtime in industry illegal. But I want to say that when there are so many wholly unemployed it does seem obviously unfair that others should be working longer than their normal hours except to meet special occasions. I do appeal to every firm which is regularly working overtime to think out carefully whether, by organising their hours, they can eliminate regular overtime, and thereby give employment to additional workmen during the normal hours. I suggest it is a national duty to make that effort.The Government is establishing junior instruction centres all over the country, under the new Employment Act for un­employed boys and girls, and this is the most practical way of dealing with this juvenile problem. Lord Halifax, the Minister of Education, explained why, in his opinion, it would be less successful than many believe as an aid to reducing unemployment to increase the school age. I need not go into that now, but we believe that by the creation of these centres we are going to strike a good blow in this excellent cause that we believe will be of great benefit to the young people.Now we have heard a good deal of discussion about getting rid of the older men from industry. But there again I doubt very much whether it would have a great deal of popular support. If the Government took upon itself to say to men at a certain age \u2018Out you go,\u2019 it certainly could not be done without making State provision for them. In these times that would be almost a more serious matter to face than we could do at present.There is something very hard in turning out competent men still able to work, who, perhaps, owing to the circumstances of their lives have not been able to make provision sufficient for their old age. To compel them to give up work in full possession of their powers, all their faculties, and say, whatever their circum­stances may be, \u2018Out you go\u2019 - I do not think the Government could do that.A matter that is being discussed a good deal now is the shorter working week, and on that I would like to make one or two observations. The progress of science and mechanical progress has brought the shorter working week undoubtedly within the realms of possibility in some industries, but I do not believe that in the immediate future any country, or probably any industry in any country, is in a position to introduce it fully. Everyone is in sympathy with it. We favour the prospect of shorter working hours throughout the world. We do not believe the time has come yet when the Convention which has been proposed at the International Labour Office can be introduced. We do not believe the plan would work we do not believe that the principal countries of the world would ratify it at present. Much more knowledge has to be gained, much more progress has to be made; but we do welcome every experiment - and experiments are most valuable - by individual employers and by individual industries in trying out a shorter working week. We should also welcome international agreements arrived at industry by industry if such agreements were possible, and we are anxious to see, from that point of view, one great reform that is due, if not overdue - that is, an international convention to regulate the hours of work in coal mines. We have seen that some firms in this country have adopted a system of work sharing. I think that is a sensible and healthy practice. It is not adaptable to all industries; it is not adaptable in all places. But I would like to see many more employers and men considering whether it would be a right and possible thing for them to introduce in the industries with which they are connected.Just one word about the distressed areas. I have no information to give you, but you all know that a report is being considered that was drawn up by some Members of Parliament and some non-members who visited those districts to make a report to the Government. I am satisfied that whatever we may think fit to do, and whatever we may do either on these reports or in amplification of them, we shall have your full sympathy and support. On our part, I undertake that we shall take whatever action we may find possible and appropriate at the earliest moment possible.Now I want to say a few words about the agricultural industry. The Government are resolved, as you can see by what they have done, that this great industry, which is of incalculable value to the nation, shall be once more put on its legs. All measures taken and to be taken have the one aim of stopping the influx from the country to the town and main­taining a contented community on the land. Those things cannot be done in a moment, but for the first time for years we succeeded last year in stopping the terrible decline of people employed on the land. New plans have yet to be made. Existing ones will very likely have to be revised in the light of experience, for we have not been afraid to experiment, and experiment boldly. We have set our hands to the plough and we have no intention of turning back until the furrow is ploughed. We have diffi­culties. You all know what they are. We have, as far as is practicable, to reconcile the increased production of food in this country with the prosperity of our Dominions, without damaging our export trade and without damaging our shipping. To some extent these various things run counter to each other, and it requires the most delicate steering lest we do more harm in one direction than we are doing good in another. But believe me, whatever our critics may say, the Government as a whole and the Ministry of Agriculture in particular, have all these facts and all these aspects only too vividly before them. We believe we can bring back prosperity to agriculture without doing anything that would jeopardise the chance of opening new or re-opening old markets and without unduly affecting the serious difficulties under which our great shipping industry is being conducted.There is, of course, another subject closely touching the Dominions and giving us much anxiety - the question of migra­tion. Had migration continued since the war on the same scale as before the war, our unemployment problem would be a mere bagatelle. World conditions, the fall in prices, and the economic blizzard have struck the Dominions as hard as they have struck us and Europe. At the moment there seems little prospect of emigration such as we have known in the past, but we have the subject constantly under review. That admirable Under-Secretary, Mr. Malcolm MacDonald, deservedly popular in our Party in the House, has gone to Australia to take part in the celebrations there, and the most important work he has to do is to discuss the situation as it is there today. He will also see what it is likely to be in the next few years and when the first opportunity is likely to arise when this question can be seriously re-opened - a vital question not only to this country, but also to our Dominions.I do beg of you that, when you come to discuss in your constituencies what the Government is doing, and has done, you make yourselves familiar with all that is being done and that has been done this year and that will be done under the new Bill on overcrowding and housing in this country. It is a simply amazing record, and I say that because it may be a sad thing to confess, but there are precious few members in this Government who are good advertisers. Perhaps it is not too much to ask that while we are working as we are working - and I can tell you that I have put in as much work during the past three years as I have ever put in in three years in my life - you should sound a few cheerful notes on a trumpet. I can never find it in my heart to put it to my lips. I know that you have been discussing certain aspects of the housing question in regard to compensation of condemned properties. All that I can tell you is that I shall weigh with the greatest care what you have said. I will consult my own colleagues about it, and we will see what the trouble is that is apparently causing a good deal of anxiety in many breasts.Two by-elections are imminent - those at Lambeth and Swindon - and I hope that those in contiguous constituencies will do all they can to see that National candidates are elected. Don\u2019t let us make the mistake of thinking that by-elections do not matter - that our majority is too big. It is true, as far as voting goes, we can afford to lose a seat or two, but the loss of a seat always has a moral effect. It depresses the workers in the constituency. We should not let a constituency feel that it is fighting in a corner by itself, but rather that it has your sympathy and help.I have said something to you about what we have been doing and trying to do. I want to talk quite seriously to you on some thoughts which have been passing through my mind during the last year and I think are not inapplicable to the political situation which we see in this country and in Europe. When the first Reform Bill, a little over a century ago, was passed, the bulk of the Tories, as they then called themselves, believed they would be excluded from power for ever, and that the country and the Empire would be destroyed. I am old enough to remember the Reform Bill of 1885 and the giving of the franchise to the agricultural labourer. Sixteen years ago there was universal suffrage, since when the Tory Party has been the greatest numerical party in that combination - and in my view for this reason, that the Tory Party has always been a National Party. I do not mean a class party, I mean a party that acts for all classes.Some people say I am a supporter of Liberal principles. That phrase used to annoy me, as I do not know what Liberal principles are. Similarly when some of my friends write to me and say: \u2018I wish you would give me some more Tory principles or govern in accordance with Tory principles,\u2019 I say to myself, \u2018What are Tory principles?\u2019 Before I come to what they are just let us ask ourselves whether it is always easy to know what they are, because there does not exist any gospel of Tory principles which can tell you what principles to apply to the changing principles in a changing world. In the early days of the two-party system, when Whigs and Tories first took shape, there was a National Government, and it was formed with a very excellent object - it was to fight the French, and to fight the French to prevent the French Crown having a completely predominant position in Europe. A great many Tories left that National Government because there was more interest in pro­secuting legislation against Dissenters than in beating the French.At the time of the Canada Bill, the first Bill that gave self­-government to any part of the British Empire, the Duke of Wellington said he could not support it, and that its passing would mean the absolute disruption of the Empire. Sir Robert Peel did not like it, but he said he would support it because the dangers of not passing it were greater than passing it. Is it the right policy to refuse self-government in the Dominions or not? I should like some clear answers to these questions when asked what are Tory principles.Disraeli brought in a Reform Bill in 1867, I think, and in 1874, in Mr. Disraeli\u2019s Government, we gave a charter of liberty to the Trade Unions, for which the Tory Government was thanked formally by a Labour member. Twenty years later the Tory Government refused to remodel that Bill to meet modern needs. What was the true Tory policy? Extra­ordinarily difficult to answer are these questions. They are questions which I should like to have answered, but if we want to ascertain the basic principles on which our Party rests we have to go back to the recreator of that policy after it was broken to bits in the second quarter of the nineteenth century - Mr. Disraeli.In an autobiography written by a friend who was with me at Harrow the author had quoted me as saying that Disraeli would live as the gospel of the future. So you see what a dogged little Tory I was at 17. Disraeli laid our principles down at the Crystal Palace many years ago, and you cannot go wrong if you stick to them. They were, \u2018the maintenance of our institutions and of our religion; the preservation of our Empire, and the improvement in the condition of our people.\u2019 That does not tell you how you are to adapt your policy in changed circumstances and changed ages. That is the duty of a leader. The responsibility - and it is a great responsibility - that rests with a leader is to try and adapt the policy according to the deep-laid foundations of the Party principles to meet whatever may come in this world.Equally as it is the duty and the responsibility of the leader to do that, it is the right of the Party, if they think fit, to challenge its interpretation. That is democratic. If in sufficient numbers they can challenge it so that it inevitably leads to the choice of a new leader; that is democratic, and that is the way we do things. But I want to say that I am at present leader of this party, and so long as I lead I am going to lead it. After all, I think our Party as a whole has risen marvellously to the demands that have been made upon it since the War. What experience had any of us of this age in which we live and yet how many of us, and especially our younger men, have got a true realisation of the age? And that is largely why there is so much confidence felt in us in the country. I think many people have realised what is the truth - that a great deal of this feeling of restlessness in the country is not a revolt of the \u2018have nots\u2019 against the \u2018haves.\u2019 It is something deeper and more honourable than that. It is a revolt against the subordination of the human to the mechanical, of the creative to the commercial function, and the recognition that there can be no permanent social order in any country except by the full recognition of the social needs and social ends of men and women.\u2018Improvement of the conditions of the people.\u2019 Never did those words mean more than they do now. There is going to be more leisure than there has ever been, more unemployment than there was before the War, until the world is properly adjusted. This is the social problem we have to face - to prepare the people to use their increased leisure worthily and to see to it that those who cannot get work do not lose their manhood and their woman­hood. We Tories, as part of our heritage, have a profound sense of the value of historic continuity and of our great Constitution, and it is a remarkable thing that in some of those years when all the world was rattled soon after the War there were Englishmen who said, \u2018Look at America and Italy, and even look at Russia; see what they are doing.\u2019 You do not hear so much of that now.Did you notice in the last fortnight that the French Prime Minister and the President of the United States each bade their people look across the sea to this little island?People look with wonder at this island and say, \u2018How is it that you have stability which does not seem to exist in any other country in the world?\u2019 The answer is that our Constitution has grown in that way, and the great danger of tampering with it is not the danger of changing it, but the danger of cutting out roots which go down to the very beginning of our history and to our very being.I call on you to stand when the next Election comes as you stood at the last Election - to stand for the maintenance of our institutions and the preservation of our Empire and the improvement of the conditions of the people - in the full and certain knowledge that if you do this then indeed there is no fear for the future of England. She will be preserved once more by those things which, as Disraeli said, are of more value than her accumulated capital - her cumulative experience, her traditions, her character and her people.

aVAt this critical moment you will not be surprised if I devote nearly the whole of my speech to a consideration of current events and their reactions in this country.I propose to speak about what is present in all your minds tonight, and must have been for some little time, and will, I fear, be for a little time yet.  Let us try to do a little clear thinking and clarify the issues that lie before us.There has always been a not unnatural feeling in some sections of our Party that while the ideal of a League of Nations is a great one, there are practical difficulties connected with it that render it extremely doubtful whether we can, or should, give it wholehearted support.I am not speaking of the moment.  I am speaking of the past, and I want us, for a moment, to consider why it was that the League of Nations was started and why the desire for its foundation found an echo in the hearts of so many of our fellow countrymen.It is no new thing that, after a great war, the world should feel it ought to be possible to make some arrangement to devise some mechanism that might make such experiences impossible in the future.  No such scheme, no such machinery has yet been devised.  But, I think, what we all felt, at the end of the War, was that war had taken on a new face.There was something that differentiated the last war from all previous wars, and it was this \u2013 that the march of science had placed a power of slaughter into the ranks of modern armies that no armies in the past had ever possessed.That very nearly resulted, in Europe, in throwing back our civilisation for generations, and people felt that at the rate at which science was progressing it might well be that these perils and dangers might be magnified many-fold in ten or twenty years, and that an effort to make war, if not impossible, difficult in its inception should be taken by humanity, lest its civilisation should be wiped out.There is no doubt in my mind that, had the whole world joined the League of Nations, and had the will to restrain war been there, the League could have prevented war.There are various \u2013 I am not going to specify \u2013 important nations outside the League, and the task is more difficult, but if the task be abandoned now, all chance will be gone of what may still be possible, to get the nations of the world inside it.But there is a school of thought, and it is sometimes connected with those who share very much the views that I and many others hold on Imperial questions.  It is the isolation school, who would fetch us out of the League, and who would believe that this country and the Empire would be safer outside than in.I want to say a word or two about that, because I believe that to be a fundamental and most dangerous heresy at the moment and far more dangerous in the future.  I believe it to be dangerous on National and Imperial grounds.  I believe it, in short, to be impossible.I come again to the march of science that is only beginning.  The world is infinitely closer today owing to the facilities of modern transport than it has ever been, and it will get closer.  Frontiers, which a few short years ago were simply defined and easy to guard, are now neither.  They are not simply defined and they are not easy to guard.The reduction of distance, now that flying is making the strides that it does \u2013 if that be not a mixed metaphor \u2013 the effect on this country, so far as its defence goes, is very much as though the land which was submerged in far-distant geological ages, and gave way to that stretch of water between us and the continent of Europe, were once again rising, and making a bridge over which people might pass, and on which we might well, some day, have to defend ourselves.Let us never forget this.  The centre of our Empire, and, so far as we can see, for many generations to come, lies in, and will lie in, this Island.  If this Island perish with all that it stands for, I doubt if the Empire can hold together, and in my view the maintenance of the Empire will depend on the maintenance of the position of this heart of the Empire in Europe.  And, unless that heart be secure and beat strongly and firmly, the current of life blood will cease to flow throughout the world where our children are in the Seven Seas. I should like to quote you a short passage which I employed last year in the House of Commons, which may be new to many of you, and which was written by a great student of politics, and a great supporter of ours, Mr. Frederick Oliver.  He puts in a few pregnant sentences what I have been trying to express to you in my more faulty phraseology.He was speaking of foreign policy in the second quarter of the Eighteenth Century, and how impossible it was then for this country to pursue an isolationist policy, and he says this:'The people whose home is Britain cannot escape from their practical environment.  Isolation is a bubble of a distorted imagination.  Weary with an apparently insoluble confusion, tested by endless provocation, haunted by the memory of a thousand fears, in the past British statesmen have sometimes been tempted to bid other nations of Europe to go their way and let us ourselves go in peace.'But the very essence of the matter is that no one of us can go his own way.  Individual men may go, as the Pilgrim Fathers went, but the nations cannot go, and it is not the worse that human kind should choose to stay where they are born, and since we are forced to stay, we must play our parts manfully or be borne under.If we allow our prestige to become impaired, if we shirk responsibility and let things of moment go by default \u2013 in other words, if we cease to care whether our strength is recognised or not, whether our voice is audible in the councils of Europe, we lose the chief security of our independence.We risk our own ruin, we injure the whole Continental fabric.  Confusion and disaster will follow as certainly as if one of the planets of the solar system should cease to pull its weight.These words might have been used to meet the crisis facing us at this moment.Without pursuing the subject, I would like to add one sentence.  I spoke of our Imperial responsibilities.In my view the time may come when events in Europe may have repercussions that may be felt throughout the whole British Empire, and we cannot afford, not only nationally, but as an Empire, to refuse to play our part in the continent in which the hand of God has placed us.  (Cheers)We are pledged by our signatures to the Covenant of the League; we have signed the Kellogg Pact.  It is not only, in my view, our vital interests which dictate our policy, but it is the fulfilment of our solemn international pledges.I have noticed, during the last weeks, while the present grave issue between the League of Nations and Italy has been debated in Geneva, that it has been represented in many countries abroad as an issue between this country alone and Italy.  Though amongst our own people the nature of the dispute is fully realised, I wish to remove any shadow of misunderstanding on this point, if it should still exist anywhere.We have, from the very beginning, spoken and acted on this issue solely in our capacity as a member of the League and in fulfilment of our obligations under the Covenant.  There never has been, and I hope never will be, national enmity between my country and Italy.That we should urge our fellow members of the Council to oppose Italy from selfish or mean motives of our own would not only be repugnant to our national self-respect, but an abuse of the whole spirit and intention of the Covenant, to which his Majesty\u2019s Government would lend no countenance.  (Cheers)I go still further.  This country resents, and indignantly rejects, the suspicions which have been caused by its sincerity in defending the country.  It will bode ill for the League of Nations if one of its leading members, in proclaiming its fidelity to obligations to which all are equally bound of their own free will, can be held up to suspicion and misrepresentation of these motives.I trust that we have heard the end of this (cheers), and in making it clear that we are actuated by no such motives, I wish to make it clear that the Government have not, and never have had, any intention of taking isolated action in this dispute.If the security which the nations of Europe regard as a primary need for their peaceful development can best be achieved by collective counsel and collective action, then the responsibility for any action that may be taken rests on all, and must be faced squarely by all.  The Secretary for Foreign Affairs laid full emphasis on this essential aspect of the problem now confronting all of us who are members of the League, and I wish to call attention, once more, to the words which he spoke to the whole world on the occasion of his great speech at Geneva:I have said already that we must all share the responsibilities, and so all will share the benefits, and don\u2019t let us underrate or overlook the benefit to ourselves.  I regard collective security not only of real and practical benefit to this country, but as something which affords us greater security than can be obtained by any other policy which I have yet seen advocated.But we cannot achieve our policy and our goal by mere words.  The Government have made up their mind as to the wisest course to pursue.  Our primary necessity is to see that peace is preserved in Europe.  We believe that, from collective security and the League of Nations, we have to our hands the best means of preserving peace, or of exercising some measure of control over events should peace be temporarily broken.It is certainly the hope of His Majesty\u2019s Government - and I believe I can say of all the Governments represented at Geneva - that is the desire to help and to be maintained.I should like to pay tribute to the unswerving loyal support we are receiving at Geneva from every representative of the Empire, from every quarter of the globe.  Grave reports have reached the Council of the League within the last day or so regarding the movement of troops and aircraft within the boundaries of Abyssinia.  The situation thus created will form the subject of the Council\u2019s deliberations at their meeting tomorrow morning.You will not expect me to say anything now which might prejudice, in any way, their work or the issue.  I am confident, however, that I am voicing the sentiments of the whole country in appealing to Italy in this dispute, even at this hour, to refrain from action which will render the task of the Council more arduous.Let us keep before our minds, during the difficult days ahead, the main objective of the League and its members, that any action taken must be with the approval and support and collaboration of all, and that it should work for the shortening of the conflict and the hastening of a satisfactory agreement.I would only add, on this subject, that there is no truth in the propaganda that is being assiduously put forward abroad, and which I have seen stated in this country, that we have not advised Italy of our views for many months past.  From the earliest days in this crisis there has been frequent and constant diplomatic touch maintained, and if that be challenged, the Foreign Secretary will be ready at any time in the House of Commons to meet it with more detail than would be suited to a large public meeting of this kind.But I want to say to you that recent events have confirmed my own doubts and anxieties, which have been present with me and my colleagues for some time past.  We have, as you know, since the War, done more in the way of practical disarmament and more in reducing expenditure on necessary equipment than any other country \u2013 I was going to say in the World \u2013 but I will certainly say in Europe.We cannot pursue that path longer.  The whole perspective on the Continent has been altered in the last year or two by the rearming of Germany.I have no reason to believe any hostile intentions.  I do not look on Germany, or on any other country as necessarily a hostile foe.  I hope, indeed, for a continuance of that friendship which, after the Great War, we have so often succeeded in making with those who have recently been our foes in the field.But I cannot be blind to facts; that the presence of another great nation, armed, alters the perspective in Europe.In the fulfilment of obligations under the League of Nations, I cannot conceal from myself that some day the fulfilment of those obligations may be that the nations who are fulfilling them may have to maintain by force of arms the Covenant of the League.I ask myself, with all the responsibility that falls upon me as principal adviser to his Majesty, how far I am entitled to accept fully those obligations without repairing the deficiencies which we have made, and for which all of us are responsible since the War.  It is a responsibility, but I cannot bear or shoulder a responsibility which I do not think his Majesty\u2019s Government, on examination, would be prepared to shoulder.We have one other thing to remember in connection with the League of Nations, another pregnant fact \u2013 that we have today a new factor in Europe.We have dictatorships; and we know that, historically, however pacifist the early stages of such forms of Government may be in its intentions, we know too well the tendency that has shown itself later to divert attention from domestic difficulties to external adventure.While such conditions exist, and remembering the responsibility we have for our people, I am not satisfied with the position as it is today.  It is neither the time nor the place to go into further details on this matter, but I would repeat once more, there is a risk in accepting obligations as a member of the League of Nations unless we are able to carry out these obligations to the full.I do not like the doubt and questionings which have reached me from the world at large as to our ability to fulfil our obligations.  So long as those doubts exist, our words will not carry that weight in the councils of the world that the word of Great Britain always has carried, always ought to carry and, I hope, always will carry.In no conceivable circumstances, as I have said in the House of Commons, must we feel that we are inferior in the air of anyone within striking distance of this country, and in no conceivable circumstances should it be impossible for our people, whatever may happen, to be secured in the services of their food from overseas.I have taken rather longer than I intended on this subject, but I want to say something on the resolution in regard to sanctions that was passed at another seaside town at a Labour Conference there.I do not want today \u2013 the matter is much too serious \u2013 to say much that might be said about that Conference.  I want to speak to you of the gravity of that resolution, and I want to give you one or two thoughts that have occurred to me on this subject, and may well have occurred to those who belong to our great Party \u2013 and, indeed, to others.I rejoice in the fact that that resolution was passed \u2013 (cheers) \u2013 but I do feel this \u2013 and I think clear-sighted men in the Labour Party would agree with me \u2013 that the Party as a whole will not realise all the implications of their resolution until they acquire that knowledge that is only to be got when they are in office.Of course, it was supported by the Trade Unions.  Trade Unionism, like the Friendly Societies, is a peculiarly English growth.This country is the native soil in which such institutions are indigenous.  They are integral parts of the country\u2019s life, and they are a great stabilising influence.  Perhaps some of our Party who take a less wide view than I do in having to look forward, as I do, may say, \u2018Oh, well, they did not make things easy in 1926, and some other years we can think of.\u2019  That may be true, but it does not alter the truth of the general proposition that I lay down.Let me ask you to watch carefully the continuous efforts that are being made by the Communist Party to attempt to destroy Trade Unionism.They do not want to destroy them for nothing.  The spirit of Trade Unionism is the bulwark of popular liberty.  If Trade Unionism was destroyed, you would be on the road to Communism and from Communism to Fascism.Let anyone in this island who has a knowledge of industry in industrial regions try to imagine what industry would be like today if there were no Trade Unions.  It would be chaos, absolute chaos, and chaos that would lead to disaster.I have said these few words because I have no doubt, in my own mind, and I am convinced, that while Trade Unions are wholehearted supporters of the League of Nations in this present action, they no doubt feel that the country, the case of which is now being considered by the League, is a Fascist country in which the Trade Unions have been suppressed.That would be equally true of Germany and Russia.  In my view Fascism, or any state of Government which will suppress the freedom of Trade Unionism, is a very chimera, a very bogey, a figment of the imagination. There is only one risk of a Fascist rule in Great Britain \u2013 that is if we ever get Communism first.  Fascism in Italy, as Mussolini himself would confess, was built up on the defeat of Communism, and the success of Nazism in Germany was brought about by the defeat of Communism.Until the Trade Unions in this country cease to be the constitutional bodies that they are today, and become controlled by Communists, or by people with Communist leanings, and try to form some dictatorship in this country, not till then will you see that swing to the Right that always answers it, and seeks by force to impose its will on the country, as has been tried by the extremists.  No extremists will get into that position by force in this country, because of that respect, born in all of us, of law and order.I have only said that because I do not myself believe that there is the slightest chance within any period of time that I can foresee that anything of the kind can happen.  This country has its feet too firmly planted on the path of constitutional progress that has served her people well.  I think she will be stimulated to tread in those paths by the sight of what we can see in countries not so placed as we.But, before I leave the subject of Fascism and Nazism, I want to add this.  In all movements there is good and there is bad.  I spoke earlier about the advent of dictatorship which made the outlook in Europe more uncertain, and made those anxious for the security of their own country more inclined to study the new conditions, and to advise the country to secure itself in certain directions against possibilities in the future.The good in these movements, which was so obvious in their earlier state, was the inculcation of discipline among the youth of the country, based on love of their country, and the desire to make themselves fit for the service of their country.  Up to a point that is an ideal we would all like to see in this country \u2013 our people fit for the service of their country, by which I mean their work and labours to make our country a better and happier place.Then youth will always be prepared, as men of all ages will, to defend their country if their country is attacked.  But you have got another form of patriotism, which I think is a spurious form, and that is where the danger comes.When your love of country leads you not only to make your country a better country, not only to be prepared to defend your country if she is attacked, but when you desire your country to make war against other people for purposes of her own aggrandisement.When you get that idea widely spread in a nation you have got a situation that may be dangerous to the neighbours of that country.Economic conditions today are a real danger.  I will show you how.  You all know the difficulties we have had.You all know the work, on the part of Governments and of Parliament and of social workers, to help our unemployed and to find work for them.  We know what great strides have been made in the last four years.  We know that we have not yet conquered that problem, and how for the purposes of political warfare far more stress is laid on those who have not got work than on the many who have got work.We make no complaint of that, but we see that in some of the countries of Europe, where unemployment has been rife, where the standard of work has been low, the attempt has not been made, as we have made it, to carry the unemployed, but work has been found on the manufacture of material and munitions for war.  That means that some countries are in the process to become fully equipped for war, and those who remember the last war know the part that equipment plays.Such a situation may be sometimes a situation of danger, it is not a situation that can be ignored by any Government.  We have to guard, in this country, a social life and a standard of life better than any that exists in Europe.So much for the material side.  But we have to guard certain spiritual values of infinitely more importance and value to mankind \u2013 that love of freedom and that love of justice, without which we could not survive.There are many throughout the world today who still worship silently, steadily, and alone at those shrines at which we worship so freely in this country.  You may depend they are all watching and sympathising with us, and praying that we may be strong enough to hold aloft those torches until mankind has found more wisdom, and recognises that they are the better part for mankind.  (Cheers)With those thoughts in our minds, we shall in due course, when we come to put our programmes forth, make clear both of these matters of making good equipment and material so long neglected, and what we think should be done.And I want to tell you that, at the same time, while I know these things must be done, and while I know that the expense must be faced, it is not in my mind \u2013 and I am sure it is not in the mind of the Government \u2013 that we should slacken our efforts by one little whit in continuing with that social progress which we have been able to bring about in this country in recent years.We have been examining during the Recess many schemes in connection with the depressed areas, and as the Chancellor told you and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Labour told you, I think we shall be ready when the House meets to put forward our suggestions.There are questions of vital importance such as the nutrition and physical condition of our people and maternity services with which we must go forward, and if we, in this country, can only keep from serious industrial disturbance, if we can continue on our work, if our industries can go forward and make such profits that we can get a really handsome share of income tax out of them \u2013 (laughter) \u2013 I, for one, have no fear that this country can carry all the burdens we propose to lay upon it.But, I want to remind you that the auspices are good.  This Party is united today as closely as it has ever been in nay time of its history.To come back:  this next election must come upon us \u2013 certainly before another year has expired.  (Laughter)  I think it is obvious to all of us in the present condition of external politics that it would be extremely difficult for me to say anything more definite to you this evening.I have struggled for this ever since I became its leader, because I believe that we should form the largest nucleus to which might be attracted members of other parties, who at critical times would fight for the same great causes that we fight for.  It was in a great fight of that kind that forces were joined to form the National Government four years ago, and in the next fight we have we want all hands on the ropes again.We want friends to see eye to eye with us \u2013 we want friends from the Liberal Party \u2013 we want friends from Labour.The dictators of the world are saying that peoples inside the democratic countries are inferior to them because they are always quarrelling in their politics, and they will never agree on a policy.Let us show the world when the election comes that whatever issues there may be at the election \u2013 let the people of an ancient democracy show that their  cohesion, their purpose, their will can be no whit inferior to that of nay dictatorship that ever existed in this world, or ever will.It is for us to show that a great people is united and determined in preserving the peace of the world by collective action and to fit themselves for the task, and to attain that end they will shrink from no effort and no sacrifice that may be demanded of them.  (Loud cheers)

aVIt is almost exactly a year since we last met by the seaside and I am glad to see that your high spirits have not abated nor your fighting qualities diminished. In fact you don\u2019t look a. day older than when I saw you last at Margate. As for me I have indeed assumed new responsibilities since I became Leader of the Party but the burden sits easily on my shoulders because I am supported by a harmonious and united Government, and by a Party which has no differences to hide and no division of its loyalty to its leaders. And so I have no need to warn anyone here that if he doesn\u2019t mend his was he will have to be smacked and sat in a corner. I have no need to appeal to you to close your ranks and keep the Party pure from the corrupting influence of outsiders; and I have no reason to fear that any of my colleagues is harbouring the intention of bringing dissension among us by advocating from inside a policy different from that approved by the Party itself.Bye-ElectionsIn these happy circumstances I can proceed at once to my first and most pleasant duty which is to thank you for all the work you have done in the constituencies during the past year. There can have been few occasions when, it was possible to look back on the visible results of your labours with so much satisfaction. We are now nearing the end of the sixth year of National Government and since we last met there have been a quite unusual number of opportunities for the country to express its disapproval, if it felt any, of our record. Yet out of 27 bye-elections which have taken place since last October only two have been lost to our Socialist opponents, while 25 have been retained by supporters of the National Government.I think we may all claim some share of the credit for such an unprecedented result, the Government for a policy which has kept the peace and maintained the prosper­ity of the country and you for the careful organisation and the downright hard work you have put in which has enabled us to bring our supporters to the poll. And I think itwould be ungenerous not to admit that the Socialist Party has had some share in our success. For surely no Party has ever backed the wrong horse more persistently than they nor bitten one another with greater ferocity when they discovered their mistakes.ConferenceDuring this week they and we have both been holding our Conferences. I shall have something to say later on about one item in the new \u2018short programme\u2019 which they have adopted and I will only observe now that though the programme may be short the time is likely to be long before the country returns them to power to carry out proposals which would at once destroy confidence and paralyse employment. Our Conference has been less dramatic but more businesslike. I have already studied or had reported to me the gist of the various discussions that have been taking place and I can promise you now that I will give careful and personal consideration to the views which the Conference has expressed.Foreign AffairsThis is the one occasion in the year when I can speak face to face with representatives of the Party from all parts of the country, and I want to take advantage of it to review the whole field of politics so far as I can do that without trespassing unduly on your time.I make no excuse for devoting the first part of what I have to say to foreign affairs.In these days we never seem to be able to free ourselves for more than a few days from international problems which affect our interests directly or indirectly but which arise from circumstances beyond our control. The primary responsibility for our policy and for the action we take from time to time to deal with these problems rests upon the Foreign Secretary, and no member of the Government is subjected to so continuous and exhausting a strain upon his physical and mental resources as the man who holds that office. Happily, in our present Foreign Secretary, Mr. Eden, we have a statesman who combines all the energy and vitality of youth with an un­rivalled experience of men and affairs in all parts of the world, and we all have reason to be grateful to him for the tact and skill which he has devoted to the maintenance of peace and the care with which he watches over the interests of this country.At the present moment there are some grave matters occupying his attention. Although in neither case has there been any formal declaration of war yet, there are in fact two major wars in progress, one close at hand in Spain, the other far away in China. Both of them are being characterised by the use of bombing aeroplanes and in both cases non-combatants, men, women and children, are being killed and mutilated by the action of aerial weapons, which we are told are aimed at military objectives, but which in no case can be considered as instruments of precision. It is a sickening and horrifying spectacle from which the mind revolts and it has aroused in many countries the strongest feelings of indignation at its inhumanity - and sympathy with its helpless victims. Yet it seems to me that there is some danger lest these natural human feelings should miss the real point at which they should be directed. Cruelty and barbarity, mutilation and death of non-combatants, destruction of property, starvation and misery are the inevitable accompaniments of modern warfare. The real crime against humanity goes further back than that. It lies in having resort to force at all, in contradiction of engagements solemnly entered into, without even an attempt to settle differences by peaceful discussion and negotiation.Three days ago the attention of the world was arrested by a clarion call from the other side of the Atlantic, as welcome as it was timely in its utterance. Hitherto it has been assumed that the U.S.A., the most power­ful country in the world, would remain content with a frankly isolationist policy. But President Roosevelt has seen that if what he calls the epidemic of world lawlessness is allowed to spread no country will be safe from attack. In his declaration of the necessity for a return to a belief in the pledged word and the sanctity of treaties, he has voiced the convictions of this country as well as of his own, and in his call for a concerted effort in the cause of peace this Government will be wholeheartedly with him.You will have seen that on the initiative of the League Assembly, it is proposed to hold a conference of the signatories of the Nine Power Treaty and other Powers with interests in the Fax East. I have little doubt after the President\u2019s speech that the United States Government will agree to be represented at that conference and to consult with other members as to how the conflict in China may be brought to an end. It would clearly be premature at this stage for me to commit this Government to any particular course of action. I will only say that our governing objective, now as always, is the restoration and maintenance of peace, and we will gladly co-operate in any plan which will help to secure that end.Events in the Fax East have for the moment diverted attention from the Mediterranean, but the war drags on in Spain and the situation in that country is still causing us increasing anxiety. We were sincerely rejoiced that it was found possible to come to an agreement with the Italian Government as to the patrolling of the Mediterranean by French, Italian and British warships, and we felt encouraged to hope that that agreement might be followed up by further discussions between the three Powers with a view to making the policy of non-intervention really effective. We are still awaiting the Italian reply to our invitation but I earnestly trust that it may prove to be of such a character as to bring us all into greater harmony. If we could once make real progress in the settlement of the Spanish problem the way would be opened to those conversations which formed the subject of the recent correspondence between Signor Mussolini and myself.ArmamentsIn the meantime until the world recovers some of its sanity, there can be no halt in the process of rearming this country. On that point there is practically only one opinion now, since the Chairman of the Labour Party Conference, in the sole passage of his rumbustious speech which has attracted any attention outside, declared that this country must be powerfully armed. Certainly we have not had much help in arming the country from the Labour Party, who have consistently voted against all the service estimates, but as there is more joy over one sinner that repenteth than over ninety and nine just men who support the National Government and have no need of repentance, we very heartily welcome this belated conversion to the true faith.Such was Dr. Dalton\u2019s trust in the National Government that he did not think it necessary to ask any questions about the progress of rearmament, but I do not suppose you will be so easily satisfied and I am sure you would be disappointed if I did not give you some account of how we are getting on. Well I must say frankly that progress is not yet as fast as I should like or as it soon will be. But on the other hand anyone who has any conception of the vast scale of our programme, much vaster than anything we have ever attempted before in peace time, must have realised that before we were able to start on mass production an immense amount of preparatory work had to be done. New designs had to be perfected and tried out, priorities determined, sites acquired, factories built, new tools manufactured and placed in position, and contracts placed. All this had to be done before we could even begin our new programme and upon the thoroughness with which this task is performed necessarily depends the smoothness and speed with which subsequent production will proceed.I am glad to say that this preparatory stage is now practically completed and that production has begun in earnest. All three services are sharing in the general activity. The new Secretary of State for War - you may have noticed his picture in the papers - is devoting his ingenious mind and his untiring energy to mastering every detail that concerns our army and other people\u2019s armies, too. Under his watchful eye I have every confidence that no military problem, great or small, will be overlooked and that though our army will not compare in size with the huge conscript armies of the Continent, it will, when fully equipped, be thoroughly adapted to the task it has to fulfil. As for the Territorial Army, I am glad to say that it is rapidly increasing its strength and as more equipment becomes available I anticipate that we shall have no difficulty in filling its ranks to the full numbers required.As for the Navy the Foreign Secretary recently gave some figures at Geneva which I am told profoundly impressed those who heard him. I need not repeat them here in detail but I may remind you of his statement that the aggregate tonnage actually now being built or already sanctioned by Parliament for the British Navy exceeds half-a-million tons, while the naval personnel is being extended at a rate never attempted before in time of peace. It is perhaps the condition of the Air Force which has been the subject of the greatest amount of attention, and some anxiety has been expressed about the pace at which it is expanding. Yet there is plenty of evidence apparent to everyone who moves about the country that its activities are increasing with great rapidity and, I am afraid, with a good deal of disturbance to the peace of the countryside. Powerful machines unsurpassed in design and equipment are now steadily coming forward from the manufacturers. The volume of supply will very soon be greatly augmented. You have heard of the shadow factories. Where 12 months ago was nothing but bare ground, aeroplane shops have sprung up, and today in half-a-dozen different places an army of workers as keen as they are skilful is at work operating the very latest types of machine tools. These men, moreover, are working under conditions second to none in the world in the provision that is made for their health and well-being. The result of all this and of the ready response to the call for men which shows no sign of diminishing can be seen in the fact that in the space of the last two years the strength of our home based force has been nearly trebled, an expansion at a rate and on a scale never attempted before.IndustrialIt might naturally be expected that with this rapidly growing production of armaments our ordinary commercial business would be showing signs of getting squeezed out. No doubt it must be suffering some disturbance from the pressure of munition orders, yet it continues to show an astonishing resilience and there is still no visible sign of that slump which our political opponents continue to prophesy with such obviously pleasurable anticipation. No doubt it is distressing to them that the policy of the Government which they describe as a public danger should have produced results which compare so strikingly with the conditions which prevailed when they were last in office. Let me give you one or two figures which will demonstrate the improvement.In the first six months of this year industrial production as a whole was 50% greater than in the first half of 1931. Production of pig iron was 100% more, of crude steel 120% more, of artificial silk 220%, and of motors more than 100%.  During the 5 years 1932-1936, 2,688 new factories were opened in Great Britain providing employment for a quarter of a million workpeople. Nearly 250 of these factories (many of which employ processes new to this country) were set up here by or in association with foreign concerns, attracted here by the tariff.The amount of merchant tonnage under construction in our shipyards at the and of June was 120% greater than at the end of June 1931, while the amount of British shipping laid up was only 3% of what it was six years ago.Those who pretend that our tariffs obstruct inter­national trade should note that our retained imports in the first six months of this year were 40% greater in volume than they were in the corresponding period in 1931, and those who maintain that they injure our export trade may be reminded that taking the same two periods our exports have risen by 32%. The effect of our policy on employment is shown by the fact that the number of insured persons in employment excluding agricultural workers has risen by two millions.There is a story that someone once complained to George II that General Wolfe, who afterwards took Quebec, was mad, to which the King replied, \u2018Mad, is he? Then I wish he would bite some of my other Generals.\u2019 And if the Government that has achieved the results I have quoted is a public danger, the Opposition will have to catch some of the infection before it can hope to be given employment again.Now before I leave the subject of industry there is one point on which I should like to say a few words because I notice that our opponents are trying to represent that the recent increase in the cost of living is somehow due to the Government, and their suggestion is that under a Socialist Government prices would at once fall. Well the first remark I would make is that the cost of living is still below what it was in 1929, while the average level of weekly wage rates is substantially higher than it was at that time. But of course the fact is that the present rise in prices is an inevitable accompaniment of the general improvement in conditions. One of the most marked features of the slump was the disastrous fall in the prices of primary commodities and the consequent loss of purchasing power in those countries which depend for their prosperity upon the money they can get for their exports of those commodities. Countries like Australia or the Argentine live on their exports of wool and meat and maize and wheat and when prices of these articles slump, their purchases from this country are bound to fall off. We should therefore welcome the better prices which are now ruling for these growers of food and producers of raw materials since we are reaping the benefit ourselves in the increased export trade which we are doing with them today.It would be too much to expect that the weekly earnings of the workers should keep an exact relation to the cost of living, but I am satisfied that apart from increases in wage rates, earnings have been largely increased not only by the grading up of individual workers but also by the substitution of full-time for part-time work and by the addition of overtime. And no doubt that is in fact the explanation of what has struck many people as a truly remarkable fact, viz., that this phenomenal increase in the activity of trade and employment has been unaccompanied by any serious labour disputes. That does not mean that the workers have refrained from putting forward their claims. What it does mean is that the gains which have accrued to them have been won by peaceful negotiation instead of by conflict, and I should like to pay my tribute to the wisdom and reasonableness which has characterised both employers and employed in these negotiations and which was strikingly illustrated in the agreement recently reached in the engineering trades. It is with special gratification that I observed the inclusion in that agreement of provision of a holiday period with pay for the wage-earner.AgricultureIn any survey of conditions in this country the position of industry naturally comes first because we are, and so far as we can foresee we are destined to remain, predominantly an industrial and trading nation. From our industrial and commercial activities the vast bulk of our wealth is derived and in them the overwhelming majority of our population is engaged. Nevertheless there has been in recent years a growing appreciation of the fact that in our national economy a vital position is held by agriculture. It remains our largest single industry, the annual value of its output is in the neighbourhood of £250 million and its maintenance is essential both to our social welfare and to our national safety.To the recognition of these facts we may attribute the remarkable circumstance that never before has so much time, thought and effort been devoted to the welfare of agriculture as in the half dozen years of National Government.How best to deal with its needs in a country which is predominantly industrial and commercial is no easy matter to determine. The broad object we have set before ourselves has been to ensure that maximum supplies shall be made available within the purchasing power of the consumer consistent with reasonable remuneration for the efficient producer. There is no single method by which that object can be secured. A policy adapted for products which are mostly imported is not equally suited to those which we produce chiefly at home. Conditions change from time to time and the method which is appropriate today may be out of date tomorrow. Our plans therefore must be capable of adjustment and at different times and for different purposes we have made use of tariff, subsidies and regulation of imports, together with various measures intended to lower costs of production and to increase efficiency both in production and in marketing.Under the Marketing Acts farmers have special statutory powers to organise their industry and to exercise complete control over the terms of sale of their produce, subject to the necessary public safeguards. By this means milk producers were able to save their industry from disaster in 1933, and pig producers with the assistance of regulated imports have been able to expand the pro­duction of pigs by 40% since 1931. Producers of hops and potatoes have greatly benefited by the stable conditions which their respective schemes have secured. Producers of horticultural products, on the other hand, have received substantial assistance through the imposition of customs duties. In the case of wheat, where home production is small in relation to imports the Wheat Act has given farmers security against slumps in world prices, while the Sugar Industry Act has made it possible to continue the growing of sugar beet and to secure that the industry shall be efficiently worked.Last session Parliament was engaged on important new policies to benefit the livestock industry and to build up the fertility of the land which has seriously deteriorated during the depression. A duty was imposed on foreign beef. Provision was made for a subsidy of £5,000,000 a year to help the beef producers and its distribution was so arranged as to encourage and assist the production of higher quality beef. The reorganisation of marketing, long overdue, has been tackled and experiments in central slaughtering have been put in hand with a view to reducing the gap between what the consumer pays and what the producer receives. Under the new Agriculture Act we are assisting the farmer to buy lime and basic slag for the purpose of restoring the fertility and productivity of his land and I am glad to say that the number of applica­tions we have already received shows that the farmers fully appreciate the importance of this measure. Under this same Act we are also helping land drainage schemes, we are giving some degree of insurance to growers of oats and barley and lastly we are taking steps to reduce the enormous losses, estimated at £14,000,000 a year, which are now being sustained in consequence of various animal diseases.This is a long list of measures, some of them very costly, which have been taken to maintain our agricultural industry, and they are evidence of the determination of the Government that agriculture shall not be neglected. There are, however, three branches of the industry which are causing us concern at the present time, namely, those engaged on the production of poultry, pigs and dairy products. The first you have been discussing in the course of the Conference and Mr. Morrison, our genial and very able Minister, has told you what he has in mind on that subject. In the pig and bacon industry, negotiations with the Pigs Board and the Bacon Board followed on the announcement of the Government\u2019s policy in July and they are proceeding satisfactorily. As to milk the general lines of our policy were laid down in the White Paper and put shortly they are these. The key to prosperity in the industry lies in the increase of the consumption of liquid milk. We believe that by publicity and in other ways that increase can be obtained, but it is essential that the public should have complete confidence in the cleanliness and purity of the milk supply if they are to increase their demand for what is one of the most valuable of human foods. Accordingly the Government are proposing to ask Parliament to provide additional Exchequer assistance estimated to amount to £14 millions in the first year for measures to further this object and to supplement the efforts the farmers themselves have been making to improve the quality of their milk.The difficulties that are being encountered in dealing with the milk problem illustrate both the inter­dependence of town and country and the need for mutual appreciation of one another\u2019s requirements. A fertile soil with healthy stock upon it capable of responding if need be to a call for increased production is an asset to the whole nation. A prosperous agriculture is a necessity to the towns since it provides industry with one of its best customers. But on the other hand I would ask farmers to bear in mind that in the purchasing power of the towns lies the very foundation of farming prosperity, and that in trying to help them the Government must be careful to preserve as far as possible all the sources of that purchasing power. Only by mutual understanding and mutual tolerance can we hope to preserve the stability which is essential to both town and country.PensionsWhen I had the privilege last year of addressing a similar meeting to this at Margate I was still Chancellor of the Exchequer. Since then I have handed over the responsibility for the National Finances to Sir John Simon, and it could not be in abler hands. But after nearly six years experience of that great office it would be difficult for me, even if I wished it, to banish its problems from my thoughts, and I cannot refrain tonight from saying a few words of warning to you about the future. It would be a mere hiding of our heads in the sand to imagine that when we have committed ourselves to the vast programme of expenditure on armaments that has been forced upon us, we can at the same time have just as much to spend on other things as if we lived in a peaceful world free from all anxiety and care about the intentions and ambitions of other countries. We may, and we do, deplore the stupidity, the futility of spending our money on weapons of destruction instead of things that would make us all happier and life more worth living, but \u2018needs must when the devil drives,\u2019 and the sight of what is going on in China today brings home to us that our safety from such horrors is more precious to us than anything else. But safety cannot be attained without sacrifice, and I say to you that I cannot see any prospect of our being able in the near future to introduce reforms which would add substantially to the present enormous annual expenditure of the country. I say this tonight because I notice that our Socialist opponents are making great play with a new contributory pensions scheme of £1 a week for a single person, and 35/- for a married couple at 65, provided they retire from employment, together with increased allowances to children of widows and to orphans. The full details of the scheme are contained in a report by the National Council of Labour which I hold in my hand. I do not complain of the Report, which goes very carefully into the whole question and concludes with an estimate of its cost. I have not checked the figures, but taking them as they stand, they show that the average cost of the scheme over the first ten years would be £85,000,000 a year.The authors of the Report state that it is not unreasonable or impracticable to ask for an additional 1/- a week from each insured male, and 9d. a week from each insured female employee and that if the employers also paid 1/- a week for each employee, whether male or female, in addition to what they pay now, the combined contribution of employers and employed would bring in the required £85,000,000. It is further suggested that if Budgetary conditions permitted, the State would find some portion of the £85,000,000, and to that extent the contributions could be reduced, but that the proportions to be contributed respectively by the State and the contributors must be settled when the scheme is intro­duced in the light of the conditions then prevailing.As I have said, I have not attempted to check the accuracy of these figures, nor do I want now to consider what would be the effect on industry and employment of the imposition of this new burden. What I want to call your attention to is the way this scheme is being presented to the public. It is recognised that they cannot be expected to read through the 32 pages of close print in this Report, and so the plan is dished up in a more attractive form with coloured pictures to be sold for a penny. But there is a significant omission in this broadsheet. Here we are told that \u2018Labour in power will immediately increase the present pension to £1 a week,\u2019 and that \u2018Labour\u2019s Pension Plan will mean that the vast majority of men and women in your Britain will be assured of a reasonably comfortable retirement.\u2019But about the £85 millions there is not a word. There is not a word to indicate that Labour\u2019s Pension Plan is not a free gift to the worker but is to be paid for by increased contributions which may be as much as 1/- a week additional to what he pays now. Well, I consider that dishonest politics, dishonest because it omits a vital consideration in any estimate of the value of the plan, and still more dishonest because it promises definitely benefits which, so far as I can see, this country will not for many years be able to afford.ConclusionI do not believe that tactics of this kind bring credit in the long run to the Party that adopts them, and I trust that our Party will never promise anything that we are not confident we can perform. There will still remain for us a wide field of practicable and useful reforms which will make no extravagant demands upon the national purse. Such is the new plan for improving the physical fitness of the nation which we have launched and which has aroused the greatest interest and enthusiasm, especially among the young people for whose benefit it has been devised. Let us apply our energies in the next few years to the preservation of peace, to perfecting our defence, to the pursuit of the policies which have brought our country to its present condition of general prosperity, to the introduction of such reforms as can wisely and prudently be undertaken and to the preservation of our free democratic institutions based on the principles of individual liberty and tolerance in which we have grown up. By concentration on a practical programme on these lines we shall deserve better of our country than by making promises, however brilliant, which can lead only to delusion and disappointment.

aVA year ago I was sitting, Madam Chairman, where you are. I had no idea then, nor, I suppose, had you, that within twelve months a General Election would have been fought and I should be addressing you in my present capacity.Sir Winston\u2019s brave message at that time is still fresh in all our minds, and I am sure, now that the formal Conference is over and we are at a public meeting (to which I am allowed to be admitted), I am sure that you would wish that we should send him a message of greeting, gratitude and good wishes from us all.I hope you will forgive me, but I do not propose to spend much time this afternoon talking about the political past, even the immediate political past. Of course, it would be very nice to sit down and do a little purring together - and we could. It would be gratifying for each one of us to do it. But my main purpose today is to look forward and not to look back.Therefore, about the General Election I have only a few words to say. First that, believe it or not, the decision to hold it was not an easy one. Apart from weighty national arguments I was conscious of at least two hoodoos: no Government in the history of this country, since universal franchise was in operation, had ever increased its majority; and that our Party - so I was told by everybody except Lord Woolton - did not like holding elections in the summer. As against this, I felt, and still feel that we had a message to give the country to which the electors would respond. And that was not some brave new elixir, but a message of service to our countrymen. We described to them what we had done, what the difficulties were, and what we proposed to do, and they have given us a mandate to get on with the job.That is what we mean to do, and it is about the future that I am going to speak to you now.  But I think I ought to recall this: a decisive element in our victory was unity. Never forget that. I have little doubt that the contrast we presented in this respect, shall we say, to the state of affairs elsewhere, did win us much support. We must now expect our opponents to learn their lesson and we must not forget ours while they learn theirs.Yet, despite our faith, despite the fervour of our voluntary supporters, despite the hard work of each one of you, the results of the General Election could not have been won without the loyalty and spirit of our organisation, presided over by the penetrating and avuncular genius of Lord Woolton.Lord Woolton, I am told, you know, that others are now beavering away to discover whether they can emulate what you have done. Some assert that it is mainly a matter of money and machinery. They could not be more wrong. As one who has watched you and your work closely during all these years, I would say without hesitation that your greatest gift to our organisation has been the sense of leadership and comradeship which brought a human understanding into the working of every single part of our machine.People speak of what you have done as creating some slick, Twentieth Century Party organisation. I hope you will forgive me if I say that that also is not the full explanation. It is the man much more than the method which has wrought these wonders. We thank you very much, and we thank Lady Woolton too, for her patience and for her kindness to us all and for her unfailing cheerfulness.We salute our new Chairman. Many of you know him well. He is young, energetic, and has the intelligence to grasp all the intricate problems which will fall to him as Chairman of the Party. He knows some of them already, so some of the headaches will be familiar. I am sure that he will give us brilliant service. To him and to Donald Kaberry, who has the fine qualities of that staunch county from which he hails, we wish all success and all good fortune.Our first task at home is to do battle with our economic problems. These are formidable but they have been worse. They can be solved if we take the necessary measures now. And that is precisely what we propose to do. We shall only be able to fulfil our hopes for social improvements of all kinds if we can build a stable and progressive economy. The action which our wise and experienced Chancellor took last February and again last July has had its effect. That is what we would expect, for we have the utmost confidence in him.In this connection I have just received the provisional trade figures for September. I thought you would like to have them: Imports £304,000,000; Exports £243,000,000 (These figures are approximate); Re-exports £11,000,000.The trade gap for September was therefore £50,000,000 compared with £68,000,000 in August and £108,000,000 in July. The September gap is actually about the same as the average monthly gap last year, and these exports of £243,000,000 for September bring the total figure of exports for the first nine months of this year to the formidable total of £2,123,000,000, which is nearly six per cent above the first nine months of last year.These results are encouraging. They show that the action which we have already taken has been right. But we cannot be sure that this will be enough alone. Nor is this a business where any doubt can be allowed to creep in. Therefore, we must do more in the way of corrective measures. We have been at work examining all this during the last weeks, and our plans are now ready. I cannot tell you this afternoon what additional measures we propose to take. That statement will be made as soon as Parliament meets, and we shall give priority to dealing with these matters.Now there is another consideration. In our efforts to carry through this work, many Departments of State will have a part to play. This will be a combined operation. I think it important that the same team of Ministers should handle unchanged the essential work we have to do in these coming weeks. For this reason I have asked my colleagues to remain at their posts for the present. And that\u2019s that.These measures of which I have just spoken must be largely concerned with reducing excessive home demand on our resources. But it is just as important to increase the efficiency of our production. We want not only to export enough in order to pay our way, but to have a surplus, and we want to use that surplus at home and to do all those things which you have rightly asked for at this Conference, and most important of all to get ahead with schemes for development in the Commonwealth and Empire.And yet, as you well know, the Government can only create the conditions. It is industry which must create the wealth. British industry has been doing powerful work, men and management alike deserve praise for the increase in production which has been won.  The figures I have just given show it. We ought not to forget that the greater part of industry has been running with smoothness and goodwill.As you know, I have personally had talks in the last few months with the leading employers and trade unionists, representatives of all sections of industry. Our invaluable Minister of Labour is following up this matter, and we hope that the discussions which are now going on will lead to constructive ideas and action.We also welcome the steps which have been taken in the last few months by the TUC in this field of industrial relations I am particularly anxious to see the growth of what I call \u2018partnership in industry,\u2019 and I use the word \u2018partnership,\u2019 as the Minister of Labour did yesterday, in its widest sense. I include in it joint consultation, the giving of full information to employees about the affairs of the companies in which they work, and also profit sharing in a number of forms, particularly when it offers opportunities for employees to hold shares, and so acquire a real stake in the enterprise in which they work.Now I would ask every firm in this country to consider carefully and urgently whether they cannot introduce further measures to promote the sense of partnership of which I speak.In this and in other ways I believe that we can, over the years, bring greater peace throughout industry and at the same time we shall do something more than that. We shall make work a more satisfying part of life and thereby raise the whole quality of our free society.Well now, from questions of peace in industry I must go for a moment to questions of peace in the world, and I begin by saying that I am sure we all wish the Foreign Secretary all possible success at his Conference this month. We know that he will do all that man can do.After the Foreign Secretary and I had concluded our work at the Conference of Heads of Governments at Geneva in July, I used some words at the final session which I would like to quote to you. They were these: \u2018If we can continue our work together in the spirit of this meeting, what is hopeful purpose today should become solid performance as events unfold.\u2019I see no need to change those words or to modify their emphasis in any way.Since the Conference closed, volumes have been written about it in many lands, some acclaiming with enthusiasm the Geneva spirit, others decrying the results as of little value, or even harmful. It doesn\u2019t seem to me to be necessary to take such an extreme view either way. Indeed, to do so is to misconceive both what was done at Geneva and the work we now have to do. The meeting of the four Heads of Governments didn\u2019t resolve any one of the stubborn problems which still confront the world. But it wasn\u2019t meant to do so. All that it could do was to chart a course - to prepare an agenda if you like - to make it possible for the Foreign Secretaries to meet and get to grips with problems which so far we have not been able to discuss across the table with any useful result at all.Now, I want to give you two examples of what I mean from my all too long experience of this business. In the spring and early summer of 1951 there was a conference in Paris at the Palais Rose. They had 74 formal meetings, believe it or not, and at the end of them, after four months of weary work, they had not managed to agree on an agenda. That was good going.And again, there were nearly 400 meetings with the Russians about Austria before any progress at all was made, and after our Berlin Conference last January, which I remember so well, and Soviet Russia\u2019s stubborn refusal there, nothing seemed less likely than that Austria would be free this year and all the foreign troops withdrawn. Yet that is what has happened.Well, what moral should we draw from all this? That we must not be surprised at setbacks. They are inevitable. We must not be exasperated at what sometimes seems the unintelligent repetition of old arguments till we are weary and sick of them. The processes of diplomacy are slow but behind all this repetition of public and private argument, conciliation may grow and the power of peace, prevail. No doubt the discussions later this month will be difficult. It is quite possible that after weeks of negotiation they will be adjourned without any progress made. I cannot tell, but of this at least I am certain, that the international anxieties in Europe and the Far East are less immediately acute today that they were when you and I met at Blackpool a year ago. And that let me tell you, is something to be able to say.But this does not mean that the Great Powers of the world have changed their purposes. I do not think that they have. But it could be, you know, that the knowledge of the weapons which some of them now command is helping to create a feeling of \u2018maybe we had better go along without trying to get all we want, because to try to get all we want might blow us where we don\u2019t particularly want to go.\u2019If this degree of wisdom has been learned, it is likely that any Government which today has far-reaching ambitions in an imperialist sense will say to itself \u2018better go slowly,\u2019 or, in the words of the Persian proverb: \u2018Patience is from God and haste is from the devil.\u2019 And if the world has learned only that in this year of grace 1955, it deserves a friendly mark in history.I wish I could stop there. But the Middle Eastern situation is serious and could be dangerous. Everyone knows of the tension between Israel and Egypt, and how each country tries to build up its armaments to be stronger than the other. There are grave risks in this. Not only because we are faced with the crudest form of arms race, but because there is always the danger that the one which believes that it is today the stronger may be tempted to strike first. That is how wars have often begun in the past.We have worked for a long time past by all manner of methods to try to bring about a reduction of tension in that part of the world. We have also tried to hold the balance even as regards the delivery of armaments. But now, if a Great Power from outside steps in with supplies on an infinitely larger scale, the risks are going to be intensified. That is inevitable. Here is, surely, an occasion where the Great Powers ought to agree to exercise restraint themselves and to join together to restrain others. That seems to me what the spirit of Geneva ought to mean.As I look back over recent years, certain influences have moulded our diplomacy and helped to chart our progress; I\u2019d just like to mention them.First, most important of all, the constant unity of the Commonwealth, which has become a more active influence in world affairs in recent years. You know there is no doubt that the judgment of its members played its part in South East Asia when a year ago we faced in Indo-China a crisis which endangered the peace of the world. The influence of the Commonwealth will always be felt rather than enforced in world affairs. But it is nonetheless important for that.In this connection, I am sure you will all have been happy to read of the meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers, which is to take place in London next summer.  I look forward to it with pleasure and confidence. I know, from many discussions I have had over years gone by with almost every member of the Conference, how valuable their joint advice can be to us and to the world.  There is really nothing like it.And then there is our close partnership with the United States of America. And here I must express on behalf of each one of us our deep regret at President Eisenhower\u2019s illness and our warm-hearted wishes for his speedy recovery. For it is fair to say that no foreigner in his lifetime has ever been more truly loved by the British people. We feel that he is in part ours too, and I know our American friends will understand that.It is my unshaken faith that so long as the friendship of our two nations endures, the peace of the world will not be broken.Finally, there is the unity of Western Europe, the unity which has grown and found expression in trade, in travel, in treaties.  All that is good, very good, because it is an expression of a political reality.These are the prevailing forces in world affairs. Watch them closely. So long as their influence does not wane, we are moving along the path to peace.I would have liked to discuss disarmament with you. I hope to do so - or the Foreign Secretary will - in greater detail later. This afternoon I will only say this.The first aim is to reduce tension at points of contact. It is for that purpose I submitted a plan at Geneva.  The next chapter depends on progress with German unity.  We in the West and the Russians have different views about this. In my judgment, European security can never be based on the division of Germany for an indefinite period. It was with this end in mind that we put forward at Geneva a plan for a Five Power pact to give confidence and security to all.Finally, looming over everything, there is nuclear warfare and the hydrogen bomb. The bomb which has compelled the nations to talk against a terrifying backcloth of universal destruction. Here, of course, it is the problem of supervision and control which is all-important. Many ideas have been canvassed. But I do not think that any one country has found a final solution yet. We have put forward constructive ideas on several occasions. No doubt they can be improved. We are ready at any time to discuss them and other thoughts and projects to find a solution, as we must do.Peace in the modern world is closely associated with defence. I have always held that to build up the defensive military strength of the West would improve the international situation. And so it has turned out. It was the conclusion of the Paris agreements, whether some people like it or not, it was the conclusion of those agreements that made the Geneva talks possible at all. One certain way to reverse the process of easing tension would be to slacken our defence effort and to try to negotiate from weakness. We have no intention of doing anything of the kind so long as the responsibility lies with us.Of course, that does not mean that our defence programme has got to be inflexible. The Minister of Defence and I and the Service Ministers have been examining our long-term plans for the defence forces. These, I may tell you, present some pretty baffling problems. We have got to take into account our overseas obligations. We have got to consider the cost of our programme, haven\u2019t we? And every new weapon, with its improved performance, and probably with additional gadgets as well, is sure to do one thing, it is sure to cost more than the weapon that was there before. We have to weigh the demands that defence makes on our resources of manpower and materials. And we have to be sure that our forces are fitted in size and in equipment for what they have to do.Our examination of all this vexing business has made good progress since the General Election last May. The Minister of Defence has been tireless in his efforts and I am now reviewing with him our research programme, to make quite sure that our main effort is concentrated at the right places.Last June, some of you will remember, we transferred from the Ministry of Supply certain functions connected with iron and steel and the engineering industries. That has proved, I think, a wise decision. It has meant that the Minister of Supply can now devote more attention to the provision of military equipment. It has also meant that his Ministry has become mainly a fourth Defence Department within the co-ordinating powers of the Minister of Defence. Now as you will see, all this takes us a further step towards our objective, which is to secure a closer integration of our forces and of their supply.Now the Minister of Defence, if he is to do his work effectively, must he able to direct policy over the whole of this field, and I am considering what further changes of organisation can be made to enable us to handle smoothly and effectively these vital questions of defence policy.Our detailed plans for all this readjustment of the defence forces will be explained and examined when the White Paper and the Service Estimates are put before Parliament early in the New Year. But I wanted to tell you now what it is we are trying to do.And now there is one special matter to which I must refer, and that is the manpower in the forces. We have made enough progress with our other plans to make it possible for me to say something definite on that topic today. I feel it my duty to give to the country the conclusions the Government have reached at the earliest possible opportunity.Now what is the position today? At present there are about 800,000 men and women in the forces, of whom about 280,000 are National Servicemen. Her Majesty\u2019s Government have decided that by the end of the financial year 1957-58, the strength of the Services shall be reduced to about 680,000 men and 20,000 women. This will be a reduction of about 100,000 upon the present figure. But over the five years, from March 1953 to March 1958, it will he a reduction of 170,000, or more than 20 per cent, a very substantial figure by any standard you care to apply.Well now, how to effect this reduction.  The reduction must be gradual. Nothing could be more inefficient or cause more disorganisation in the forces than sudden and violent fluctuations in manpower.  We have had this before. The decrease will be about 20,000 in the next six months and about 40,000 in each of the following financial years.We are confident that we can discharge our Treaty obligations and maintain our position as a world power despite this reduction in numbers.  Now the precise extent to which the reduction will affect National Servicemen will depend on how successful we are in encouraging regular recruitment. We want all the volunteers we can get. And with this end in view, the Government are again considering pay and conditions of service for the regular forces - it is good economy - and our decisions about these will be announced at the time of the Service Estimates at about the beginning of the year.I have been considering for some time what is the most efficient and fairest method of bringing about the reduction we propose in the burden of National Service, and it is a pretty intricate question. I do not believe that a system of selective service or of balloting would be acceptable to the people of this country.  We think that is so and I am glad you agree. The effective choice lies between reducing the period of service and reducing the number of young men called up every year. The difficulty about an immediate reduction in the period of service - and I don\u2019t conceal it from you - is that it would inevitably lead to a reduction in the numbers of the fully trained men, whom we most need. That is because the cut would fall upon the most useful period of a man\u2019s service. At this moment in the international situation, and having regard to the state of our overseas commitments, this is a reduction for which I am not prepared to be responsible. And so we have decided that for the present the reduction will be brought about by calling up fewer young men each year.The age of call-up will rise, the period of service remaining at 24 months. But we hold ourselves free to decide in the light of future developments in the international situation, whether the reduction we intend to make in the size of the forces shall continue to be brought about in this way or by reducing the period of service. The option will remain open to us. I think that was the fairest system we could possibly devise. And so this year there will he only three registrations instead of the usual four, and the age of call-up for the balance of this year will be about 18 years and five months.Plans are also being made for a reduced call-up next year. If the whole of the proposed reduction in the size of the forces were to be carried out by allowing the age of call-up to rise, the normal age of call-up would reach 19 years. But it will still remain possible for men to apply for early call-up when good reasons exist.We realise that we must make sure that those called up are used efficiently, and vigorous steps are being taken to investigate cases where it is alleged that men\u2019s time is being wasted. And we have also decided - I hope you will think rightly - to reduce the burden of part-time service for National Servicemen, because the roles of these forces have been changing. Some men are required for the Mobile Defence Corps, some are needed to man the Control and Reporting Organisation of the Royal Air Force, some to bring active formations up to war strengths - two reserve divisions are earmarked for NATO. But the conception of reserve forces waiting to take part in large-scale conventional warfare is, in our judgment, out of date. Therefore, in the event of a nuclear war the primary role of the reserve army would be to help to maintain the life of the nation and to deal with raids and sabotage.For those purposes we need a different type of training and organisation and it will be introduced. The present requirement for part-time training of National Servicemen is 60 days including three camps, spread over three and a half years.  We consider that this requirement should be reduced to a maximum of 20 days including one camp.There are, however, two or three categories to whom this will not apply. Except for these categories, National Servicemen, who have already done one period of continuous training will not be required to do further training, and that decision will apply from 31st December this year.As I have said, this decision with regard to the reserve forces links them with the work of civil defence. It is obvious with the development of nuclear weapons there are new problems to be faced, and we are at work on these, In the first place, we must think of this question as one problem of home defence, which is a better term than civil defence, a defence in which both civil and military forces have to take part.I have made certain arrangements within the Government, to co-ordinate planning and training for this purpose under the Minister of Defence. A full-time Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces, will be appointed in the near future.We shall intensify our research work to find means of reducing the damage caused by nuclear attack, and that applies particularly to what is called \u2018fall-out.\u2019All these matters, believe me, are much more important than the provision of large material resources.  Much useful work is being done by voluntary workers. I thank them for what they are doing.Finally, I would like to give you some reflections on our country\u2019s future as I see it. We are today in an exciting but difficult transition period. It is quite true that employment has never been so high, quite true that prosperity has never been so widespread. Perhaps the British people taken as a whole have never enjoyed a happier summer than this one, under those \u2018wicked Tories.\u2019  But we are looking ahead and in this highly competitive modern world, our island has always to be in the lead, or our people have no future.At the moment one of our greatest difficulties is that we are short of an essential raw material, coal, and to import coal is difficult and places a strain on our balance of payments. I do not want to blame anyone for this because, you know, the reasons for it are many of them complicated and go back quite a long way. Personally, I consider, and I am not ashamed to say it, that in present conditions of a wide demand for labour, it is remarkable that so many miners stand so loyally to their task. But still the problem is there.  If we could get 20,000,000 more tons of coal a year - the Chancellor will agree - or its equivalent in other fuels, the outlook would be transformed. Now, in time, that is going to happen.The new discoveries on which our scientists and engineers are engaged are going to change the whole pattern of the future for this country and other countries too. That prospect is continually widening, and no one can tell what the final meaning and message of all this is going to be.  But, of course, we must keep right in the front.In these last weeks I have seen more of the work which is being done in this nuclear world. I can assure you that it is immensely impressive. We have all to re-think many of our problems, domestic as well as international, and we are doing so. But meanwhile, there is one problem which has been pressed upon me from all sides: the shortage of young scientists and designers. It isn\u2019t any part of my purpose to enter into arguments about the value of one form of education as against another (As Chancellor of a University I should get into great trouble if I did).  But of this I am certain, unless we can hold our own with the other great nations - Russia and the United States in particular - in scientific research and its application in engineering design, we shall fall behind in the industrial race.  At this moment there are not enough young men in this country studying these subjects. If they will come forward, if with their help we can continue to keep abreast of every new development, we shall be ready, whether the new world bursts or creeps upon us. It is for these reasons that I have agreed with the Chancellor of the Exchequer - and I am deeply grateful for his help - that whatever the difficulties, balance of payments or others, nothing will be cut away from the necessary work in this nuclear sphere, or in the training of our scientific manpower.Now I have finished and I have spoken to you - I apologise for the length - for almost an hour, you may have noticed I have tried to give you a close account of some of the work which our Government has been doing since it received your mandate last May. If I were to tell you of the many other things you would be here for at least another hour, but I thought you would wish to have directly from me at this great Conference some account of our stewardship. You may also have noticed that I have not mentioned the words \u2018Socialism\u2019 or \u2018Nationalisation.\u2019 You know, truth to tell, I think they are just a little bit out of date.If we are as a country to rise to the heights which we can attain, and of which I have tried to give you some glimpse as I see them in the nuclear world, if we can do that we shall need certain qualities from our people. We shall need imagination; we shall need inspiration; we shall need individual effort and enterprise and a willingness to sacrifice at times our personal position or authority in the wider interests of the nation\u2019s good. We shall need all these things and more. We believe that our Party has the political mission to fulfil them, and we believe that because it has that mission we were returned at the last General Election; and because it has that we belong to this day and age.Now, what I am asking from you this afternoon is your help, when you go back to the constituencies, to enable my colleagues and myself to go on with this work so that we can - as I believe it is well in our power - lead the world in this new scientific age and discover something of the mysteries which today cloud the vision of man.

aVLet me first congratulate all of you here, and the speakers both from the body of the hall and from the platform on the outcome of this most successful Conference. Your resolutions have covered all the great issues of the day at home and abroad I am sure that the nation as a whole will have noted the wisdom and the sense of responsibility with which you have discussed them. The Party is the stronger for our meeting here together.You have discussed our economic problems against the background of present world events. In this you were wise. For it is useless to discuss our economic problems against the background of the British Isles alone. That is why the Socialist doctrine of equality makes no sense. The world has moved on since the nineteenth century when so much Socialist theory was developed.Scientific progress has become a gallop instead of a trot. Our own position \u2013 our country\u2019s position - no longer rests on its old foundations which seemed so secure. By now everyone should know that our life depends on our ability in brains and skill to do better than our competitors in world markets. There is no other way by which we can live. We cannot insulate British life from world competition, and try to build here some academic society all at one level regardless of the challenge of the world outside.It is from that world outside that we have to get much of our food and most of our raw materials. Nobody is going to give them to us. They have all to be bought and paid for, and we can pay only if we sell our goods in the face of keen and growing competition.It is only if our own people are more intelligent, more adaptable, more eager, better taught than our rivals that we can hope to maintain the present standard of life of our people. And no nation can maintain these qualities in a rigidly equal Socialist state. What we need is opportunity by means of education, incentive and reward, all three. It is a favourite phrase of the Socialist Party that \u2018Socialism is about equality.\u2019 I distrust most sweeping generalisations. But there is a sense in which we can say that \u2018modern Conservatism is about opportunity.\u2019 And please note how sharp the contrast is. The nearer one approaches to complete equality the more limited the opportunities of life must become. So it is that our aim is the very opposite of the Socialist equality state. There is nothing whatever to be gained for anybody from the old gag \u2018soak the rich.\u2019 That is not the way to move forward. To make progress there must be confidence that the harder we work the more ingenious our skill, the richer the returns, not merely in money, but in a fuller way of life for all. That also is the way in which to impress the world both with the energy and the enterprise of our people.Nobody - no Party - wants to see unemployment in this country. There is one certain way to bring it about and that is to fail to compete and sell our goods abroad.  In this country an individual who falls behind in the race can look for help to the State in many directions. That is right. But a nation which fails to keep up, that nation has to bear as best it can all the heavy penalties of failure. And that is not just a party doctrine or prejudice I am expressing. It s the harsh, inescapable fact of our island life, which no theory and no wishful thinking can alter.Most damaging to our country are the Socialist statements at their last Party conference. They amount to encouragement of Middle Eastern countries to nationalise oil and other undertakings which we - British brains and skill and capital - have done so much to develop. Any such action would, of course, be disastrous to the countries themselves. The Mossadeq experiment showed us that. But it would he disastrous to us all. There is an utter inconsistency - reckless inconsistency - between Socialist foreign and domestic policy, as they outlined it at Blackpool. How can we at one and the same time abandon our interests abroad, invite foreigners to nationalise them, and improve our social services at home? Greater nonsense has never been uttered.We have now to consider what can be done nationally to increase both opportunity and incentive. This is the aim of our Party. It is unjust to pretend that in the period of Conservative Government, we have not made efforts to create opportunity and to encourage incentives. We would have liked to do more. I admit it. We are now trying - the Chancellor labours at that constantly with a persistence for which we should be grateful - to improve our national finances and to encourage savings to make this possible. I must recall to you that in four years, you, Mr. Chairman, three times reduced direct taxation at all levels. This was all the more remarkable when we recall the crumbling inheritance left to you by the present Leader of the Opposition. Mr. Macmillan, in his first Budget this April, did something equally important. He gave new incentives to saving. I know some people scoffed at Mr. Macmillan\u2019s plans to make savings more attractive. Well, now you know that they were wrong.Lord Mackintosh, the Chairman of the National Savings Movement, has just told us that in the last six months small savings have been a record, the best for eight years. Mr. Macmillan\u2019s Budget, Lord Mackintosh says, has had a tonic effect. And, I add, the most lively - that is the most controversial of the new projects - is not due till next month.The Budget did something else. It made more possible for the self-employed and others to provide for their retirement, and that\u2019s a matter of the greatest importance to a very large number of people. Don\u2019t doubt this, we want to do more to reduce the burden of taxation. The Chancellor knows, as we all know, that this weighs heavily on those with fixed incomes and what are loosely called the middle classes. The spending power of our money affects them too.  The Chancellor of the Exchequer might have given more of his surplus away this year, as it was tempting to do, before he had built up our reserves and strengthened our balance of payments. The result in the short run would have been encouraging to you, but in the long run it would have proved no help but a further blow to those on fixed incomes most affected by the fall in the value of money.The position is now improving, thanks to the Chancellor\u2019s sternness and his efforts. Now we shall take the first opportunity to give whatever further help we can. But all action must be governed by the national interest. This has never been, and is never going to be, as long as I have anything to do with it, a class Party. We have been handicapped, it\u2019s true, in certain respects by a legacy which we have to carry, even though it is a proud one. Half the world\u2019s trade is still being carried on in sterling with a margin of reserves much below what we would wish. That is a direct consequence of the sacrifices of two world wars. It is also a condition which constantly limits our ability to do what we want to do at home because of its effect on the world exchanges.Since I last spoke to you, the Government has been fighting a grim battle against inflation, which means encouraging exports at the expense of the home market. We have had some success in this. Despite all difficulties, many of our industries are showing a splendid example. In these last months we have been winning a growing number of orders in the highly competitive dollar market, and this year our earnings of dollars have increased steadily.Of course, we knew that none of the steps we took to improve the balance of trade - none of them - could be popular. They haven\u2019t been. But they are working. Our exports, which are the real test of our nation\u2019s life, are ten per cent above last year, our imports this year are only one per cent above last year. Or, to put it another way, the gap between our exports and our imports has on the average been £22,000,000 a month less than it was last year. In other words, the credit squeeze is working as it was intended to work. It is, in fact, forcing the inflation out of the economy. The process is extremely disagreeable - I know that - but it is healthy, and it is going to have this result. We shall be more competitive with other nations, but we shall no longer enjoy - and we have to face it - easy money or increases in profits or in wages which have not been earned. That is the answer to those who have said that our measures were ineffective.  It is also the answer to those who clamour for them to be relaxed. They cannot be until the cure is carried further.This is always a difficult time of the year for our gold and dollar reserves. But we can at least note an improvement on 1955. The reserves since January have increased by £74,000,000. Last year in the same period they fell by £148,000,000. It is quite true - I must immediately add this - that in the total this year must be included the sale of the Trinidad Oil Company. This sale hit the headlines. But news which does this sometimes distorts the picture. What is less well known is what I am going to tell you now - that during this year our investment in the oil industry overseas, including the Commonwealth, will much more than offset the Trinidad sale. At the end of the year our stake in the oil industry overseas outside this country will show a very considerable increase over 1955.However unpopular the credit squeeze, it is all part of the battle against rising prices. Victory here finally depends upon the soundness of our economy. And it is the long-term results that count. That is why we have abolished some food subsidies, notably that on bread. We have done that in the interests of the soundness of our economy. It cannot be right indefinitely to subsidise one food, however important, and to allow everybody, however wealthy, to gain personally thereby. Despite the abolition of the subsidies, the cost of living has remained more stable than it did last year, and, of course, much more stable than it did in 1951, when the Socialists were last in office. In that year the rise was 12 per cent. So far this year the rise has been two per cent. And that at a time when the cost of living has begun to rise in other countries, including the United States and Canada.Indeed, some prices are falling. The farming industry has suffered from a fall in fat-stock prices. This was much sharper than we had expected when our price system was worked out. We therefore felt it right to see at once what we could do to put matters right more speedily. We have decided to work out an improved system with the farmers\u2019 representatives, as a result of which the Government will authorise a substantial supplementary payment. The Chancellor of the Exchequer has agreed to provide a sum of about £l0,000,000, with the aim of bringing the average return to the industry for the current livestock year closer to the standard price of 151/- a cwt. I am sure you will agree that it is only just that we should bring immediate help to an important section of that industry.This wretched substitute for a summer has enormously increased the difficulties of all engaged in agriculture. They have made a most gallant effort to bring in the harvest against all odds.Over the general field of the cost of living, the essential now is to keep the steadiness in prices which is being so hardly won. We can do it. But we can do it only if we put an end to the constantly rising spiral in wages and prices forcing each other up. The real test of the wage packet is what it will buy, and the only way to make it buy more is to produce more.  There isn\u2019t any other. And what is true of wages is just as true of profits.I have spoken of incentive. And now about opportunity. Here we have been creating throughout the land educational opportunities far exceeding anything that this country has ever known. Despite all the pressures upon the economy and many other claims on our resources, we have maintained high priority for education. I am sure that this is a good national investment. We are opening ten new schools every week. Most of these are secondary schools, because it is there that the need for increased accommodation will chiefly be felt in the next few years. In five years time one child out of every three over the age of 11 will be receiving his education in a new school. That\u2019s not all. Through the ingenuity of two successive Ministers of Education, we are doing this at little more than half the cost per school place under the Socialist Government.We have also multiplied the opportunities for careers for boys and girls in the many spheres of technical education. We have not been dawdling either. We published our White Paper, you may remember, on Technical Education this spring. It allowed for £80,000,000 of capital expenditure for the next five years. I can report to you that £50,000,000 worth of these building projects, which represent commitments of local authorities as far ahead as March 1959, have already been approved. This includes the help we are giving to the colleges of advanced technology, most important for the future of our industrial life, but not the additional help which we are giving to universities. We don\u2019t believe in too much central control in development of this kind. The men on the spot best know the needs of local industry. We do believe in encouraging and guiding this programme, which is so fateful for our future, and surely all this work is better than arguing the point, so dear to the Socialist heart, whether every boy, or no boy - they are not sure which - can go to a public school?It is in this same spirit of working for the future that we have approached the problem of the development of nuclear power, most exciting of all topics at the present time. We have deliberately given these projects a certain privileged position. Already we have earned a reward because the two new atomic power stations now soon to be built, will produce about twice as much power as seemed likely when the project was being discussed eighteen months ago.This is 1956. It is not 1906 and the period of Taff Vale.  Nor is it 1926 and the General Strike. It is in the consciousness of this that we have had repeated and, I think, useful discussions with representatives of the Trades Union Congress since we came into power. We think that it is right for the Government to keep in touch with the representatives of organised labour.  But I am sure that responsible trade union opinion understands as well as we do what are the realities of our respective positions in the State.  It is not for me to define the responsibilities of others. But we, as the elected Government of this country, are answerable through Parliament to the electors of this country and only to them. It is our duty to put forward the policies which we believe to be right. This we shall do. And as long as Parliament supports us, we will carry them through.I am very glad of the welcome which the Conference gave yesterday to the idea of the contract of service. This is absolutely in accordance with the principles we believe in here. We wish the Minister of Labour all success in his efforts to make this proposal a reality in British industry.There are all sorts of forecasts about the future of our Party. We are very grateful for them. I am sure they are all givers with the best intentions. People amuse themselves by taking our temperature for us several times a month. They don\u2019t often get it right. But all this is of little importance provided we hold to our principles, know where we are coming and are determined to get there. This Government has every determination to fulfil its mandate, which is for the whole life of a Parliament. When that work is done it will be the time to judge us. In the meanwhile, what matters most to us, and, if I may say so, to me as Leader of the Party, is the virility and imagination of the support we are receiving from the younger generation. I believe that to be growing, and from natural causes.  What is the good of saying to a young man: \u2018Work hard, seize your opportunities.  And at the end of 20 years of brilliant effort you may hope to gain equality, or, perhaps, if you are very fortunate your industry may be nationalised?\u2019 For those are to this day the purposes of Socialist policies. It is only in their ranks that anyone can still be found so reactionary as to want to extend nationalisation to any other industry. But make no mistake about it. They still exist, and if the Socialists were ever elected they would still carry out that policy. Their left outside - I beg pardon - their outside left wing, now centre forward, would see to that. Yet if there is one issue upon which the overwhelming majority of this country is united, it is this: no more nationalisation. In our ranks we want to create for our \u2018younger\u2019 supporters an atmosphere in which they can instinctively feel that they are at home in a national Party.A Party which believes in our nation\u2019s future can inspire our people to put its strength into what it seeks to do. If the younger generation knows this, if it knows it is going to be given better opportunities, if it is tingling with technical skill, if it knows that greater effort will win greater reward, then young people are going to join our ranks. They will understand that we, and not the embittered equalisers, are their hope.I am glad, therefore, that the Young Conservatives among you are going back from this Conference to start a new drive for membership on Monday. You are losing no time about it. And please, even in your drive for membership, look for quality rather than quantity. You are already the largest political youth organisation in the country - indeed, I believe, in the free world.  It is good, even so, to add to your members. Go out and search for new recruits. But make sure that they are the young men and women who really share your faith, your vision and your determination for your country\u2019s future. There we have the emblems of the campaign upon which you are shortly to start.  We all wish you luck in that effort.I look forward to meeting thousands of you at the Festival Hall in London next month at the end of your campaign. I take this opportunity to urge all the senior branches of our Association to do everything in their power to lend a hand in this campaign.I will now speak to you about the situation in respect of the Suez Canal dispute. Before we examine the political implications of this event I must record in plainest terms the economic impact upon our life in this country of any hostile interference in the free passage of the Canal. It is no exaggeration to say that this is a matter of survival for us as a trading nation. It concerns the employment, the standard of living and the pay packet of every man and woman in the land.Many charges have been brought against the Government by our critics in this country. The most fantastic of them is that we have not acted in accordance with the United Nations Charter. Nothing could be further from the truth, and no such accusation can be maintained by anybody who has either read the Charter or followed our course of action. To prove this I must briefly recall to you what we have done.First, we consulted with our two principal Allies. Then we called together the 24 principal users of the Canal. With two exceptions only, Egypt and Greece, they accepted the invitation to London.  The conference was brilliantly conducted with the Foreign Secretary in the Chair.  Within a week, eighteen nations agreed to a set of proposals put forward by the United States in agreement with France and ourselves. They were designed to ensure the efficient operation, maintenance and development of the Canal in co-operation with Egypt, and with due regard to her rights and interests. The eighteen nations also agreed that these proposals should be presented to Egypt as a basis for negotiation.All of this was entirely in accord with the Charter, Article 33 of which enjoins us to attempt to reach a settlement through negotiation. We did so. A mission was then selected to go to Cairo on behalf of the eighteen nations. Five countries were chosen, recall them: Australia, the United States, Persia, Ethiopia and Sweden, representing the four corners of the earth. Is anybody going to call those colonial powers? I would not. They were in fact representatives of the 18 users of the Canal, whose total traffic forms more than 90 per cent of the total. We were fortunate when Mr. Menzies, the Prime Minister of Australia, undertook the Chairmanship. We owe a great debt to him. Could any men have shown more patience than these five did in explaining the unanimous view of the 18 powers to Colonel Nasser? Was that wrong? Was that against the Charter?  Or perhaps was that colonialism? Clearly, the 18 powers did not think so.  Yet Colonel Nasser turned down the proposals and made no counter-proposal.It was then we decided to set up an Association of Users of the Canal. The terms of reference announced by the French Government and by ourselves were identical because they had been agreed in advance with the Government of the United States. Of course, this Association was at no time intended to take the place of the basis of negotiation offered by the 18 powers. It was designed to safeguard the rights and interest of the users pending a permanent settlement.All that again is in accord with both the letter and the spirit of Article 33 of the Charter. Indeed, let me tell you this, to have gone to the Security Council without any previous attempt at direct negotiation would have been contrary to the provisions of the Charter; and to have gone to the Security Council without previous consultation amongst the users of the Canal would have been to invite confusion. The Security Council would have been discussing the subject without any plan or set of principles to guide it.  When the 18 nations met in London for the second time they had before them these proposals for a Users\u2019 Association, as well as Colonel Nasser\u2019s reply delivered after Mr. Menzies had left Cairo. The 18 powers were unanimous in regarding Colonel Nasser\u2019s reply as unacceptable.It was in these circumstances that we and the French Government decided to take the issue to the Security Council, having given notice that we were likely to do so a fortnight before. How can anyone pretend that our conduct has been other than completely in accord with our obligations to UNO? The whole storm about this at home has been utterly artificial and partisan, and unworthy of any political party in this country.  There was never any question of whether we should go to UNO, only when.  And on timing the Government of the day must be the judge.  We can hand that over to nobody else. For the Government has to consider not only public opinion in its own country but the views and opinions of other nations, in particular of its Allies.I want to remind you that the Socialist Government itself pursued a precisely similar course in respect of the Berlin Airlift, the most important international issue since the war until now. The Socialist Government did not go to the Security Council in six weeks, as we did, but after three and a half months. We did not chivvy and abuse them for this. On the contrary, we supported them, because we knew that they were playing the hand, and we thought that the country\u2019s interest should come before any attempt at mere party advantage. Have you ever thought of this? Had we been in office at that time, I wonder how much support a Conservative Government would have received, had it pursued exactly the same policy in respect of that event, as did the Labour Government.  It is, indeed, extraordinary in 1956 to find the Socialist Party, of all Parties, abandoning internationalism in favour of ultra-nationalism.Through all these negotiations, difficult as they have been, peace has been our aim. But not peace at any price. And I will tell you why. Because in dealing with a dictatorship, peace at any price means to increase step by step the dangers of universal war. What is at stake here is not just the Canal, important though that is. It is the sanctity of international engagements. This is the supreme lesson of the period between the wars. I can never forget it.You know, when the United Nations Charter was negotiated, as far as this country was concerned, by an all Party delegation which I had the honour to lead, in the closing months of the war, when we were debating the ratification of the Charter in the House of Commons, Mr. Attlee, as he was then, was Prime Minister. He then rightly pointed out - and I want you to note this - he pointed to \u2018a great advance\u2019 on the original draft, due to a United Kingdom initiative. Originally the Charter had only said that international disputes should be settled by peaceful means, in its final form it declared that such disputes must also be settled \u2018in conformity with the principles of justice and international law.\u2019 Thus, I ask you to note, we have not only the right but the obligation to see that the principles of justice and international law are upheld. When Colonel Nasser seized the Canal, we thought it our duty to take certain military steps in the Eastern Mediterranean. The Government has no intention of modifying or withdrawing from this decision. In order to carry it out, Parliament gave us without a vote certain powers which we have used, but not abused.  Those precautions had to be taken to enable us to take action in defence of British life and interests, or in any other emergency that might arise in the area concerned.All that we have done since is completely in accord with what I said at the time. The movement of every unit has been either to British territory or to territories where we have Treaty rights, not one of which we save infringed in the slightest degree. In other words, we have shown the most absolute restraint.The presence of our forces in the Eastern Mediterranean, far from inflaming the situation, has greatly decreased the danger of further incidents and induced a measure of caution in some minds. In this respect, as in so many others, I agree with the Prime Minister of France, when he said that our action had already justified itself.What would anyone in this country have said if we had not taken these precautions? And if there had been a repetition of the massacre in Cairo in 1952?  Better to be safe than sorry. Some have protested that the precautions are on too large a scale. My reply is that if you are determined to defend national interests nothing is more foolish than to do so with inadequate forces.  Others ask, do we need to keep it up? Yes we do.  To relax now before a settlement is reached would be fatal. I deeply regret - and I know nobody does more so than the Minister of Defence - that in making these military movements we have had to interfere with the private life of some families, in particular the Reservists, and the Regulars of all three Services whose release has had to be deferred. They are all fulfilling a national duty, and, it is fair to add, are doing so in the overwhelming majority of cases with patience and good humour. This is all the more credit to them since they have not been encouraged to do so by some politicians and some sections of the press.I know there are some who argue that we should have acted more promptly by striking back the moment Colonel Nasser seized the Canal. I do not agree. By going through every stage which the Charter lays down, we have given an example of restraint and respect for international undertaking. But that does not alter the responsibility which rests upon us, and upon our allies, to ensure that justice is done and that international obligations are fulfilled. After all, the United Nations Charter was set up to discourage breaches of inter national agreements, not to allow them to pass with impunity. I have seen it suggested that this dispute about the Canal has something to do with colonialism. No comment could be more misleading. Colonialism has nothing to do with the matter one way or the other. We have never disputed Egyptian sovereignty. What is at stake in this dispute is whether the sanctity of contracts has to be respected or not.But if we are to discuss colonialism, is there any country in the world that has ever done so much to bring the people of its great Empire stage by stage to full nationhood? The process is going on now as we stand here.  And no one has the right to cast a stone at us. Contrast that with countries taken over by Communism, the Baltic States, for instance. There the silence of dead night descends.The Opposition\u2019s attitude in this country has, of course, completely changed since the debate on 2nd August. That is the outcome of pressure from the extreme Left. That is clear for all to see. On 2nd August the Leader of the Opposition compared Nasser\u2019s conduct with that of Hither and Mussolini. He was the first to use that simile. Whether he now would like credit for it I cannot say.  Indeed, he made a speech in which he used language more vehement than I had employed.This is not just my opinion. I will give you a Socialist authority for it. Lord Stansgate, better known in the House of Commons in former days as Mr. Wedgwood Benn, father of another Anthony, made this observation in the House of Lords that day: \u2018I can correctly and sincerely say that I found much more reason, common sense and conviction in the Prime Minister\u2019s speech than there was in the rather heady wine which was produced by my own Front Bench.\u2019So much for Lord Stansgate.It is clear that this forthright speech of the Leader of the Opposition did not please everyone. It did not please in particular the enemies of a bipartisan foreign policy. For after 2nd August, what happened? Tribune hit out, not at me, but at the Leader of the Opposition. It accused him of outdoing the Tories in suggesting ways of putting pressure on Egypt.  So the ignominious retreat began, and in due course the retreat became a rout, until we reached the point when the seconder of the Suez resolution at the Socialist Party Conference could say that if the United Nations sanctioned the use of force or economic sanctions, the British Labour movement would do everything in its power to oppose these moves. Those who speak like that are of a kidney we have learned to recognise. They are the friends of every country but their own. Those who exult that bipartisanship is dead are the same as those who criticised their own Socialist Foreign Secretary, Ernest Bevin, when he was alive. They are those who exploit every difficulty we face abroad for their own party purposes.  What a contrast to the loyal support Ernest Bevin received from Conservatives on the many occasions when the interests and prestige of our country were in the balance.Let me sum up where we stand.  From the beginning we have never changed our position. It is not changed now. It remains, as I stated it in the House of Commons on 30th July - the first statement of the Government: \u2018No arrangement for the future of this great international waterway could be acceptable to Her Majesty\u2019s Government which would leave it in the unfettered control of a single Power which could, as recent events have shown, exploit it purely for purposes of national policy.\u2019 That is our position and it has not changed. It remains our intention to seek its acceptance by negotiation if we possibly can.I am not yet in a position to tell you what the chances are of realising this. The last report I have received from the Foreign Secretary this morning - the Foreign Secretary in whom we have the utmost confidence \u2013 is that a little progress has been made but there are still wide differences of opinion. If such progress has been made it is due to the firmness and resolution we and those who think like us in other lands have been showing throughout this crisis. I must, however, warn you not to indulge in hasty or overoptimistic judgment. President Eisenhower in his Press Conference on Thursday [October 11th] was reported to have said that you must have peace with justice or it is not peace. I agree with those words. We should all take them as our text.  That is why we have always said that with us force is the last resort, but it cannot be excluded. Therefore, we have refused to say that in no circumstances would we ever use force.  No responsible Government could ever give such a pledge.This facing of the facts has been seized on by many Socialists as somehow immoral or a refusal to trust to the process of international law. That is a completely mistaken attitude.  The history of every nation shows that it is not sufficient to have good laws, if the power to enforce them is lacking. That, in turn, depends upon the strength of will and the integrity of the executive. These conditions apply equally on the international plane. To turn a blind eye to the realities of the situation would be to hazard not only the security of our own country, but to surrender our responsibilities in the world. This we are not prepared to do.I cannot close my comment on this situation without expressing the satisfaction we all feel at the unity between ourselves and our French allies throughout these anxious weeks.  Stage by stage we have been in close agreement. One happy consequence of all this has been to increase the sense of partnership between the nations of Western Europe. The truth is we all have a common interest in this, as in so many other matters. For us in Britain the Commonwealth must always come first. But, you know, increasingly our neighbours in Western Europe understand that this is true and accept it. And it could be greatly to the advantage of this country and of the Commonwealth, if in commerce, and in other matters too, we in Western Europe could draw closer together and always practise joint policies as well as observe joint treaties. It is my hope that this community of interest and loyal friendship may one day find expression in some closer form of relationship between us.So here, in conclusion, is the design I put before you. Incentive and opportunity at home; respect for engagements abroad; courage and imagination in our approach to the Commonwealth and to Europe. Here are national aims which only our Party can fulfil. (Loud and prolonged applause)

aVHAROLD MACMILLAN, 1957, Brighton   My Lord Chairman, I need not tell you how glad we are to see you among us this afternoon. This vast audience has already demonstrated the affection and esteem in which our Party holds you and will always hold you. Since the last Mass Meeting of the Conservative Conference we have lived through a difficult and tumultuous year, even judged by the standards of this modern age. It speaks much for the strength of the Conservative and Unionist Party and the basic loyalty and steadfastness of all our people that we have overcome so many troubles and are facing the future today with such resolution and confidence. Everyone in this hall will I am sure understand the somewhat mixed feelings with which I approach my task today.First, I need not hide it from you, pride at the honour which the Party has done me in electing me their leader; next, humility, when I think of the magnitude of my responsibilities; finally sorrow that the leadership should have come to me in the way it did, through the illness and retirement of my friend and colleague Anthony Eden. But to these I must frankly add a sense of inspiration at the challenge of the great issues at home and abroad.Once again, as twice in my lifetime, we shall only overcome them by unity and daring. I have naturally drawn great comfort and strength from the support of my colleagues in the Government, from our Members of Parliament, and from all of you in this hall who give the Party its direction and vigour in the constituencies throughout the country.In the course of this Conference you have heard speeches from most of the leading Ministers. I am sure you must be impressed by the grasp of the subject and the breadth of vision which they have displayed. You have heard the Foreign Secretary and shown the confidence and support you have for him amid his heavy responsibilities. You have heard the Chancellor of the Exchequer and been able to admire the courage he is displaying in facing his onerous tasks. There is one, alas, of my colleagues who has not been able to be here, the Home Secretary. We are indeed sorry that he is not with us but it is good to learn that he is heading towards full recovery, for the Party owes him more than it can ever repay.Now I come to the Party. Here again I want to thank two men particularly. Oliver Poole, who has been a wonderful help to me ever since I first became leader; who kept his head clear and his heart loyal during the first months of difficulty and who has shown a real sense of duty and team spirit in continuing to serve us in that part of our work where he can give us the greatest help. And now I come to Lord Hailsham. I do not think I need say very much about him. He speaks for himself - and very well. I would like to say this. He did not seek this post. He did not want it. Beneath a certain buoyancy which we all love in him, there lies a sincere modesty. He did not think he could do it. But when I pressed him, he finally replied, as I expected, that he would do anything that I asked him to do to the best of his ability. When I told him of Oliver Poole\u2019s generous proposal, then indeed many of the new Chairman\u2019s anxieties were removed. Together they will make a fine team Give them all your support.Now, I come to this Conference. But before I do so, I am sure you would wish me to express our gratitude to Sir Stephen Pierssené who has served us well and long. We hope he may have many happy years of activity, but perhaps in a less strenuous sphere. At the same time I would like to welcome his successor, Mr. Urton, who is no stranger to most of us.Now, for the Conference. It has been an inspiring Conference. I think I remember saying on one of these occasions that it was a happy dispensation of Providence that decreed that the Conservative Party Conference should always take place a week after the Socialist Party Conference. At least it makes it easy for the country to draw its own conclusions. There is hardly any need to underline the contrast: \u2018To point the moral or adorn the tale.\u2019This week the keynote of our Conference has been that combination of realism and idealism, so difficult to attain but without which no human organisation has the right to live, or the power to survive. No one who has been here and heard the wide-ranging and thoughtful debates, or read them in the newspapers, or listened on the radio, or looked at the television, can fail to realise that this is a modern twentieth century Party: a Party drawn from every section of the Nation; a Party with the largest youth organisation; a Party which, while resting its foundations in the past, is building for the future; a Party seeking real solutions to modern problems, seeking them with determination, with knowledge and, as is your right, with a certain amount of criticism. I am all for criticism. We cannot just live by patting each other on the back. But we have never gone in for stabbing each other in the back. I read during the recess that Mr. Gaitskell was suffering from a crick in the neck. I was very sorry, but not at all surprised. Looking over your shoulder is the occupational disease of left wing leaders. Here, at any rate, we look each other in the face.I want to speak first about the outside world - what used to be called foreign affairs. But really that phrase is out of date. In old days foreign affairs meant something remote, rather mysterious, only understood by a few experts. Now we have learnt only too well that our fortunes at home are inextricably linked with the world outside, financially, economically, materially, morally. This modern world in which we live is dominated by three great facts. The fact of Communism; the fact of the new nationalism; and the fact of nuclear power and modern technology with all their immense possibilities for good and for evil.We were brought up to divide history into times of peace, sometimes secure, sometimes less secure, but still peace; and times of war. But Communism has changed all that. It has destroyed the old distinction. It is a continual war. Cold war we call it, a never-ending struggle between two opposing forces. To most of us it is the struggle between good and evil. But when we say this, we must try to live up to our claim. The challenge to freedom does not only come from abroad. At any rate, we all know the weapons of Communism, both at home and abroad. Propaganda and intimidation to weaken the West by fear, subversion of areas where our vital interests are at stake, and the perversion and arming of nationalism to serve Communist ends. We have to resist these tactics by every means in our power.At the same time we have to seek - and we are honestly seeking - some kind of an answer by which the danger until it can be finally removed can at least be contained. Peaceful coexistence is fine so long as it is really peaceful, and each side is prepared to live together without trying to undermine the other by plot and intrigue. Yet we must not deceive ourselves as to the nature of this struggle. It is, I fear, one of those great secular divisions from which the world has suffered in the past and which now takes a new and dangerous form. We must be patient as well as prudent. For the conflict is moral as well as material. To meet it we must assess calmly the aims and methods of those who confront us. We must meet any goodwill with equal goodwill. But we must avoid wishful thinking which would accept mere words and phrases at their face value. Deeds, not words, these are the only reality. Above all, we must not lower our guard, nor underrate our own strength. We must certainly not undermine it ourselves.We have, as I see it, a triple shield. First, there is the community of purpose and moral influence of our own Commonwealth of Nations. Second, there is the growing solidarity of Western Europe. Third, there is our alliance with the United States. One of the great though quiet achievements of the past few months has been the recognition in London and Washington that we must act together. In the Far Eastern troubles of 1954, America insisted on the peril. She was then prepared to go it alone, but we were for restraint. Then a year ago America thought that we had been too hasty over Suez. To us, it seemed that they were too slow to understand what was really involved.The Communists, of course, still hope to divide us; and if they can do that, their task will be easy. Of course, there are plenty of people who are tempted to harp upon and exaggerate our occasional differences. But I must say frankly that if they do so, they are wittingly or unwittingly playing the Communist game. For on the unity of purpose and policy of the Commonwealth, Europe and the United States lies the hope and the only hope of the free world.There is one vital aspect of defence in which America and Britain are jointly determined. It is well for the world that that has been so. I mean, of course, the nuclear bomb. This is a matter which needs calmness of judgment as well as imagination; sense as well as sensibility. Nobody can deny that it has been the Western possession of the bomb which has deterred and still deters the Soviet Union from open aggression. Even the most recent developments, however startling, have not altered this strategic fact. It is our will to retaliate with nuclear strength which prevents them daring to launch their enormous forces against us. And it is for this reason that during this year I, with the full support of my colleagues, have resisted all the pressure from so many sources to abandon the manufacture and testing of our weapon without any safeguards for our own security. The pressure was very severe; some of it, of course, was not respectable - it came from Communist or Communist-inspired sources. I did not mind that, but much of it came from the most worthy and high-minded men and women - whose views I naturally respect. But events have shown how wise my colleagues and I were to stand firm, and not to send our Foreign Secretary in the words used in this hall a week ago, \u2018naked into the Conference Chamber.\u2019The story, you know, was told of Wilkes, the great 18th Century demagogue and agitator, that when in his more respectable and declining years he was speaking to the King, the Monarch was surprised at his moderation. \u2018Ah!\u2019 said Wilkes, \u2018I was never much of a Wilkite myself.\u2019I am beginning to think that Mr. Bevan was never much of a Bevanite. Of course, I must admit that the second Socialist resolution last week asking us to undertake no more nuclear tests seemed rather to undermine the first. It seemed to take us back to Mr. Gaitskell\u2019s original idea that we should make the bomb but not test it. I never thought that a very prudent plan. But no doubt this was a tactical concession to the extremists. In any case, our position is clear. We want to end the testing and production of nuclear weapons, but we want to make sure that if we make such an agreement it can and will be enforced. But getting rid of the bomb is not enough. At the same time we must have some reduction of conventional forces.We want, of course, to free the world from the shadow of the nuclear threat. But we cannot give up our deterrent if as a result we are left in a position of hopeless weakness and inequality in conventional forces.We and our allies have made one proposal after another. They take full account of Soviet security as well as of our own - that is the only way. As yet, so far we have had no real response. We have had nothing but propaganda arguments. But we do not despair. We shall go on trying. Meanwhile, so long as we have the retaliatory power I do not believe that a mass assault by the Soviet forces upon us is practicable. Sir Winston Churchill pointed out that in the stalemate may lie the hope of avoiding global war. Yet we have to accept this fact that if Communism is checked in that way, it will turn to other methods. We have to meet subversion in all its various forms. We must help our friends all over the world who are in danger.All this means a long and sustained effort. We must not overstrain ourselves. We must not exhaust our economy in Britain by attempting too much. Nothing would suit the Communist powers better or serve our allies worse. That is the purpose of our new defence plan. We believe that we can best fulfil our tasks both in the deterrent and in what we have called the police work that falls upon us from time to time all over the world by well-equipped volunteer forces. We have always said that we would dispense with National Service as soon as it became possible to do so. That is our aim. Industry will of course benefit when the call-up stops.  The whole economy will benefit and we should be able to look to our great tradition of volunteer service to match the nation\u2019s needs.For the moment the Soviet advance has been halted in Europe. The powerful organisation of NATO stands firm. In the Far East, SEATO has come into being and the situation, though precarious, is less anxious than it was a year or two ago. It is natural therefore that checked in two directions the Communist flood should have sought the weakest point - that has been and still is the Middle East.A year ago when we ascribed much of the troubles of the Middle East to Russian infiltration our analysis was questioned and even ridiculed. I do not think anyone would question it today. Recent events in Syria have shown how persistent Communist subversion can be. One of the great gains of recent months is that our American friends are now determined in close collaboration with us to do all they can to assist and aid the countries of the Middle East. For I am persuaded that it is in the interests of these countries as well as our own that the economic co-operation and friendly relations which have done so much to build up their freedom in the past should be strengthened and not weakened. For it is by this honourable partnership that the standard of the countries of the Middle East and their strength can be continually improved. Soviet infiltration and interference would in the long run prove a menace to both. We trust that the Middle Eastern peoples will see the danger to themselves, that they will discover before it is too late that the Communists who charge us with \u2018colonialism\u2019 are themselves the cruellest imperialists.Let us remind the world that the Iron Curtain has gathered behind its sinister folds no less than a hundred million people in Europe alone since the end of the war. Britain, during that time or in the same period, has helped five times that number - about five hundred million people - in Asia and Africa to achieve nationhood as full and free members of the Commonwealth. The free Commonwealth is our answer to the claims and problems of growing nationalism. What was Communism\u2019s answer? What is it today? It can be summed up in a single word - Hungary. Therefore, while the world outside is full of dangers and difficulties, let us take heart. Let us hold on together. Above all let us hold together the three groups of nations of which we are the only country to be a member of all - the Commonwealth, Europe, and the Anglo-American Alliance.Only thus can we do our duty by our own peoples and by the United Nations, whose principles we are all pledged to serve and whose authority we seek all the time to strengthen. Yet, if we are to discharge our duty in the world, our power to do so must depend above all upon our domestic economic strength. I believe we have the will, although, of course, there are faint hearts and defeatists everywhere in every country. What we must ensure is that not only that we have the ends but that we have the means. Our foreign policy must rest upon the strength of our economy.Now I come to a question with which you have dealt. One problem has troubled us both at home and abroad. It is the problem of inflation. So much has been said in this hall during this week that you will not expect me to repeat it. Our great pre-war problem was unemployment.  Our great post-war problem has been inflation.  Before the war, under Conservative and Labour Governments alike, there were many men and women unemployed. There were machines standing idle.  In those days prices were low but unemployment was high. Today we have full employment. In most years, since the war, we have had a labour shortage; that is to say, more jobs in industry than men and women to fill them. All this has brought with it the problem of rising prices. This has confronted both Parties since the war - and many other countries besides our own.Our first responsibility, therefore, is to see that inflation does not undermine our economic position or endanger the expansion of our economy. We have had our successes. In spite of all our difficulties we have achieved as a nation a good surplus in balance of payments. This year it will be some £200,000,000. We have invested heavily overseas, and of course in our capacity as bankers to the sterling area we have had to meet heavy drawings on the central reserves from the rapidly developing countries of the Commonwealth. Meanwhile, at home we have reached, so far as the mass of the people are concerned, the highest standard of living in our history.I see that Mr. Bevan called the people \u2018an embittered and frustrated industrial mass.\u2019 I do not know where he got that impression from. Has he never seen any of those six million TV aerials which have gone up since 1951? Has he never run across any of the extra two million cars or motor bicycles? Does his view not embrace any of those houses he did not build but we did?Let us be frank. The wage earner and the business man find wages and profits go far above prices. It is the pensioner, the retired man, the people on fixed or nearly fixed incomes, who have borne the burden. I said at Bedford recently, and I say again today, we have a clear duty to those sections of our people who have not shared in this general prosperity and that duty we intend to discharge.This is, of course, a many-sided problem. We are not merely an industrial country; we are the bankers to the sterling area. From this we gain great advantages. It helps us, but it brings corresponding risks and responsibilities. The fact that the greater part of the world\u2019s trade is done in our money means that our money can be vulnerable. Our policies must command confidence not only in this country but abroad. And confidence in our money is affected not only by events in this country but also by what is happening abroad. During this summer the pound suffered because people abroad feared that the British Government and people would not boldly face the problems of inflation or of extra wage claims not matched by extra production. It also suffered, and perhaps to a greater degree, because people abroad believed that the German deutschmark was undervalued and saw a hope of a quick capital profit by buying marks. Let us try to get this in perspective for a moment.In 1951 we took over this country in a state of extreme - almost desperate - crisis. The Socialist Government was so frightened of the situation that they did not even try to deal with it. They had not the courage for that - they ran away from it. It is true they summoned Parliament - but only to dissolve it. We certainly do not mean to run away from our responsibilities. After the first year, when we had to follow and intensify measures of restriction, import controls and the like, we have developed a policy of expansion through freedom, opportunity and incentive - and this coupled with a continuing reduction in the burden of taxation. Monetary policy, restriction or easing of credit, acceleration or retardation in this or that part of the investment programme over which the Government has direct control - surely these are the measures which we must intensify or relax according to the state of the economic barometer.Nor must we forget the human element. Incentive is necessary if we are to get real expansion, and that is why we have made tax reductions amounting in all to some £800,000,000 or £900,000,000 a year. Nevertheless, when the boom in investment developed in 1955, bringing a danger of renewed inflation, we brought in measures designed to get people to hold back on buying and save more. The credit squeeze helped to restrain the boom within the limits of our resources, restrictions on hire-purchase damped down a bit the spending out of borrowed money. National savings were assisted by higher interest rates, income tax concessions on small saving, and - dare I remind you of it - the launching of the premium bond.These policies took, of course, some time to work, but they did work. And the result is that we have now a decent surplus on our balance of payments. We have increased both exports and savings to record levels. But the threat today does not come from a shortage of money of the type that led to unemployment between the wars. It is really no good trying to revive the bogey of Mr. Montagu Norman. Everyone is fully employed - indeed, there is, if anything, a shortage of labour. The danger does not come from too little money in the system. It comes from too much. In other words from inflation.Of course, the Government could, but will not in principle, allow money, paper money - for that is what it is - to be created to ensure that, for the time being, the spiral of wages and prices goes merrily up.  But who gains? The wage earner won\u2019t gain in the long run, and all the rest of the community will lose. The spiral won\u2019t keep on going up - sooner or later it will blow up. Then all will lose in a common disaster, in which the trade by which we live, our savings of the past, and our hopes for the future would all be involved. This is where the real threat of unemployment lies - not in the Government\u2019s measures to deal with the problem.There is another misunderstanding I would like to clear up. It is not true to say that there is a freeze on private investment. Private investment can be financed in three ways - either by bank overdraft, by internal savings of a company, or by raising fresh capital from the public. The first certainly cannot be increased because the bank overdrafts are to be held on average to last year\u2019s figures, and these are forms of money that are in a sense creating money. The second depends upon the wise and prudent policy of those who direct industry. The third, raising money on the market, depends upon what is judged to be the capacity of the market to absorb it, which is another way of saying, upon the willingness of people to save. I am sure we must aim to match our investment by genuine saving. And if more is saved, why then, more can be invested. In the same way, if more is produced more can be earned - and should be earned. What we cannot afford is more to be paid out, unrelated to higher production.The Chairman has said something about the wicked accusation that we seek to impose unemployment. There may be some people - there must be in this audience - young enough not to have known, there may be some so remote from reality not to realise what mass unemployment involves in human suffering. Certainly anyone of my age, or who has had my experience can never put it out of his mind. We do not seek unemployment - we seek to avert it. And if it ever comes to the people of this country again, it can only come in one way - it will be a self-inflicted wound. Our aim is not to create unemployment and I think our record proves it.Our aim is not to reduce living standards in any section of our people. On the contrary, our fixed purpose is to raise them for all. Our aim is not conflict but unity. Whatever extremists may say, I would urge ordinary men and women of every section of the community to put out of their minds all appeals to prejudice. But I must say this frankly - and it is my duty to say it - that unless we can show common sense all round we may by ill-considered words and deeds throw away the substance for the shadow like the dog in the fable.I cannot believe that our people will make the tragic mistake of throwing away the solid benefits which they have gained and the still more substantial benefits which are within our grasp. Surely what we all ought to be doing now is seeing how we can produce a bit more, not seeing how we can chisel a bit more out of somebody else. I believe that, if they think it over, all those who hold great responsibility, either for the leadership and management of business, or the Trade Unions, will have this thought in mind. In any case, our duty as the Government is clear. In spite of misunderstanding and misrepresentation, we intend to see this thing through. Then our policies will be seen not only to be necessary but fruitful. Meanwhile, I feel sure that we can look to you in this hall, and to all those whom you represent and influence outside, for full and active support.We have seen a good many things through in the last six years. Cast your minds back for a moment. In a fortnight\u2019s time Britain will have had a Conservative Government for six years. Six years of Socialist restriction compared with six years of Conservative opportunity, so we can strike a balance sheet.First, our trading account with the rest of the world. In their six years the Socialists were £800,000,000 in the red. In our six years we are £800,000,000 to the good. We have been earning abroad more than we have been spending and we are doing so now. And we have been investing far more 50 per cent more - half as much again more - overseas than the Socialists did - and that, in spite of the 6,000 million dollars\u2019 worth which they have received in gifts alone. And we have been investing more at home. And even with our new measures will go on doing so. In six years the Socialists built less than a million houses. In six Conservative years nearly twice as many have been completed. For every single school place completed by the Socialists we have completed two. Take the records on taxation. In five Socialist Budgets taxes went up. In five Conservative Budgets taxes have come down. Then look at the difference in the standard of living: one doesn\u2019t need statistics to demonstrate this - the evidence is all around us. Abundance of goods and freedom of choice. It took us less than three years to get rid of food rationing which had persisted through six long Socialist years.You will remember the gibe about \u2018Red Meat.\u2019 What has happened? I will tell you. The gibe has become the joint. Mr. Bevan once said, \u2018Why look in the crystal when you can read the book?\u2019 Well, you can read in the book the comparison between the record of the Socialist and of the Conservative Governments. The facts are all there and six years is a fair period of trial. The trouble is that it is so easy to forget what things were like back in 1951. And, of course, we are such a young Party that many of us do not know.It is easy to forget how we had to take a bit of margarine with us when we went to tea with a friend, how eagerly we queued for what I think was called a bit of off-ration offal, or that strange part of bureaucratic thinking - bananas on green books only. People in those days could not buy nylons except under the counter or from the spivs; we had to dash round looking for candles every time there was a power cut. And even after six years of enlightened Socialism - six years of this Utopia - the Minister of Fuel and Power proudly made this statement. He said: \u2018Electric fires are a major cause of power cuts. We have imposed a purchase tax on them, and the Area Boards no longer display them in showrooms. I am told that in many parts of the country it is becoming really difficult to buy an electric fire.\u2019 What a boast! What a triumph of planning!That was in October 1951. It was in that same month that the Socialist Prime Minister said: \u2018If rationing is good for the people in wartime, surely it must be good for them in peacetime.\u2019 All these things are part and parcel of Socialism. But - and I must be serious - these things are not just a glimpse of the past. They are an awful warning for the future.In due course the British people will be called upon to make a great decision. When that time comes it will be their duty to put aside many of the minor incidents or temporary difficulties, or even grievances, that naturally arise in the life of any country.  It will be true next time, as it was last time and the time before that - to borrow a phrase from our old friend Anthony Eden - that the broad divide in our political life is between Socialism and freedom, between those who accept the doctrine that the State should dominate the life of the individual and those who believe in the highest degree of individual freedom compatible with an ordered community and the common good.That is still the choice today, and will be in two or three years hence. The people have the right to be informed, and a duty to inform themselves as to the real meaning of the programmes set before them. They have to decide, moreover, partly on hard practical grounds - what will best suit their material fortune and prosperity - and partly, if I may be allowed the word, on spiritual grounds, on what best suits the ideals and ambitions that they have for themselves - aye, their children and their fellow countrymen - their country.Let us take first the practical grounds. Our economy, under whatever Government, Left or Right, will have to live in a harshly competitive world. It will have to develop its own strength without the great benefit of the legacy of wealth which has been largely destroyed in two world wars. What are the proposals so far set before us by the Socialists? They pay lip service, of course, to the defence of the pound.  But how do they propose to defend it against the continual pressure to increase wages, regardless of production? First, by the purchase of some 5 million houses, now in private hands, at a cost of perhaps something like £2,500,000,000.  But to turn fixed assets into liquid money hardly seems a very good method of steadying prices or resisting inflation. Then they do it by a series of controls, presumably combined with rationing? That will only bring us back all the frustration and misery, aye, and dishonesty, from which we have recently escaped. They do it by immense increases in public expenditure and so taxation. Will that help? Will they do it by an attack upon industry upon a scale undefined and apparently practically without limits?There has been a great ideological dispute as to precisely which form of nationalisation was to be preferred, the old or the new.  I think the supporters of the new felt that the word nationalisation was not very popular. They came to Brighton not to praise it but to bury it. But really it has all amounted, as far as I can see, to a distinction without a difference. They are using the oldest trick in the world - if the goods do not sell - try them with another label. I read in a Socialist magazine the following account of this dispute: \u2018The real choice\u2019 it says, \u2018is whether the Government is to use public ownership to take a cut in the swag or to use public enterprise to cut the swag itself.\u2019 This is an elegant way of describing these two proposals which have caused such a furore in the Labour Party. All the same, it seems that a compromise was reached, and it was decided to use both methods. There is to be a short list who are to have their throats cut, and a longer list who are to be bled slowly to death.Let me turn for a moment to their foreign policies, which are even more obscure. Some support the principle of the alliances; others oppose it violently. Some are in favour of Britain being armed with atomic and nuclear deterrents; others oppose it bitterly. Some are for the American alliance; others against. Some see in Communism the deadly enemy of all free society; others believe it to be something that can be soothed or flattered or wheedled into harmlessness.We are convinced, and I firmly believe we can convince the mass of our fellow countrymen, that these Socialist theories will not work, that they have been proved not to work, and that they would bring about an early collapse of the whole structure on which we have built up in recent years so much prosperity for all. What is more - I do not believe that anyone really wants that kind of society. Where everything is rationed, where houses are municipalised, where education is uniform, where industry is nationalised, where individual effort is hobbled and derided and where taxes are sky-high. Think of all the bills piling up for the unfortunate Socialist Chancellor of the Exchequer. I see that Mr. Harold Wilson has earmarked himself for that job - well, I would not like to be in his boots.But we on our side must not be content with destructive criticism. We shall succeed if we have - and are clearly seen to have - ideas and policies both at home and abroad which match the possibilities of our time. We Conservatives have a pattern of policy: that pattern has clearly emerged throughout the last six years. Inevitably, the difficulties of recent months, the recurrence of inflation at home, and the Middle Eastern crisis abroad, have somewhat obscured this pattern in the minds of many people. In the maze of events some have lost the thread. But it has not been broken. The pattern is there. It is our special duty - every one of us in this hall - to let it clearly be seen in every constituency throughout the land.Let me try to give its general outline. Abroad we hold to the policy of peace through strength with our friends in the Commonwealth, our allies in the great regional organisations, and our American partners. At the same time we will do all that negotiation and ingenuity can contrive to turn this policy into one of real peace through adequate disarmament with proper safeguards.I believe the mass of the people broadly understand this policy and approve it. They understand, too, the modern role of the Commonwealth, changing and developing all the time. They understand the economic value of the Commonwealth as well as its moral value - they want to invest in it and help in its development. And they well know what the world would be like, with the pressures of Communism and the dangers of extreme nationalism, if this Commonwealth of ours did not exist both as a fact and as an ideal.At home, our aim ever since we took over in the crisis of 1951 has been the same - to build a strong, expanding economy, built to sustain our worldwide responsibilities, built to compete in the markets of the world, and built year by year to raise the standard of living of the people.Expansion and freedom, trade and progress, remain our main theme and objective, and it is to these that our individual policies are geared. For instance, our Free Trade Area proposals which you debated here yesterday have the aim of increasing our trade with Europe, while safeguarding the interests of our domestic agriculture and of the British Commonwealth. For Europe is the area of the world where trade is expanding the most rapidly, and it is from Europe that the duty of the Old World to meet some of the needs of the new and developing territories can best be met. Our agriculture must continue in good heart and play its part in the new conditions of freedom and abundance. The policy of long-term assurances and improvement grants embodied in our new Agriculture Act will give a sounder basis for farmers than ever before on which to plan ahead.With regard to Commonwealth trade, you will have read the brilliantly successful way in which the Chancellor of the Exchequer, with his Commonwealth colleagues, has brought to a conclusion the Conference in Canada. And we have given the warmest welcome, and, I trust, some new ideas of our own, as a most constructive contribution to the Prime Minister of Canada\u2019s determination to increase trade between Canada and the Old Country.We need more power, hence our rapidly developing nuclear power programme, which will be pressed forward on the maximum scale our economy can sustain under the able direction of the Minister in charge. We need young men and women, qualified to handle the new processes and techniques which modern science develops day by day. Hence our rapidly developing nuclear power programme, which will be pressed forward on the maximum scale our economy can sustain under the able direction of the Minister in charge.We need young men and women, qualified to handle the new processes and techniques which modern science develops day by day. Hence the £100,000,000 expansion of technical education. But, you know, for all their importance, these questions of how to earn our living are but a means to an end - living itself.Our Party stands for the combination of two principles; the rights of the individual - freedom, let us call it - and his duties. Every man comes into this world alone. He goes out of it alone. Although the life of man on earth is spent in a community, to which each man owes obligations, fundamentally he is a single, individual soul, alone before his Maker.All through human society there has been this inherent problem of how to combine the rights of each individual man and woman, their right to live their own lives, to express themselves in their own way and to make or, if you like, to mar their own fortunes, how to combine that with the duty that they have to others and the benefits that they can bring to others. A Socialist society, or a collectivist society, would not provide a high standard of material conditions for a people who have no raw materials save coal and a little iron; who brought into being an immense population in a confined compass; and who can only live by their intelligence, their brains and by the constant development of new methods - which spring after all in the long run from individual human brains.When I spoke on the occasion of my election as your leader some months ago, I said that it is only by giving opportunity to the strong and able that we can have the means to protect the weak and the old. The whole fabric of our social services - slum clearance, health services, insurance benefits, pensions, education and the rest - is nurtured and sustained by the success of individual enterprise and effort. Encourage that enterprise, and these social services will expand in increasing scope and usefulness. But damp it down, penalise it, and inevitably the social services will wilt and wither. But even if that were not so, even if Socialism could provide every material benefit, I do not believe that it offers the kind of life suited to a people of our long tradition of freedom and civilisation. Man was not made for the State, the State was made for man; and there, fundamentally, lies the difference between the approach of our two philosophies. I have no doubt at all that if we can but make these principles known and understood, which way will fall the choice of the great majority of our fellow countrymen.

aVThere is something in the bracing air of Blackpool that, apart from minor exhilarations, seems specially good for Conservative Conferences.It was here that we met twelve years ago after the landslide of 1945. Inspired by our great leader, Sir Winston Churchill, we began to re-define and re-adapt our policies to the needs of the day.Under Lord Woolton we created a new, modern and democratic organisation. It was here that, four years later, in 1950, you issued the call for 300,000 houses. And you got them.In 1954 we held one of the most lively and successful of our Conferences which set us confidently on the road to winning a second General Election. Now, here we are again, in 1958, getting ready to win a third. A mathematician will tell you that there are heavy odds against winning three General Elections running. That is, of course, true. So there are against a hat-trick; but the odds against are diminished - not increased - when the bowler has already taken two wickets in succession. And with Lord Hailsham and Lord Poole in the team we need not worry about our bowling.Autumn - \u2018season of mists and mellow fruitfulness\u2019 - is also the season of political conferences. We have recently enjoyed reading about the first two - the Liberal and the Socialist Conferences. Those, of course, were the mists. Here we have had the fruitfulness. Our political opponents seem to me to be living either in the past or in a world of make-believe. The pure doctrine of laissez-faire and absolute free trade; the nationalisation of all the means of production, distribution and exchange - these were the cries of my boyhood. What a musty period flavour they have now. How utterly out of touch all this is with the problems and opportunities of today. That is why so many of the Liberal and Labour debates have an air of lavender and old lace. But the arsenic is there too. It seems to me that the Labour Party\u2019s two main occupations today are splitting over their policy papers and papering over their policy splits. And as with economics, so with foreign affairs. Many of their resolutions are quite unrelated to the actual facts of life today, and many are contradictory. What a contrast with what you have been doing these last four days. Looking through the resolutions on our order paper here, there is one thing that sticks out a mile. We are up to date and they are not. We are realistic and they are not. We are relevant and they are not. And then there is another thing - the accent on youth at our Conference. The Young Conservatives have been seen, and they have also been heard. The emphasis in all your discussions has been on the present and on the future. On the needs and opportunities as well as the problems and dangers of this new, scientific, technological, jet propelled, nuclear powered age. I, too, want to speak today chiefly about the future. But before doing so, I will take as they do in the films a quick flashback over the past. It is just a year since I spoke to you at Brighton. Quite a lot has happened in these twelve months. Last year we had just announced our new and severe measures for combating inflation and the danger to the value of the pound. You will remember them - seven per cent Bank Rate, the credit squeeze and all the rest. Well, now you can see the results. The value of the pound on the world market strengthened dramatically and has remained strong. As a result of renewed confidence and of a most favourable trade balance, our Gold and Dollar Reserves have made gains every single month since last September. Not counting what we borrowed last autumn, we have during the last 12 months added £1,000,000 to the reserves every day. The cost of living index stands today no higher than it did last November. The Budget - Mr. Amory\u2019s first Budget, but the sixth of our Budgets to cut taxes - did all that was possible within the limits that prudence allowed. He cut taxation by over £100,000,000 a year. He cut the duty on house purchase. He cut the Purchase Tax on a great range of household goods. And if this was not enough to win a lady\u2019s heart, he cut the tax on cosmetics, jewellery, handbags and mirrors. What it is to have a bachelor as Chancellor of the Exchequer!Before I pass to the general state of our economy, I would like to say a word about our oldest and still largest industry, to which you, Mr. Chairman, referred \u2013 agriculture. Our farmers have suffered from one of the most difficult summers this century, and the earlier expectations of a bumper harvest have been dashed - literally to the ground. The harvest will now be below normal in all too many areas. I am determined that, so long as I am responsible, this shall never happen again.  The unemployment figure of 2.2 per cent covers the whole country.  But averages, as of course we know, are deceptive things, and there are certain areas where unemployment is a special problem.  Sometimes a local and once flourishing industry is on the decline owing to changes of method or perhaps of fashion. Sometimes the areas are remote from the great centres of communication or perhaps have only seasonal trade to support them. I am thinking in particular of some areas in Scotland, in Wales, and some of the coastal districts of England.We have taken powers to encourage industrial development in some of these areas. We also intend to use the industrial certificate system for the same purpose. But as well as the opportunity to work, I want to see the opportunity to earn. We want to see a steady increase in earning power to provide the means for a fuller life. We want to remove much of the drudgery and toil from manual labour and make life easier and brighter in the home. We also want to see people keeping more of the money they earn and the Exchequer taking less. That is why in Budget after Budget taxes have been cut. That is why we aim to continue this happy process.Next, the opportunity to own and to save. With more than half a million new houses built for sale in the last seven years, we have already gone some way towards providing more chance to own. The Socialists want to see a nation of Council house tenants; we want to see a nation of house owners. The Socialists want to narrow and concentrate in the State the ownership of industry; we want to spread it. And we are spreading it. Listen to this; it is a quote: \u2018In pre-war days it was the wealthy who supplied the cash to finance industry, Today it is the turn of the masses to take over a large part of this vital job by putting their savings to work. Figures show us it is the British public generally, not just a few rich chaps, who are pouring their money into Saving Certificates, Premium Bonds, Defence Bonds, Building Societies, Unit Trusts, and other forms of saving.\u2019 This is not a Tory leaflet that I am quoting; it comes from a Daily Herald feature of last Wednesday (October 8th), and it gets better as it goes on. It says: \u2018The ordinary people up and down the country are materially better off now than they have ever been. We have more money,\u2019 says this article, \u2018to spend and to save.\u2019 And yet I seem to remember I got into terrible hot water a year ago when I said they had \u2018never had it so good.\u2019 As a nation we are saving more each year than we saved in the whole six years of Socialism. And, by the way, I was glad to see that nice little tribute to the Premium Bond. This increase in saving is twice blessed. It not only helps the individual and the family, it also provides the funds needed for economic expansion. New roads and factories, new plant and equipment, research and development - all this can only come from saving.To sum up: the right to earn, the right to own, the right to save, and the opportunity and encouragement to exercise these rights. That is what we stand for. That is what, whether they intend it or not, Socialism must in the end destroy. But there is another large field of conflict between the Parties - the place of the individual in modern society. When we took office in 1951, we set about the task of removing from off the back of the trader, the farmer, the businessman and the private citizen the whole Socialist paraphernalia of burdensome and complex controls. We cut back State trading, we reopened the commodity markets, we abolished rationing, we did away with identity cards, we got rid of a thing, a horrible thing, hardly remembered now, called the development charge, and many other irritating controls over personal liberty and freedom.The disciplinary powers of the Agricultural Executive Committees have been abolished, and a Council is being set up to watch over the working of administrative tribunals and enquiries, and to see that the ordinary citizen gets a fair deal. Since the Lord Chancellor is in charge of this, I think we can trust to his robust good sense.Then there are the various Emergency Regulations. Powers readily and properly granted to the Executive in the urgency of war must not be allowed to live on unchallenged.We have been steadily hewing them down. There were 215 in operation when we took office in 1951. Over 200 of them have gone. And we intend to finish the job during this Parliament. Those that for some reason have to be retained and cannot be abolished will be made part of the normal fabric of Parliamentary law. Of course, we in the Conservative and Unionist Party do not want to return to the laissez-faire doctrinaire Liberalism. Too often that meant the defence not of freedom but of privilege.There are, of course, many cases where the interests of the nation must override those of the individual. That must happen in slum clearance, for instance, or with the new road construction on which the Minister of Transport is so active.You have been rightly insisting that where these cases happen the individual citizen must get fair play. Mr, Brooke, the Minister of Housing, is an ingenious as well as a cautious man. That is why he has been so singularly successful in dealing with the terribly difficult problem of rent control. I think that, when our proposals in this matter to which I have referred are presented to Parliament, you will not be disappointed. This role of providing the balance between the State and the individual is, I believe, the historic role of the Tory Party.Once it was necessary to proclaim the rights of the State against those of powerful individuals or associations. It may become necessary to do so again. But now the need is rather to proclaim the right of the individual against the State and other large-scale concentrations of power.I now want to look further afield. Dependent on world trade as we are, what happens at home - what we can do to affect things at home - is only part of the problem. What happens in the world - what can be done to encourage international trade can be every bit as important. There are many things which cannot be done by one country alone, but only by co-operation between many countries - by the practice of economic interdependence. Britain, which is at once a Commonwealth - head of the Commonwealth - a European and an Atlantic power, has here a unique opportunity. The recent Commonwealth Economic Conference in Montreal has been a resounding success. It has been welcomed as such throughout the Commonwealth. The United Kingdom Ministers - Lord Home, Sir David Eccles and of course the Chancellor of the Exchequer - were able to point the way to a freer system of trade and payments; to encourage and stimulate exports; to develop and stimulate trade; and to encourage investment throughout the Commonwealth. An economically strong Commonwealth needs an economically strong Europe. This is certainly our conviction here in Britain and all our Commonwealth partners share this view. That is why we propose that the Common Market of six European powers should be allied with a broad free trade area. Mr. Maudling, who was at Montreal, is now carrying on these negotiations in Paris with skill and perseverance. All the industrial countries of the world must share in the task of supplying capital to enable the poorer countries to develop their resources. We can be proud of what we are doing. British investments overseas now reach something like £200,000,000 a year. This is a greater proportion of our national income than any other country\u2019s. We must keep it up.Finally, one of the problems of world trade, on which I am glad such progress has been made in Delhi, is that of creating a sufficient volume of credit to support the expansion of world trade. I first discussed this with President Eisenhower this summer and he has already shown the response which America intends to make. All this is vital to our trade and our employment. But it is not merely economic self-interest which should prompt us. The inequalities of living standards in the world are a source of weakness. They are easy targets for Communist propaganda. Indeed, one of the most powerful threats of Communism today is economic, and it is in the economic field that it must primarily be met.Now I turn to the political aspects of these problems. The Foreign Secretary has dealt so fully in his speech with some of the most urgent questions that you already have a clear and detailed picture of the responsibilities we carry - and they are global. You have already shown how you value the courage, skill and patience which the Foreign Secretary has brought to his task. He, with the Commonwealth Secretary and the Colonial Secretary, have done fine work for the prestige and authority of Britain overseas. In foreign, as in home affairs, we must accept the facts of the age in which we live. We cannot deal with them by words and resolutions, but only by practical policies and actions.I read the latest document on Socialist foreign policy, and the speeches made about it, by Mr. Gaitskell and Mr. Bevan. The most remarkable thing that came out of the debate was the Socialist vote in favour of the Conservative Government\u2019s policy, that we should not unilaterally renounce the nuclear deterrent.It was indeed curious to find Mr. Gaitskell adopting precisely our own argument, that to deny ourselves possession of the bomb and rely on America to use it if necessary in our defence would be both morally indefensible and politically disastrous.  I am bound to say that during the last two years I have found the Socialist position on this controversy very confusing. Some were against the bomb and still are. Others, including apparently, Mr. Gaitskell, were and are for the bomb, but they were against the tests. But had I yielded to the heavy pressure brought upon me during the last two years and prematurely abandoned the tests, then there could have been no bomb. If now, the majority of the Labour Party are in favour of Britain having the bomb, that policy has only been made practicable by our refusal to yield to their agitation. At the same time we have not rested there. We now have, through our close friendship with the United States, the amendment to the McMahon Act. This allows us to pool our information, and to speak on equal terms with the Americans. In all this we owe a lot to our Minister of Defence. I would remind you that it was the British Government\u2019s initiative which brought about the conference of nuclear scientists at Geneva which has agreed that control is scientifically possible. We have now joined with the Americans in proposing a one year suspension from the end of this month, subject to the Soviet agreeing to work out with us a proper system of control. If, as I hope those talks succeed, we have a chance of making a beginning with real disarmament - for that is what we want: real agreements in which conventional and nuclear disarmament go hand in hand.The principles of our external policy are threefold - strength, unity and under standing. We must maintain the defensive strength of the Alliances - NATO, SEATO, and the Baghdad Pact. I am of course ready to go to a Summit meeting inside or outside the United Nations, and indeed I thought for a moment that we had reached that objective when Mr. Khrushchev accepted our proposal for a Summit Conference on the Middle East within the Security Council. Then after (or perhaps because of) a visit to Peking he suddenly turned round and withdrew.This was a great disappointment to me, but I have not given up my hope of a Summit meeting. But there is one thing I must make clear. I pray that we may be able to reduce armaments, but we will not reduce them unilaterally. Let the level of both sides fall simultaneously. Any other course will not bring peace, but either war or surrender.What is the next thing? Unity. Among the Western powers who are members of NATO, there are from time to time dangerous divisions. We have one now between Greece, Turkey and ourselves on the question of Cyprus.Here I know you would wish me to express again what was so well expressed yesterday - the sympathy we have with our forces in Cyprus, both military and civil. We have the greatest admiration for them and the fullest confidence in them and in their discipline and courage. I must repeat that the problem of Cyprus is not a Colonial but an international one. I have certainly done my best to bring all sides together, and I am not without hope that agreement will be reached. Discussions are still proceeding in NATO and I hope they may be fruitful. Meanwhile I am not ashamed to have put forward the idea that such a problem could best be solved by mutual co-operation. For remember, the old world is not the whole world; Europe is not the whole world - it is but a small peninsula of the great Asiatic plain jutting out into the ocean.The powers of Europe should not think backwards to their old quarrels, but forward to a new understanding. I know, of course, of the long, bitter fights between Turkey and Greece going back 500 years. But if we were to look backwards over the centuries, we should still be at enmity with France. If France and Germany were not able to look forward they would still be bitter rivals, instead of having, under the leadership of great men, decided to shake hands and be friends. It does not serve the cause for which we are all joined together, nor do we match the level of world events, if in any of the western countries we allow our minds to be obsessed by the quarrels of the past, instead of looking to the dangers of the present and the hopes of the future.In the same way, there are many in this country, we may as well confess it, who want us to quarrel with the United States.For instance, we are invited to abandon our independent nuclear power (which I think is the Liberal policy), pool our arms with America, and then publicly quarrel with our American allies. On the extreme left, some are willing to play the Communist game, an obvious feature of which is to try at all costs to drive a wedge between the Atlantic powers.Happily, American and British policy on the Middle East is today agreed and I am convinced that the rescue operation which we did in concert in Lebanon and Jordan has given the necessary opportunities for the United Nations to play their role. As the Foreign Secretary rightly stressed, so long as the veto in the Security Council remains, there must always be occasions when the great powers cannot evade their duty. They must prevent aggression while there is still time. Then having completed their immediate task they must hand it to the nations of the world for collective action. That we have done and the responsibility now firmly rests upon the United Nations to see that our work has not been in vain. Meanwhile, I cannot believe that the Opposition can look back with any pride on the role they played when this crisis arose in the summer. It was perhaps no accident that, seeing Anglo-American unity in the Middle East, the Communist pressure changed and they started to hot up the Far East in the hope, of course, of splitting us over that. Do not let us fall into that trap. On the strength of the United States and their continued interest in the world as a whole, freedom largely depends. We can best serve British interests if, on the basis of our friendship, we give our honest advice in private consultation, rather than yield to the temptation of public recrimination, or (what I think they really like) governessy nagging. In this spirit, from the opening days of the renewed troubles in the Far East, centring on Quemoy, I made clear the position of the British Government and people. I am convinced that the mass of the people support the line which we have taken. Recent events have confirmed the wisdom of our course. Strength, then, first; next unity. What is the third need? I called it, for want of a better word, understanding or imagination. We have got to recognise the changing character of the world abroad just as we have to recognise the tremendous changes at home.We know the rise of nationalism, the sense of independence and freedom which come to peoples who have either never had it since the world began, because they have never risen from barbarism, or who formerly had great civilisations and empires that have declined and fallen. Some of these countries, in Asia or Africa, are rising like a giant from a long dream, and are determined to revive the fabled glories of the past. Others, coming for the first time out of the darkness to the light, are determined to force their way into this new exciting world even sometimes at the cost of disunity or aggression. In this turmoil, all this would be less dangerous than it is if so many of these peoples did not lie, as it were, in the uncommitted territory between the great structure of communist strength upon the one side and that of the free peoples upon the other. In this no man\u2019s land position, they can either try to play off one side against the other, gaining benefits from both, or they may be the easy prey to the subversion of Communist propaganda that preaches freedom and practises slavery.What then is our role in all this? Just as the United States has the larger part to play in military strength and in economic development, for they have the greater resources, so I think the Commonwealth has a unique opportunity in the political field.Since we met last year, I undertook a tour of the Commonwealth, which, although it was very short, was the most exciting experience of my life. A month or two before, I had been to Canada where I have been since. But in this tour I went to Pakistan, India, Ceylon, Singapore, Australia, and New Zealand, and all through I was thrilled to feel that some great instrument had come into being - half consciously, no doubt - perhaps under Providence, which can and must largely influence the solution of this struggle in Africa, Asia and Europe.For the Commonwealth represents, by its very nature, a declaration of partnership and interdependence between all men and women of different races, regions, creeds, religions, traditions and philosophies. And how has it come about? In the old Commonwealth countries it has come through the people of British stock who have gone out as pioneers and kept there loyal feelings for the old country and especially for the Crown. But in the new Commonwealth countries it is the product of something of which, perhaps, now we think too little; partly the great pro-consuls who governed these territories, still more perhaps the magistrates, the ordinary administrators, the doctors and the missionaries. To them, therefore, we have handed on the traditions of individual rights, the equality of man with man, the independence of the Judiciary from the Government, the right of free speech, and of free Press, to think, to say, and within limits to do what you like - all the things which in the long course of experience spread over hundreds of years we have learned in our own country. And it is because of this link in the Commonwealth that, although some of the new countries in it have different points of view on questions of defence, or the organisation of military strength, they have a complete unity of view about the things that are really worthwhile in life. It is perhaps worth noticing that it is these new, emerging countries which have come from and are still members of the Commonwealth where these traditions are being maintained and respected. They will have difficulties of course. But they will cling, I believe, to the principles of liberty and respect for the law which are our common tradition. And this is what I feel so deeply: they will have a decisive effect upon some of their neighbours, who, as they reach their independence, may be tempted to fall victims either to Communism or to other forms of dictatorship. I repeat, therefore, our external policy - strength, unity and understanding. Each set of problems, whether in Europe, the Middle East or the Far East, must be dealt with so far as possible in the light of these principles. But our difficulties, as I have said, cannot be resolved by words and speeches and resolutions. They will only become manageable if we apply these principles with patience and determination. Above all, you cannot contract out of this task; you cannot \u2018disengage\u2019 from the common cause of freedom.So ends once more our Tory Conference. Once again, it is a beginning and not an end. This is a time for action not a time for rest. One warning I must give you before I close. Set your faces against apathy and complacency as you would against Socialism itself. Do not be beguiled by the sweet music of public opinion polls; there is work to be done. Yet we have good grounds for hope - yes, and for confidence too. We are building a Britain strong and free as we promised in 1951. Let us then go forward together - with driving enthusiasm and with a living faith.

aVLast year, if I remember right, we did not have a Party Conference. We had a General Election instead and that really went quite well, considering. So far as we are concerned, our mood can be described quite simply. We are grateful but not complacent. Grateful because three successive victories with increasing majorities is something we have received for which we ought to be duly thankful. At the same time, in face of many problems at home, in the Common wealth and in the world, we need to brace ourselves for renewed efforts. Yet if neither the Government nor the Party can afford to relax, we can at least say \u2018thank you.\u2019 As Leader of the Party, I have already had many opportunities to express my personal gratitude to individuals or groups. But I want just once more to thank you all, and through you the massive body of our loyal supporters throughout the length and breadth of the land.Nor should we forget the great men of the past, who made possible this spectacular revival of our Party and presided over its continuous growth - Churchill, Eden, Woolton. These were the architects of victory. After them came Hailsham and Poole, whose confidence never faltered in good times or bad. It would be impossible to mention all my colleagues who have served so well, but there are one or two to whom I must refer. First the Home Secretary: you would think his own Department was enough to keep him occupied - drink, betting and all the rest. But in addition he leads the House of Commons, he is Chairman both of our Party Organisation and its Research Department. We owe him a great debt. We owe much to Heathcoat Amory, whose wisdom, charm and modesty made him both loved and trusted. His successor, whose qualities have been proved in five arduous years at the Foreign Office, brings to his new task a firm character and a flexible mind. I have seen enough already of the new Foreign Secretary\u2019s work, especially at the United Nations, to confirm my confidence that the choice was right, and now you have heard him for yourselves. And then we have to welcome back one or two who have recently returned to us - wandering souls, but happily not lost. We have a young Party and, with some exceptions, a young Government. At any rate we can claim this: although we do not normally address one another as \u2018comrade,\u2019 we are in fact a comradeship of loyal friends.For the last twelve months all sorts of experts have been making surveys and writing articles seeking out the reasons for our victory. There has been a lot of talk about the images of the political parties but what has really emerged is the image of the British people in 1960. What is it that the people of Britain - especially the young people - want in the 1960s? They want to see their country economically sound and prosperous and they want opportunities to get on in their jobs and to use intelligence and imagination and initiative. That is Conservative policy. They want to earn more and to keep more of what they earn. That is Conservative policy. They want more new hospitals, houses, roads and schools. That is Conservative policy. They want their houses to belong increasingly to themselves, not to a local council. That is Conservative policy. They want to see the State coming to the aid of the old, the sick and the unfortunate, with a wide variety of services. That is Conservative policy. They do not want nationalisation or rigid State control of industry. They prefer the Conservative policy of encouraging industry to get on with its own job, with the Government helping and not hindering - a partnership, not a gigantic takeover bid. They want to see their country playing its full part in developing the resources of the Commonwealth and aiding the less fortunate nations of the world. For they know - young and old alike - that materialism is not enough. That material prosperity, to be hallowed, must be shared. That is the policy of the good neighbour; and if it means risks or sacrifices to achieve it, these must be accepted. That, too, is Conservative policy. They see the securing of peace and justice as the most important problem abroad, and they want our country to be united and strong enough to give a lead. They are not despondent or cast down by difficulties. They are eager to face the exciting problems of prosperity and development in a rapidly changing and often dangerous world. That is the Conservative faith.So we need not be surprised when the pollsters tell us that more and more Conservative support is coming from the young people. We must keep it that way. Our Party needs all the time new blood and new ideas. My first duty today is formally to launch the new national campaign of our Young Conservatives. In this campaign we have two aims - to increase their political activity, and to increase their membership. Mere numbers are not enough. That is why I am so glad to learn that there are now well over two hundred Young Conservative policy groups in the constituencies. This work will be of real value in our Government. It will give us first hand information about the way the younger generation is thinking and feeling. And, by the way, our Young Conservatives cover a very wide range of responsibility and age. At one end they are at school; at the other they may well be married people with children of their own at school. Their voice deserves to be heard in the Party, and in recent years it has been heard with increasing effectiveness. Everybody who has attended your discussions this week will have heard that for themselves. Next February they are going to have a go at a conference of their own. The Young Conservatives are already the largest political youth movement in the free world. They have played a great part in the historic victories of our Party. I ask everyone to help in this campaign. I hope that it will result in a big boost in the numbers and the enthusiasm of Young Conservatives throughout the country. If it does - as I am sure it will - then we can say with all confidence: \u2018The Future is Ours.\u2019At the last General Election we called our Manifesto \u2018The Next Five Years.\u2019 The first of these years is over; and you have heard a progress report from Ministers of how they have been using it. Let us start with our social laws - many of them notoriously out-of-date. We have dealt with betting in the first Session of Parliament; licensing comes next. In all this our aim is to keep a right balance between freedom and excess.The problem of crime, as in most other countries, is a cause of concern. It will certainly help if the police are not expected to enforce laws which no longer command general respect. It will also help them to be relieved of some of their routine traffic duties. Of course, the new system has its growing pains, but I think it is beginning to work. Anyway, I heard all about it from my wife. On the broader aspects of crime and prison reform the Home Secretary is manfully at work on new legislation.I turn next to education. We have a proud record of achievement, and the Minister, Sir David Eccles, has ambitious plans for the future. Since 1951 we have provided nearly 2,500,000 new school places and - even more important - there are 57,000 extra teachers in the schools. We have big development programmes under way covering both schools and colleges. Next, housing. At our Conference ten years ago you told us to raise our sights and asked for the 300,000 target. The Socialists said we could never build them, or alternatively, as the lawyers put it, that we could only do it at the expense of school building. They have been proved wrong on both counts. We have built the houses and we have built the schools, too. More than 2,500,000 houses have gone up since 1951, giving one family in every six in this island a new home. And for many of them not just a home, but a home of their own. Meanwhile the local authorities, with Government help and encouragement, are making good progress with special needs such as houses for the elderly and slum clearance. We need to do better still for the elderly, and we will. We are getting ahead with slum clearance; we are re-housing people from the slums at the rate of 200,000 a year.Housing, with all its related issues - rents, the use of land, town planning - involves some pretty intricate and knotty problems. In you, Mr. Chairman, we have the right man to tackle them. Better homes make for better health. Yet whatever strides we make in the prevention of disease, we shall always need the health service to cure illness. There are now nearly two hundred major hospital building schemes in various stages of building and planning covering the whole country. Apart from maintaining a high standard in the Health Service, we have given special attention to the needs of the mentally sick under the new Act which was put on the Statute Book last year. On Thursday you debated the needs of the elderly; their human needs as well as their financial needs.At the last election both Parties put forward their schemes. I observe that the Labour Party\u2019s has now been scrapped. It was found, it was said, to be too complicated to attract the electors. In other words, they did not trust it - or its authors. In contrast, our plan has been put on the Statute Book and comes into operation next April. It is designed to get the right balance between State help and self help. While it strengthens the State scheme, it does not exclude private and occupational provision. These arrangements are for the future. For those who have already retired I made our policy clear at the Election and I repeat it now.We intend that they should continue to share in the expansion of national wealth. And I think you will find that in the future, as in the past, our actions match our words. That, then, is the story. The facts are clear. We have the biggest social programme in our history and we are spending on it a bigger proportion of our national wealth than ever before. We are carrying out scrupulously the pledges given at the last Election. We are doing things that people want done and that we believe need doing.I know there are some people who never like to dwell upon anything that goes right. They seem to think that to travel despondently is better than to arrive. But we must face the fact that in many fields, particularly in education, expenditure is bound to rise.We must also recognise that taken together with necessary expenditure on defence, it places a big burden on the economy. There is thus a limit to what the Government can spend, and a limit to the speed with which we can carry out our declared policy of seeking to reduce taxation. Of course, if you are right, and you are right, to want to see more money spent in all kinds of worthwhile directions, then we must accept the consequences. If you go into a restaurant and order a meal, you must be prepared to pay the bill when it is presented.Experience over the last nine years, however, shows that we need not be discouraged. For we have been able both to expand our national services and at the same time to reduce taxation.The social services today are costing hundreds of millions more than when we came to office. But we are taking £1,300,000,000 a year less from the taxpayer than we should be if we had maintained the Socialist rates of direct taxation. How has that come about? We have spent more and yet drawn out less in taxation.One explanation of that is in prudent management and an attempt to concentrate spending at the points where it will do most good. That has meant - you must have forgotten them now but I have not - doing some unpopular things as well as popular things. That\u2019s what Governments are for.The other explanation is the expansion of our national wealth. We must make sure that this healthy growth continues upon sound foundations. We want this growth, and the prosperity that goes with it, to be spread as evenly as possible throughout the country.In the past year total unemployment has fallen by 100,000. With a national unemployment figure of only 1.4 per cent we have today by any definition full employment. But at the time of the Election we were disturbed by the existence of local patches of unemployment in particular areas. We promised - to deal with it - a Local Employment Act. This has now been passed into law. Under this Act, you will have read of great schemes of development in those parts of the country, where they are specially needed, steel, motor-cars and other projects. But even before these schemes have reached fruition, which are only now beginning, I am happy to say the figures in these areas are improving all the time.In Scotland unemployment has fallen from 3.9 per cent to 3 per cent; in Wales from 3.2 per cent to 2.4 per cent; in the Northern Region of England from 3 per cent to 1.4 per cent; in Lancashire from 2.4 per cent to 1.7 per cent. There is, alas, one area that still causes us great anxiety and for which we will do our best - the loyal people of Northern Ireland.In our Manifesto we said that our policy was to double the British standard of living in this generation. This was an ambitious aim - some thought too ambitious. But as Mr. Butler told you yesterday, the figures prove that we are well up to schedule.Now, a word about Agriculture. With an increased production of 68 per cent above pre-war, Agriculture is playing its full part in the national wealth. It is still our greatest industry and it plays a double role. On purely economic grounds a high and efficient agricultural production helps our balance of payments. From a wider point of view a prosperous and contented countryside is part of our way of life, and essential to the wellbeing of the towns. As we all know only too well, agriculture must always be to some extent at the mercy of the weather. Last year the problem was the drought. This year we are all extending our sympathy to those areas which are suffering grievously from flood. Of course the officials in the Ministry even it all up. They produce annual figures adjusted to what they optimistically call \u2018normal weather conditions.\u2019 Personally I share the view of the old farmer who said that he hadn\u2019t seen one average summer in the last sixty years.However, our agricultural progress has continued - come drought or flood. Happily today, even in difficult areas, the great spread of agricultural machinery has lightened the task of the farmer, and it is worth recalling that our agriculture is the most highly mechanised in the whole world. Progress has continued not only on the large farms, but on the small ones too. It has been aided by our various schemes for improvement grants, of which growing use is being made.I said just now that the prosperity of town and countryside were interlinked. Ultimately they both depend - we all depend - on the expansion of world trade. To achieve that expansion - and I read the most interesting debate you had here - we are working on different schemes to increase economic co-operation between the countries of Europe.Two groups, as you know have been formed - the Six and the Seven, we call them. It is our aim to bring them into better harmony to the mutual advantage of all. It will not be easy but we shall not be discouraged. And you can be sure - as you have already heard it from the Ministers concerned - that we shall not overlook in any of these plans the vital interests both of Commonwealth trade and British agriculture. There are, I am told, some signs that expansion in world trade has slackened recently, after its great surge forward in the last year or two, but it seems likely that any pause will only be temporary. Be that as it may, what is certain is that world trade is becoming more and more competitive.It has been said before, but we must always remind ourselves of it - the world does not owe us a living. We have to earn it. That means that we have to compete, and to compete with some very efficient countries equipped with the most modern machinery. Anything, therefore, which pushes up our production costs, whether it be excessive wage demands, or inefficient management, or restrictive practices on either side of industry, can only damage our export trade and the foundations of our present prosperity and full employment. And this is the background in which I appeal to all concerned in industry - employers and employed and especially the very responsible Trade Union leaders who play such an important role - that all work together to ensure that our industrial costs do not rise beyond what our customers overseas will pay. Of course, in his conference speech the Chancellor of the Exchequer covered all this ground; (and, by the way, I hope the Foreign Secretary is not depressed at seeing how much better the Chancellor of the Exchequer looks now that he has left the Foreign Office; but I think the Foreign Secretary has the strength. If he looks as well in five years\u2019 time as the Chancellor of the Exchequer does now I will be very pleased.) He dealt with all these subjects on which I would only touch by saying this: an economy as delicately balanced as ours is, where exports are so vital and where excessive imports may be so damaging, such an economy cannot be steered with absolute precision. We have all the time to keep upon the narrow edge between undue inflation or undue deflation - both of them in their different ways equally disastrous - and between too much expansion and too little. And if the balance is to be kept, economic adjustments are necessary from time to time; nevertheless, I can assure you that the broad purpose of the Government is to encourage the development of investment and production at the greatest pace which prudence will allow.I have tried to summarise the work of one year to give you a broad picture of how our social and economic policies have been progressing. Perhaps you would now allow me just to say a few words about the principles which lie behind these policies.Our starting point, I think, is the supreme value of each individual human being and his right to develop his personality in freedom. That may sound just a vague truism. Yet it is one that no politician should ever forget, because it at once sets the limit to political action and to what governments can do or ought to do. But individuals live in society and they have duties as well as rights; and the State must maintain the framework of an ordered society. An important part of this framework lies in our institutions. Through them our national character is expressed and continuity maintained. Through them our forefathers have endeavoured over the ages to work out a balance between order and freedom, and so we continue today. In all this, the Crown, Parliament, our legal system, our local government institutions, to mention but a few, play a vital part. A good deal of history (and some of it pretty rough history) has gone into the fashioning of these institutions to give us the right balance between order and freedom, and the maintenance of this balance needs constant vigilance.Last century when Liberalism was in the ascendancy, Conservatives felt the need to counteract the excess of individualism and laissez faire. When we came into office in 1951 we found that the balance had been upset in the other direction - too much power concentrated in the State. We have done a good deal to restore it since, that is the first principle. The second, with which I hope you will equally agree, is that the family is, and must continue to be, the keystone of our national life. Divinely ordered, the family it is at once the most natural and the most intimate of our institutions. It has the most decisive influence in moulding our early years, and the effectiveness of the services the State provides - for example, education - largely depends upon the foundations laid in the home. So does respect for law and decent behaviour.The strengthening of family life must be one of our central themes, and that as much as anything has inspired our housing drive.What do these guiding principles - the dignity of man and the consequent necessary limits to political power, the value of our institutions as the cement of society - mean in terms of policy?One thing they mean is surely this: moderation should be the keynote of policy. Extremes always threaten the family or the individual in one way or another. Too much State control endangers freedom and initiative; but a free-for-all exalts rights over duties and means that the weak go to the wall. Extremes undermine the national unity which it is our Conservative tradition to foster. We want the maximum of consent to acts of government and the minimum of coercion. Our aim is to harmonise different and conflicting interests, not to set them against each other with the strident accents of the class war. We aim to balance them so that all can contribute as one nation to the common good.In politics we need faith. We need hope too. These are great virtues. But don\u2019t let us forget the words, \u2018the greatest of these is charity.\u2019All that preoccupies us here at home must be set in a wider context. All our achievements and all our hopes depend on peace and prosperity in the world. It is just over a week since my return from New York to which you referred. I was not at all sure whether I could do any good by going there. I certainly did not wish to be tempted into playing Mr. Krushchev\u2019s game. However, after the Foreign Secretary had attended the opening of the United Nations General Assembly he sent me a message urging me to come. He felt that it was only right that with so many Heads of State and Heads of Government, including many of the Commonwealth countries, collecting in New York, the British Prime Minister should be present. And I am glad that I went. It was a remarkable gathering - the leaders of nearly 100 nations from North, South, East and West; comprising, with some important omissions, almost all the countries of the world. It was a dramatic and unforgettable experience. And with all its weaknesses and faults, the ludicrous aspects as well as the solemn, no one who has any imagination can fall to look on this spectacle without a certain awe. Here were the representatives of this strange human race that in a tiny period of geological time has conquered all its terrestrial rivals and made itself master of the material world. Is it doomed now to self-destruction? Or can it conquer its own passions and so, under Providence, master its own destiny?Today the world is full of divisions, and there are various ways of looking at them. There is the East-West, or Communist versus the free countries; then there is the division between developed and undeveloped countries; and there is the division between the democratic countries and non-democratic countries. And then there is the new Soviet view that the world is divided into Communist, Capitalist, and Uncommitted. Of course, in reality it is not so simple. It is true that the two great power groups, that is the groups armed with the most formidable weapons and the power of producing them, are on the one side, the Communists, and on the other the Western Democracies. There is no question where Britain stands here. Britain stands with the West. Nor let the world be deceived by the chance clash of personalities and argument in our strange political disputes here at home. There are of course earnest and sincere pacifists, a body of opinion which has always been respected and, may I add, generously treated in this country. There are, of course, a few Communists and fellow travellers. There are a few traitors too, I have no doubt. Then there is a large class of worthy but rather woolly-minded people who are more easily moved by emotion than thought and argument. But there is nothing new in all this. We understand it here at home. But sometimes in the past our enemies and even our friends have been deceived by a chance vote given here or there. They are wrong. The British people do not change. And at heart they are determined to stand firm in the defence of freedom. There has been great talk recently of a neutral bloc. It is true that there are countries which are not members of one or other of the great military alliances. All the same, even those members of the Commonwealth who follow a policy of non-alignment are opposed to Communism. They are not spiritually uncommitted, even when they are so militarily. And what is true of these Commonwealth countries is true of many others who are in no military grouping. There is in this sense no real neutral bloc. A certain grouping of this character forms itself from time to time in the Assembly meetings for special purposes. But it has no great underlying unity of political doctrine or constitutional method. These countries are neutral in the sense of not wishing to be involved in the clash between the great Powers. They have an important part to play in the world, and we have an important duty towards them. And yet, of course, by a strange paradox, this neutrality would be gravely threatened if it were not for the power of the West. I ask myself - how far would it be possible to sustain a neutral position if it were not for NATO, SEATO, CENTO, and above all, the Western determination and authority. Had NATO, which I was glad to have the chance of defending in the Assembly, had it not come into being, or were it now to be deserted, abandoned by America, Canada, Britain or France, what would be left of freedom and national independence?There is, however, another and a much more real division between the nations of the world. It is the division between the developed and the undeveloped countries. All developed countries have a moral obligation towards their less fortunate neighbours. Britain has a special duty which she is manfully performing. It is the duty to the Commonwealth countries which, although now independent, still require investment of money and men on a massive scale. Indeed, one of our main concerns in the management of our own economy is to guide it so as to be able to carry out these duties. Nor have we limited our responsibilities to Commonwealth countries. There are many other areas which we have aided and will continue to aid. As I said just now nobody can be in any doubt that we stand loyal to our Alliances and a stalwart member of the coalition of free nations. That is clear. But it does not in my view mean that we should all the time indulge in a running propaganda battle with the Soviet Union by means of violent polemics. It may suit them but I do not really think it suits us. What we ought to do is this. We should be absolutely firm in our attitude towards the Soviet bloc. We should not give in. We should not surrender. But we should try to damp down controversy and we should try to encourage in every way we can a general amelioration of relations, or in the current cliché - I do not like it but it is the one which has become current - the reduction of tensions.I believe that is not only in the interest of Great Britain, and in the interest of the West, but in the interest of the whole world. For after all, however far away it may be - I shall not live to see it, but however far away - we must look to the end. And how will the struggle end? It can end in only one of two ways. The first, force: that is no direct solution in the modern nuclear world. It doesn\u2019t end the argument, except in the sense that it ends the people who are arguing. It ends in mutual destruction. The second way is by negotiation, leading perhaps to a slow but gradual transformation of the situation. Given peace, and given time, we must believe in our ultimate success. For we believe that our way of life is better materially, morally, and spiritually, and that, with peace and growing contacts between the two concepts, the faith we hold must triumph. If we do not believe that, then we have no right to call ourselves either democrats or Christians. Mr. Krushchev, for his part, no doubt thinks his way of life is better, and that, given peaceful co-existence, perhaps of his own definition but still that it will be without war, is bound to succeed. Mao-Tse-Tung and Chou-En-Lai do not agree with this view. They think (which is the orthodox Marxist view) that it can only be resolved by armed conflict. Hence the dispute of which you read. Now, if I may venture, without impertinence, to join in this controversy, I am bound to say I lean myself to the Russian as opposed to the Chinese view. But if we think negotiation, peaceful co-existence, of whatever form, the lowering of tension, feasible and right, how can we make progress? I must confess to you that the collapse of the May Summit was a grievous disappointment to me. I had worked hard enough for it, and it was a tragedy to see this dream melt away in an afternoon. However, it is no good crying over spilt Summits, and I felt that we must nerve ourselves to face what would happen and look forward to some later improvement.Of course, the situation has substantially worsened since May. It would be quite foolish to deny it. It has been worsened by a new outburst of controversy and by the use of the United Nations Assembly for purely propaganda purposes. It has worsened because negotiations have in fact been broken off. Nevertheless our purpose must be to try to get back to the mood of last spring. Negotiations on Germany and Berlin will have to be resumed. I have had one or two conversations the - Foreign Secretary with me - with Mr. Krushchev, and he has given his accounts of what I said to him at some Press Club or public meetings in New York. And when I refer to the careful record which has been kept, I am sometimes a little surprised. But allowing for the embroidery of his natural exuberance, I do not think that he has misrepresented the spirit of our private talks. Our public meetings were rather different. I told him that the problem of Berlin and Germany must be handled in a way that does justice to the reasonable desires of the German people through negotiation and not by force. It is a potentially dangerous problem from the point of view of East and West alike. And, if we can have a Summit for this - and other purposes - and if my two partners, the Presidents of the United States and of France agree, I am all for it. I have said so, both privately and publicly. Indeed, all the three Western powers said it in their joint statement last May, after the collapse of that Summit meeting.Then there is the question of disarmament. Here, too, progress has been disappointingly slow. The trouble is that the discussions never seem to get to grips. Plan succeeds plan, committee follows committee, but these conferences never seem able to cut the cackle and come to the rockets; and whenever a committee starts to go fairly well, so far the Russians have walked out of it. There are thus manoeuvrings and recriminations. Our position is clear and simple. We don\u2019t want just to argue about disarmament. We want the nations to disarm. The broad problem of disarmament is discussed year by year by the Assembly in committee. And that is right, for the whole body of the United Nations has a continuing interest in this problem which affects them all. But this discussion by nearly a hundred Nations can only be in the most general terms. What is the next stage? Here I think we ought to distinguish between principles and the practical details. The principles can and ought to be discussed and agreed in a group representing the diverse interests of the world. For example the Ten Power Committee which the Russians so unexpectedly left earlier this year. That is the principles. But when it comes to the practical methods of inspection, control and the like, they must be examined by people who know something about the arms in question and how and what are the technical problems of controlling them. Such a group must be small, efficient, experienced. And we have an example as I said at the Assembly, in the scientists who met preliminary to the discussions on the abolition of nuclear tests who produced a practical report, upon which a political treaty may still, we hope, be based. For that negotiation, happily, is still proceeding. The Soviet Government appeared, however, either to reject or not to understand my proposal, but I will continue to do my best to make it clear to them. At any rate I feel sure that if we are to make progress on disarmament practical discussions of the technical details must go hand in hand with broad discussions of principle. The Russians say they want a general agreement on disarmament, but that only after that agreement has been reached will they discuss control. They accuse us of saying that we want control without disarmament. Of course, that is not our position. We want simultaneous disarmament and control, and the two must go together at all stages. I do not despair, for here is one of the cases where, as the Foreign Secretary said, our interests ought to be the same.Disarmament, if it can be achieved, must be of equal interest to the Russian people as to our own. They too must grudge the large expenditure of human effort and skill which goes into these more and more complicated weapons. If the will is there - and it certainly is on our side - I believe a way can be found. As the Foreign Secretary told you on Thursday, we will continue our most strenuous efforts to clear away the misunderstanding, reveal the real points of difference, and try to resolve them. In spite of the disappointments we have had and the failure up to now to persuade the Soviet Government to accept our sincere proposals, we shall persevere.I have spoken of these recent events. Perhaps you will allow me, before I finish, to say a few words about what I would call our role in this tumultuous world. What can we in Britain contribute, and for what can our country stand? First, let me say that we can contribute little unless we work together with a reasonable degree of internal unity and with an attitude of reason and calm. Ranting or exhibitionism, whether clerical or lay, of the intellectual or the hooligan, will not increase our standing in the world. It is true that, relative to other countries, or some other countries, we have not the great wealth, vast territorial possessions, the might and strength or armed forces that we had in the last century. I do not think that we need to be too depressed about that, because what is true of us now was true of our position in the 16th and 17th and a large part of the 18th centuries. Yet our influence in the days of the first Elizabeth may perhaps inspire us to what our influence could and, please God, will be in the reign of the second Elizabeth. We have experience, and that counts. We have perhaps a certain amount of self-control; and people get very excited all round us. We have worldwide interests: Europe, the Atlantic Alliance, and above all the Commonwealth. Our economic and financial interests are not limited to these islands or even to the groups that I have mentioned. We are linked with the whole Sterling Area, and thus closely with the under-developed countries.Naturally the Second War knocked us about a good bit and it has taken us a little time to recover. But in recent years our reputation in the world and our influence is stronger. No one doubts our firm resolution. No one can doubt our earnest and honest desire for peace. But by peace we do not mean surrender to force: we mean peace with justice.Moreover, we have shown a remarkable power to adapt our institutions to new circumstances and new needs both here at home and overseas. The older ones among us have seen in our lifetime startling changes. These changes are continuing at a tremendous pace. We have seen the Empire being transformed into the Commonwealth of free and independent nations.I cannot tell you how moving it was to me and how helpful to find in the United Nations so many leaders of the Commonwealth countries and to profit by their experience and friendship. Representing the older members of the Commonwealth were great and stalwart figures, Menzies, Diefenbaker, Nash. I was able, also, to have long and intimate discussions with Mr. Nehru, almost the senior of our Commonwealth Prime Ministers, who has an unrivalled position both in his own country and throughout Asia - indeed throughout the world. There came too, the youngest of our team, Dr. Nkrumah of Ghana and Prime Minister Abubakar of Nigeria.Of course there are differences of emphasis and approach, but I do not think any great difference of purpose and underlying faith. The very presence at the United Nations Assembly of these men was a living rebuttal of the attacks on what is called imperialism and colonialism. But of course we still have difficult problems ahead and we must try to bring to them both imagination and decision. In Africa British initiative has brought with it all the civilising influences. In addition to establishing peace and order it has developed industry, agriculture, transport and power. In certain areas, notably Kenya and the Rhodesias, many Brush people have settled.  They have made these countries their permanent home. And they have done so with the encouragement of successive British Governments.We have, therefore, obligations not only of interest but of honour. But the very success of the pioneers has brought with it corresponding problems. With education and development there has grown a new ambition and a new political consciousness among the African people. We have, therefore, in the words of the Resolution you carried on Wednesday, to see that in the march to self-government legitimate rights are protected as well as legitimate aspirations fulfilled.Of course it is not easy to do this, not at all. It is a tremendous test for all concerned. Our main duty here at home it seems to me, where we live remote from these pressures is to unite in showing understanding, sympathy and restraint.We are indeed fortunate in having to help us the Commonwealth and Colonial Secretaries, Mr. Sandys and Mr. Macleod. Together they make a good team. This is not the time for me to speak about the details of the Monckton Commission. We have already expressed our gratitude to Lord Monckton and his colleagues for their work. It will, of course, be for the Federal Review Conference to discuss and decide these great matters. I would only say this: the purpose of the Monckton Commission was to help us not to destroy, but to confirm and develop the federal association between the three territories of Central Africa; and the remarkable and outstanding feature of the Commission\u2019s Report is the nearly unanimous acceptance of the need for such a federation, and the tragedy that would be involved in its collapse. Not enough attention, I think, has been given to that which is the main feature of the Monckton Commission\u2019s Report. The Government, therefore, will approach the Review with the earnest hope that the Conference will find an agreed basis for the continuance of a federal structure, and with the determination to carry out to the full our responsibilities and our pledges towards all men of all races.I have said this is a world of change, but in change we must not despair; we must keep cool heads and stout hearts. Of course a lot of people do not like this change. The Pax Britannica had certainly great advantages. Guaranteed by the British Navy, there was maintained for a hundred years a broad peace between the great powers, in the course of which the world made the greatest jump forward in its history in technical and material progress. Nor should we forget what was done on the moral and spiritual side. If the trader developed the Empire initially, the doctor, the missionary and the administrator were close behind. Many people may think that the world was better in the old days - they always have thought so. Countries, like individuals, can give themselves up to an agreeable old age in cherishing these nostalgic memories. They have the melancholy charm of autumn. But spring is the time for a strong and virile people. This is no time for vain regrets; and the excitements, the opportunities, the thrills of what can be done in the second half of this century are, to my mind, as great as those seized by our forefathers.Much of what is happening now is good, very good. Sometimes there is retrogression, confusion, almost chaos. There is a lesson to be drawn from the Congo situation. But it is just as much a warning against going too slow as against going too fast. At any rate, we have given our new emergent territories a good training and a good chance. They will make mistakes. Their Governments, like all Governments, will commit follies. Their countries, like all countries, will be misled by demagogues. But that happens even among quite experienced people.I said in the beginning of my speech that I believed our people, and especially our young people - in spite of all the dangers and problems of the day - were ready to join confidently in the march forward. I believe that they would wish a British Government in the critical years that lie ahead to make its own positive contribution to these vast and often baffling problems. History and geography have combined to place our country at this time in a position of special responsibility and special opportunity.It falls to the Conservative Party now - and perhaps for many years to come - to ensure that the responsibilities are faced and the opportunities seized. Let us remember the past both to read its lessons and to draw from it inspiration; but let our minds and energies be directed to the tasks of the future. In the closing minutes of this Conference - this great Conference - let us cast away party pride or sense of party triumph. Instead let us all humbly resolve to be equal to our duty and worthy of our trust.

aVThis month marks the tenth anniversary of our Conservative Government. But I do not intend this afternoon to look back. I would rather look forward. I will only say this. Our opponents affect to dismiss this whole period as \u2018wasted years.\u2019 If the country at large shared that view, they would hardly have renewed our mandate with bigger majorities at two General Elections.I would like first to pay tribute to all my colleagues in the Government, whether in the Cabinet or outside, and to the Members of our Party in Parliament for their loyal support. It would also be right at this meeting to refer to the change in the Chairmanship of the Party. Mr. Butler, at my special request, took on this work after the last Election. He has given the Party great and distinguished service. He is now going to help me in a wider field of public duties. In particular he is going to lead the Ministerial group in London charged with the general over sight of the Common Market negotiations which are to be carried on by Mr. Heath on the Continent. I am deeply grateful to him.I commend to you Mr. Macleod as Mr. Butler\u2019s successor. He has proved a most successful Minister. He has had long experience of how the Party works; he has zest and great organising ability. I am sure that he can count on the support which has been accorded to all his predecessors and will be fortified by the invaluable help of Sir Toby Low. That is all I have to say on Party matters today. Well, not quite all. I will allow myself just one excursion into the fascinating realms of Labour Party policy, partly for its own intrinsic importance, and partly because it is typical of the indecision which is characteristic of the Socialists today. I will choose a subject of which I have had some experience \u2013 Housing. At the last General Election the Socialists had a plan to purchase, for I don\u2019t know how many hundreds of millions of pounds, and hand over to the Local Authorities all rented homes - about five million of them. This was one of the major planks in their platform. But in \u2018Signposts for the Sixties\u2019 this takeover bid has been quietly withdrawn, gone, vanished, faded away, kaput. At their recent Conference, somebody from the floor moved to put the plan back again. The platform was of course indignant, and saw to it that the proposal was voted down. It was explained that the Executive no longer believed the scheme would work. Perhaps it is as well for us all that they discovered that in opposition and not in office.I will not follow this afternoon what has become the traditional pattern for these occasions, and give you a detailed progress report on almost every aspect of policy. In the last few days you have had full debates on all the vital issues. You have heard the responsible Ministers describe their problems and their plans in a series of brilliant speeches. In that field they have left me very little to say. What I should like to do is to take a look at where we all stand today, and see whether any answer can be found to some of the questions which are in the minds of everyone, especially the younger generation.What is Britain\u2019s place and purpose in the modern world? What are our goals at home and abroad? What must we do to get there? What are the dangers? What are the prizes and what are the stakes? Nobody viewing the international scene today can fail to be concerned and saddened by the deterioration which has taken place during the past eighteen months.Faced with so many problems, there are some people \u2013 not, I am happy to think, in our Party - who would like Britain to retire into isolation and cease to play a major part in the world. We might perhaps make some minor contribution to some Regional Pact, or preferably contract out altogether - become \u2018sitters,\u2019 not \u2018doers.\u2019 We should then, it is true, be less involved in the day to day struggle. Whether we should be any safer is another matter. All experience shows that you only stay neutral and safe if there are others who are prepared to defend you.The world today is torn by one of its great doctrinal struggles, greater perhaps than any in the past. Nothing in our recent experience has ever approached the gulf between Communist ideology and our own. And not only between Communism and our own Christian philosophy but between Communism and any idealist philosophy based on a belief in God. Nothing can bridge that gap. What we can hope to do - and what we should continue to aim at doing - is so to contain the issue without abandoning our own positions that time is given a chance to do its healing work. In the fullness of time, if we believe our own faith, we must surely hope that what we regard as wicked and cynical doctrines will gradually change and lose their fervency and strength. Then Communist countries may begin to develop into more normal civilisations recovering a moral basis for their life.But we are confronted with more than a struggle of ideologies. It is also a struggle for power. For Communist Russia by a strange quirk, is the greatest colonialist and imperialist country in the world and it is using all the old arts and ambitions of Tsarist Russia, strengthened by the techniques and devices of the modern world, and a strange if perverted creed that has a queer attraction both for the most primitive and for the most sophisticated societies. Sometimes they have come with offers of money (not in fact very much money, nothing on a scale approaching the aid the Western countries have given). Sometimes they have come with a revolutionary creed which at first at any rate is often attractive to peoples whose political evolution has been slow. Sometimes they offer armaments in order to set this country against that. Naturally by all these moves they have some success. All the same, experience of the Russian clutch makes people a little suspicious of it. Sometimes they are able to wrench themselves free. Sometimes, alas, the process has gone too far. Once the Bear\u2019s hug has got you, it\u2019s apt to be for keeps. But except in the countries actually neighbouring to Russia, the Communists have not been able to operate by their own armed force. Even in these countries nobody can doubt what is the real feeling of the people, whether it be Poland, East Germany, or Hungary. Nor can any honest man deny what would be the result of any straightforward plebiscite.It is Soviet Russia that has frustrated all our efforts at Geneva to reach agreement on the abolition of nuclear tests. In addition, she has blown off a score or more explosions in the atmosphere amounting to many megatons. I cannot help contrasting the rather modest reaction all over the world, including our left-wingers, to this wanton addition to the fallout risks, with what would have been said had the offender been one of the Western Powers. All the same, I still hope that the Russians may in their own interests be willing to accept something in the nature of a detente; that they may wish for a pause in this particular turn of the struggle. Berlin may provide the first real test of that. The Foreign Secretary has put before you very clearly the present state of the Berlin problem and our hopes of finding by patient examination a basis for negotiation. I have nothing to add to what he has said except perhaps to observe how brilliantly in the last year he has justified an appointment which did not go uncriticised when it was made.If Communism could bring itself to carry out with sincerity what their leaders declare to be their purpose, if they would allow a straightforward competition between our two systems, we should gladly accept the challenge.Meanwhile we must accept the fact that this bleak ideological struggle may last for another generation, perhaps even longer. In this struggle we must have faith and a sense of purpose. In every civilised society there has been a conflict between the materialist and the idealist concept of life. Some of the noblest figures have devoted themselves entirely to the latter. These are the great lights that have shone through history. There have been many, too, who with pure cynicism and selfishness have followed only what they believe to be their immediate material interests. All the same, the great mass of us have been brought up to believe that practical day-to-day ambitions should be leavened by idealist inspiration. Now we are faced with vast communities and widespread doctrines which wholly reject any idea of this view of life. Materialism is all they think about. If this mood were to spread, either in the form of a positive acceptance of Marxist atheism or in the perhaps more dangerous form, the indolence of agnosticism, then I believe that Western society would be doomed.Britain cannot retire from this contest, but we cannot wage it alone. We must bring to the help of our friends and allies such moral and material strength as we can create at home. And we must do more. We must look outside our island, wherever we have authority and influence. That is one of the purposes of our policy. We can bring our influence in the Commonwealth. We can play our part in Europe. We must bring a continual effort to strengthen the organisations and groupings of the Free World, for the Free World is not strong enough to hold out unless it works as a team - together.It has been with this in mind that we have approached the question of Europe and the Common Market. In recent years, the countries of Western Europe have drawn closer together in matters of common defence. But in economic affairs there is still a potentially dangerous rift - the Six and the Seven, both of them in themselves sincere attempts at cooperation and greater unity. But if the gulf cannot be bridged, or if it seems to be permanent and unbridgeable, then I greatly fear the consequences will be grave. It will be, as I said in the United States six months ago, \u2018a canker gnawing at the very heart of the Western Alliance.\u2019 The Lord Privy Seal, Mr. Heath, and the Commonwealth Secretary have dealt in detail with our position in these negotiations and with the safeguards that we require for the Commonwealth, our home agriculture and our EFTA partners. I need not go into it here. I am convinced that a more united Europe could be and will be of the utmost benefit to our Commonwealth family.This issue, which you have been discussing largely on economic aspects, does not concern only the economic aspects. We must keep in mind the picture of the Commonwealth as a whole and what it has come to mean. It should be idle to claim that the recent developments which are turning the Empire into the Commonwealth have met with universal approbation at home. It is quite natural that there should be nostalgic memories of past glories. Of course, to the little Englander or the philosophic Radical this means nothing, for they always rather disapprove of the great story of British expansion overseas. Yet nobody today can go to any of those distant parts of the world - and I have visited, as Prime Minister, almost every Commonwealth country - without a thrill and a tightening of the throat as old memories stir. Nearer home, we cannot pass a museum or depot of almost any regiment without remembering with pride how much valour has been spent in the creation of this immense heritage. In the next stage, when conquest changed to administration we remember not only the great pro-consuls but the simple, humble men and women who gave so much to the advancement of the peoples entrusted to them. Now we have reached the third stage. It has been our constant purpose to hold these responsibilities as trustees until, with the ward grown up and able to arrange his own affairs, the guardians can take their honourable discharge. Nor should we perhaps forget, as it is forgotten sometimes, that in the early days it was not a choice between independence or British rule. It was often either British rule or chaos.As I say, the third stage has now been reached. Of course it is fraught with great problems and great dangers. All the same, I think the best judges may perhaps be those who have had to deal with this changing scene. The reactionaries, if there are some, have not been the governors nor the members of the colonial service; not at all, it is they who have been the leaders even in this evolution. If there are disappointments and setbacks, as there are and must be, on the way - and what great human aspirations have not suffered disappointments and setbacks - my faith, and your faith, I believe, in the destiny of the Commonwealth is still undimmed.I believe that this is the dawn and not the dusk. What we have done and are still trying to do is something which has never before been attempted in history. Our purpose is to create by evolution a new Commonwealth structure which will avoid the decline and fall which till now has been the fate of every Empire. Freedom of the individual under the law, the right to think what you like, say what you like, and within the law take what action you like, and, above all, to believe that the machinery of the State exists to be the servant not the master of its people - to open up a wider and fuller life for the individual - these are what the Commonwealth should stand for. We do not all always live up to our ideals; growing countries have their growing pains. We in this island had quite a rough time of it for many centuries, with many bitter internal struggles until the Victorian age, when we settled down to the orderly form of politics we now enjoy. So let us hope that others may be able to learn from our mistakes.To return to the Common Market. The prizes of success would be great, but they are long-term and not short-term prizes. Nor must we delude ourselves. Even if we succeed in negotiating our entry on acceptable terms, that will not be any short cut to an effortless prosperity. It will not absolve us from the stark necessity of earning our way in the world in the teeth of fierce competition. It will be no less necessary than now to keep a close eye on costs and prices. Indeed, we must expect competition to intensify. It is a bracing cold shower we shall enter, not a relaxing Turkish bath.But that must be our experience whether we join or not. In or out of the Common Market, Britain in this decade must be prepared to face changes in her industrial life and organisation, some of them novel, many of them painful, but all of them in the long run salutary. We in the Government felt that there is now a chance of giving a new meaning to the future relations of Britain, Europe and the Commonwealth and that in the state of the world today this may make a difference. We cannot guarantee that we shall succeed in our purpose. But I am sure we should have been wrong, after full reflection and earnest weighing of all these things, not to have made the attempt. If, through indecision, timidity, or sheer political expediency, we had allowed this opportunity to slip from us, we should have failed to rise to the level of events. Your vote on Thursday showed that our Party is ready to face the reality of the world today. Of course, the Socialists once again are undecided. They, as a party, belong to the class which the Gallup Poll calls \u2018don\u2019t knows.\u2019 Mr. Gaitskell is still hesitating. Let him beware lest, if I may recall a famous phrase, he sits so long on the fence that the iron enters into his soul.In any event - in this Common Market or out of it - our economic policy must be dynamic not static. It must change with changing conditions. Naturally, after the restraints of six years of war and six years of Socialism, our first instinct in 1951 was to set ourselves free - free from the restrictions and controls inevitable to a siege economy and inseparable from Socialism. We have only to look round the country to see the beneficial results of that broad policy. But freedom must not be made the excuse for licence. It must not mean waste, inefficiency or unwillingness to develop any of our resources to the maximum in an orderly and constructive way.Yesterday you heard the Chancellor of the Exchequer and gave him every assurance of support in his testing and supremely important office. He emphasised the pressing need to increase our exports. Since we launched the special export drive last year and since the Government introduced the new means of assisting exports, we have made substantial progress. In the last ten years exports have gone up by 20 per cent (a fifth) in real terms - far more of course in money terms, as we well know. But we have got to do better still. For the great help we used to get from our invisible exports, £300 million or more, and which we had up to a year or eighteen months ago, has suddenly dwindled. This may be for temporary reasons lower prices of oil and lower shipping rates \u2013 but I do not think this amount can be rapidly rebuilt. Therefore, we have all the more need to increase our visible exports - that is, of actual products. When you add to this our need to invest and give aid overseas, you will see how vital today is the export drive. And from this new angle, I am sure it is right that we should now make further efforts to develop, by a combination of Government, management and Trade Unions, a purposeful attempt to see our industrial future as a whole, though leaving it to each industry to make its individual assessment of its own future, to find where the weaknesses are, and to remove all those obstacles which from whatever cause may stand in the way of efficient production. We all know in our hearts that if every industry in this country were anywhere near the level of the best, our problem would be solved. There is also need for co-operative effort to make sure that each industry knows what the other is doing and makes the right preparations for joint development.Of course, if we were to hand ourselves over to a completely controlled economic system, like the communist one, some of the difficulties of those at the top would doubtless be much reduced. Anyway, their mistakes would be concealed. But it is not so pleasant for those who aren\u2019t so near the top. A completely planned socialist economy means the Government taking into their hands full power over human lives and human destinies.But while it is and has always been opposed to State domination, the Tory Party has never stood for the sacrifice of human values to the doctrines of a completely free economy. Between Socialism and the old laissez-faire Liberalism there is indeed a Middle Way. That is our way. It is in this spirit that the Chancellor of the Exchequer has formulated his proposals for planning in a free society, purposeful but free.I must add just this warning. In any economic society, planned or unplanned, profits, salaries and wages must march in step with increased production. It is because we have gone rather too fast and this has affected the level of costs and therefore the balance of payments that the Government have had to propose the wages pause. As the Chancellor of the Exchequer has explained to you, it is intended to be temporary. Its purpose is to fill the gap until productivity as a whole justifies further increases. It is obvious that without an increase in national productivity, mere increases in money rewards cannot add to income in real terms. In addition, they threaten the stability of the whole economy. With the close co-operation of all concerned I believe we can find the right answer. The Government have thought it right to give a lead, even at the cost of some highly distasteful decisions in the sector under their control. We believe that the country as a whole sees the reason for our action, and I am hopeful that the proposed National Economic Development Council will help to improve competitiveness of the whole economy.I reminded you in my first words that it was ten years since the task of government was entrusted to the Conservative Party. What I have tried to do today is not to look back over the past but to look a little into the future. What are the tasks we must seek to tackle in the next ten years? For I have no doubt at all that if you all play your part, the responsibility for those years will lie with our Party. I cannot promise to be at the helm all that time. For, like one of Shakespeare\u2019s characters I do not intend \u2018To live after my flame lacks oil. To be the snuff of younger spirits.\u2019 Obviously in our ranks there is no lack of younger spirits.\u2019Our first task is to maintain the safety of our country and to do our duty in the world, to play our full part in the collective defence of freedom. That must take precedence over every other consideration. It will involve effort. It will involve patience and some sacrifice. But it is well within our power. Having made that clear at the outset, let me turn to our affairs at home - social progress.First, slum clearance. I put that first of all our social problems. We must remove these blots that are a threat to health and the decencies of life. We have not been idle. Indeed, we are the only party that has made not without difficulty a sustained attack upon the problem. If we can maintain the same rate of progress as we have had in the last three years, we shall have broken the back of the problem outside the larger cities. We shall then be free to concentrate on these.Second, the old. I take an increasing interest in this. Their numbers are growing. They are living longer and more active lives. Pensions, of course, are a basic need. We Conservatives have always been cautious about the promises we make to the pensioner. Of course, in this field we are always outbid by our opponents. But the four increases we have made give pensions a higher purchasing power than they have ever had and our new graduated scheme will prove a notable forward step by relating pensions to earnings. So we need not fear any comparison between our deeds and our opponent\u2019s words. As for the future, I will repeat what I said at the election, and have since carried out. We intend in the coming years, as in the past, to see that the old share in rising national prosperity. Then there are the housing needs of the old. Special housing for them was only just beginning ten years ago. But now it is an accepted feature in local authority programmes. It in fact accounts for more than a quarter of the total of their house building. Help in the home, health services, and so on: we have made great progress here, but more needs to be done. There is also the need to prepare for the more worthwhile use of retirement, whether in occupation or in leisure. But, in addition to the help that the State or the local authority can give, we must not neglect the part that neighbourliness and voluntary effort have to play. It is good to see some of our younger Conservatives heading a concerted attack on that worst feature of old age - loneliness.Third, the young. If we are to keep abreast in the modern world we must devote ourselves to vast educational expansion. When we came in ten years ago, the university population was 83,000. By the end of this decade, we hope - if all goes well - it will be 170,000. You have only to look around the country to see what has been and is being done in the building of new primary and secondary schools. And there is a lot of improvement going on in all the schools that you cannot see from the outside. We must complete the programme and get rid of the oversize classes. At the same time we shall continue to expand our technical education and develop the youth service. We shall aim to widen education and training opportunities in industry. In a single phrase, the next ten years in education must set the seal on the work of the last ten years.Fourth, the nation\u2019s health. Here again the Government have already told the hospital authorities to make their plans for ten years head. This is a massive undertaking. To see the job through may well cost £500,000,000.Fifth, our standard of living In the last ten years, wages have gone up by one third in real value, not just nominal, and if we can keep the general rate of increase the same - level with, and not ahead of our productivity - we should be able to see the average wage packet rising from the present figure of £15 a week to something like £20. That means the average industrial wage earner should be a £l,000-a-year man at current prices. That would have seemed an impossible dream not only in my youth, but even only a few years ago.Of course there will be the impact - there is already - of a high standard of living on various sectors of the economy. And we must also devote new thought to the social consequences of this more widely distributed wealth. Will the structure of the social services, which after all was designed against a vastly different background, be altogether suitable to the new conditions? How can it be remodelled or adjusted to ensure that public resources are concentrated on those to whom they do most good, and that the benefits are not dissipated by being dispersed too widely? How best can we adapt our present policies to take account of a growing ability - and, I think, a growing desire of the individual to make more provision for himself and his family?I am confident that, given the will, we can make great forward strides in the next ten years. Of course, it is no easy road that lies ahead. To ensure success we shall need to draw to the full on those traditional qualities of work and thrift, which have stood us in such good stead in the past. Work to produce wealth; thrift to ensure that we put by more of today\u2019s wealth to meet tomorrow\u2019s needs. Science today is, as you know, my Lord Chairman, placing exciting new devices at the disposal of industry and commerce. All of them are costly. That calls for investment on a massive scale. We dare not neglect that investment; but unless it comes from genuine saving, it will inevitably be met by inflation, with all its injustices and dangers. If the Government are to preach thrift, they must also try to practise it. We intend to see that Government expenditure, both current and prospective, is kept in line with our national resources. For this purpose, the Chancellor of the Exchequer asked for the help of a second Cabinet Minister of authority and experience at the Treasury. I am indeed grateful to Mr. Brooke for so readily accepting this task. The Government have, of course, a great part to play in all this; but success or failure will rest in the end with the nation.We need better organisation of industry, a more conscious application of resources to needs, better industrial relations with all concerned facing the realities of our situation. For what, after all, would be the use of arguing about a tea break if we could not afford to import the tea? We have got to get rid of restrictive practices, both by management and labour. If all that we have to do both at home and overseas is to be accomplished, we must be imaginative, but practical - eyes on the horizon but both feet on the ground. It is fashionable, I know, today to throw doubts on the value of material progress. But it was a Great Tory statesman, Disraeli, who made the improvement of the condition of the people one of his cardinal aims. But it does not and cannot stand alone. Prosperity, however widespread, will not solve our problems.In this Conference, you have been deeply stirred by the prevalence of crime, and especially violent crime, despite all our social advances. In the course of a notable debate, the Home Secretary set out the policy which he has been following in recent years with the full support of the whole Government. On Thursday last at this Conference you gave him an overwhelming vote of confidence. I know that this will cheer him greatly in his difficult and unenviable task, and fortify him in carrying forward his plans, for he needs the help of every one of us. But no Home Secretary, no police, no laws, no prisons or reform institutions, can solve this problem alone. What we need is a rekindling at all levels of our society of the old faith that makes a clear distinction between right and wrong. If I may be allowed to say so, we need humility as well as faith. So much for home.What of the next ten years work overseas? I have spoken of the Commonwealth, with all its difficulties and opportunities as the self-governing communities multiply. The next ten years will be the test of the new Commonwealth. Helping the new Commonwealth should be as inspiring as founding and governing the old Empire. I have spoken of Europe and of our hope that Britain may become more closely associated with Europe, economically and politically. We must think of Europe and the Commonwealth, not as rivals but as joint pilgrims on the road to peace and freedom.I have spoken too of the world outside. Here, as the Foreign Secretary rightly told us, we must be calm and steady, but firmness does not mean obstinacy. We must not oscillate wildly from one extreme to the other - unilateralists one year, multilateralists the next; sometimes isolationists, sometimes internationalists, and sometimes a bit of both. We must pursue, as we are doing, a steady and consistent policy. We must not miss the opportunity for relaxations of pressure, so long as we never forget that the fundamental struggle will be long and testing. We could lose very quickly by a false step; but to win will mean a long drawn out effort waiting for the time when Communism itself falls a victim to the spiritual forces which it despises.To sum up - here at home, we seek a balanced society, in which our prosperity as individuals is reflected in the standard of the things we do together, and in which public effort is conjoined with private purpose in a common endeavour to increase our wealth and to use it well. In our Colonial territories we seek to place new nations on the true course. In Europe and the Commonwealth, we seek to add a new relationship to old ties and to find a greater common strength in the face of the greatest common challenge. In all the world, we seek to help poorer nations, to preserve freedom and to promote peace. These are exciting opportunities for us all in the next ten years; tasks which will put to worthy use the vitality of a great people. We in the Conservative Party are ready.

aVThis is the fifth time I have had the privilege, as Leader of the Party, to address the full Conference at the end of their work. I am bound to tell you that I always find this, although an agreeable occasion, a difficult task; for in the course of your debates all the great subjects of the day have been fully discussed, both from the floor and from the platform.I have had full reports of your discussions and followed them day by day, almost hour by hour.You have debated the future of Britain, Europe and the Commonwealth, in their broadest aspects. One outstanding theme in your debates has been what role Britain can and should play in the changing conditions of the modern world. What opportunities and what difficulties lie before us. A second major theme, whether you have been discussing financial, economic, industrial or social questions, has been how do we face the problems of change and innovation in a rapidly changing society? These two subjects are closely related, for on how we live our lives at home depends on how we stand in the world outside.Momentous decisions such as these inevitably arouse doubts and misgivings, and differences of opinion inside as well as between political parties. The historic debate you had on Thursday naturally reflected something of this. Of course when a party is in Opposition, it can allow itself to be lured by the pursuit of power without any inhibiting sense of responsibility. To this end the leaders can - if they wish - sit on the fence without fear, if not without reproach. Perhaps you saw in the news the other evening that a Monsieur Henri Tochatain in central France gave up after standing and sitting on a tightrope for 174 hours, just over a week. Poor deluded man. He thought he had set up a world record. The alternative to sitting on a fence seems to be to hop from perch to perch, waiting to see how things develop and where, and how the maximum of party advantage can be extracted. A party in office cannot afford such luxuries. It must face the facts of the world and shape its policies to meet them. You have made it clear this week that that is what you expect us to do, and that is what we are doing.The European Economic Community is one of the facts of the modern world. It is there, and its very existence must cause profound changes, and that is just as true whether we go in or whether we stay out.We in the Cabinet have given long and anxious thought to every aspect of this problem. It has been our duty to weigh up the balance between all the dangers and all the opportunities of alternative courses of action. Throughout we have applied one single test - what will be in the best long-term interests of our country and of those beyond our shores with whom we have such special ties and for whose welfare we have such special responsibilities.To have gone full speed ahead and hustled into Europe without counting the cost, as the Liberals would have had us do - would have been wrong - utterly wrong. It would have been equally wrong to drag our feet and adopt the dilatory, hesitant advice of Mr. Gaitskell. He says in effect that a few more years will not matter. But, time does not stand still, Europe is not standing still. The Six are developing their arrangements both economic and political. To wait indefinitely would be to forfeit the chance of influencing events.The European Community is not a static but a growing and dynamic body. In many respects its policies and future have still to be worked out. If we wait too long it will be too late. Now is the opportunity and we must seize it.That is why we decided in July last year to open formal negotiations for our entry into the European system. We put down a formal motion asking Parliament to approve our actions. What did the Socialists do? They would not actually disapprove what we were doing. That might subject their pliant leader to pressure from one side. They would not approve, for that would make him the victim of pressure from the other side. So what did they do? They solemnly asked Parliament not to approve or disapprove, but to take note of our decision. Perhaps some of the older ones among you may remember that popular song, I think recently revived: \u2018She didn\u2019t say \u201cyes,\u201d she didn\u2019t say \u201cno,\u201d She didn\u2019t say \u201cstay,\u201d she didn\u2019t say \u201cgo.\u201d She wanted to climb but she dreaded to fall, so she bided her time and clung to the wall.\u2019Still, we got the approval of Parliament and accordingly negotiations actually began in October last year. Much progress has been made since then - progress which I reported at the recent Commonwealth Prime Ministers\u2019 Conference. The negotiations are now being resumed to deal with the many points still outstanding, and you will, I know, wish all success in this assignment to Mr. Heath and those who work with him. We intend to continue our efforts to secure satisfactory arrangements for the interests of the Commonwealth, our own agriculture and our EFTA partners. The massive vote you gave on Thursday shows that the party is solidly behind us in these efforts. When the negotiations are concluded it will be the duty of the Government to make their considered recommendations to Parliament. I cannot tell you today what will be the final outcome. All I can say is this. It is our sincere hope - which I know you overwhelmingly share - that these negotiations may be successful. In spite of carefully chosen phrases inserted here and there into his Brighton speech, I cannot help wondering whether success would be as gratifying to Mr. Gaitskell as failure. At any rate, as you know, Mr. Khrushchev is against the whole thing.Inside Western Europe a complete transformation has taken place since 1945, both politically and economically. At that time Europe, devastated by the most destructive war in history and by the breakdown of the internal regime in almost every country, appeared almost finished as a force in the world. But Western Europe has achieved a remarkable recovery. It is on its way to forming an economic and - in one form or another - a political unity which could, in terms of population, skill and resources, rival the United States or the Soviet Union. It is fifteen years since Sir Winston Churchill in two remarkable speeches, one at Zurich and the other at Fulton, with characteristic vision saw the possibilities of a new Europe arising from the ashes of the old. Thus was born the Council of Europe, from which stemmed the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation, the European Payments Union, Western European Union and many other constructive developments. Thanks to the statesmanship of Ernest Bevin, the Labour Government and most of the Labour Party overcame their reluctance to these ideas and, indeed, played a considerable part in furthering them. That has remained firm British policy ever since, with the broad assent of the British people outside the ranks of the Communists, semi-Communists and fellow travellers.But the urge for unity in Europe has not been satisfied by the establishment of these institutions. The European movement has caught the imagination of the young; it has transcended party politics and national barriers. Its impact has not been limited to economic affairs. With the development of the European idea there has come a resurgence and a new vigour in all aspects of European life, in sport, in the arts, in science and in industry. There is something here of that release of the spirit which lifted Europe out of the mediaeval twilight into the brilliance of the Renaissance and the modern world. Europe is once more on the move.We in Britain cannot stand aside from all this. Although in the latter part of the nineteenth century and the first half of this century, we have sometimes tried to ignore the Continent, we have never really been able to insulate ourselves from what happens only twenty miles away.What, after all, is the story of this island since the end of the Middle Ages and the rise of nation states? Successive British Monarchs and Governments have been concerned to preserve in changing conditions the liberty and independence of our country. This has involved using all our efforts to prevent the domination of Europe, then co-terminus with the civilised world, by a single power. This was our story in the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. Sometimes war was our instrument, sometimes diplomacy. What we could never rely on was our sheer size. In point of numbers we are and always have been a relatively weak country, not to be matched with the giants of Europe in the old days or with the giants of the world now. How presumptuous it must have seemed to the great conquerors and rulers in Europe - Philip II, Louis XIV, Napoleon - yes, and even Hitler. This tiny island defying their embattled might. And in a sense they were right. Alone we should have had but little chance and that is why all through history we have sought allies and sought them well. Our great leader, who cheered us on when we had to stand alone, devoted his energies to getting us allies - bringing in the Americans, helping to revive France, encouraging the Italians when they freed themselves from the dictator\u2019s grip, welcoming the Soviet alliance when Russia was attacked. This was Sir Winston\u2019s method and well he justified it. We were perhaps never so proud as when we stood alone in 1940. But in the end it was the enemy who stood alone and that is how we won.The instrument of coalition, of alliance, is one which we have always used in war. In peace perhaps we have used it less; but anyone who looks honestly at the history of the first half of this century cannot help feeling that the prospects of peace might have been better if we had played in peacetime as large a part in the affairs of Europe as we - and our Commonwealth partners too - have in war. For this hesitation we have paid a heavy price. Is not that, perhaps the lesson learned from the battlefields we remember, and the comrades we mourn?In considering what are the interests not only of this country but of our Commonwealth partners, let us never forget that for all of us far the greatest interest is the preservation of world peace and freedom.Therefore we must welcome the determination of our neighbours in Europe to seek to bury for good their age-old conflicts. A new bond of common purpose has united our old ally, France, with our former enemy, Germany. This in itself has greatly strengthened the prospects for peace. Britain and France have long forgotten the centuries of conflict which divided us; we have stood together so often in adversity that the old rivalry has been replaced by a lasting friendship and a deep consciousness of common purpose. We have a great opportunity to renew and strengthen these bonds with France and to link them with a closer relationship with Germany.There is also our longstanding friendship with Italy - now happily restored - and with our ancient allies in the Low Countries and Scandinavia. If we can build on these foundations a united Europe, then together we can face the future with confidence and strength. Already the European Economic Community is beginning to pursue common economic policies towards the outside world, and soon it may begin to do so in foreign affairs. It will do that whether we join it or whether we do not. But it is of the greatest importance to all of us in Britain and the Commonwealth that the policies which it pursues should take full account of the wider needs of the rest of the world. In isolation from the European scene we cannot expect to have any steady influence on the formulation of policy. I believe that in the long run the isolation of Britain from the centres of European power would be damaging for us all, as well as for Europe itself. Inside the Community, British influence would be important and could be decisive.There has been a wide and perhaps natural concern with what is called the question of sovereignty and this has been reflected in your Conference. Going in must involve some pooling of national freedom of action. Nobody denies that. Of course, within the sphere covered by the Treaty of Rome, which is essentially an economic Treaty, we agree to the rules of the club. That is true of all the clubs to which we belong: to GATT on the economic side, and far more formidable and far-reaching NATO on the defence side. Remember that under the terms of the NATO Treaty, we are pledged to go to the aid of any one of fourteen other countries if they are attacked. In terms of the totality of modern war, this is indeed a tremendous pledge. It may not involve our formal sovereignty, but it does involve our physical survival.It is true that the Governments of the Six are anxious to move forward from an economic to some form of political union, and we want to play our part in devising these new arrangements. But so far there is no agreement as to the form which they should take. Mr. Gaitskell now prattles about our being reduced to the status of Texas or California. What nonsense. But in any case, if he really believes that then, he should surely be against the whole thing, root and branch, not just wondering whether we are getting sufficiently profitable terms. Certainly if I believed that I would not touch it on any terms. The approach of the six existing members of the Community is gradual and pragmatic as our own has been on constitutional developments. In any case, any agreements reached in his field must be by unanimous consent. There can be no question therefore of Britain being outvoted into some arrangement which we found incompatible with our own needs and responsibilities and traditions. That is the position today. But if we delay indefinitely, as Mr. Gaitskell seems to want us to do, we might eventually be confronted with a different and a much less formative situation. By then a European structure might have taken more definite shape and we would have had no part in shaping it.Meanwhile, the Treaty of Rome is an economic treaty with its own rules and its own system of voting unanimously on some things, by majorities on others. It has its political implications; but while close co-operation is involved there is no question of our being asked or expected to accept any system of a federal character involving the sovereignty, in the true sense of the word, of the Crown and Government and people of these islands.While the political development of Europe lies in the future, the economic consequences can already plainly be seen. What do they mean to us at home and to the Commonwealth?If we go in, we shall have wider economic opportunities. We shall be part of, and have free access to, a home market of 250 million people instead of 50 million people - five times the size. This will transform our industrial situation. It will make possible specialisation and mass production and the introduction of techniques like automation which can be developed only on the basis of a large home market.The whole trend of modern industry is towards a larger, unified market. In fact, modern technology is making these large economic units essential in the newest industries, and it is in developing these new industries that Britain\u2019s future lies. British industry will have to concentrate more and more on the complicated, sophisticated, specialised goods. Not just the things which are relatively simple to make, but the difficult things which need great precision and great skill. If we can obtain proper terms and go into Europe to seize these new opportunities, I am convinced that it will be in the best interests of the Commonwealth as well as ourselves. Both as buyers of their goods and as suppliers of the capital they need for their development, our value to the Commonwealth depends not just on sentiment or on goodwill, important as they are; it depends on the economic strength and prosperity of Britain. So much for that.But beyond that, Britain\u2019s entry into the Community would almost certainly be only the first step in a fundamental re-shaping of the framework of world trade. The possibilities of moving at last towards worldwide agreements on foodstuffs and raw materials would be greatly improved. We believe that our entry into the Community would decisively strengthen the outward-looking forces already at work in Europe. The Community, in co-operation with the United States, would then be able to carry further the processes of freeing world trade. President Kennedy\u2019s bold and sweeping proposals for further tariff negotiations have now been passed through Congress. We can therefore expect the opening of these negotiations to follow quickly after our entry into the Community. Both the United States and the Six have made it clear that they are willing to consider constructively the negotiation of worldwide agreements on trade in agricultural products. These could be of decisive importance in themselves, and at the same time, economic growth coming from reduced trade barriers should also facilitate the proposals now being canvassed, which would promote the disposal of food surpluses through aid programmes to developing and, let us not forget it, sometimes to hungry countries.All these, of course, are complicated problems. Yet even the prospect of our joining the Community has been a powerful stimulus to new ideas. The Commonwealth is not and does not expect to be an economic unit. Nor is it any longer the close-knit military and political alliance between countries of similar origins and all owing allegiance to the Crown, which we knew so well during two World Wars. The Commonwealth today is remarkable for its diversity, which is widespread. Indeed its diversity is its greatest strength. This unique and free association, embracing every creed and race, stretched over five continents and comprising a quarter of the globe\u2019s population, is at once an influence and an example of the possibilities of co-operation throughout the world. Its value to peace is incalculable, but I am persuaded that it is complementary and not alternative to the consolidation of Europe.Now for my other question: how do all these changes affect us here at home?Well, one thing is clear. In or out of Europe, we shall have to live in a world of increasing competition. We have never been afraid of that in the past, and we need not be afraid of it in the future, either in industry or in agriculture. Our farming is efficient and well placed to meet the challenge and opportunities of the enlarged European market. Of course there will have to be changes in the methods of sustaining a healthy agriculture. But, in or out of Europe, in the years ahead changes are inescapable. Broadly speaking, if we enter Europe, we shall move towards a managed market rather than a system financed largely by the Exchequer. I am confident that these new conditions can provide a firm basis for the future development of our great agricultural industry.If there is one thing more than anything else that has struck me in your debates, it is the way you all recognise that, inside or outside Europe, this country has got to be prepared for change. It is a job for us all over the next decade - for Government, employers, trade unions and the general public - it is our job to see that change is brought about not only with efficiency but with humanity as well. We are all more or less planners today. I was a planner thirty years ago when it was not quite so fashionable. The real difficulty about planning is not the concept but the execution. In a totalitarian State planning is simple but not necessarily effective. In a free democracy it certainly can only be effective if it is backed by the general assent of the people. During the last year, the Government have taken two important forward steps in planning \u2013 \u2018Nicky,\u2019 the National Incomes Commission, to ensure that rates of reward are both fair and an step with what we produce; and \u2018Neddy,\u2019 the National Economic Development Council, to help us produce more, and produce more efficiently, by keeping our plans in line with our resources and by removing obstacles to growth. We talk a great deal, and quite rightly about growth, but, of course, everything cannot grow at the same time or at the same rate. In reality, a growing economy means a changing economy, in which some industries will be expanding and others contracting in the light of changing demand both at home and abroad.Efficient industries require a network of roads and railways to serve them. That is why we are concentrating so much money and effort into our railway modernisation and road-building plans: hundreds of millions of pounds over the next few years on the railways and more than thirty times as much on new roads as when we returned to power, and this road programme is steadily growing. Our essential strength today lies in our ability to stay in the front rank of scientific and technical invention. We need not be over-modest. After all, we already have many outstanding achievements to our credit - our nuclear power stations, our new types of automatic machinery and electronic devices, pre-eminence in aero engines and many aerial components, and the lead which we are giving in revolutionary new forms of transport. We have done a lot in these years since the war; but we cannot and must not relax. We have heard a lot lately about \u2018a thousand years of history.\u2019 Let us make sure we learn the right lessons from them. Surely the lesson is that in all our great periods we have been ready to accept change - nay more, to be the leaders of change.If we are to go ahead in these fields we must make the best use of our brains and of the traditional skill of our people. That is why we are greatly expanding the opportunity for technical education. Since 1956 over £100 million worth of new building for technical education has been put in hand, and there are over 9,000 more full time teachers in this field alone than there were then. Students taking advanced courses have more than trebled in the last seven years, and the number taking courses on day releases continues to grow. Alongside this development there must be a parallel advance in training within industry in apprenticeship and the like. Many of our training schemes must be remodelled to meet the needs of today. I am glad to see that, with the help and encouragement of the Minister of Labour, there are signs of new thinking in industry about all this. No, it is not really in this field that I see our danger.Where we are in danger of falling behind is not in the discovery of new methods but sometimes in their application. This is partly due to being a nation too set in our ways, too apt to cling to old privileges, too apt to fear new methods, often too unwilling to abandon old practices that have outlived their usefulness. This is as true, if I may say so, of the professions as of the trade unions and of management. There are too many demarcation lines, social and industrial - one might almost say a sort of caste system. Whether we are in the Common Market or not, all this has got to be changed. Of course it isn\u2019t easy. It isn\u2019t a technical problem so much as a psychological problem. As a matter of fact, it is much easier to change machines than it is to change people.I said that change must be brought about with humanity. We have got to ensure that natural fears and anxieties are removed, and that people\u2019s material problems are recognised and met.It is in this spirit that we intend to introduce legislation in this coming Session providing for written contracts of service and minimum notice related to length of service. We hope this will provide a foundation for a voluntary move forward in pension, sickness and other schemes to ensure security and status among all employed. But, of course, the changing pattern of industry must necessarily entail movements of labour from one job to another. That involves the problems of re-training, re-housing, and the location of industry - steering expanding industries into areas where existing industries are contracting and workers and facilities are therefore available.Let me take one practical example - the railways. I think that the country as a whole accepts the necessity for reorganising and modernising the railways. It indeed would be remarkable if a railway network developed in the days of the stagecoach was still ideally suited to the needs of a country in which one family in three owns a motor car. But all of us equally recognise the very real difficulties which this causes men who have given their working lives to the railways.We all sincerely hope that these matters will be solved sensibly and amicably with the co-operation of all concerned. But solved and settled they must be. The first industrial revolution was on the whole efficient. It was certainly dynamic. It placed Britain in the forefront of the world for a century. Its faults lay in its inhumanity. Even today we are still faced, as you emphasised in your debates, with its physical legacy of slums and its psychological legacy of poisoned industrial and social relations. As a party and as a Government we are determined to see that our new industrial revolution, far from being marred in any of these ways, makes its own contribution to human betterment. In the last decade we have made - and no fair-minded person can deny it - immense improvements in all our social services, in pensions for the old and education for the young. In hospitals and health services. In slum clearance, housing, and home ownership. I am glad you are going on about home ownership. Today two houses in every five are owner-occupied. That was not so, if I remember rightly, some years ago. Yes, and they have done this before they knew what we were going to do about Schedule A. In the course of this Conference you have heard from active and enthusiastic Ministers about their further plans in all these fields. You have certainly not tried to keep them back. You have spurred them on, and rightly, for you know how much more there is to do. But let us never forget that the foundation for what we have done and what we are going to do rests upon our economic strength and competence as a nation. If we fail there we fail everywhere. Just as we are boldly stepping into the international future, determined to play our part to the full, so at home we recognise the same need for a modern, progressive and practical approach. We cannot cling to the methods of the past if we want to win the prizes of the future. We are indeed well based for this new leap forward. Thanks to the work of the last eleven years there has been an increase in the general standard of living, greater than in the whole of the first half of this century. Everyone knows that the life of the people is better, much of the old class division has gone. Everyone knows that there is a greater sense of opportunity in every field. Upon that foundation, then, let us build and build still better.Throughout this Conference, two great subjects have occupied your minds. First, the place of Britain in the modern world, with its new balance of power and the new groupings that have come into being. Secondly, the decision not merely to accept in our minds the need for great changes as a new industrial system develops, but positively in our hearts to welcome the opportunity which change presents. Our task is to overcome the obstacles in the way and to guide this great flood of invention through well-planned channels so that it may make the land fertile and fruitful. If, as I trust, we are able as the result of further negotiations to make the great decision to enter Europe, Britain in Europe will be economically stronger. Britain in Europe will have a double influence, both as a European country and one of worldwide interests. Britain\u2019s power and value to the other Commonwealth countries, old and new, will be greatly enhanced. And we can hope that our European associates will share with us that outward looking view by which alone the prosperity and so the peace of the world can be secured.At the same time, we must begin to build the new Britain, on the sound foundations of the progress we have made in the last decade, accepting and applying change and innovation at every point. That means not only materially in our plants and techniques; but humanly in the better training of our youth, better apprentice systems, better technological education, and accepting and applying change and innovation individually and nationally. If, at the same time, while respecting financial integrity, we can devote ever increasing resources to the education of youth and the comfort of old age, if we can thus in a new industrial revolution carry forward all that is good and remedy all that was bad - why then, on these two great issues, separate yet intertwined, we can surely move confidently to the future.This is a great moment of history. The decisions we have to take in both these fields will be dramatic and perhaps decisive. In our appeal today, as so often before, we can look not merely to the support of our own Party but to the great mass of people, especially I think, young people, who are determined that our country shall not rest upon its achievements, great as they have been. We can look to all those who are determined to read aright the lessons of the past and who are inspired by the daring as well as by the prudence of our forebears to move forward and seize the opportunities that lie ahead.So from this historic Conference and this great meeting let this message go out. We are determined as a Party, and I believe as a people, to rise to the challenge of the hour.

aVThe tone of this assembly has been lively, taut, well-informed, and confident. And I believe that it will finally silence the parrot-cry that Liberals have no policy.We are now, indeed, accused of the opposite offence, of having too much policy (Laughter). Now nothing we do, I hope, is ever going to please the numerous hostile commentators that there are in this country. It is as foolish to think that they will suddenly be converted to Liberalism as it is to think that the Communists will suddenly take to the free way of life. We used to be told that the trouble with our assemblies was that they groan under the ruthless dictatorship of the executive (Laughter). Fellow delegates, we have made this party, you and I. It has not always been easy, but we have built it up and there are a lot of people in this hall who have come into the Liberal Party and have devoted their money, their energy, their wits to building up their party. And it is your party - my party - and all of our party. We stand for partnership and we mean to practise partnership in this party.It may be that we should run a different sort of party. Some people do (Laughter). But a Liberal Assembly comes together so that we may together fashion our policy, see each other, talk to each other as equals, take the pulse of the party, and feel the fist of the party when necessary.We like it like that, and it is our party, and we are going to have it like that.Now, we are also charged with the new and curious offence of looking critically at the aims and institutions of our country. We do this because we care about our country. We do this because we are deeply aware of the British contribution to the institutions of the civilised world and we do not want to see this contribution cease, and run into the sands of defeatism (Applause).A new radicalismIn all the great periods of our history, Britain has been not only unafraid of change, she has been in the forefront of change. In the Elizabethan age - and I remind you that there was an Elizabethan age, it was not something invented by the Tory Central Office, rapidly discarded when it did not fit the facts under the Tory Government - it was Spain which wrapped itself in the trappings of outworn prestige and grandeur. It was Spain which refused to change. It was Britain which reached out to the new 16th Century frontiers opened up by the birth of science.At this Assembly we have hammered out a workmanlike set of proposals for change in Britain. We have said again that people count. We believe in change. We cannot say it too often and we reiterate it at this assembly. It follows that these changes must be brought about by the common will of the nation. But we shall only generate that common will if we can generate some passion behind the projects of our policy. Mr Gladstone said that little is accomplished in politics without passion and it is true. The reforms we propose are not very complicated. They are widely agreed to be necessary, but this country is inert and will only be shaken by passion.It is typical that reforms that everyone knows to be necessary, and which many other countries have carried out, should in Britain be considered to be absolutely visionary (Laughter). How dare people think that when science is undergoing revolution after revolution, when the whole structure and obligations of government have changed, that it is impossible to change the political institutions by which we run our country? (Applause) How can you suggest, when in the arts and sciences there is this enormous ferment, that politics alone must go on being wrapped up in a polythene bag, being more remote from the ordinary people? (Applause)Breathing new life into democracyDictatorships do not primarily arise from the ambitions of wicked men. Lust for power is very often the symptom of a malaise in the body politic. Dictatorships arise when democracy ceases to serve the interests of the ordinary people. We are on the approaches to the general election. What is going to count for this party in the coming year is not only the clarity and cohesion of its policies. We have got to make those policies live for ordinary people so that they mean something to them. That is the prime task of this party next year.Can we imbue partnership with life and give it magnetism? Can we make structural reforms inspiring? Can we kindle again in this country the flame of political interest and catch the divine spark which has been so sadly lacking in our public life?Now partnership is a magnificent ideal, but do not let us delude ourselves. We shall never get everybody to take an active part in political partnership. What we have got to do is to give everyone the opportunity and the chance to take part. We have to create a free society in which even those people who do not feel that they have a place can take part - and can at least give their assent, feeling that they believe in it.I believe it is possible. I believe we can create a society which people can admire, and to which they can respond. In every great society the citizens have been proud of proclaiming their citizenship. Men would have died rather than deny that they were Athenians or, indeed, citizens of Elizabethan Britain. Banishment from their society was a punishment less dread only than death itself.When a man claimed to be a Roman citizen, he identified himself not solely with the victories of the Roman Armies or the material prosperity of the city itself. He identified himself with the public virtues of Rome, embodied in the structure of her Empire and in the systems of law and administration.A return to civic prideBut who could be proud of an association with the public life of Britain in the last few years? (Loud applause)Today too many people are backing away from Britain, backing away from their responsibilities to their country. They emigrate. They take pride, not in developing and moulding the civilisation which we have inherited, but in enjoying what is ludicrous and sordid in it, and disclaiming all responsibilities for its ethics or good management (Applause).Now I beg of you Liberals, identify yourselves with your country! Get closer to it. It is yours - and this backing away, this snide dissociation from the great past and from the beckoning future - it will be the death of this country if it continues (Applause).But today voluntary banishment from Britain is common. Who can wonder at this? There are things we have got to put right. The decline in our public life is not confined to the Profumo affair. Indeed that affair, though dramatic, is important only as a symptom. Never since Suez has this Government attempted to lead and instruct the people. It has misled and distracted them whenever it can. It is the shoddiness, the lick of the paint on the rotten boards, the lack of candour, the lack of quality in the actions of those who lead us, which makes people contract out of their responsibilities.If the Government will not face awkward decisions, why should the people? If the Government cling to office at all costs, how can we maintain any values or standards in the country at large?\u2018A twentieth century Ruritania\u2019­The ordinary boy or girl too often feels around him a 20th Century Ruritania. They soon learn that to have a title, to have the right background, to know the right people, is more important than to know your job. The British used to laugh at foreign bigwigs loaded with medals, posturing under meaningless titles, prating of prestige and all too often corrupt and decadent. Now no establishment in the world is so much concerned with titles and decorations as is official Britain. Nor is any governing class so concerned with its prestige and anxious about status rating. Underneath all this façade we now know what has been going on.Now wonder then that there is cynicism about the conduct of our public affairs. This cynicism has lead to a good deal of complacency and a great resistance to change. Suggest even that you change such an obviously unworkable system as the rating system and \u2018Oh\u2019­, you will have been told, \u2018that will be very difficult.\u2019 Yet however difficult it may be to change this system, it would be impossible to devise a tax system so unfair, so punitive to enterprise, so generally unworkable, as the rating system. But in spite of this it continues.For 100 years, we are told, banks have been sending old bank notes by the million uncancelled to the Bank of England. We know that, when suggestions that this practice was possibly a little dangerous were made, the good old answer came back, \u2018What was good enough for our forefathers is good enough for us.\u2019­ I dare say that this system will continue. After all, who shall be assured in those classic words \u2018it works.\u2019 So far we have only lost £2 million-worth of notes and have had the meagre police force of this country totally distracted from what, to me, are more important tasks. The primary duty of the police is not the protection of property - important though that may be - but the protection of the weaker and older members of the community, from fear and from assault.Standards in public lifeWe are now awaiting the report of Lord Denning on, among other things, the state of public life in this country. I ask you to consider this astonishing development. Since when have the people of this country had to call in a High Court judge, however eminent, to carry out a roving commission into the private lives of various individuals, so that we may be informed whether we are behaving ourselves or not?Ladies and gentlemen, can you contemplate Mr Gladstone requiring advice on this subject? (Laughter) Let us be fair, Mr Disraeli would have laughed himself silly at the idea. Mr Asquith would not have stomached it for a moment. And Mr Balfour would have cut it down with a phrase. As for Mr Churchill, I wonder what he is thinking now? This constant setting-up of inquiries by judges into wholly unjudicial matters is itself conclusive evidence of our failure to equip the Government with the proper machinery for carrying on its business. It is also a sign of a failure by the people of this country to shoulder their responsibilities. It is a failure of democracy to make up its mind about whether its affairs are being conducted to our satisfaction or not.What is to be the outcome of this report? It is surely unthinkable that evidence taken in private by a process which, as far as I know, is unknown to any judicial system in the world, should be made public. But under what system of law is a court or an individual entitled to pronounce on questions of public conduct without making this evidence public? That is the dilemma we are in.Now, we shall be told, these reforms may be necessary and perhaps we do need some changes in the way we conduct our affairs, but you must take them slowly; do not rush into things.\u2018The wind of change\u2019­If you have read your newspapers this morning, you will have seen the desperate price we are now being called to pay for not having looked ahead, for not having grasped the difficulties when they were manageable, for not having discharged our duty to countries under our control and, later, under our influence.Britain, which has a very proud record at the United Nations, has been forced for the third time to cast her veto, and for the third time this had been upon a matter which rightly or wrongly, will be interpreted throughout Asia and Africa as being a matter in which white supremacy is in conflict with the just aspirations of the coloured people.We are in this dilemma because, first of all, we failed to bring up Southern Rhodesia and other parts of Africa, to bring up the Africans, to be able to discharge their own affairs. We did not give them sufficient education. We did not begin early enough to lead them to self-government. We have failed further because, when Liberals again and again pointed out that the policy of trying to enforce a federation on Central Africa was bound to fail, unless it had the consent of the people concerned, we could get no Tory to listen to obvious sense or to look at the obvious dangers ahead (Applause).The Prime Minister talked about the wind of change. There was, after the war, a man - and not an ignoble man - called General Mikhailovitch. He disappeared. And as he went he spoke these immortal words: \u2018The gale of the world has blown me away.\u2019 This is not a wind of change. This is a gale. Now, Liberals have said that there is a clear obligation on this country, before we hand over authority to Southern Rhodesia, to use our utmost influence and ability to ensure that the franchise of that country is widened and to maintain the Armed Forces of the Crown in the hands of the Imperial Crown.I do not believe we can get out of this situation without difficulty now. But I do believe it is a tragedy, from which we must learn, that we should be casting our veto at the United Nations in the face of African aspirations for decency. It is a tragedy, as Mr Mark Bonham Carter has said, if the impression left on Sir Roy Welensky should be that he cannot trust the British Government. I believe it is a tragedy that at this moment, when our record is so good, we should be brought up against this sort of situation by failure to act in time.Now, unless we can get people to identify themselves with their institutions and their country, and unless we can get them to take notice in time, we can say Goodbye to the chances for the ordered reforms for which Liberals stand.What should citizenship of Britain mean today? What should we create here to which people would assent, so that people will be able to say, \u2018I lived in the Sixties and Seventies and, for all my life, I shall be proud of the public life of my country\u2019­? What can we do to restore that confidence, that optimism, to draw people once again into their country\u2019­s affairs and give back power to the decent, hard-working, general British citizen? I will tell you what I think British citizenship should mean.Reviving BritainFirst, that this country gets its role in the world right. To begin with, it should be the proud boast of everyone who is entitled to claim citizenship of our Commonwealth, that they can come to this country freely, and walk its streets, as Britons (Loud applause). Secondly, few things have been more inimical to the true development of Britain than the attempt to keep up as a nuclear power with the U.S.A. and Russia, while neglecting the opportunity to play a constructive part in Europe. We lost Europe through delay. We lost Europe through failure to look into the future. Europe still needs Britain, and Britain, Europe. We must be prepared to take a political initiative. We must allay the justifiable European suspicions that we still do not yet realise that the Channel tunnel will soon be a reality.Secondly, it should mean that a citizen should have a clear political choice put before him. I have never denied that there is a place in any democratic system for Conservatism. But equally any healthy country must - and especially is this true today - have placed before it clear leadership on the progressive side of politics.It is monstrous that so little information should be supplied to the public about politics. The simplest and most obvious thing is for a television edition of Parliament daily. The next thing which is needed is that Parliament and the press, acting on behalf of the public, should be allowed to probe into the recesses of where decisions are taken, and to be informed how our civil service works and where it needs improvement.There is considerable friction between Press and politicians and that is right - that is right. And, if you doubt it for one moment, look at the fate of the Daily Herald. The House of Commons and the Press have a great interest in common. They stand, if you like, for the non-Establishment against the Establishment. They have a common interest in finding out how things are done. And whatever criticism you may make of the Press of this country, it discharges that obligation. As a politician I have said again and again that, however critical or indeed beastly it may be to politicians, it gives publicity to politics and without that publicity the House of Commons would die (Applause).At this Conference we have put forward radical proposals for the reform of Parliament, the executive and the civil service. I wonder if, indeed, Liberals appreciate just how radical those proposals would be, and how vital they are to the creation of a more satisfactory Britain.If, for instance, you set up specialist committees in Parliament to take part in the decision-making process of government, you will fundamentally change the nature of Members of Parliament. I am quite sure that neither the Labour Party, nor the Tory reformers, understand or welcome this. It is not a question of providing some more desks and pay for members, but it is a question of expecting them to do a new job to participate in the managerial side of government, and to supervise the direction of such things as the nationalised industries.I want that because I believe the functions of government have changed enormously in the last fifty years, that it is now doing all sorts of positive jobs, and has extended its range immensely. And if democracy is to answer the purposes of the people - and I know of no other role for it - it has got to bring democracy into the discharge of these new roles of government which have grown up in the last twenty years.Pursuing the general goodEqually, when this party calls for change it does not simply mean change in general, and the maintenance of the status quo in particular. That is what has so bedevilled the effort to stop inflation in this country. Everyone is against rising prices in general, but all in favour of bigger wages and higher prices for their own goods in particular (Laughter). We do not mean, when we demand a new transport system, that every branch line is going to be kept open. Our reforms are based on the need for greater participation, the association of people and their representatives in a system of government which will answer the problems of today.But, once again, let me give you a warning. If this is to be effective, a clear distinction must be drawn between those questions in which dissent is inevitable and proper, and those in which agreement should be inevitable. There are issues which must be brought to a conclusion before participation can take place.The world around us is a difficult and, in many ways, a savage place. The people of East and West Berlin are divided by a wall - one of the harshest divisions in history. They are more conscious of loathing, than of any participation with, the Communist oppressors of Eastern Germany. Negro children taken under escort to the schools in Alabama cannot be very conscious of any participation with the white society in which they live. Surely there is no greater tragedy of our times than that children who feel no scintilla of colour should be drawn in to bear the burden of their fathers\u2019­ and their mothers\u2019­ failures. They reflect, however, this basic division in the human race. In South Africa and all through the world there are many questions which have to be solved before you can have participation.In this country, there are still groups of lower-paid workers left behind in the general surge forward who have the right to dissent from the easy platitudes of the affluent society. And above all in human affairs there is a natural friction between the governors and the governed. We felt the beginning of it in this hall yesterday (Laughter and applause)This friction is very often essential to freedom and, in their justifiable emphasis on participation, Liberals must not forget that freedom lies at the root of Liberalism and freedom often entails dissent and opposition. You must not be afraid to dissent from what is evil, and it often entails opposition as well.Redistributing wealthThirdly, to be satisfactory, a society must feel some confidence in the distribution of its wealth. In this town ten days ago, the Trades Union Congress were wrapped in a serious debate about an incomes policy. Two years in Edinburgh I said that an incomes policy was inevitable in this country. We have made known our proposals for this in our pamphlet \u2018Opportunity Knocks.\u2019 We believe both that capital wealth should be more widely shared, and that the salaried workers and those in the public services should be more adequately rewarded. As for industry, apart from giving the worker a share of the profits, we believe that the state should give a lead to industry by fixing minimum wages and indicating a maximum for wages, salaries and profits, leaving room within these limits for bargaining over exact wage rates. As far as profits are concerned, our proposals for free competition and consumers\u2019­ protection, and the steps to curb speculation in land, should keep them in check. But of course profits must be brought into the general purview. If the public welfare is ignored by firms, then sanctions in the form of extra taxation should be applied. These proposals are related to a detailed programme for job-training, consultation and the more skilful use of manpower in industry. We stretch out our hands to the unions who are going our way. The forces of progress in the movement must feel the support of all progressive opinion. But an incomes policy will only be accepted in conditions of economic expansion.Fourthly, we have made our proposals for the reform of parliament, the executive and the civil service. But these proposals must be completed by reforms of the legal system.But first a word about the police. I hear people at this assembly criticising the police. Now there may be things wrong with the police. They, too, may need their organisation overhauled. But do not, I beg of you, let it go out from this Assembly that we are critical of policemen and policewomen (Applause). I have, over the experiences of the last twenty years, formed a high regard for decency, and there is no more decent body than the police of this country. If any of you get into trouble you may pray that you fall into the hands of the British police and not some of other police forces in the world.They are not very well paid. There are not too many of them. They are loaded with a multitude of jobs and they are put into some pretty exasperating circumstances.Equally, when we say we require the reform of the Civil Service, let me pay my tribute to the people who run the Post Offices, National Assistance and the Labour Exchanges of this country. They all do a decent job. They do it with humanity and with devotion; and, while we want to change the Civil Service, we are deeply conscious of the inheritance of a dedicated, incorrupt, hardworking Civil Service which we have from our forefathers.Reforming the legal systemNow a word about the reform of the legal system. Here I speak with some affection for the system, because I was trained as a barrister. It needs reform, under three heads. First, the reform of the penal system, about which we have been talking this morning. When I compare some of the sentences awarded for offences against property, and sometimes on demonstrators, with the sentences which are often given to people who beat their children half dead, I wonder just whether we have our priorities in punishment quite right.Then I draw your attention to the recruitment to the legal profession. The trades unions in this country are constantly under attack for restrictive practices. This speech now requires some courage as I look around on the platform. But the restrictive practices of the most reactionary union fade into oblivion compared with the restrictive practices of the Bar (Applause).Not only is the profession of Barrister and Advocate in this country, through the operation of our schools and educational system, largely confined to the upper-income groups, but it insists upon maintaining a closed shop which would be the envy of the most black-hearted tycoon or the most reactionary Trades Unionist. If anyone wants to take a Barrister off his circuit he has to pay an extra fee and engage in a supernumerary junior. Talk about the plumber\u2019­s mate! (Laughter) Nor have most legal offices and chambers begun to modernise themselves, or sought to make access to the law cheaper.Most important, there is a growing divorce between the people and the law in this country. Nobody gets involved in civil action if they can avoid it. If they do, they may find themselves engaged in litigation of unknown cost, conducted in archaic and unintelligible language so that you cannot find out what is going on. And at the end of it all they may have more judges on their side than against them, and lose the case.It is an axiom of British law that not only should justice be done, but should be seen to be done. It is also a justifiable boast of the British that the judiciary are independent of the executive. But the office of the Lord Chancellor is a standing negation of this. He is both a leading politician and head of the judicial system. The Attorney is put into a most difficult position when he has to appear before tribunals which may affect the reputation of the Cabinet. And further, the use of High Court judges in political matters under no satisfactorily established procedures is liable to be damaging to the whole standing of the judiciary. Liberals have pressed that at least the procedure of tribunals ought to be altered and brought up-to-date. In its present form it is not only inefficient as an enquiry, but it often does great damage to innocent individuals. We also say that the Judiciary and the legal profession must be drawn from all the nation, it must be equipped to deal with cases where the individual is in conflict with the executive, and must be seen to be absolutely free from any contact with, let alone subservience to, the Executive.I do not want to put too much stress upon a single remark or take it out of its context, but there was a judge in one case who suggested that duty to the State over-rode every other duty (Cries of \u2018Shame\u2019­). I am bound, as a citizen of this country, to dissent from that remark (Applause).The Conservatives will not set about the reforms necessary to give us a Britain of which we can be proud - this is abundantly clear from the record of the last 13 years. They have had their chance. They have failed to take it.The failure of LabourBut what of Labour as the alternative? It is true that Labour are still primarily representative of one section of the people only. It is true that they have tied round their necks a shopping list for the nationalisation of further industries. But what to my mind are more damaging to the credibility of the Labour Party as a progressive alternative in this country are two other criticisms.First, their failure to grasp the importance of just this structural reform which Liberals have stressed, and without which we shall never get the right decisions carried into effect. You have only to read the recent debate on the reform of Parliament to see that those most complacent about our Parliamentary system are to be found in the Labour Party. How are you to get the reform of industry from a party so intimately concerned with industrial vested interests? We know, from the experience of those who have lived for long under Labour local authorities, that progress in the Liberal sense is not by any means always to be found under Labour local government.Secondly, the country has a right to know where Labour stands on many wider issues than nationalisation. It was made quite clear a year ago, in this town, by Mr Gaitskell that they were opposed to this country joining Europe. Since then the Labour Party have shown no appreciation of the need for a British initiative in Europe. And, in home policy, what is their attitude towards the private enterprise system? They have lost all moral belief in Socialism. You will search in vain for any mention of nationalisation or socialism in the by-election addresses of Socialist candidates. Yet they do not seem eager to improve the competitive system. This country cannot afford a government which is evasive on this issue.To my mind we have got to make up our mind how we are going to run the economy in this country and, as far as I am concerned, the largest sector of it will be run by private enterprise. We have got to help and foster that sector, to make it efficient, assist it, and do so in the name of the people as a whole. But the Labour Party personify that most disastrous attitude. They do not want to abolish the private enterprise sector, but at the same time they will not associate themselves with it.Punching above our weightAs I regard this Conference as focused on the future, I will finish by giving you your marching orders for the campaign which will not open when Parliament is dissolved, but which is opening now, this autumn, and will not end until polling day at the General Election. We have in recent by-elections polled more votes than the Tories. We have produced before you at this Conference men of higher calibre than many Tory Ministers.Now I do not mean to indulge in any personal criticism, but in all seriousness - if you look around, you have before you Lord Ogmore, who has already discharged in the most difficult circumstances some of the highest tasks which the body politic can place upon any man. There is at this moment a contest going on for the succession to the leadership of the Tory Party. Does anyone doubt that had, by some impossible chance, Mr Frank Byers been a member of the Tory Party, that his name would have been canvassed alongside Mr Maudling, Mr Macleod, Mr Heath and anyone else you like to name in that party? (Loud applause) And if the Prime Minister is going to lay his relations on the line - well, I back mine against his! (Laughter and applause)We have lately had two Ministers of Education, Sir David Eccles and Sir Edward Boyle. Now Sir Edward in my view is a brave and able man, and I see nothing wrong in saying that about him, when he has come under public criticism for a courageous act, whether you agree with it or not. But Sir Edward, I feel sure, would not claim to be better informed about education, or to be a better presenter of the educational case, than Mr A.D.C. Peterson whom we have here at this Assembly (Applause).I could go on to mention Professor Fogarty, Professor Wheatcroft and others who have come to this rostrum. I make no wild or extravagant claim when I say they are men of equal ability, character, dedication and force to any you will find in public life today. To my mind, it is foolish to indulge too much in personalities in politics, and in particular to say that people are not fit for office. The one thing you could be certain there would be agreement about in any Tory gathering before the war, was that Mr Winston Churchill was totally unfit for office. It had nothing to do with his opinions. It was considered by the Tories that his judgement and his personal qualities made him unfit to serve this country, and efforts were even made to put up a National Liberal to get him turned out of his constituency. Let that be a lesson to us, and to those who learn from history.We shall have over 400 candidates in the field at the election. Our hat, as Lord Ogmore said, is in the ring, but there are many people who are genuinely puzzled by the effect of the Liberal campaign. Some of them may still be tempted to vote Tory or even to join the Tory Party for the sake of keeping Labour out. I ask them to reflect on the fate of those who have done this over the last 40 years. There have been plenty of rats to leave the sinking ship, but the ship has gone on and the rats have sunk (Applause).\u2018Towards the sound of gunfire\u2019­There are no more miserable spectres in our political life than the numerous varieties of National Liberals absorbed in the Tory Party. They have done that party no good. They have done politics in this country little good, and advanced the cause of Liberalism not one title. That makes us all the more welcoming to the converts who are coming back. I welcome old members like Sir Frank Medlicott, the former M.P. for Brighton, Kemptown - I say, come and join us, come and join the march forward.It may be that the brothers of the prodigal son were a little harshly treated but there is respectable authority for welcoming back the prodigal sons.The people of this country, as I have said, are entitled to have politicians who stand up and tell the people what they mean. They are entitled to have politics in which the parties stand for some principle and, without that, you will never have healthy politics in this country.One thing is certain about this election. Great interest is going to be fixed on the number of votes cast for Liberal candidates and the number of candidates returned. Even if there is not a Liberal Government, the temper of whatever government there is going to be will be validly affected by the public support given to the Liberal Party. If you want an example of how effective a Liberal vote can be, only consider the result at Orpington. Not even the crackest shot in the Tory Party has ever bagged six Cabinet Ministers with one barrel! (Loud applause)If we return after the election with a solid block of Liberals in the House of Commons, even if we do not hold a majority, we shall be able to influence the whole thinking of the country and attitude of whatever party may be in power. We have made it clear that we intend to use that influence. As the election approaches we shall not shirk the battle, nor shall we be diverted by the great volume of criticism which we hope will pour down upon us (Applause).War, delegates - war has always been a confused affair. In bygone days, the commanders were taught that when in doubt they should march their troops towards the sound of gunfire. I intend to march my troops towards the sound of gunfire (Loud applause). Politics are a confused affair and the fog of political controversy can obscure many issues. But we will march towards the sound of the guns.Our Government, for too long, has pretended not to see what it does not like. It has put the telescope to its blind eye in a very un-Nelsonian mood, so it can say that there is no enemy in sight. But, delegates, there are enemies, there are difficulties to be faced. There are decisions to be made. There is passion to be generated. The enemy is complacency and wrong values and inertia in the face of incompetence and injustice. It is against this enemy that we march (Applause). We are not alone. The reforms which we advocate are inexorably written into the future. We move with the great trends of this century. Other nations have rebuilt their institutions under the hard discipline of war. It is for Liberals to show that Britain, proud Britain, can do this as a free people without passing through the furnace of defeat (Loud applause).

aVLady Davidson, I want first to say how absolutely wonderful it is for all of us here to have you presiding over this final session of the Conference. Your typical approach and stimulating introduction have reflected the high spirits of this Conference which are obvious to us all. We thank you for the start you have given to us for our final session. We would like to say \u2018Thank You\u2019 for the splendid record of service which you and your husband have given so unstintingly to our Party. It is nearly half a century of service. I have to confess to you, Lady Davidson, that my early recollections of your entry into politics are slightly hazy. All I can say is that they are very much clearer than those of the present Chairman of the Party, who was not even born at that time!It is a great pleasure to have Lord Davidson with us today, because he is part of our Party\u2019s history. Ill though he is, we are glad that he has been able to come and give us that sense of continuity of our Party in all its activities during these past decades. So together we express to you our intense gratitude. Thank you for the welcome you have just given to me. We miss you from the House of Commons, because you were always our guide and friend. There was no need for us to adopt the present method of the Labour Party and have a lady in the Whips\u2019 Office; there you always were, to look after us. I hope it will not be misunderstood if I say that to all of us - and especially my generation - you were indeed our mother.Many happy things have happened to me this week, for which I want to thank you all. There have been many kindnesses, which I have greatly appreciated, and other things as well. I found in my Daily Mirror yesterday - I read it avidly, as no doubt you always do - that the barbers of West Bromwich had banded together and come to the conclusion that, seen from the back, my haircut was the best in the country. I can only apologise to you all that this splendid panorama has been reserved for the members of the National Executive Committee.We have got to know each other well, and this is all-important in our political life. To come and be here at the Conference throughout has been of immense help to me, and perhaps, Madam President, Sir Max and Sir Clyde, who have done so much to make this Conference a success, I may express the hope that the invitation to the leader to be present may become part of the permanent pattern of our Party Conference. I think it will mean a new relationship between the Party as a whole and the Party at this Conference, lacking, I hope, nothing of the past but also being in tune with the times today. It has been a good Conference. Just think of all those fellows in Transport House with their eyes glued to the television screen, just to see that everybody was being fair to us and fair to them.It has been a good Conference, and at Bexley, my own constituency, a fortnight ago - I had to get a plug in somewhere - I asked that this Conference should face facts realistically, frankly and courageously. Madam President, that is what we have done. We have done it to an even greater degree than I ever dared to hope.Just look back over those splendid speeches from the hall: frank, honest, sometimes critical. Gone are the days of praise and platitudes - well, almost gone! A little praise is very agreeable sometimes, and the speeches from the platform show that I am right to be proud of the splendid team we have heard during the whole of this Conference. They are men of great experience: Mr. Maudling, the Deputy Leader of our Party, always at my right hand and by my side; Sir Alec Douglas-Home, a man of great experience with a wealth of negotiating experience; Iain Macleod; Enoch Powell; Peter Thorneycroft; Sir Keith Joseph; Tony Barber; and the other members of the Front Bench who have spoken; and Sir Edward Boyle, who not only spoke here during the Conference but addressed a great gathering of 2,000 people at CPC. It was a great intellectual gathering which had come to listen to what, I am told, was a very detailed, sustained argument about forecasting, or indicative planning, as it is technically known. This interested me greatly. I somehow feel that indicative planning is not really endemic in the British character. The forecast for the night of the CPC meeting - broadcast far and wide in every hotel - was heavy rain. Yet 2,000 people came to this hall without a single umbrella between them. It only shows that weather forecasts themselves are not enough. Somebody has got to do something about it. Then there were the younger members of the Front Bench: Margaret Thatcher, Peter Walker, David Price. They also made admirable speeches.Did I really hear it said at Blackpool that Mr. Wilson, looking at the Government, said that man for man they could more than match us, more than match this team? Look again, Mr. Wilson, look again.He had better look at some of the others as well. I will not mention their names; it would not mean anything to you. I will mention their Departments. What about the Minister of Transport in the present Labour Government? He has done absolutely nothing to alleviate our traffic problems, but he is the only Minister who produces jam today as well as promising jam tomorrow.Then there is the President of the Board of Trade. Poor Mr. Jay - reduced to carrying George Brown\u2019s bags to international conferences. When there is good news, that is; when there is bad news he has to open the bag and read it himself.And Mr. Willey, the Minister landed without any natural resources. And the Postmaster General, Wedgwood Benn, that would-be whiz kid who always gets the wrong number - even when adding up his election expenses.But there is one matter which is beyond a joke, and that is the Minister of Technology. In Londonderry a fortnight ago I challenged him to stand up and be counted, separate from the block vote, straightaway. I said, \u2018Resign as General Secretary of your Union or resign as Minister because you cannot do both with honour.\u2019 But he has not stood up to be counted. So I ask Mr. Wilson when he is going to restore the collective responsibility of his own Cabinet. Unless he does so, and until he does so, the whole country knows that despite the fine words, he is too weak himself even to deal with Mr. Cousins.Now to return to our own Conference. On Wednesday I called for a change of mood, that we should put the emphasis on individual effort and enterprise, on the importance of choice for us all, on the need for freedom and independence to stand on our own feet. The outstanding thing about this Conference in Brighton this week has been that the mood is already changing. It is clear here in this Conference. It is a mood, too, of realism. Let me affirm that to the eyes of the world which are upon us.Our task is to change the mood of the country as a whole. We know our line of advance. Let us see that other people do. Let us heed the wise, stimulating words of our young Chairman, who has just been speaking to you. We have presented and discussed our policies. We know them. Let us see that everyone else does. Let that be our resolve as we leave this Conference.Realism, I said. We are realistic. What a contrast with Blackpool. Did you notice that George Brown in one of his happier moods said, \u2018This has been a great year for Britain.\u2019 A great year for Britain? Do we really read it aright? Where has he been living all this time? Has it been a great year for industry? The longest period of 7 per cent bank rate since 1921. The toughest credit squeeze since the twenties. Investment and modernisation programmes curtailed. Costs rising and production static. A great year for agriculture? The farmers, whom I am getting to know better and better, thought the weather was the biggest hazard they had ever had until they met this Government. Was it a great year for education, with the building programmes: universities, the technical colleges, colleges of education - the CATS - all severely cut? A great year for motorists, with the road programme slowed down? For the taxpayers, with taxes going up more than at any time since the last Labour Chancellor of the Exchequer? For the householders, with rates higher than ever before? For the \u2018young marrieds\u2019 with many home loan schemes closed down and with mortgage rates higher than for twenty years? Was it a great year for all of them?Oh yes, I remember well that Mr. Wilson came to London and made a great speech, and said: \u2018We shall provide specially favourable interest rates\u2019 for those who are going to buy their own homes. He referred to a 4 per cent rate. Nothing specific - nothing in small print even, but just the implication - 4 per cent. This was enough to bring George Brown rushing down from the North to my own constituency, and what did he say? He implied that what he had in mind was 3 per cent. At any moment I expected to be overwhelmed by Jim Callaghan coming down and saying \u20182 per cent.\u2019We have the highest mortgage rates since 1945, and prices rising faster than for years - and what did George Brown say here? \u2018We will tackle the problem of rising prices at the roots.\u2019 Well - he did; he manured the roots.Was it a good year for sterling - under threat for eleven months and supported by £1,100 million of additional debt? They sat there waiting for something to turn up, and in August, when another £1,000 million standby turned up, they preened themselves on having found the solution to our problems. A great year, indeed!Yes, it has been a great year for the public relations men, stimulated by keen competition from the Prime Minister. It is the only competition in which he is really interested. He has his army of \u2018admen\u2019 in the basement - they must be getting pretty close to the bottom of the barrel now, looking for the glowing terms with which Mr. Wilson can pat himself on the back \u2013 \u2018a dynamic Government,\u2019 \u2018a purposive Government,\u2019 \u2018an honest Government,\u2019 \u2018a frank Government,\u2019 \u2018a Government imbued with the Dunkirk spirit,\u2019 and \u2018a Government with guts.\u2019 What self-adulation - and the latest word is \u2018gritty.\u2019 It goes back to David Lloyd George - sand in the works.What is their defence for all these broken promises, for the blunders, for the incompetence and for the very high debts? The so-called £800 million deficit. Let us deal with this once and for all. It is time the people of this country recognised the truth, and it is very relevant to the judgment of last year, 1964, and it is very relevant to those of you who from the hall in our debates on policy and economic affairs asked us questions about the management of the economy next time.Mr Wilson\u2019s favourite trick is bitterly to attack those whom he accuses of selling sterling short. I will tell you the name of the man who in the past year has done far more than any other to sell sterling short: that is Harold Wilson himself. He did it by his politically-motivated exaggeration of the £800 million so-called deficit. We have suffered enough from this lie, and we must suffer no more. Let us look at it.Of the £750 million overall deficit, £350 million was British investment overseas - solid assets like the Shell share in the Italian petrochemical industry. Those are assets of which Mr. Wilson is proud to boast when he travels abroad. Of the remainder, another £100 million was due to aid for the developing countries - and we in the Conservative Party are not ashamed of that, and we were always pressed to do more by the Labour Opposition.But there was a gap, and I will tell you why. It was because during 1963 and 1964 the Conservative Government, under Mr. Maudling\u2019s guidance, was deliberately trying to break out of the cycle of recession and expansion which we had experienced since the war: a stable expansion, more modernisation, greater competition, intensive regional redevelopment - all these together formed a coherent policy. And, as part of this expansion, we forecast a high level of imports in 1964. They were needed for our expansion, but they were higher because of stockpiling from fear of the restrictions which a new Labour Government might impose on our manufacturers. And by our policies we were encouraging exports to rise to catch up with our imports.And, of course, the myth about this has been exploded by the Labour Government themselves. It has been exploded in their own National Plan - page 69, chapter 7, subsection 4. Go and read it, Mr. Brown, go and read it, and you will find there a fairer balance set out of the situation. It acknowledges and accepts all these facts, and demolishes the myth of the White Paper of 26th October of last year.Let me remind you that Mr. Wilson himself supported this policy. Indeed, Labour, pressed us to expand faster. And on this policy of a steady expansion depended many of our hopes for the future, But what have the Government always done? They have always accused Mr. Maudling and our Government of refusing to take necessary action last year because of electoral considerations, refusing to take advice to deal with the economy. In fact, Mr. Maudling put up Bank Rate in January. He put another £100 million on the Budget in April. There is not one word of truth in the accusation that advice from any quarter to act was refused or rejected, and certainly never for electoral considerations.But Mr. Wilson put political interest before the national interest. He broke the confidence on which our expansion depended. What mock horror he shows now at the state of affairs he says he found when he took office. What he forgets is that five weeks before the Election he accurately predicted the trade position. What he forgets is that two weeks after the Election he himself officially stated there was no need for measures of restriction. At the same time, he knew that the deficit this year was going to be halved - he was told so, and he said so in his own White Paper. Plus is no new discovery as a result of the Government\u2019s policies of the past year. There were seven weeks when they knew the position, seven weeks when they said it was manageable. The crisis only came after their exaggeration and their muddle. The mess was created by Messrs. Wilson, Brown and Callaghan - messers indeed.This Conference will be remembered for our policy document, Putting Britain Right Ahead. What we have done here is to work together on our action plans for the next Conservative Government. These plans you can put to the people. There are five of them which I wish to put before you to sum up our discussions.First, our action plans to give all those who have already retired individual care and attention.Second, our plans to give all those who retire in the future the real security for themselves and their families of a pension which can really be called their own.Third, our plans for helping the young marrieds to find a home of their own, and a home at a reasonable price.Fourth, our plans to ensure that the earner enjoys the prosperity that he himself, and only he himself, will be creating.Fifth, our plans for giving the customer, whether the motorist or the commuter, the hospital patient or the housewife, better service and, above all, steadier prices.All of these plans derive their strength from the two great driving forces of modern Conservatism. First, our belief in the virtue of a property-owning democracy, which Iain Macleod elaborated in his speech here. What does it mean? For us, it means three things: a home owning democracy, a share-owning democracy, and a pension-owning democracy. The other force, which has been emphasised time and again at this Conference, is our belief in the individual, the man and the woman, the individual as taxpayer and as a member of a trade union, the individual in the school and in old age, the individual at work and at play. Here, all around us, as well as in the rest of our country, we see the immense richness of diversity of individual character and personality and, let it be said, often eccentricity, which is the great source of our strength as a nation. It is this which we must nourish.This Conference will be remembered, too, as you, Sir Max, recalled, for the debate on Rhodesia, in which passionate feelings were expressed with reason and in which the Conference reached a firm and clear decision. There were two young men yesterday who, I think this Conference will agree, showed great courage in the speeches which they made. One of them was Jonathan Aitken, son of a dear friend of many of us here, Bill Aitken, who, alas, died so recently - but with whose great uncle, I am afraid, I sometimes disagreed. His was a remarkable speech.I wish to say a few words about Rhodesia. Last Saturday I saw Mr. Smith. I did so only after the negotiations between the two Governments had broken down. My main object was to find some means of re-starting the dialogue between the two Governments, of seeing that the negotiations continued. We could not leave the British Government to sit in Whitehall and Mr. Smith to go off to Salisbury, possibly to take the drastic step of a unilateral declaration of independence. I did not believe that this could possibly be allowed to remain where it was.Later that night, we saw Mr. Wilson. As a result of the points we raised, there was a further meeting between Mr. Wilson and Mr. Smith on Monday, and I was glad of it. Later that evening, I issued a statement, after the meeting of the Shadow Cabinet, urging further negotiations. On the Tuesday, Mr. Wilson made the proposal for a Commonwealth Mission. It may seem strange to some that, if such a proposal were going to be made, it was not discussed with Mr. Smith when he was in London. But at least it means that another method of keeping negotiations open is being examined.The position the last British Government took up, which has been followed by the present Opposition, was clearly stated yesterday by Sir Alec Douglas-Home. A unilateral declaration of independence would be invalid. Its impact would have the gravest consequences. The whole Commonwealth, the old members of the Commonwealth as well as the new, have made that abundantly plain. In these two respects the present Government\u2019s policy has followed ours, but the handling of the negotiations is the Government\u2019s responsibility alone. They have not, and cannot have, a blank cheque from us on that. We are free to criticise the conduct of the negotiations, and, if I may say so, the Government themselves need to look again at the psychology of their handling of these negotiations and their relations with Rhodesia.To all our citizens in this country, in these very difficult moments, I would say how greatly I deplore the use by anyone of the emotive words, words like \u2018treason\u2019 and \u2018traitors,\u2019 which can do nothing whatever to help to bring a solution to this problem. As an Opposition we shall concentrate all our efforts on securing a solution by negotiation.This Conference made it abundantly clear yesterday that the overwhelming majority present wish to do nothing to prejudice that. This is why it overwhelmingly supported the Resolution. As your Leader, I bear an immense responsibility in this matter. With my colleagues I shall continue to discharge it, knowing that you have given us your confidence. Today, at the end of this eventful week everyone here prays that there will be no unilateral declaration of independence by Rhodesia. We pray that with all our hearts. Our views are known to the British Government, and, on behalf of us all, I should like to send this solemn message to Mr. Smith and his colleagues: \u2018We believe that a middle way must be found. If there are still thoughts of unilateral action, then turn back from the brink.\u2019In that debate yesterday, and throughout the week, many of you spoke of the consequences, for good or ill, of change. We are just twenty years since the end of the Second World War. There is no particular magic in that figure, but a whole generation has now come to manhood who knew nothing of it, and those of us who did now realise how far off it all is. To my generation, who had just reached manhood before the last war, how different the situation is. Some of us were born along this coast, looking across the Channel always towards Europe, loving our country and outward-looking. Then we used to take our chance without any money to get across to Europe and to wander round and see it. Why? Because Europe still then, and only twenty-five or thirty years ago, was the hub of power in the world as a whole; it was the centre of affairs still as it had been for centuries. Then it all changed. Now today this is a time, twenty years after that cataclysm, when men\u2019s minds are again beginning to question so many of the things they have since taken for granted; to question the things in their daily lives, in their jobs, in their families and in their country. This is happening all over the world where people are trying now to find a fresh equilibrium. Even in the year since the last election this process has moved apace. The first practical steps have been taken towards nuclear weapons in China. We have seen the polarisation of the Sino-Soviet conflict. For us in some ways the most important of all, we see the changing balance between the two sides of the Atlantic. Whether it is in trade, in industrial goods or in farm produce, whether it is in the international financial arrangements, whether it is in the defence of the west as a whole, the old arrangements are being questioned and new ones have to be worked out.How different the situation was when these arrangements were first made. Europe was weak then, and across the Atlantic they were powerful. They gave generously of their strength, and as a result Europe today is rebuilt, prosperous and flourishing in trade and finance. The more clearly the changing balance between the two sides of the Atlantic is understood, then the greater are our chances of redressing the balance without friction between friends. It is in this position today that I want Britain to be able to exert her influence.I want again to have a British policy. I do not want this in any nasty nationalistic sense; I want it in order to be able to perform our duty internationally as we do here, with the traditions of centuries and she experiences of ages, to do our duty as we see it. I want us to do our duty in the Western Alliance, in Europe, in the Commonwealth and the developing countries as a whole. Alas, today this Government has neither the power nor the will to pursue such a policy; overburdened with debt it is inhibited from pursuing effective action. Therefore, it is we who must pursue a British policy.What we have to do now is to carve out a new place for Britain in the world, carve it out without nostalgia, without bitterness and without regret, but with imagination, skill and with determination. That is what our discussions this week have been about. Change has been constantly on our lips. Change in attitudes, change in skills, change in policies, and in people. But the change most necessary is a change in Government.In this world where the constant need is to understand change, the Labour Party today, as we see them, have all the wrong attributes. Why? Because they consist of one part revolutionaries and three parts stand-patters. They are revolutionary optimists wishing to march back into the 19th century to the time of the birth of their doctrine. They are evolutionary pessimists finding every conceivable argument why day-to-day change should not take place. They are rooted in vested interest. They are avid for the status quo. It is no paradox, strange though it may seem, that in a period of rapid change like this, what the nation needs is leadership from a progressive and modern Conservative Party, for it is only we Conservatives who will get moving and seize the opportunities which exist for us as a country. It is only we Conservatives who will act, and it is only we Conservatives who will remember and care, as change goes on, for the individuals - and there are always many who find it difficult and uncomfortable. Above all, it is only the Conservatives who will have the foresight and the sense of history to keep and protect those elements which are fundamental and valuable in our society, to keep the things which make this country the place where we want to live.The moral of this is plain. We must regain power, but power has to be won. We must work to bring it back. There is no easy way. I did not disguise this when I became your leader. It must be clear to every one of us here at this Conference. Once again, it is the efforts of the individual men and women which count. Let us face this fact realistically. The Government today is still on trial by the people of this country. But we also know that the day of reckoning will soon come. It will come when the people of this country find that words are no substitute for deeds; that publicity is no substitute for policies; and that gimmicks are no substitute for government. We here, every one of us, and those whom we represent in our constituencies can bring that day nearer. We do so as we capture the hearts and the minds of our fellow citizens by our own personal influence one upon another. You, Madam Chairman, with all your long experience of politics, will know that that is in fact the only way. But great is the prize. It is to guide the destinies of Britain in this ever-changing world. It is that upon which we set our hearts here at this Conference today. It is that prize and nothing less which together we will win.

aVMr President, I must first say to you what an enormous pleasure it is for all of us at the last session of this great Conference to have you presiding over our gathering. I am giving away no secrets when I say that you have always been a Conference favourite, and you have been so because all of us have admired immensely both your capacity for carrying out the most arduous and difficult tasks in Government and the courage with which you always saw them through. All of us here want to thank you for the many years of hard work you have carried out for our Party and for everything which you are still doing for us in the House of Commons and also here - which is so important - in the North-West. We are deeply grateful to you.This has been a very heartening Conference for us all, and I, as leader of the Party, may, perhaps, take this opportunity to thank the whole of the National Union for organising the Conference here in Blackpool. Also, I thank - I do so personally, but I know you will want to join with me - all of my colleagues in the Shadow Cabinet, and some from outside, who have made such admirable, splendid, vigorous, informative, stimulating speeches at the end of each debate. I have listened now to a good many Conference speeches over the last 15 years, and I cannot recall a Conference at which so many of the winding-ups have been of such a high standard as we have had during the past week.In those words of thanks, inadequate as they are, I join my own for the work which all my colleagues are doing throughout the year in the Shadow Cabinet and in our Party in the House of Commons, as well as tramping up and down the country carrying our flag and speaking for our cause. My thanks are sincere and very grateful.Mr. President, you have summed up for us the atmosphere of this Conference. It seems to me it has been serious-minded, that it has been determined, that it has been taking the long view, and above all that we have shown ourselves to be confident. In fact, I would sum up by saying we leave Blackpool today buoyant and united. That is my report to our Party up and down the country on this Conference.However, last year on 18th October the leader of the Labour Party also gave a progress report to his Conference on the first year of Labour Government, and he went on to say, \u2018A year from today I confidently look forward to submitting to the Labour movement an even more encouraging progress report.\u2019That report, Mr. President, is due in three days\u2019 time, but as so often happens there seems to have been a leak. As the Speaker of the House of Commons would say, \u2018For the sake of greater accuracy, I have obtained a copy.\u2019It starts off with this heading: \u2018Members of the Labour Party, Comrades.\u2019 Well, you will see in present circumstances it therefore has a somewhat limited distribution. It begins: \u2018We have maintained full employment - in the Cabinet.\u2019 It goes on: \u2018George Brown announced that he was declaring himself redundant but we devised a scheme of work sharing; we spread the work, Comrades, but we all keep the top pay. Comrades, we are raising our productivity - in the Cabinet: a budget in March, a budget in May, a budget in July. It is true, Comrades, that at this last election we produced only half as many promises as in 1964, but, Comrades, we have broken them in a third of the time. Comrades, we have introduced a proper Socialist discrimination against unproductive services. We have achieved this by a large, continuing, purposive expansion of the Civil Service. Comrades, we are nationalising steel and land and the trade unions. Comrades, we have put prices up; you will hold wages down. Comrades, we have rejected the defeatist doctrine of stop-go: go has gone, gone for good.\u2019 It ends, \u2018Farewell, Comrades.\u2019Enough of that, because although this has been a grim year for our country, yet having listened to this Conference what you would really like is for me this morning to look forward rather than back. I want to take as my theme the great divide which separates the parties today in so many ways, and I want to take with it as well the theme of the greater unity for which we all ought to work in this country as a whole.We have reached this year what I first called in the House of Commons the Great Divide, and at this Conference the differences have become clearer, they have been sharpened. But this is not for the sake of creating differences. It is because these differences represent the different characteristics, the different approach of Toryism and Socialism in the modern world. The Great Divide between freedom and compulsion represents perhaps the widest, the most dramatic gulf between Conservatism and Socialism today, but that is not the only example of the Great Divide. There is the next one, over how we can rescue this country from its economic difficulties. There is the divide over the determination, the very will to tackle the nation\u2019s economic and industrial problems; the divide how to give real security to those who are in need; the divide on how to advance the hopes and aspirations of those who want better education for their children, better homes for their families, better jobs for themselves. There is now, alas, a dear divide between the parties as to how to bring to an end the Rhodesian tragedy. Even since we debated it in this hall and we heard Reggie Maudling\u2019s moving and magnificent speech, the Government has sent to Salisbury an emissary with what they describe as \u2018final terms.\u2019 Mr. President, you know this better than anybody, with all your great experience of negotiations: how could any Government really desiring a settlement be so foolish as to send a man with what they define as \u2018final terms\u2019? There remains the Great Divide that separates us from the leaders of the Labour Party, the divide over the genuine desire to go into Europe. These, then, are the issues which are raised between us today, and let no one say that these differences between the parties do not matter.This has been a serious Conference because we have been wrestling, as we often had to wrestle in Government, with solutions or the real problems of ordinary men and women, and we know and share their fears and anxieties because many of them are the fears and anxieties of us in this hail today, those who are still trying to find homes, those who are worried about their children\u2019s education, those who are worried about their Health Service and the service they are getting, those who are worried about the future when they retire, those who are worried about their country when they see it slipping in the world, when they see it in debt, when they see its influence disappearing. These are our fellow citizens and they are worried, but above all they are worried by the nagging fear of redundancy, of short time working of smaller pay packets, hire purchase commitments, and above all worried about losing their jobs.This, Mr. President, is going to be a cruel, hard winter for many people whom I met in Scotland, whom I met in Wales and whom I met in South West England and whom I met here in Blackpool and the many like them in the seaside resorts of this country - a cruel hard winter because of the Selective Employment Tax. We always said that if we were going to recover our prosperity and our stability, then some deflation was necessary and change to new industries would involve short-term unemployment. We said it boldly and courageously at the last Election. We still stand by it. \u2018Change\u2019 has suddenly become a very fashionable word. Over ten years ago Angus Maude and others of the group to which I once belonged in One Nation, wrote a book called Change is our Ally. Enoch, who spoke yesterday afternoon, was one of the main contributors. Change is our Ally we said, but for Mr. Wilson, who now produces the word \u2018change\u2019 on every possible occasion, change is not an ally but an alibi. An alibi for the errors and failures of the last two years.As Iain Macleod said yesterday in his brilliant speech, anyone who has been Minister of Labour, who knows these problems and has to handle these problems, hates unemployment. It is unavoidable sometimes, as I have described, but what I hate more than anything now is the unemployment which is being caused because the Government failed to act in time. More may he caused now because they have to take action which is much harder and harsher than it would have been before.This is the thesis I want to put to you. This is the argument which I want to put before this serious Conference. The whole basis of the Labour Party\u2019s policies and doctrines and their actions in the last two Election campaigns were that they had the answer to the problem of how to increase our national wealth rapidly. They said that they could get away from Stop Go. On this depended their economic policy and their social policies. On it they won two Elections. What is now absolutely clear is that with even the most optimistic forecast for the next three years, what the Labour Government achieves, if it survives for five years, will certainly be less than what we achieved in our last five years of Conservative Government. These facts are beyond dispute and at once they destroy the myth that the Labour Party could do better than we have done, that there was some quick, easy shortcut to prosperity without anybody having to trouble himself. Well, they cannot do better than we have done. They have failed. There are some people who draw the conclusion that what we have seen is the failure of the free enterprise system. There are many in important positions and many who comment on our affairs who either consciously or unconsciously have come to that conclusion and are writing it and saying so. They, therefore, say that the Government\u2019s move to controls and compulsion is inevitable. Then they go on to say: therefore, it is justifiable.Mr. President, I repudiate absolutely the conclusion that this is the failure of the free enterprise system. I repudiate absolutely that it is inevitable and I repudiate completely that it is in any way justifiable. This has been the failure of Socialist economic policy. There was inflation through mounting Government expenditure. They thought that they could control it by voluntary means, which could not possibly succeed in those circumstances, and, of course, some of them sought it to help to win the Election. It has been their failure to manage the free enterprise system, but then how could they? They do not understand its psychology or its motivation, they do not know what makes it tick and, above all, they do not believe in the free enterprise system. That is the real failure, and those who say that because the Labour Government has not been able to manage a free enterprise economy, then abolish the free enterprise system, how foolish they are. Surely the answer is not to abolish the free enterprise system, but to do away with a Labour Government?The nation as a whole, many of our fellow citizens feeling bewildered, is desperately seeking a way out of its present difficulties. Some of our fellow citizens are still looking for a simple trick such as Mr. Wilson offered them in 1964. Mr. President, I must say again that there is no easy way out. There is no simple solution. There is no short cut to a solution of our nation\u2019s problems. Therefore, and I say this to the country as a whole, it having been shown conclusively that the other major Party in the state has no simple easy solution, let us all, as one people, in national unity at least agree about this, namely, that there is no short cut. The answer will only be found by a combination of measures based on the energy, the hard work, the skill and the enterprise of every single man and woman in this country.So contrast our approach. Our approach is to say, \u2018How can we enable the free enterprise system to work better?\u2019 \u2018How can we enable it to be more fruitful?\u2019 \u2018How can we enable it to achieve those things which we all want to see?\u2019 The Conservative Party is the Party of free enterprise and let us be proud of it. We accept the obligations which this places upon us, an obligation to understand the nature of modern capitalism and what is required of it. Of course, the changes in technology, about which Ernest Marples talked with such wit and humour, the growing size of our factories and our plants, the cost of these great projects - all of this has changed capitalism today compared with what it was even ten years ago. Therefore, there will be changes in the structure of our industries and firms, differences in size, in manning, in the number of men and women required, in their skills, their education and their training in new techniques as larger markets will mean short-term problems of transition. It is, I believe, the job of the Government to help industry to overcome these problems and to help modern capitalism to work. I sum it up in this way: our task is to remove the obstructions which exist, wherever they may be, to enterprise and competition in our business world. That, then, is our approach - enable it to work better by tackling the fundamental obstructions and obstacles.However, today everything is frozen - not just wages, production, productivity, investment, even redeployment. In fact, almost all progress is frozen; and the Government turn to us and ask what should they do. They have no answers themselves. I shall briefly tell them some of the things which they ought to do.I have said that they have almost entirely frozen the redeployment which they say is the purpose of the whole of their measures. Very well; men who want to move cannot change houses because they cannot deal with the mortgage for buying the new house because no one can come into their house because they cannot get a mortgage. This is the practical problem of dealing with policies of this kind; they have made no preparations. Very well, then, let them take special and, if necessary, discriminatory action in order to deal with this problem.There are quite insufficient training facilities in this country to enable men to be trained for fresh skills and change their jobs. Very well then, do not let the Government sit there supine; let them produce a crash training programme; use the resources which are available in our firms; make extra use of the resources available in our educational institutions. Let them make a special call on the abilities of our firms and our teachers in order to meet what is a national requirement; and let them make it speedily.And, then, genuine productivity agreements which help the men and help our country - let them exempt these from the present arrangements; they ought to have done so long ago. As soon as possible, let them get back to men and employers carrying out their legal obligations, and let them make agreements enforceable on both sides and not only on the employer\u2019s.Now, those were three proposals which I put to the Trades Union Congress when they were in conference. How foolish of people to say this was an incitement to the Trades Union Congress to defy the Government or break the law; there was no law to be broken - it was a voluntary agreement; and the Trades Union Congress is just as entitled to try to influence the Government as anyone else. And we as a Party are perfectly entitled to put forward our proposals which we believe are sensible for the industry and the trade unions of this country. Indeed, if the Government had adopted these policies, then the economy (if it had been run properly as well) would not have been facing its present troubles, and the voluntary system would not have broken down.I shall give you a programme. There are now left nine months under which the Government\u2019s first order in the wage freeze runs. I shall give you a programme for nine months to start to get our basic economic affairs right. It is based, firstly, on confidence; it is based, secondly, on competition; and it is based, thirdly, on constructive trade unions.There is one thing which would restore confidence not in nine months, but in nine seconds - for the Prime Minister to announce tonight that he is abandoning the nationalisation of steel. Instead of seeing that dreary measure dragging its way through the House of Commons, I give you a programme to replace that.Let them run the economy, as Iain Macleod said yesterday, on the basis that you have the number of vacancies only equalling the number of men available to fill them. Let us pass a Bill to do a genuine reform of company law and not the half-baked proposals which we have had so far from the Government. Let us have a Bill to stop up the holes in the Restrictive Practices Act, and create greater competition. Let us have a Bill to help the shoppers, both in the hours in which they can shop and with better information to help the housewife buy wisely and well, not turning her into a snooper for Mr. Stewart when he requires. Let us set up a new machinery to help the small firm to grow and to prosper into one of the great firms which will be the foundation of our future prosperity. Let us have a really vigorous policy of regional development, not a facade to cover up the fact that the Selective Employment Tax is damaging every region in the country, as is also their new investment allowances. Let us have the creation of more growth points in these areas where the resources are available. Above all, let us have a budget - a budget next April based not on penalties again but on incentives to every man and woman in the country.We can tell them what ought to go into it. First of all, abolish the Selective Employment Tax; that is the first thing they have got to do. Let them make the tax system comprehensible; that would be helpful. Let them restore to our businessmen the sort of encouragement in investment allowances which we gave them. But it is no use giving men greater and greater investment allowances if they cannot get the money for the investment itself. This is one fundamental problem with which they have got to deal. Then, let us undo the damage which was caused to small companies by the Corporation Tax and the Capital Gains Tax, which we fought in 1965. A budget which once again makes our company taxation reward the fittest and not the fattest.Let us give new encouragement to people to save. But, most important of all, a budget which will start the job of making it once again worthwhile for men and women to work harder and to earn more.I come to my third, and I believe most important, theme \u2013 constructive trade unions. Some people - even some members of our Party - have welcomed the fact (and even appear pleased) that what has been ore of the main problems in the last twenty years (the pressure on wages of trade unions and the inflation which followed) should have been dealt with by what I might term \u2018the Government just knocking the trade unions over the head,\u2019 dealing with it through fines and imprisonment. I take no pleasure from this; indeed, it saddens me deeply.I have already warned that this is not only a question of the trade unions. This leads on to the controlled economy and to the control of the businessman \u2013 one or two of whom may perhaps be pleased - it leads to the control of investment and controls right through the economy. That means that we shall then find the citizen sinking to subterfuge, the black market rackets, the petty crime, and everything that we know from experience which goes along with controls and regulations and the controlled economy.I therefore say to you here today that this way of dealing with the problem is not the Conservative way, and let those who may be pleased with it not call themselves \u2018Conservatives.\u2019What I do want to put forward is the choice which now faces the trade unions because this is a matter which is going to be debated up and down the land in these coming months. They can continue to go along the way they are going. If I am frank, I say that I see very little chance of going any other way with the present Labour Government, or they can choose our way. We have put it forward in Putting Britain Right Ahead. We put it forward at the last election. Our approach is this: what we need is a new framework based on law which will be suitable for trade unionism in the modern world, and within that framework the trade unions themselves shall be able to carry on all their proper activities in freedom. That is our approach.What we have seen in these last few years is that the whole balance of our economic activities has been upset. When that occurs in any form of human life, in any of our activities, there are two courses open. Of course, the natural one for the Socialists is to say, \u2018We must control it.\u2019 For us the natural answer is to say, \u2018We must right the balance and then men and women can continue in freedom.\u2019Ours is not the easy way out. In some ways it is much easier to have done what the Government has done. In fact, they were not prepared to reform trade union law. They set up a Royal Commission which is still waiting for the evidence from the TUC. Ours is not the easy way out. It demands courage. But our proposals do show a respect for the place which the trade union movement holds in our national life today. Indeed, I believe it is a compliment to the trade union movement, it is a mark of our respect for them, a recognition of the importance of their place in our national life, that we should believe in giving the highest priority to creating a new, modern framework in which they can carry on all their activities for the benefit of the country as a whole.Of course, so much of this is based on human relations, but it is also based on law; and just as Parliament never hesitates to legislate for the corporate life of the company, and to safeguard the individual rights of its shareholders, so in the same way, in my view, Parliament should never hesitate to legislate for the corporate life of the trade unions and to safeguard the individual rights of all their members.But of course this, too, would involve change, and the unions in this arrangement must be prepared to deal with the problems of the restrictions on the shop floor, the demarcation disputes, the rules restricting output, the rules restricting entry. There is room for all who can acquire new skills. We need it. We need it desperately. So I hope that we shall find the trade unions choosing the way of moving into modern times, with a modern legislative framework rather than taking the other way out of becoming more and more out of touch with modern life and finding that the Government is taking over more and more of their rightful functions.So, Mr. President, I believe that what I have said puts forward a programme, not in detail - that is not our task - but of the main lines which this Government ought to follow today.But there is one major vital matter on which finally I want to speak: Europe. We have heard the announcement. I must confess it did not disrupt our conference that Mr. Wilson is to have another Chequers weekend on Europe. I must say my heart fell at the very mention of another Chequers weekend. There on TV we shall see innumerable pictures of the long, sleek limousines pouring into Chequers, the long lines of black, sleek policemen all guarding them outside, and from it will come what unforeseeable disaster?Mr. President, the time has come when this Government must declare itself clearly and firmly on Europe. We have done so. We fought the last election on it. Sir Alec, in his speech yesterday so highly praised by everyone here and in the Press today, dealt clearly and forcibly and persuasively with the position of the European policy. Europe today is restless; Europe wants to know where the British Government stands. Our friends in the Community are restless and want to know. Our trading partners and allies, some of them in the European Free Trade Association, feel the strain of being in their present position with Great Britain. They have the strain of the surcharges. They have the strain of the vacillation of the British Government. The Government must make its position clear. The Community is moving apace to its final state. It will be in that final state by the time that any British Government will be able to negotiate with it.Certain fundamental facts follow from this which the British Government today must recognise and they are these, that they or any other member who wishes to join will have to accept the European Economic Community as it is for itself. The time has long passed, to my regret, when any member could expect to influence the Community from its outside in its basic beliefs and its basic organisation. So the British Government must recognise that there are some things on which there can be negotiations and others which have got to be accepted; and that includes the Treaty of Rome, the Common Tariff, the agricultural policy, and the institutions. We negotiated arrangements for the Commonwealth. Of course we hope that all of those special arrangements will remain. We believe that they should. There will have to be transitional arrangements negotiated for the change over of a great country like ourselves to a member of the Community. But it is no use any longer Mr. Brown and his friends asking for special privileges in the European Economic Community. It is true that the Six members gave them to themselves, but they were the founder members and, rightly or wrongly, their view now is that that period is over and the privileges are no longer to be extended.Then it is no use either members of the Government travelling Europe and travelling the world saying that the will to go into the European Community exists. It is no use them saying that unless they are prepared to take the decisions I have outlined. Only when they show that they will accept that as a basis of European membership for Britain can they say that they have the will to carry this policy through.The Labour Government must weigh up the balance on this issue. They cannot defer it any longer. In fairness to our friends in Europe wherever they may be, in the Community or in EFTA itself, and in fairness to the Commonwealth, they must make up their minds and tell the world. While the period of waiting for negotiation goes on there is an immense amount to be done to change our own internal policies, in order to be able to adapt ourselves more easily and to give us longer time and to work out the problems of the sterling area and to deal with the indebtedness of this country to the International Monetary Fund, and to discuss with those who wish in Europe the question of defence and political developments.All of these are immense and difficult problems which would face any Government, and I say so quite frankly to all of you here today and to the country as a whole. But Europe will not wait for ever, and unless a decision is taken in principle for this country, unless a solemn declaration of intent is made, then finally, when the Community reaches its full stage of development, it may be too late for any British Government to take that step. So I believe that this is a solemn time for the British Government on Europe.In that very distinguished speech of Angus Maude\u2019s he said we must show our people that these things are worthwhile, that these immense efforts for which we are calling in pursuing our policies, for which we are asking our Party members up and down the country, are worthwhile. I believe that they are. To people who are worried, as I have said, about jobs and homes and schools, the future of their children, who are worried about the country, then surely we can show them that, in order to produce that fuller life which they want, in order to see our country holding its head high again in the world, these immense efforts are worthwhile. But I have so often felt in the travels I have had to make in these last few years that perhaps we in Britain do not yet fully realise how much life today can hold for our people; how much is possible with all the modern techniques; how much can be achieved by our own efforts when we are given the opportunity. The life of so many people in the Commonwealth, in Canada or New Zealand, in Scandinavia or America; to see so many of the chores of life removed; to see the working conditions they want; to see the educational facilities for their children; to see the opportunities of recreation in every form - this is a life which in many ways is so much fuller than we have yet been able to achieve here in Britain.Surely it is this vision which we can hold out to them when we demand these vast efforts. This is not just a materialistic society. This is a society in which you have a material basis to enable you to have a richer and fuller life than any generation has ever had before.There are some who say: \u2018But how can you talk about these things during a crisis? Surely this is misleading people.\u2019 Exactly the reverse. I believe that the only way we can move the British people out of this crisis is to show them what is worthwhile; to show them how to make the effort to get out of the crisis and to achieve what we all want to do. It is what we must do as a Party - to show our people what is possible, to show them the way which we ourselves have been charting at this Conference, and to try to achieve a greater national unity upon the means of getting there - a greater national unity than we have had in the past. I believe that our Party must give the lead. In the House of Commons you can rely on my colleagues and myself; and in the country we depend, as you know so well, so much on you - every one of you - and your friends and neighbours who are working with us.So go out from this great Conference at Blackpool. There is not a moment to spare. Make sure of your objective: go to it to achieve the result we want. Go to it, with that long haul to get rid of this Government. We can do so now in good heart. We know, the country will know, that Labour Government does not work. We can show that our ideals are right, our philosophy is right, our policies are right. We can show them the great divide between the parties, that freedom is at stake. We can show them that, with far greater national unity on our principles and ideals, we have so much to offer. This year will hold a great deal for us. As you have said, Mr. President, we are set for a long haul in national affairs. But in our local affairs the opportunity will already be there.In Birmingham this year we achieved success, London and Lancashire next year! That is what we want. As we march forward on this path, then let these three - Birmingham, London and Lancashire - be the stepping stones to victory.

aVI move, Mr. Chairman, the acceptance of the Parliamentary Report.We are now nearing the end of the first Parliamentary session following the 1966 General Election, and the very full Report which has been circulated to delegates has got to be seen not only as a long list of Acts of Parliament but as a record of Government action. And far more, it is a spelling out in terms of Government action of the basic social and economic priorities of this Labour Government.What we have had to do in dealing with the economic crisis is the cause of the deep anxieties which fill the hearts of every one of us here at this Conference, and I am going to deal with those anxieties. But it is vital that our concern about them should not blind us to what we have done in these three years, and the enormous progress we have made towards achieving the goals that we together set our­selves here at Scarborough four years ago.Today I am going to give you the facts. In the three years we have been in office we have ended the slide to social inequalities and public neglect. We have put in hand a dramatic deployment of resources in favour of those in greatest need, in favour of the under-privi­leged, on all fronts of social action - social security, health and welfare, the housing of our people, the education of our children and our young people - the most massive ever carried through. We have set out to make good the damage done to our society by a system of Tory Government, a Tory Government which upheld a two-standard system that in another country won recognition in the phrase \u2018private affluence and public squalor.\u2019And remember what we have done is so far only three years' work. We are still less than half way from the Election of October, 1964, to the statutory end of this Parliament. Already our plans, our plans for further expansion, have been laid for the next three years and beyond against the background of the resources which will be available.Remember, too, that we have carried through this programme of social advance against a background of inherited economic difficulties. When they were faced with econo­mic crises, the Tories cut the social services again and again. When economic crisis over­took them, as it did every four years, they placed new burdens on those least able to bear them. Twice they increased the weight of the prescription charges. They cut school building, they cut the building of houses to rent. To be fair to them, they did not cut the hospital building programme. They had hardly any hospital building programme to cut.Now my colleagues from the platform this week are giving the facts about the social pro­vision we have made for bettering the lives of our people, and let me this morning draw these facts together.Provision for the old, the sick and the disabled. In 1963/64, the Tories\u2019 last financial year - and remember this was a peak year for them because they deliberately pushed up their social services spending as the Election drew nearer - in 1963/64, the total they provided for social security was £1,970 millions. This year we are providing £2,831 millions, an increase of £861 millions. (Applause) For every £100 they were spending, we are spending £144.Provision for the young - education. Their last full year, £1,363 millions: this year, £1,936 millions - an increase of £573 millions. For every £100 they provided on education, we are providing £142. Nor is our provision confined to school hours. On sport and other youth activities we are spending exactly twice as much as the figure they had worked up to in their pre-Election programme.Provision for health and welfare services. Their last full year, £1,118 millions: this year £1,619 millions, an increase of £501 millions. Again, for every £100 they provided in their peak year, we are providing £145.Housing and slum clearance. Their last full year, £657 millions: this year £1,018 millions, an increase of £361 millions. Again, for every £100 they provided in their peak year we are providing £155. I am giving you these figures, and I do not apologise because these are facts. (Applause)Now let us take the total spent on all the social services, on health and welfare, the social security and education of our people - and here I am excluding the massive help that we are giving to local authorities with their rates and the provision we are making for redun­dancy payments.I once said in those Opposition years, \u2018Among civilised men greatness amongst nations is judged not by a country\u2019s battle­ships, its supersonic bombers, its arms or its H-bombs, or by the speed and efficiency by which it can mount an imperialist military excursion. It is judged by its treatment of the least privileged of its citizens, its young children, its old folk, its war disabled and those injured in factories or in the mines.\u2019 Fine words, always easy in Opposition?Now the achievement. Our total provision for social services of all kinds for which, again, they allotted £5,144 millions in their last full year, their peak year, we are now providing £7,457 millions, an increase of over £2,300 millions over their last full year in office. (Applause) Fine words, then proud facts, facts achieved by your Labour Government.In a fortnight\u2019s time at the Conference of the Conservative and Opportunionist Party at Brighton (applause), they will promise slashing cuts in taxation. Let them at Brighton say which of these items of expenditure I have outlined they will cut. Pensions? Health? Hospitals? Housing? I remember that before the 1964 Election they boasted that they had costed everything. We doubted it then, but now that Mr. Marples has brought in a com­puter to grind out Party policies at the press of a button, it should be easy for them now to give us the answer. So let them give the facts and figures at Brighton of which of these items I have outlined they would cut in the interests of reduced taxation.Because the figures I have given you represent social priorities against an economic background which would have driven a Tory Government into social retreat and panic demolition. I have no doubt that some of you will feel like asking, \u2018Yes, but what about defence spending?\u2019 Quite right. In 1951, when there was a great debate about the rearmament programme, I expressed my doubts, as many of us did, about the priority between defence expenditure and social expenditure. We had then committed ourselves to a defence pro­gramme of £1,700 millions, and that had to be set against a total expenditure in 1951 on the social services of £2,069 millions. In other words, for every £100 allocated for defence, £122 were being spent on the social services. Now today, for every £100 we are spending on defence we are spending £340 on the social services, and in 1970/71 our planning provides that for every £100 we shall be spending on defence we shall be spending £390 on the social services. And in real terms, that is allowing for increased prices, defence expendi­ture this year has already been cut by one third, more than one third, compared with that 1951 defence plan.I doubt if there is a delegate here this morn­ing who, in 1964 or 1963 when we were last in Scarborough, even though the gravity of the economic position was at that time deliberately concealed from us by the then Government, I doubt if there is a delegate here who then would have thought that three years later we would be able to report an increase of £2,300 mil­lions, or nearly a half, in our provision for the social services.And for those who say we could spend more on the social services if we spent less on defence, let me remind them of this. The increase in our total provision for the social services - I am not talking about the total spending, I am talking about the increase since we came to office - that increase is considerably more than the total amount we are now spending on defence, a defence pro­gramme which we have cut. We have switched resources from defence to the social services - the right priority for a Socialist Government. (Applause)Now let us see what these Socialist priorities mean in human terms. Let us go into the home of an old-age pensioner. Of course, we have not abolished poverty yet. But for everyone in receipt of the basic pension, in three years we have raised the benefit paid by 22s. 6d. per week for a single person - 22s. 6d. a week over three years. In 13 years they only managed 37s. 6d. And, on top of this, now the social security supplement as of right to those who need it.Or suppose we take the case of a newly bereaved widow. Her husband was 55, he, had worked 40 years; he was earning, let us say, the average wage in British industry. In 1964 his widow would have had £4 15s. for the first 13 weeks. Now, that newly-bereaved widow would receive £10 8s. for 26 weeks. And after that she gets the Labour Government\u2019s increased rate of benefit, and she also gets everything she can gain from our abolition of the earnings rule for widows. (Applause)Or take housing subsidies. On a typical house, the subsidy is now over £85 a year against £24 when we came into office. Or a typical flat, a flat in many of our cities costing £5,000, the subsidy for this is now £112 as against £24 three years ago.Take our housing record which Tony Greenwood presented to Conference on Monday. Record completions, record starts, an all-time record in nearly half a million houses now under construction. Houses built to let: in a year of Tory squeeze, 1963, after 12 years in office, they built 124,000 houses to let. This year, despite economic difficulties, we shall complete not 124,000, but getting on for 200,000: 16 houses for every 10 they were building four years ago.Schools: they averaged 475 new schools a year. We are building well over 600 and we have just allocated more in the areas of greatest need. Primary schools, our first need: they averaged 295 a year, we are building 500.Hospitals. New hospital building: in their 13 years they spent £22.6 million a year. This year, we are spending £97.3 million. For every £100 they spent each year in their term of office, we are spending £431.So I could go on. All these achievements are a part of our Parliamentary Report to you, the victories won against bitter, sour, sullen opposition, won after weeks of weary com­mittee stages and long all-night sittings: the fruit of three years\u2019 clash between the Socialist way and the Tory way.But let us pause a moment now, in reverent remembrance of clashes and controversies which are no longer with us: a long list of bitter controversies which not long ago took the centre of the political stage and did that because the Conservatives put them in the centre of the political stage.The 1957 Rent Act, the proud creation of Duncan Sandys and Henry Brooke, now as irrelevant as the one and as forgotten as the other. There lies that Rent Act, dead, un-mourned, even by the party for which so long it was a living symbol of their eternal articles of faith. And in its place security of tenure for our people and a right to a fair rent.Or another forgotten controversy, Rach­manism, which right up to the end they tried to argue did not exist, or, if it did exist, it was all exaggerated, and, even if it wasn\u2019t, nothing could be done about it. That was what they said. In one quick, clean surgical operation our Rent Act has cut out, almost to its last ves­tiges, from London and our other big cities, this malignant growth which flourished and festered under Tory housing policy. (Applause)Prescription charges, the last refuge of every bankrupt Tory Chancellor, abolished in one short, sharp Act a few weeks after Labour came to office.Land racketeering, which the Tories defended as essential to a free market economy, essential even to the British way of life, and which right up to the last hour in October, 1964, they refused even to restrain - and now, because of Labour\u2019s Land Commission Act, another lost and almost forgotten controversy.Leasehold. How many resolutions have we had over the years, how many hours have we spent at Conference after Conference attacking this social blight which Tory landlordism insisted on retaining in our older towns and cities? We shall not have much to debate in future. The Leasehold Reform Bill is now in its very last stages. The Tories carried out their pledge to fight it every inch of the way. Legalised robbery, they called it. When our measure becomes law later this month, it will guarantee to a million British families security in their homes. (Applause)The other controversy, steel, so recently the ark of the Tory Covenant - and the key to the Tory treasure chest? Now, an issue settled, and settled for all time, in the interests of a great industry and the workers in that indus­try, and the nation that depends on that industry.These were some of the problems and con­troversies forced on the nation by a Tory Government. And they are dead. The prob­lems we are facing today, problems we debated yesterday, are problems of adjustment, of transition, deep economic and human problems of change arising from the restructuring and modernisation of our industrial fabric.We here do not look at these problems as technical problems. The issues raised - this was true yesterday, and it is true today - go right to the very heart of this movement. We are meeting at a time of deep concern and debate about the economic situation, and par­ticularly about the effects of the measures the Government had to take, on production and, above all, on employment. This concern is not only inevitable: it is right. For if any of us, however beset by the need to put Britain\u2019s international economic position right, were ever to forget for one moment the human realities, the realities for every family in this country, then none of us would have the right to bear the responsibilities that you have entrusted to us.For us unemployment is not a matter of social, still less economic, statistics. It is a human problem, and for very many people in this hall it has human - and bitter - memories.No-one who was brought up in one of our older industrial areas in the years of the depression - as I was in the West Riding, or Wales, Lancashire, the north-east or Scotland, or Cumberland or the Black Country - could ever erase those memories from his mind: what unemployment meant for his neighbours, his friends \u2013 one\u2019s own family - not in terms of living standards only, but the deeper psycho­logical effects that loss of work, loss of status, loss of dignity, loss of security and, perhaps above all, loss of hope brought to a familyFor many of us here, certainly for most of us who remember those days, this was the issue which brought us into politics, what we saw, what we lived through and our determina­tion that these things should be no more. And we are still, all of us, the same people.We reject as an instrument of economic policy the creation of a permanent pool - as they call it - of unemployment. Our aim, our whole policy, is to secure full employment, but to secure it on a permanent basis. (Applause)What else was the purpose of our controls over capital investment overseas; our insistence on keeping Britain competitive through a prices and incomes policy; of con­trolling office and factory building in the Midlands and the south and offering grants and premiums to help the Development Areas? What was the purpose of all this if not to end unemployment? And when these measures proved insufficiently powerful we took the July measures of 1966, to prevent the economic disaster which threatened us with a deeper and more lasting unemployment prob­lem. We have paid a heavy price for those measures, but those measures were necessary. There was no alternative.One consequence at least of those measures has been that over a wide sector of British industry, productivity has increased, costs have been reduced and waste eliminated. We have had a remarkable rise in productivity, in output per man, over this past year. But it has been increased productivity so far only in a negative sense. We have been producing the same amount as last year with less employ­ment. This is one of the tragedies we face because of its contribution to the unemployment problem although equally it is one of our main reasons of hope for the future.Because we are now able to look forward to the rising production which Jim has told us more than once this summer will be coming this autumn, and the rising employment which this increased productivity has made possible. And we have it in our power now - as never happened in the old stop-go cycle - to go for­ward to increased production and increased employment if and only if we remain competitive in the markets of the world.Production has already begun to increase. The latest figures show that the increase in our basic unemployment figures month by month in the earlier part of this year is now corning to an end. For the first time for nearly eighteen months the number of jobs available has started to increase. Let me ask you to take your minds back to last year, we remember the anxieties of the motor car workers who demonstrated at our conference last year. They are not here this year. The industry is moving, its leaders tell us, into a record boom, and it is a new opportunity that industry is fading, having now streamlined its costs, that makes so tragic the repeated unofficial strikes of the past few weeks. Add if next month\u2019s unemployment figures against the background of this developing boom were to show significant unemployment among car workers, let it be clear that will be due to strikes and not due, as we were told a year ago, to Government policy.I warned about the problems we face this winter because of weather and other factors which every winter temporarily raise the unemployment figure. But basically now there is an upturn in the economy. Last week, I warned, too that we will resist pressures to embark on an irresponsible reflationary policy which would undo all that has been achieved, and make meaningless the sacrifices for which we have had to ask. And yesterday Jim made clear why.The break-out that is now open to us must be industrial, technological, regional, because however necessary, monetary policy, credit squeezes and the rest, however essential to deal with a short-term critical situation, these things do not of themselves provide the answer. The answer lies in industrial restructuring and reorganisation. Above all, it lies in the application of technology to our industrial processes and in speeding the process of industrial change.This was the message of Scarborough 1963. Let me remind you what that message was. It was first a demand for more purposive policies in education, to strengthen our educational system and above all to widen the gates of educational opportunity including higher education, including too, adequate facilities in every part of our educational structure for the training of scientists, technologists and engineers.And that Scarborough message; secondly, was a demand for the mobilisation of our scientific talent, on the job of creating new opportunities far our industry - and in that mobilisation to carry through a massive re­deployment of scientists, from defence projects to the needs of industry and peaceful reconstruction.That Scarborough message, thirdly, was the long neglected need to apply the results of science to British industry whether in moder­nising our older industries or in creating new industriies bated on science.And fourthly, the message of Scarborough was the message of technological change, a second industrial revolution, yes, but the message was a revolution which by this time would be humanised, would be tempered with a humanity and a care for social values; a care for human values which was lacking in the first industrial revolution. And I remember with what insistence the need to relate this revolution to human values was pressed, in the debate, in speech after speech from the floor, and in Dick Crossman\u2019s reply from the platform.I said here at Scarborough that if socialism had never existed the challenge and opportunities of the new scientific revolution would have brought it into being, and if I believed that four years ago, I believe it more than ever now in the light of the last three years through which we have lived.The traditional socialism of this country was created out of the squalor and the inhumanity and the exploitation of that first industrial revolution.And today in some of our older industries and in the environment of some of our older industrial areas, we still have the problems of economic and social change resulting from that industrial age of brass and iron, muck and money. The delegate from the Rhondda spelt out that inheritance yesterday in, for me, one of the most moving speeches of this Conference. (Applause) And socialism today, the socialism of the future, means translating into human terms the immeasurable possibili­ties which science and technology, freely encouraged and harnessed to social needs and national needs, can create.That was the message of Scarborough four years ago, and today, after four years - three of them in government - we look at that Scar­borough message against the harsh test of reality - but also against a proud record of achievement.First, and I take the first part of that message, what we have achieved in education - education at all levels. We have increased teacher training, the first guarantee of smaller classes. We have stepped up primary school building. Our determination to end the vicious system under which the educational future of a child can be determined by an arbitrary and unscientific test at the incredible age of 11. (Applause) This battle is now on. We are deeply engaged in it all over the country. We intend to win it - all of us here together. (Applause) But this is not all. The message of Scarborough was that if neither humanity nor the long-term needs of the nation could afford segregation, educational apartheid at 11 plus, equally we could not afford an unfair process of segregation at 18 plus. We called for a rapid expansion in higher education, the widening of the gates of opportunity, to every kind of higher education. There were 22 universities in Britain when we were last in Scarborough. Today there are 44. (Applause) And this is partly because all the former Colleges of Advanced Technology have achieved or are achieving university status in a very real sense. And as we then demanded, here is one place where an end has been put to the educational snobbery which stood in the way. When we were last in Scarborough, there were 203,000 students in our universities and our other institutions of higher education. Today, there are 325,000, an increase of 60 per cent; 105,000 of these are in science and tech­nology, an increase of 32,000 over four years ago. We are now spending £470 millions on higher education, 88 per cent more than four years ago. Capital spending on universities is now double what it was four years ago. The number of teachers in training has risen from 54,000 to 95,000 this year. We are spending £124 millions, nearly 75 per cent more than four years ago, on scientific research at our universities and research councils. We are linking the work of these universities more and more, and of the Colleges of Further Educa­tion and the new Polytechnics more and more with industry and with the regions where they are situated. So that was the first message of Scarborough.And the second theme of Scarborough - ­scientific and technological research. This year Government spending on all civil scientific research and development will be about £266 millions compared with £158 millions four years ago. And this includes as we then demanded, a massive redeployment from defence research to civil research.And we are getting priorities into our scientific research - priorities not only between civil and defence research, priorities within civil research, because we cannot afford at once all the research - and all the equipment - all our scientists would want.Now I come to the third theme, the applica­tion of all this scientific research in technological application to British industry. You have had our reports to Conference about what Frank Cousins and now Tony Benn have achieved in carrying out the Scarborough mandate at the Ministry of Technology. I am not going to go over this whole story, it is too long, but when you have heard about the emergency action taken to save the British computer industry - and how it is now going from strength to strength - the establishment of a completely computerised publicly-owned banking service through the giro system, and now about the new national data processing service, based on seven giant British com­puters, which come into operation this week, the reorganisation of the British machine tool industry, and the massive help the Ministry is giving to its most forward-looking designers in producing more and more modern instruments backed by Government guarantee - when you heard from the Minister how Aldermaston scientists and the miniature servo-mechanisms originally built for missiles are now being redeployed on the production of artificial limbs for the industrially disabled and for thalido­mide children - you can see that Scarborough mandate working in applications which none of us could have seen four years ago. But you can see the emergence in practice - now not prospect - of the themes we then endorsed. The theme of making the commanding heights of British technology independent of American domination. The theme of transferring human resources and physical resources from military research to the blitz on our economic and social problems.And the theme of reducing our humiliating inherited dependence on industry overseas for the supply of advanced modern machinery - machinery which, given the right lead and the right stimulus, we have always known could and should be pioneered and produced in this country.And the fourth theme, Mr. Chairman, of Scarborough, was the humanising of the tech­nological revolution. We said that the indus­trial pattern of the future and the pace of industrial change would not only call for vastly expanded programmes of training young people in industry. It would mean that very many of our industrial workers would have to be given facilities for retraining, for learning new skills, once and perhaps twice during their working lives.Yesterday Jim announced further actions we are taking in order to encourage training; Government Training Centres, training in the factory and the rest, and because of what we are doing we have the right to demand a similar sense of urgency from many in industry.After the T.U.C. at Brighton I asked the Economic Committee of the General Council to come to see me. What I said to them then I want to say to some of the powerful industrial delegations here this morning. You have expressed your concern about unemployment - and, you know, my colleagues and I feel that concern as deeply as any who spoke at the rostrum either in Brighton or here in Scarborough.Here is one practical thing you can do, you can remove the restrictions on employment of men when they have been trained (Applause) - and this applies equally to men trained in Government Training Centres and to men trained up to semi-skilled level in the Develop­ment Areas. Because already there have been too many cases where Government training, and industrial training at Government expense, has been frustrated and negatived by a veto from the shop stewards and others on their being employed in jobs which make use of their new skill (Applause) It is right in Congress and in Conference for all of us to make speeches about unemployment, but those speeches must be backed by action in the unions especially at local level. (Applause)And equally important with many is the need to bring new work to the areas affected. One of the big differences between us and the Tories has always been that we recognise that Britain\u2019s industrial problems \u2013 Britain\u2019s em­ployment problem - above all the ability to expand without lurching into balance of pay­ments difficulties - is dependent on mobilising the full productive power of the regions which were neglected for so long; the recognition that our problems could not be solved on a two-nations policy. Yes, they were ready to talk about the two nations, but they were never prepared to make them one. They were never ready to apply with sufficient vigour the policy of restraining excessive growth in the pros­perous regions that was needed to create full employment in the areas which for so long they left depressed.We acted. Our decision to schedule large areas - nearly the whole of Scotland, large parts of Wales, the south west, north east and elsewhere, as Development Areas, this re­placed their policy of narrow growth points which would have left whole areas to decay. Our advance factory building programme - more than twice as large in three years, as they achieved in 13 years - our boosting of Govern­ment expenditure for factory development in these areas - fourfold compared with the last Tory year. Our tighter grip on factory development in congested areas - our exten­sion of this control to office building, the sharply discriminating investment grants for Development Areas; the regional employment premiums started last month - £100 millions a year for the Development Areas. This is what we have so far done. Now in the period of industrial expansion which lies ahead there will be further clear and deliberate discrimina­tion in favour of the Development Areas.Four years ago we talked of science-based industries in the Development Areas. The enlargement of scientific research facilities, the time required for that research to bear fruit and the still longer time required to apply it to industry, meant that very little could be achieved in a period of three years - or longer. No one expected it.But let me tell you this morning of a new proposal for the establishment of new science-based industries in Development Areas.As a result of great advances in nuclear generation, where Britain now leads the world and here let us not be backward in again proclaiming another triumph of public enterprise (applause) - as a result of these advances the new generating stations of the 70\u2019s will be able to produce electricity for industrial use far cheaper than electricity costs today. Thank God for that. (Laughter and Applause)This will mean that it will be economic to establish big new industries in this country which we have not had before because our power costs were not competitive with hydro­electric power overseas. And it will mean the opportunity, in Development Areas, for new industries which we have not previously had in this country. Industries which will help to make us less dependent on overseas production.We are now prepared to build publicly-owned power stations to work in partnership with private enterprise smelter industries - the electricity to be supplied at a price based on the stations\u2019 own generating costs. And the construction can start now. We are ready to start today to discuss with the aluminium industry the provision of one or more giant smelters, competitively powered with nuclear electricity, and this need not mean any further erosion into the coal industry because these stations, and the industries they will bring in their train, will be additional projects, addi­tional consumers of electricity which do not exist today.Indeed, there is a possibility - which I am now discussing with the Chairman of the Coal Board - of associating the coal industry with this type of project in the Development Areas. (Applause)The Secretary of State for Economic Affairs will be announcing more details about our proposals later today. This is one more contribution to the problem of the regions and to the strengthening of our national industrial base to add to those which Jim outlined yester­day. This is right on social grounds; it is right on human grounds; and it is right because of the special problems caused by the rundown of older industries in those areas.But it makes hard economic sense, too. The essence of the Tory stop-go policy was that industrial expansion was halted after a brief period because of overheating in the pros­perous areas of the Midlands and the south and because of the crippling shortages of labour, skilled and unskilled, leading to a loss of potential exports and an increase in imports. That was the essence of the stop-go cycle.Then, because of this overheating in the Midlands and the south, the nation as a whole was plunged back into a freeze which rapidly spread to the very areas which had barely emerged from the previous chill and where unemployment was still too high. It is the pur­pose of this Government, by every means in our power, including those the Chancellor described yesterday, to narrow and ultimately to eliminate the differential between the Development Areas and the rest of the country. There is no surer prescription for continued industrial advance without launch­ing into localised inflation and overheating.But there is more than this. Historically, American development was based on an advancing frontier in the West; that of Russia on an advancing frontier in the East. In this crowded island the new industrial frontier for the next generation depends on opening up again the areas of the first industrial revolution which the Tories allowed to decline into grime and decay - the areas where industry was born. We accept this frontier as a challenge to the Government, but it is a challenge, too, you know, to our young people.Mr. Chairman, we have already got under way a vast programme of urban renewal and modernisation which is literally changing the face of Britain. All over the country, but per­haps most strikingly in the older industrial areas of the north, the grime and muddle and decay of our Victorian heritage is being replaced. The new city centres with their university precincts, their light, clean and well-spaced civic buildings, will not merely brighten the physical environment of our people, they will change the very quality of urban life in Britain.If this is true of old areas, old industries are coming to life as well. There is the work of the Industrial Reorganisation Corporation, hard at work in the modernisation and restructuring of our industries. There is the decisive and timely help given by the Ministry of Tech­nology to an ailing shipbuilding industry to help it to break through into the new age of shipbuilding created by the container revolu­tion and also to enable it to enter on a com­petitive basis the age of the giant tanker.One of our troubles is we cannot always tell you what is coming next in the field of new encouraging development. Last week I was on television answering some very grave anxieties on development areas. There were many people in development areas wondering whether the shipbuilding industry had a future. I could not tell them that night - I did not want any last-minute hitch - that the next day we should be announcing the biggest tanker order in the history of this country ­(applause) - which would not have been pos­sible but for the work of Tony Benn and his Ministry in seeing that order through.Mr. Chairman, I have talked about the road to economic success. As Jim made clear yester­day and as I have to make clear again today, there is no easy road. What we can put before this Conference is what we must do if we are to solve our problems, including the establish­ment of full employment. First, the increase in productivity we have achieved over this year in such heavy cost in human terms must not be dissipated. As production and employment increase, there must be no return to waste, whether in the use of labour or in any other element that enters into the cost.Secondly, expansion must proceed through investment in industry, through exports and import saving, and through imaginative regional policies, and through developing unused resources in the Development Areas.Thirdly, expansion must be based on an unremitting insistence on the application of new technologies in British industry, embrac­ing research and design and marketing and management. But we have the right, as I have said, to insist that technological advance must be tempered by human considerations.Fourthly, there can be no success for our policies, for exports, or the breakthrough to full employment, except on the basis of a fully effective policy for prices and incomes, in partnership, with the T.U.C. and in partner­ship with industry.Fifthly, we must proceed on a basis of partnership between Government and indus­try, not only on a basis of full consultation, of full partnership in decision, but on the basis also that the Government cannot submit to dictation by any industrial interest about the course it is necessary to pursue.This is the prescription for a strong economy, strong at home and abroad; for firmly based expansion, for rising and assured employment, for social justice. This is the message of Scarborough 1967. This is the New Britain.Before I sit down, I think it is right that against this realistic policy - and all of us here know it is realistic - the policy which will be the policy of this nation for the next three years, and beyond: it is against this that we must, I think, spend a few moments - I so rarely do this; I am going to do it this morning - testing the specious claims of those who from time to time press themselves upon the attention of the nation.We have now had three years to judge the record of the Conservative Party in their role as Her Majesty\u2019s Opposition. Not I believe in our lifetime, certainly not in 1945-51, have we had an Opposition which so clearly rejected from the outset any pretence to be an alterna­tive Government - (applause) - and which chose instead the more pleasant role, perhaps - the negative role - of the opportunist reacting to events.I want to make it clear that I have got every sympathy for them. (Laughter) Their motivat­ing force is a sense of deprivation, a sense that men ordained by a benevolent Providence to rule our affairs should have had power so rudely wrested from them by democratic electoral process. (Applause)In Parliament they are ineffective, apart from occasional sparks emitted by one or two of their leading shadow ex-Ministers now without even shadow portfolios. (Laughter) They fail as an Opposition, precisely because they have not realised that you cannot oppose unless you have a coherent and constructive alternative to offer to the policies of the Government. (Applause) For three years they have opposed practically every measure we have introduced, even some which they intro­duced and which we have re-introduced. They had to get on the pop radio bandwagon, after they were pledged to abolish pirate radio. The test they have applied - at least they have been consistent in this - has not been, \u2018Will this measure help Britain?\u2019, but will it win votes, will it call into being some potentially powerful lobby which will help them on the road back to office and power.They have opposed every measure proposed by the Government to secure economy in expenditure, whether on costly prestige air­craft, or on any other single item. In this Parliamentary Session alone - I do not want to inflict an all-night sitting on you - they have opposed defence economies in Malta and Aden - and, of course, further east - they have demanded more spending on pay for doctors and dentists in the Forces, and pressed it to a Division, more money on university students, on drugs legislation, on pensioners, on S.E.T. refunds, on aid for Barbados, and a lot more besides. All this, and transport, too, where they have put forward a programme which on the best authoritative costing would increase Government expenditure by £10,000 million.Yet at the same time they promise to cut taxation. (Laughter) On taxation they proclaim the fiscal dreams of a Gladstone, and on expenditure they speak the language of the pork barrel. When the news is good for Britain they pass by in silent embarrassment­ (laughter) - too small to proclaim the achieve­ments of a Britain in which they are remote from power. And when the going is hard they are quick for party advantage to provide aid and comfort to those at home and abroad, the sell-Britain-short brigade who scrutinise every cloud over Britain in the hope of a speculative silver lining for themselves. (Applause)This is a proud country, a country which has no time for those who knock Britain when we are up against it and no time for a party who could boast of a Britain which, when they were in charge, ran into a gaping deficit, and a party who now indulge in petulant pro­nouncements to denigrate a Britain which is paying her way. This is our country and this is their country too. You know, I may have views - and I think it is safe to express them in Scarborough - about the action of the M.C.C. in dismissing the captain I would have wanted to see in the West Indies (applause) - I cannot tell you what those views are, because they are unprintable (laughter) - but however that may be it will not stop me cheering from afar for every run, every wicket our cricketers get on to the scorecard. (Applause)Not the Tories, so they look for other consolation. Deprived of national power, they seek to instruct local councils from their Central Office - this is a party that fought local election after local election on the high principle of keeping politics out of local government. (Applause)Now, I read in the Daily Telegraph - and I believe it (laughter) - of their leader, and I quote, \u2018instructing\u2019 local Conservative coun­cillors. I do not try to instruct local Labour councillors, I know what I would get if I did. (Laughter) And I read in The Times - and I believe that too - an elaborate account of how the G.L.C. now is to be run not from County Hall but from Tory Central Office. This is what they voted for, or what they abstained about. (Laughter) Equally, you know, we have every right to expose the Tory successive attempts to seduce for factional purposes great industrial organisations into resisting Govern­ment policy on clearly defined national objectives.Consider their record: on the eve of the 1966 Trades Union Congress, they took time off from their reiterated desire to constrict our free trade union movement within the legalistic shackles of a corporative state to instruct Con­gress to reject the Government\u2019s appeal for an effective prices and incomes policy, even though this was an end for which Tory Chan­cellor after Tory Chancellor, and even Chair­man Hogg, had striven. (Laughter) Striven they had, though not one of them was ever prepared to will the means. The Trades Union Congress treated this appeal with the contempt it deserved.A year ago, too, in a hastily prepared noc­turnal statement (laughter) Conservative leaders appealed to British industry to convert the National Productivity Conference, repre­senting all sections of industry, which was meeting under my chairmanship, into a forum for the dissemination of Conservative irrelevancies. The Conference refused. But more recently, when a policy of partnership between the Government and industry re­quires a new approach to the problem of Government participation and help in essen­tial industrial projects, including projects which in these past few weeks have been proved to be necessary to save essential British industries from bankruptcy, at this moment of time their leaders issued the instruction - again an instruction, and I quote, \u2018private enterprise must fight,\u2019 and this at a moment when private firms have been approaching the Government as never before for help. (Applause)On this occasion, because of certain announcements made last week, the Tory leadership may think they would have had more success. On the forthcoming Industrial Expansion Bill, an essential instrument in the fight for economic expansion and full employ­ment, they may be feeling from the most recent decisions of the Confederation of British Industry that they have at last chalked up a success in instructing somebody to do something. It is my duty to tell them that they misjudge the situation, that the Grand Council of the C.B.I. may share their ignorance of what our proposals mean; they do not share their malice. (\u2018Hear, Hear\u2019) Mr. Chairman, the Government must govern and if it is our duty to resist demands from the Trades Union Congress to repeal legislation we consider essential, it is certainly no less our duty to resist a demand from others in industry that we drop proposed legislation which we believe to be in the interests of the country. (Applause) But all this apart, this Conference - I say this now before I sit down - has the right to ask the Opposition two questions. The first: What is their policy on prices and incomes? Mr. Maudling considers it essential; Mr. Powell indicts it as nonsense, then, as that is not good enough, condemns it as a \u2018silly nonsense,\u2019 and then he sentences it to perdition as \u2018transparent nonsense.\u2019Now, where do they stand? Actually, I believe from their own words that they have now come to believe in the need for some sort of a prices and incomes policy, but I believe too that here at least they have a policy, a policy which on one or two occasions they have inadvertently and indiscreetly blurted out and which they would like really to keep a dark secret. You know, I think this should be very carefully studied. Their official spokesmen have made it clear that there would be no problem of rising incomes, no pressure for higher wages, if the level of demand in this country were cut to and were kept at a lower level than it has been. We have the right to ask them, to what level? Even today, with unem­ployment at a figure none of us here is pre­pared to tolerate, industry after industry is demanding higher wages. The Tory prescrip­tion, then, must be for a still higher level of unemployment, but at what figure? I think the trade unions and I think the nation are entitled to know.At least let them recall this, that their official spokesman earlier this year used these ominous words: \u2018It is easy now to see our mistakes. We made life at once too easy and too hard for private enterprise; too easy because to keep unemployment far lower than it is now we kept demand too high and busi­nessmen therefore had full order books whether they were efficient or not.\u2019For us, today\u2019s figure of 555,000 unem­ployed, with whatever seasonal variation up and down may occur, that figure is too high. (Applause) For the Tories, on the other hand, on their own arguments, that figure is too low, because it does not achieve such a balance between demand and supply as to deter trade unions from formulating wage claims.But secondly we are entitled to demand a clear statement about their policy for the social services and about the extension of means testing. I believe what they say on this is serious, I believe this has been thought through. What they seek now to do is to restore to our people all the indignities of a public assistance society. Since our last Con­ference your Government has abolished the stigma which many people felt attached to the old national assistance. They want to go right back now, and this in a year in which we have seen the publication of a report showing that up to half a million of our fellow citizens were too proud to claim National Assistance when they had the right to it and when they needed it.Now, thanks to Peggy Herbison\u2019s historic measure, those 500,000 are getting the help they need and getting it of right. Whatever the Brighton Conference may proclaim, we here are dedicated to the maintenance of human dignity. We reject the means test society and we reject those who demand that we put the clock back 30 years to restore it. (Applause)So, Mr. Chairman, let us leave to them their vision of Britain, the Britain they seek to restore, a class-ridden Britain, a Britain of privilege, of social privilege, of educational privilege, a Britain based on the right of that privileged class to lord it over all the rest of Britain\u2019s citizens whom we represent. That Tory Britain which before we next meet in Scarborough will have been consigned beyond recall to the social history of a bygone age. (Applause)That was their Britain.  The Britain we are creating is the one which we, all of us, set out from Scarborough four years ago to create.The Government, the Parliamentary Party, whose Report I am commending to Conference, could have no being except for the work and devotion, the support and under­standing, not only of the delegates here but of those whom they represent, the people of Britain. I have given you a progress report of what at this half-way stage, after three years, we have accomplished with the mandate you entrusted to us, a record of social advance, but a record, too, of an indomitable fight for the future of Britain against the constraints imposed upon us by the economic situation we inherited.We have asked our people for great sacri­fices and we know how deeply those sacrifices have cut into the lives of our own people. We are determined, with your continued support to see that those sacrifices will not have been in vain. Your support has carried us through days - through years - of unprecedented difficulty. We honour that trust. We are determined to be worthy of it.

aVMadam Chairman, fellow delegates, thank you for what the BBC, if they are true to their usual form, will tonight describe as a hostile reception.This is the Conference they will look back on and say: \u2018That was when Labour came back fighting.\u2019This has been a rough year for all of us in this movement. A rough year for those who have worked their hearts out in by-elections only to see the Party go down. It has been a year of bitter disappointments in the local elections. We have suffered the loss from our civic life, for a time at any rate, of the services of many hundreds of councillors, with a lifelong record of selfless, work for their local communities.It has been a year in which an oppor­tunist Opposition, backed by the special interests which support them, have thrown everything at us. Politically, personally, the lot. And in all these months I have not replied. Not yet. I shall choose my time.But we have come through. We have not lost our nerve and we are stronger for it. We shall need this nerve, this determination, this comradeship, in the period still ahead of us, when all of us know there can be no relaxation, no let-up if we are to achieve all that we have set out to do, and all that will stem from it. One thing; we know now the worst they can do to us. And they know it, too.The Tories know that time is not on their side. Whatever brave show they put on in Blackpool next week, the truth is that they have already started their cruel post-election inquest on what went wrong.And the reason they know that time is not on their side is because they have an uneasy and growing fear that Labour has got the measure of the problems - the problems not that your Government only is facing but that Britain is facing. The problems not of four years past, but of forty. The problems of moving forward from Imperialism to a modern industrial society. They can see that a pattern is emerging.It is precisely because they sense this that only a few weeks ago they made that carefully planned, much heralded act of des­peration, their campaign directed to suggest that a final and overwhelming economic crisis was only days away. They must have known that there were many in the City, and still more abroad, who, hearing these warnings and believing them, might well have been led to endanger Britain\u2019s recovery with an artificially induced flight of capital. Not for the first time. Next week here they will parade their patriotism. But it always comes off second-best wherever they see a prospect of party gain.Labour seeks to unite the nation in support of the policies of change which are needed. The Tory Party seek only to divide and destroy.Not one word of what they are saying is relevant to the pattern which is emerging and which will be the main theme of this Conference.The emerging pattern of post-Imperial Britain, of the new Britain in a fast changing world. Change made necessary by the economic sacrifice and disruption caused by two world wars and Britain's sacrifices in those wars. Changes whose roots go even further back to the turn of the century, when Britain lost the industrial primacy which she had won in the age of coal, steel and cotton.Britain under Clem Attlee\u2019s post-war Labour Government made a brave attempt to reconstruct the economic damage of the war and to begin to come to terms with the post-Imperial world. Under the Tory Government Britain lost her way precisely because the Government of those years failed to recognise the shape of the world that was emerging. Instead of building on the industrial achievements of the post-war Labour Government, all we had was Edwardian nostalgia and drift.Instead of refashioning an industrial structure that could compete with the new and more dynamic economies of East and West, we lost ground year by year. In those 13 years Britain\u2019s share of world trade in manufactures fell from 21 per cent to 14 per cent - by a third.Over the same years the Tory Govern­ment\u2019s refusal to come to terms with the facts of our world position meant that our overseas Government expenditure, mainly defence, got out of control.In 1959 overseas Government spending was £270 million. The year we took over, 1964-5, it was £477 million. Over £200 million more. And still rapidly rising.Their achievement was this - to narrow and weaken our economic base at home while widening the superstructure of military commitments abroad which their ever-weakening base had to support. The econo­mic strength that Britain can put forward can never be greater than what Britain\u2019s industry can produce and sell.While they neglected Britain\u2019s industry, they gloried in the role of world policeman and world bankers. They neglected every chance to reduce our sterling balance and the vulnerability of sterling as a reserve currency. They borrowed short in order to lend long because doctrinaire financial imperialism and the prestige of the City demanded they lend long.In October 1964 we took over the role of world policeman with an intolerable rate of overseas military expenditure; just as we took over under-equipped fighting services stretched beyond endurance to meet Duncan Sandys\u2019 ill-defined commitments. And equally in 1964 we took over the role of world banker, a 1914 role in a world where because of two wars we had lost the assets and the investments which half a century earlier had made the role practicable.Britain was facing a double problem; first, the vulnerability deriving from a weak indus­trial base. And, secondly, combined with that, an excessively committed sterling position. Our predecessors shirked it - hoped it would go away by pretending it wasn\u2019t there. We faced up to it. By 1966 we had reduced the balance of payments deficit from over £800 million to £89 million. But, even so, our vulnerability because of sterling\u2019s reserve role and the vast accumulation of sterling balances drove us into a crisis.That was what our inheritance meant; four years have shown the emerging pattern of what we have done to deal with it.It is the mark of a Labour Government that we distinguish between the short-run measures, which may often have to be harsh, on monetary and fiscal management, and the more fundamental measures of industrial reconstruction which are the basic deter­minants of our economic strength.I do not need to remind this Conference that in Swansea four and a half years ago I warned about the short-term measures which would have to be taken, to enable a Britain, not yet master of its own affairs, to meet the economic storms to which we were so vulnerable. The measures of July 1966 - the only response a Government could make to the strike of capital we were facing. The fiscal measures in Budget after Budget, high interest rates, credit squeeze. The economy measures I announced last January covering every aspect of Govern­ment expenditure from defence to the social services. An incomes policy which by the very nature of things requires statutory backing.No responsible Government could have acted otherwise. No Conservative Government would have had the guts.Your Government will take full note of everything that was said in yesterday\u2019s debate. I am proud of the fact that we could have a debate like yesterday\u2019s. That this mature Labour Movement could debate issues so deep and so fundamental without for one moment losing sight of the basic comradeship that has brought all of us here. I was not surprised at any of the views expressed. When the decisions were taken by the Government which were so strongly attacked yesterday my colleagues and I knew and sensed what every delegate who spoke yesterday was feeling.None of us have changed. We were debating policies that are unpopular but which we believe to be necessary and right. If because of the views expressed yesterday we were now in midstream to abandon those policies, there is no-one here who would respect us for such a decision. To abandon now the policies that we believe to be right would be just as cowardly and in the long run as destructive of this Party as to have shirked bringing them in.All these short-term measures, distasteful as they are, had to be taken while the basic measures of industrial reconstruction were taking effect. And we had warned that those industrial measures would take time. But whatever measures we have had to take even against these overwhelming difficulties, they have been tempered by compassion.Everything we had to do was necessary while our industrial measures were being given time to work.That is what I warned this movement about in July and what I have to warn you against today. We know, and every objective commentator on British industry knows, even the Tories know, that while we need many months more of resolute economic measures, increasingly our long-run indus­trial policies will deliver dividends in exports and economic performance which, provided only we hold firm, will produce their own political dividend. What I was warning the movement about in July, and I do it again today, is any weakness or lack of resolve which will enable the Tories to garner, to reap, the fruits of the industrial reconstruc­tion we are putting through with such pain and at such cost.In presenting last year\u2019s Parliamentary Report, I summarised the progress of the Government in restructuring and modernis­ing British industry.We began our frontal attack on the prob­lems of British industry on the day we took office. The results are now beginning to come through. And they will come through in increasing measure next year and into the Seventies.It has taken time. The industrial con­troversies of 1964, 1965, even last year, have receded into the past. And, as the Tory speeches gather dust, their authors would like to forget they ever made them.There were those early gibes about the establishment of the Ministry of Technology, which was even then saving and then building up a distinctive, indigenous British computer industry, and planning the reconstruction of machine tools, ship building, micro­electronics, and the heavy electrical industry, among others.All the work of those days is bearing fruit today in export order after export order, headlined almost daily in the financial and industrial press. Before the last election, throughout the election and after the elec­tion, our opponents fought to prevent the establishment of the Industrial Reorganisa­tion Corporation. Now they praise it. They scoffed at the enquiries we set up into industry after industry - enquiries which I promised you at Brighton two years ago would be followed by action. The whole structure of the shipbuilding industry has been revolutionised on a high productivity, low cost basis, no longer losing orders but gaining them from the rest of the world.The motor industry has been reorganised with Government help and today faces the prospect of a greater security based on a spectacularly stronger export position. We are now in process of creating an electrical industry complex which will enable us to meet on equal terms the giants of Europe and even of America. The aircraft industry - it seems a long time since the aircraft employers paid their workers a day\u2019s wages and chartered trains to come and demon­strate in what some commentators were pleased to liken to the hunger marches of the past. Last week\u2019s headlines splashed the words of their own trade association - £800 million of export orders this year. The Rolls Royce American aero-engine order; the largest export order in Britain's history, and designed to be a forerunner of still larger contracts.In the atomic energy industry, the funda­mental reorganisation announced by Tony Wedgwood Benn a few weeks ago. A re­organisation designed to ensure that Britain\u2019s research lead in the civil uses of atomic energy can be matched by a corresponding success in sales of multi-million-pound nuclear reactors abroad. Here again we are creating what five years ago at Scarborough we planned to create. Great new science-based industries with public enterprise not only providing the science base but participating through a major shareholding in the industry which is being created to exploit the results of that research.The three great new import-saving aluminium smelters foreshadowed in my speech last year, now given the green light in three development areas - English, Scot­tish and Welsh. Computers - the industry the Tories were allowing to die, now under I.R.C. sponsorship a great £100-million complex. The most powerful computer com­plex outside America, now poised for an aggressive export sales campaign in the markets of the world in contrast to countries not very far away which tamely allowed their industries to submit to the American invasion.These examples I have given are part, but only part, of the far wider emerging pattern in Britain\u2019s science-based industrial revolu­tion. And all of this could have been started not in 1964 but ten years earlier if we had not then had a Government whose industrial posture was unconcern and abdication. Men who were prepared to wash their hands and see British industry decline in relation to that of almost every other advanced indus­trial country. Men who left vital industrial decisions to the haggling of the market place and the clamour of take-over bidders whose motive was not, as I.R.C. are insisting in the mergers of today, greater industrial efficiency but the exploitation of some under-valued piece of property or tax manoeuvre. Even today, four years after, they have not learned. Our conception of a powerful, streamlined modern industrial base. Their leadership - look at last week\u2019s speeches - seem incapable of raising their eyes above the level of a tooth and claw price war in a street-corner shop.I know that industrial reconstruction on such a scale causes grave anxieties amongst many here as we see new industrial giants developing in private industry. Yes, many of them as a result of deliberate Government purpose. Where industrial reconstruction leading to larger integrated units creates greater industrial efficiency based not only on size but on an associated management revolution, the Government believe that this process should be not only tolerated but actively encouraged. I emphasise the motive of efficiency and export power, in contrast to those takeovers whose motive is purely financial and bears no relation to efficiency. And particularly in contrast to those where, after a perhaps unwholesome series of financial manoeuvres, the industry concerned is left saddled with an insupportable burden of financial commitments.This is why; following the totally inadequate consultation which attended the GEC/AEI merger, I insisted in the House of Commons on a code of conduct providing for full consultation. Barbara\u2019s department took charge of this and published the new agreed code this summer - effective in the case of GEC/English Electric.So far, I have dealt with reorganisation in what are predominantly growth industries. Reorganisation means change and change is painful We are a Party of change and because of this we have always put in the forefront the measures needed to ease the effects of change on those most likely to be hurt. The Government took early action through redundancy payments, wage-related benefits, a rapid extension of industrial training facilities and in other ways, so that as industrial reorganisation gathered speed, those least able to defend themselves could be protected.Most of the industries to which I have referred, most of those where industrial restructuring is taking place, are growth industries. That restructuring, whatever the short-term painful effects, is the best means, through increasing our competitive power, of providing real security for workers in the future. Restructuring is the condition of growth, and growth is the condition of job security, not for these industries alone but for Britain. I remind this Conference of what Barbara said, dealing with these matters in her speech on Sunday at the Eve of Conference demonstration, when she said that the question was not how many would lose their jobs if mergers took place, but how many more would lose any hope of a job if we were not pressing on with the restructuring of industry.It is the industries where change is associated with contraction which create the biggest human and social problems. The railways, the coal and cotton industries and, in certain sectors, steel, are industries where rapid technological change means redundancies; where, in very many cases, there is little prospect or re-employment within the industry.The Government realise what this means both for individuals and for whole communities, many of them in remote areas. That is why in the case of coal we have provided machinery for thorough consultation at national, regional and local level. That is why the Coal Industry Act of last year makes provision on an unprecedented scale at a cost of £133 million to soften the impact of economic change. For example, for redun­dant men over 55, for whom other work is not available, it provides three years\u2019 guaranteed income equal to 90 per cent of their previous take-home pay.That is why we have insisted on expanding the facilities for training both in our rapidly extended Government Training Centre pro­gramme and in Government assisted training within industry. Government training centres alone - there are today three times as many in operation as there were five years ago when the Tories had been 12 years in office. But we still need more places, particularly for retraining those who have lost their jobs through industrial change. Last year emphasised that all we are doing in industrial training will be wasted if we cannot end the local trade union obstruction to the employment of men who have been trained in new skills.That is why, too, we have over the past year produced still more powerful incen­tives to aid regional development with new, unprecedented help for the new Special Development Areas - areas where, because of the closure of a colliery, because of remoteness from other industrial centres, an intolerable rate of unemployment results.In my speech a year ago, I referred to regional development as Britain\u2019s new frontier. It is not for me today to set out in detail all the further actions we have taken. Let me give you one fact. Special­ - discriminatory - assistance to the develop­ment areas this year, including the additional investment grant differential is running at £250 million compared with about £150 million last year, and a mere £18 million in the last year of the Tories.A streamlined, powerful, efficient, indus­trial base in Britain - that is what the British people are building with the aid of the policies I have just described. But this industrial reconstruction, while it is an essential condition for putting Britain right, cannot succeed unless our people are prepared to accept Britain\u2019s new role in the world for the later 1960s and the 1970s. This is not easy. It has not been easy for any of us to readjust to the new situation. Two years ago I told this Party that never again would Britain engage in any war, other than self-defence, except on a basis of collective security. Our whole defence policy has been based on the rejection of unilateral, go-it-­alone, do-it-yourself, military adventures, the rejection equally of Suez imperialism, and the delusion of the so-called independent deterrent.Reshaping of our defence commitments began as soon as we took office; it has been a continuing process, culminating in this year\u2019s defence accounts. As part of the comprehensive statement on Government expen­diture which I announced in January, I made clear that following the evacuation of Aden, our defence planning would be based on a withdrawal of all our forces from our principal Far Eastern bases and from the Persian Gulf, to take effect by the end of 1971. I said further that we recognise \u2018that our security lies fundamentally in Europe and must be based on the North Atlantic Alliance.\u2019I do not intend to anticipate today the debates they will be holding next week on our firm announcement to withdraw from the Far East and the Gulf. On the one hand, the official leadership is committed by speeches from Canberra to Cornwall to the proposition that we have to spend hundreds of millions maintaining a phantom military presence in the Middle East and Far East. While even the right wing Guru from Wolverhampton recognises that you cannot promise the country sweeping cuts in Government expenditure while pouring hundreds of millions into maintaining in the Far East a military establishment which is increasingly irrelevant to Britain\u2019s emerg­ing role in the modern world.Defence, then. And if even with the strengthening of the industrial base which we are achieving, we can no longer afford the role of world policeman, equally we can no longer afford the role of world banker.I have told you how the prestige policy of borrowing short and lending long has made Britain vulnerable to the shocks of world capital movements, even when our trade and industrial base was improving. Last year a crisis in the Middle East led to financial turbulence and panic withdrawals of sterling balances. The rapid improvement in our balance of payments was halted and this was a major factor in driving us to devaluation. In 13 years they were increasing not only Britain\u2019s military overstretch, but also our monetary overstretch. We have sought con­sistently for a revolutionary change in world finance. This is now beginning to show results. If there can be no defence policy for Britain except on a collective basis, still more is this true of Britain\u2019s overseas cur­rency position. We are all members one of another. The lessons for all of us in the sterling area, and, more widely for the world financial community, have been underlined by the Basle Agreement.Monetary chauvinism is as out of date for Britain as military chauvinism. Following Basle, we now have a collective international role for sterling. And we must go on from there. Our economic role in the world depends much more directly on the efforts we ourselves make to put our house in order.Your Government accepts this challenge. And again I repeat, we shall hold firmly on the course that the Government has set. We shall expect the full support of this movement in carrying this through.And we have the right to ask for this. Because, while our industrial reorganisation and our financial reorganisation have had of necessity to be a slow and painful process, there is one part of our policy, and a part very close to the hearts of the members of this movement, on which we have gone ahead of the schedule we put to the British people in 1964.The economic strength we are earning the hard way is being built up not for the purpose of statistical satisfaction, not even for economic independence; it is the necessary condition of still further social advance here; and of our aid to hungry nations over­seas. That is what socialism means. Speeches and resolutions will not earn that advance. Only work - and the painful processes of change.Last year I gave Conference the figures for each of the social services, showing the tremendous increase in the resources the Government had by that time made avail­able compared with the last full year of our Conservative predecessors.In the year since then, expansion has continued in every area of the social services. In that year - I take the latest figures - we have completed an all time record of almost 420,000 houses. In that year we have com­pleted an all time record figure of 821 primary and secondary schools and over 375,000 school places. Remember the Tory 1964 election posters \u2018-Sh! Don\u2019t tell the Labour Party the Conservatives are chalk­ing up 10 new schools a week.\u2019 Now over this past year we have been building not 10 schools a week, but practically 16. Sh! The Conservatives don\u2019t want to know.Again in that year we have invested another all time record figure of £109.7 million in hospital building, providing for a record number of modern hospital beds. In that year we have completed a record number of health centres. Three times last year\u2019s completions.In human terms again this autumn we shall have some 203,000 students starting a new term at university; 111,000 starting a new term at colleges of education and 205,000 students starting a new term to study advanced courses at colleges of further education. We are, in 1968, ahead of the Robbins\u2019 target for the number of full-time students in higher education for 1971. (Flash­back to Scarborough 1963)Again, the best available figures show that in our hospitals we had 130,000 whole-time nursing and midwifery staff, 23 per cent more than four years ago. This means, just as much as our all time record hospital building programme, better treatment, better comfort for the sick.In cash terms, the retirement pension, widow\u2019s pension, flat rate unemployment and sickness benefits, have all been raised to a new record level of £4 10s. per week for a single person and £7 6s. for a married couple. Supplementary benefits, raised in October last year, go up again next week. The extended provision for rate rebates, for families in greatest need, comes into force today. To relieve what has now become the greatest problem of poverty in the country, the problem of large families, family allow­ances next week will stand at 18 to 20 shillings per week, against 8 to 10 shillings a year ago.I know family allowances are unpopular with very many of our people. I know that payment of family allowances is subject to widespread criticism and even more wide­spread misrepresentation. But if you accept that the duty of the community is to eliminate poverty, then we cannot turn aside from this great problem of poverty in our families.This is why we have acted. Explain it. Stop apologising. Stop defending. We have a duty to the least privileged in our com­munity. We have to do what is right simply because it is right.In January, the Government\u2019s action to curb rising rates of expenditure from defence to the social services has, I know, caused great concern to every delegate here. Deeply repugnant decisions had to be taken, desirable and urgent reforms postponed. But to say that, and feel it, does not mean, in the words I hear so often, that we have cut the social services. We have not. What we have done is to restrain the rate of future increase. But this year\u2019s expenditure on the health and welfare service is planned at £38 million more than last year, over 50 per cent above the last year of the Tories. Next year it is planned to rise by a further £63 million; and it is planned to go on rising. This year\u2019s expenditure on education is running at a rate of £77 million more than last year, and next year it is planned to rise by a further £93 million, with further rises in later years. Expenditure on social security is £176 million above last year and next year it is planned to rise further.Last year I compared our total expendi­ture on the social services with our total expenditure on defence. After the January decisions, the social services will be rising and defence expenditure will be falling still more sharply than we planned a year ago. Today, for every hundred pounds we are spending on defence, we are spending £364 on the social services. Next year for every hundred pounds we are spending on defence we shall be spending £376 on the social services: This proportion will grow year by year.You have made clear, at every level in the Party, your feelings about one or another of the January measures. That is the right of every member of this Party. That is why we are a great movement. Having done that, now it is equally our duty to go out and proclaim our achievements. (Yours, too, if I may say so)For they are great achievements and they are your achievements. These figures of financial provision, of bricks and mortar, and hospital beds and school places are the munitions of the social revolution. Year by year they represent an emerging pattern of an approach to social problems and social need which is based on priorities, inevitably changing priorities.We inherited a great problem of poverty we were pledged to eradicate. We began where that poverty was then most severe, but now the priorities are changing as we are finding resources to deal with the problem I have spoken of, the problem of large families. As we move from one area of the social services to another, from flat rate to earnings-related benefits, this is to be crowned by the plan which will soon be put before the country, the completion of our comprehensive review of social security, our great plan for National Superannuation, yes, the end of the Tory swindle.Changing priorities in education. The urgent provisions we had to make for primary schools and for better teacher train­ing facilities. Education is opportunity and, year by year, we are tackling on a priority basis those problems, from slum schools to shortage of teachers which deny opportunity. But, more clearly than ever, is emerging the great guarantee of educational opportunity - the widespread adoption of comprehensive education.Changing priorities in housing over four years. Freedom from eviction, fair rents. More houses built to let. The attack on the slums. Option mortgages and 100 per cent mortgages for lower income families want­ing to own their own homes. And as we come to terms more and more with the inherited problem of the slums, growing provision for a new priority - the improve­ment of older but structurally sound houses.Our socialism is not measured in material progress only. When, before 1964, we charted the path that Britain would follow under a Labour Government, we spoke of a new concept of freedom, the broader freedom without which social democracywould be meaningless. Freedom from contempt, the enhancing of the dignity of man.This is the only answer to the violent society. We in the Labour movement oppose the importation of violence; equally we oppose the importation of authoritarianism to meet that violence. Some public figures provoke the one, and then invoke the other to deal with it.This problem of violence has become a world problem. It is associated in many countries with a swing to the right. Only the forces of reaction, it is urged, have the will and the ruthlessness to stamp out the cult of violence which their words and policies have incited.The words of the Swedish Prime Minister at our demonstration on Sunday are the answer. An answer not in words only, but backed by one of the greatest election victories in his country\u2019s history.We shall meet the appeal to reaction here in Britain as Swedish Social Democracy has met it, not by complacent assertions that it can\u2019t happen here, but by asserting our faith that social grievances require social solu­tions - by positive social action by the State. By what, the Swedes in their election called the Strong Society.We reject equally the apostles of authori­tarian violence on the one hand and negative violence on the other. Both are essentially and profoundly anti-democratic. Both seek to destroy. The Conservatives at home and abroad seek to destroy the defences we have built for the weak against those who abuse economic and social power. The nihilists in their despair seek to destroy the very fabric of organised society.We assert that the challenge of violence can be met only by a strong community responsibility to protect the individual against the insolence of economic and social power.We are the Party of human rights. The only Party of human rights that will be speaking from this platform this month. Human rights: this has been the central theme of this Government\u2019s actions from the day we took office. In my first speech as Prime Minister I got embroiled with the Tories over Smethwick. In our first inter­national statement, we issued, in the strongest terms, a warning against racial extremists in Rhodesia - a warning of what we should have to do when faced with an outbreak of racial extremism in Rhodesia - a warning on which we had to act - followed by the assertion of the six principles on which we stood and on which we stand.For the struggle against racialism is a world-wide fight. It is the dignity of man for which we are fighting. If what we assert is true for Birmingham, it is true for Bulawayo.Last May Day, I said that this moral law was equally binding whether we were talking of Birmingham, England, or Birmingham, Alabama. But this is not a moral law that is binding in respect of race alone. It is binding for all issues involving freedom and democratic institutions.If ever there were a condemnation of the values of the Party which forms Her Majesty\u2019s Opposition, it is the fact that the virus of Powellism has taken so firm a hold, at every level; that last April those who sought to disembarrass themselves of the man felt constrained to claim that they were not dissociating themselves from his doctrine but only from his phraseology. That it was all a matter of words. That was April. In September even the words didn\u2019t matter any more.Four years, then, have seen an emerging pattern. Britain\u2019s response in terms going far beyond money and materials, to the challenge of a world which is rapidly chang­ing, to the challenge presented by the fact that Britain\u2019s role in that world has changed. It is a response marked by the qualities which history will ascribe to this Government - resolution and determination in economic recovery and reconstruction, even if this has meant standing firm against deeply cherished attitudes of the past. In economic affairs and more widely the quality of resilience and a willingness to accept change, indeed what­ever the short-term costs, to harness change to our purposes. Above all the quality of compassion and concern, the concern for the material wants of those here and amongst us and throughout the Commonwealth and yet wider; and, transcending material wants, concern for the right and dignity of men as individuals.These emerging themes were based on predetermined principles. And within those principles a strategy which has meant responding to changes in the nature of the problems we have had to face. We have never been afraid to learn from our own experience, even though the lessons have, sometimes, been bitter. The Conservatives have shown, and predictably will show here again at Blackpool next week, that they have learnt nothing even from their own experi­ence; that this rapidly changing world - a world of excitement and opportunity as well as challenge - is a world they shrink to enter. Not only are they unable to appreciate the basic character of the problems that have to be solved, they have not even grasped yet what the problems are. We shall hear nothing from Blackpool next week except an attempt to solve the problems of yester­day by the methods of the day before yesterday.We here can see the emerging themes of our comprehensive attack on the problems which we have inherited. Behind the themes, the strategy for the future. There is no party political strategy. There is only the strategy for Britain.And the strategy for Britain means con­tinuing to pursue the economic policies that are necessary, regardless of popularity, what­ever the pressures, until we are paying our way and have achieved independence. At the end of the road, Britain will reap all the dividends from the industrial change which at such pain, at such cost, we are forcing through. This industrial change is the economic miracle of which independent commentators were beginning to write and speak in the spring, the commentators whom I quoted at Newtown.I warned then at Newtown that if we were to let up now, if we allowed anything our opponents did to cause us to lose our nerve, it is they, and not we, who would reap the fruits of all we have done. I said then, I repeat today, that is not going to happen. I quoted the words of Nye Bevan - words spoken from the Opposition front bench - when he said that the Tories were reaping the fruits of the trees we had planted. It has been a backbreaking job planting those trees. I intend to see they are not going to gather that fruit a second time.And this means we continue in the policies the Government have laid down. For today, as for four years, we have to face the con­flict between what is right in the long-term and what is necessary in the short-term.The short-term measures we have taken, first in defence of the pound, and now to make devaluation work; the long-term measures towards the restructuring of indus­try and the initiation of an incomes/prices policy; these measures have been devoted in the first instance to working with the system we have inherited. What we have yet to see are the results of the changes in the system which we have set in train, particu­larly those directed to broadening and modernising the industrial base on which our whole economic future depends.For three of these four years we were engaged in the battle to defend the pound. It was right to fight that battle, and for a great part of that fight our rapidly diminish­ing deficit suggested that it could be won. Had we won it, we could have restored what had not been bequeathed to us, independence and freedom of action, at less cost to the lower-paid workers and those who in the past have always paid the price of economic crisis.Every devaluation in other countries has meant a heavy price for those least able to defend themselves. This is why we never regarded it as an easy way out when siren voices were pressing it upon us as a panacea for all our problems. It has not been an easy way out. The need for stricter control of expenditure, public and private, is greater than ever. The need for a sane, planned prices and incomes policy is greater than ever. Above all the paramount need for increased productivity is greater than ever.Everything for which we have fought before devaluation we are fighting for now. Our policy is the same policy pursued with more drastic means. Devaluation was no easy way of dealing with our problems. It meant inevitable sacrifices and inequalities - sacrifices and inequalities we have fought by special measures to protect those relying on social security and to protect the larger families on lower incomes. To accept the logic of a free-for-all economy, a free-for-all in wages would mean that the lowest paid would suffer.For we came to power to put the balance right. The balance between those who suffered and those who gained in the Tory free-for-all. The balance between private and public expenditure.We have gone through a great deal together in defence of everything we stand for, against everything they are capable of throwing at us. But we have come through. And we are now on the attack again.I have set out the task of this Party, as we go forward from defence to attack. It is the job of every member of this Party to join with their Government in defending the bastions we have won from those who would seek to drive us out for their own gain. It is for every member of this Party to join us in attacking the false and empty doctrines of those who, having failed the nation, now seek to exploit the problems of change in order to get back into power to control the destinies of a nation whose problems they do not understand.How many of our members, bewildered by the barrage of misrepresentation, have even failed to defend us against the attacks of an unscrupulous Establishment? But it is not a defensive posture for which I ask. I charge you now to go over to the attack, yes, attack them on all the things we have had to do to strengthen the economy, attack them above all on the positive things we have done, which they have opposed, and which even now they are seeking to under­mine - not least the programme of social advance of these last four years, but indeed the Welfare State itself.For us clearly the emerging pattern shows us the way forward. It is still not an easy way nor shall we offer you an easy way. It is still not a time for complacency and over-confidence, but we are now setting out on the decisive year. A year in which what we all do can decide the future of this movement, the future of this country. Let us hammer out together the way forward for this crucial year. Let others divide. We have something to fight for, something that is worth all the attacks, worth all the toil, worth all the work we still have to do. The future of Britain and the future of our children. A future for which we must go out and fight, a future which fighting we shall win.

aVMadam Chairman and fellow delegates, I present to conference the Par­liamentary Report.As you know, Madam Chairman, I always believe what I read in the newspapers. Well, I mean, don\u2019t we all? Now I read that this is the last Labour conference before your Government seeks a fresh mandate. I wouldn\u2019t know - yet. It could well be.Every delegate here knows what is at stake. What is at stake for Labour. But even more, what is at stake for Britain.Now, as we look at the first five years of Labour in power, there are those who are at last beginning to see the pattern developing.I am a little bit worried that those who talked us down so much may now be going to the opposite extreme. My answer to them is that we shall show the same steadiness of nerve when they are writing up our suc­cesses as we showed when they hadn\u2019t a good word to say about us.Five years of change. Labour is chang­ing Britain, and changing it for the better. There can be no going back.Look around. Look at the changing face of Britain. Everyone here knows, because he has seen what is developing in his own area. That new hospital - just one in an all-time record hospital-building programme. Those new schools - 3,500 of them opened under Labour. Housing - nearly two mil­lion families in new homes built under Labour. The fresh look on the face of our older towns and cities. The change and the hope which Labour policies have brought to our older industrial communities.Hope in the changing North, hope in a re-born Scotland, hope and change in Wales. These are the areas which, at conference two years ago, I pledged would be the New Frontier of industrial development. You know what Labour is doing to bring work to these areas. You have seen the factories that are going up.The Conservatives have announced that if they got back to office, they would cut back on the resources we are spending on this job. We are promoting change. Theirs is a prescription to bring back decay.Look around. How much has already been done to end the vulgar distortions they so deliberately and selfishly developed. Just ten years ago this month, they were fightingan election on the gospel of materialism.In fact, if we were to hire Colman, Prentis and Varley today they could tell the same glittering story of increases by the hundred thousand, by the million, increases under the Labour Government, in the ownership of cars, washing machines, telephones, refrigerators, T.V. sets, transistors, the lot. As they could for every other industrial country. The Scandinavian countries, the Six, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, America, the rest. It has been going on continuously under Labour as under the Tories. But that was all they had to boast about.What your Government is proud of is that, at the same time, we have been cor­recting the distortions. We have been build­ing a compassionate society.Despite all the cramping, and, at times, menacing effects of the international economic crises into which this country was allowed to drift five and more years ago, we are, this year, spending on all our social services, including health, housing and education, 70 per cent more than in the last full year of the Tories.We are changing Britain for the better. We are already creating a Britain of which we can be proud. And the world knows it. The world\u2019s tourists are coming here in their millions. We have all seen them here this summer. They are coming here to buy because they get better value for money in our shops than anywhere else in Europe. But they are coming, above all, because the new Britain is exciting.Last year, nearly five million tourists came to Britain, almost half as many again as the numbers who came to look at Britain in 1964. Still more this year. It is not just the Tower of London, not just the Beef­eaters they want to see either, nor even the Kings Road. Nor only London, or even Edinburgh, or Caernarvon. It is Britain.Month after month, the Tories have been painting the picture of a Britain down in the dumps. That\u2019s how they see our country today. That\u2019s how they want to see it. But it isn\u2019t the Britain that really exists. It isn\u2019t the Britain that these hundreds of thousands of tourists have been coming here to take a look at. They have been coming here because to them Britain - yes, Britain with a Labour Government - is an exciting place. A Britain with life and vigour and achievement. With care and compassion.Many of our visitors come to look at what British industry has done, and at the people who have made it possible. Many others come to see what we are doing in the imaginative creation of new com­munities. Britain\u2019s New Town designs are a focus of admiration when architects and planners meet.Britain is exciting because of the change in the pattern and quality of life. Especially for the young ones everywhere. A lot of us were at the Durham Gala this year. Look at the kids who were there. Keen, lively. And we have got kids like them everywhere in this country of ours.It is not only that they face much brighter prospects - educational opportunity, greater freedom, a much wider range of prospects in their work, a much wider variety of things to spend their money on. Of course, all this is true. It is the way they reflect all these things in how they look, how they dress, their sense of fun and enjoyment.Youth is joining in creating a new society. Youth is involved in these changes. And they have a sense of involvement. Labour is recognising this, by giving them rights and responsibilities which young people have never had before. This liveliness bears no relation to the dispirited society of Tory mythology. We are people who are getting things done.No, we didn\u2019t have the billions to get to the moon. But we\u2019re winning quite a lot of golds these days down here. I don\u2019t just mean sport - though I remember the Tory laments in the years after the war, that we were not winning the medals and the cups because athletes in a socialist Britain must by definition be undernourished and starving. Even our horses, so the legend went.Our technological progress in both public or private industry gets a great deal more recognition and respect abroad than it gets in the jaundiced columns of the Tory press. It has not just happened. It is the result of the Government\u2019s industrial policy over the past five years, a policy which is now delivering the goods.Productivity in Britain\u2019s coal industry increased more than 9 per cent last year, now ahead of the European Community. In nuclear energy - our prototype fast reactor now going ahead at Dounreay is 3 or 4 years ahead of anything else in operation or planned in any part of the Western world, including America. A science based industry and it\u2019s in a development area.So are the aluminium smelters now being built by private industry with Government encouragement; in three development areas, Northumberland, Invergordon, Anglesey. Yet, the Leader of the Opposition the other day was reported as criticising these ventures, despite the work they create, despite the imports they will save. Sour comment, but what about the other success stories?We lead the world in vertical and short take-off aircraft. The Rolls-Royce engine, RB211, which won from America the biggest order in the history of British aviation. And more to come. A triumph of private enter­prise, but a triumph for imaginative Govern­ment action in providing the decisive launch­ing aid.The hovercraft, fostered by Labour\u2019s National Research Development Corpora­tion and by the Ministry of Technology. Unrivalled in the export markets of the world.The Cephalosporin antibiotic used to save lives where penicillin and other established drugs failed to cure; Cephalosporin, now earning millions of dollars a year from its American royalties alone, and making a profit for the British taxpayer.Then there is spray steel making; satellite communications stations; pulse code modulation; Dracone barges; the new aviation navigational aids; the ammonia steam-naphtha process; the electron-probe analyser and the rest.And still newer developments. Carbon fibres, already in use in aviation but likely to transform a growing part of the world\u2019s industries. The biggest development in world raw materials since the discovery of man­made fibres and special steels. This is a new British achievement, a product of work in a Government research establishment developed by public enterprise under Labour Government legislation in Collaboration with industry. And American private enterprise is falling over itself to buy the right to use this product of British public enterprise.Some of these developments, such as the creation of the most powerful computer industry in the world outside American ownership, depend directly on Government assistance through the I.R C., against which the Tories fought, before, during and after the last election. Or aid through the Indust­rial Expansion Act which raised them to a new pitch of frenzy eighteen months ago. The Leader of the Opposition has now solemnly pledged his Party, if he ever got the chance, to end both.Can you recognise this Britain of achieve­ment in the welter of propaganda the Tories are pouring out to denigrate the work of their fellow citizens? This sort of Tory propaganda tries to make Britain out to be as dingy as those who peddle the propaganda.With the generosity which inspires all my comments on the Opposition Party, I said not long ago that I acquitted them, at any rate, of any charge of patriotism so far as the economic welfare of our nation is con­cerned. When the economic indices in any month give comfort to Britain\u2019s critics and enemies abroad, you can see all their top people - looking like Victorian undertakers  welcoming a wet winter and the promise of a full churchyard.No-one here is going to get over-excited about the trade figures of one single month. But I\u2019ll say this to you. There is reason for pride in the fact that in the first eight months of this year, our exports are up by 9 per cent over the first eight months of last year, by volume,. And 30 per cent above the exports for the same months of 1964 - again by volume. And the orders for next year\u2019s shipments are rising sharply.There was that remarkable statement in The Economist newspaper only a few days ago. They confessed that a few weeks earlier they had been expressing deep fears about Britain\u2019s economic situation. Now they say, and I quote their words: \u2018In these past few summer months of 1969, Britain has been running one of the strongest balances of payments among the major powers of the world; indeed, on the face of the latest figures, the second strongest behind only Germany.\u2019I welcome the editor\u2019s apology, though I think he is pitching it a bit high now. I am not sure I like these gentlemen claiming economic miraclesWe all recall how Her Majesty\u2019s Opposition were dining out on the prospects of our failing to get the balance of payments into surplus. The champagne corks popping. Now, as Britain moves from long years of deficit into surplus, their champagne is turning into gripe-water. Earlier this month came the Treasury figures for the second quarter of this year, showing a balance of payments surplus of £190 millions, that is seasonally corrected, £100 millions.Britain\u2019s friends applauded these figures. But not the Leader of the Conservative Party. This is what he said. Sourly he dismissed Britain\u2019s achievement. I quote: \u2018The second quarter is always a good quarter... If we are to keep the thing in perspective, we have to recognise that this comes at the end of five years of Labour Government.\u2019Well of course he has got a point. The second quarter of the year is usually - he said always - seasonally favourable. He has got another point. We have been in office nearly five years. So let us see what the balance of payments surplus was in the seasonally favourable second quarter of 1964, when the Rt. Hon. Gentleman himself was in charge of the nation\u2019s overseas trade. Remember our surplus in 1969 was £190 millions \u2013 that\u2019s plus. What was their sur­plus? There was no surplus. Their achievement was a deficit of £184 millions - a minus. Their achievement after nearly thirteen years was to produce a quarter\u2019s results £374 millions worse than what we have just published after less than five years. And in the second quarter. \u2018The second quarter is always a good quarter.\u2019Not when he was in charge.I\u2019ve often tried to understand the way their minds work. I think it\u2019s this. It is really a psychiatric problem caused by deprivation from the office to which they thought providence had called them at birth - or even before. This has so warped their vision that a Tory deficit of £184 millions was a sign of unparalleled economic strength and virility, while a Labour surplus of £190 millions is the result of an impoverished and debilitated nation, crippled, paralysed, shackled by bureaucratic controls, bled white by taxation.I believe they are getting rather worried about the image they will be presenting in this hall next weak. I have given some thought to their problem. What I think they should do is get a new flag, like their co-belligerent Ian Smith. I have gone to the trouble of working out a motto for them - Bonum patriae Conservatoribus pessimum, which being translated, broadly indicates that what is good for the country is bad for the Tories.But I don\u2019t give up hope for them. They are very well bred. I read a few weeks ago that there were more Etonians on the Tory front bench now than even in the Macmillan and Douglas-Home Cabinets. So perhaps they will respond to my appeal to them to keep all their sour gripes for the home market, and not use them for export.We are getting used to this talking down of Britain when they go abroad.He was at it again a few days ago. The Conservative Central Office disseminated an article he had written in the American journal Foreign Affairs, in which he affected to claim that Britain was less able to com­pete in the European Economic Community than in 1962. Fortunately, the American audience he was addressing can form their own opinion on the facts. It is a pity he did not study that moving ballad of John, Greenleaf Whittier, \u2018Bar­bara Frietchie\u2019 \u2013\u2018Shoot, if you must, this old grey head. But spare your country\u2019s flag, she said.\u2019I will make them this offer and they can consider it next week. If they stop telling lies about us, we will stop telling the truth about them.But for modern Tories, lack of economic patriotism is not enough. There must also be a total lack of responsibility in the formulation of their so-called policies.This has taken the form of a rake\u2019s progress of mounting expenditure commit­ments, combined with mouth-watering pledges to reduce taxation. Their Party spokesmen, from the Leader of the Op­position sideways, have committed them­selves to an East of Suez presence. The cost of this has been authoritatively estimated at between £250m and £300m a year. What with a fifth Polaris submarine, and other commitments, they are committed to increased expenditure on defence on a scale of over £300m a year.And all this before they get a chance to let Julian Amery loose on another flock of costly prestige aircraft. Denis Healey has already saved the country £2,000m as against the programme we inherited. But there are Tory expenditure commitments outside, in addition to the defence field.Their own Daily Telegraph, a fortnight ago said, \u2018The Conservative promises to spend are legion.\u2019 Shadow after Shadow pops up, to promise £20m here, £50m there, £100m somewhere else. Shadow beneficiaries, like the promises, are legion. Hardly a single deserving or undeserving section of the community is omitted, provided there is a prospective pay-off in votes.Some of these are specific pledges, naming the amount, the concessions. Some are vague promises, as Tory leaders take to the road dispensing to each area they visit Shadow largesse froth their inexhaustible pork barrel.The Telegraph\u2019s independent costing? I quote: \u2018The party has not put any figure on its total of promises, but it is hard to see them costing less than £1,000m a year.\u2019That grim looking family in the Tory posters would really be paying too much tax.Irresponsibility. Opportunism. Take their latest manoeuvring on the Common Market.I grant him this, no-one has been over a long period a more passionate believer in Britain joining the Common Market. But now you get the same \u2018on the one hand this and on the other hand that\u2019; the same desire to wound without being caught out striking that we have had on race, on hanging, on Rhodesia. It is, of course, no accident that Mr. Powell, a few weeks ago, announced the Tory Party\u2019s Common Mar­ket policy as his Target for 1969.But, for a vintage performance of transparent opportunism, let me take you to Sheffield last Wednesday. The aim was to create the maximum confusion by saying that a further application to join the Com­mon Market, without certain things being done, would be folly.So he set up a whole series of phoney Aunt Sallys and then proceeded to get knocked down by them.The first Aunt Sally he tangles with is his great new discovery that before entry Britain would have to be sure that all of the six present Common Market members wanted us. A brilliant perception. We can\u2019t get in unless they do want us - all of them. The Rome Treaty lays it down. That is what his 1963 veto was about.Aunt Sally No. 2. He says there must be no commitment to a federal organisation in Europe. I am gratified. Every time I have said this the Tories have attacked me.Aunt Sally No. 3. At Sheffield he attacked us in terms for our 1967 application. While he is fully in favour of going in, he was reported as saying that a great deal of damage was done to Britain\u2019s case by our application in 1967.But does he think this decision was wrong? Did he think it then? Hansard, 9th May, 1967, Col. 1300 \u2013 \u2018We welcome the application which the Government are making and we wish them every success.\u2019 Indeed even earlier on 5th November, 1966, he made a speech at Harrogate. I quote the report which said that he called on the Government for a firm declaration of intent to join the European Economic Community\u2026\u2018Let it be declared,\u2019 he said, \u2018that Britain wished to become a full wholehearted member\u2019 and he spelled out his demand for a declaration on every obligation that will be involved.He went on: \u2018Time is not on our side. Now is the moment for decision.\u2019Now nearly three years and one Powell speech later apparently it was the wrong decision.Aunt Sally No. 4. Now, as a delaying move - I quote again \u2013 \u2018The British people should be given every scrap of information available.\u2019 He boasted of how much information they gave. Really?I remember the storm in the House of Commons when, behind closed doors in Brussels, he stated Britain\u2019s entire negotiat­ing terms to the European Council of Ministers. He refused to inform the British Parliament or the British people what he had committed us all to. It was only after a leak in Western Europe seven weeks later, which was published in Britain, that they had to publish a White Paper.When Labour\u2019s Foreign Secretary stated our position and all the major issues involved at a meeting of W.E.U. on 4 July, 1967, he spoke at 4 p.m. and the White Paper was laid before the House an hour later.\u2018All the information?\u2019 All we got from him were those monthly recitals giving the latest state of play on the higher groceries.We have always insisted that before any decision can be taken, Parliament and the people have to be given the facts. That is our position today. And now the very full information we gave in 1967 has to be brought up to date.Weeks ago, I sent an instruction that new calculations should be undertaken of the estimates and assessments made two and a half years ago.Agriculture and the cost to Britain\u2019s balance of payments, on various possible assumptions about developments in agricul­tural prices.Capital movements. The estimate of the balance of advantage or disadvantage of capital movements, where a great deal has changed since 1967.The trade balance. Since 1967 British exports to the Six have increased by 41 per cent by value. What new assessments can be made on likely trends in both exports and imports?These estimates are being prepared by the combined action of all the Departments concerned. When they are ready, they will be made available to Parliament, for public discussion and debate.When we announced our Common Market policy in 1967 we said that, in or out of Europe, Britain had to be strong. If we failed to build up our economic strength, then, in Europe, we should not be able to face the competition. If we failed to build up our economic strength, then, outside Europe, we should become a backwater. So we gave first priority to building up our economic strength.And, in what we have done, our security and our independence lie. Whatever the outcome of negotiations about entry. Our application remains. Our statement of 4 July, 1967, remains, subject to changes made necessary by the passage of events. Our position is clear.The Six have many problems, not least the present state of European agriculture. If they, the Six, are ready for negotiations to begin, we are ready. If, in these negotiations, we achieve terms satisfactory for Britain, on the lines we have outlined, then negotiations will succeed.But, unlike the situation in 1961, we no longer face the challenge of Europe cap-­in-hand. Europe needs us just as much, and many would say more, than we need Europe.It is the common interest of all of us to achieve economic unity. But, if this cannot be achieved, we can stand on our own feet. At a heavy price for Britain, no doubt, but at a heavier price for Europe, and at a devastating price for Europe\u2019s influence in the world.This Conference starts from the achieve­ments of the first five years of your Labour Government. It is our job over this next year to make sure that everyone in this country recognises and gives credit for these achievements. We all know it can be done.But, I must warn you, now is the time for confidence but not complacency. The 1945 Government perished because by 1950 powerful voices, both inside and outside the Party, were urging that all we had to do was to consolidate what had been achieved. They said the main job had been done. But our job is only beginning.This Government\u2019s programme of urgent and forward-looking legislation is enough to keep Parliament busy for the first two or three years of the next Parliament.The legislation, all the work of the Labour Government, after the next election will continue to reflect changing priorities. In the last five years most of our energy has had to go into dealing with the balance of payments problem, and into the reorganisation and modernisation of industry.But for us as socialists, technological achievements and the balance of payments surplus are not ends in themselves but only means. Means to those ends which we are in politics to achieve, human dignity and social justice.The priorities of the past five years have been dictated by the over-riding economic situation and by the beginning of our attack on poverty and the major social problems. But as socialists we must con­tinuously change our priorities. Change the priorities because as we change society, as we advance, the problems of society are changing. And as we advance, the stan­dards we set ourselves also advance.In opposition we equipped ourselves to deal with the problems neglected by the Tories and based our priorities on them. Some may even have thought that that was the only job we needed to do. But exper­ience of government has emphasised new needs and therefore new priorities.This is why Labour Government always has work to do. This is why Labour Government can never run out of steam.In the years ahead we have still got to make economic strength and a balance of payments surplus an urgent priority. This is why we are not going to imperil the hard fought ground we have won in the battle for economic solvency and economic independence.Without this strengthening base we shall, not able to sustain that rate of growth of the economy which makes it possible for us to meet in full the growing priority needs of our society, including full employ­ment.Without this strengthening base we can­not contribute, as we should, to the needs of the developing countries who constitute half of mankind.A few months ago we had a great Commonwealth Conference in London. Twenty-eight countries - most of them not long ago subject dependencies of an empire, now all of them independent, eight of them having achieved that independence since 1964. A great deal of the time of that con­ference was devoted to economic affairs, the living standards of the one quarter of the world\u2019s population which between us we represented.For them, and for others, the problem is not whether the rate of growth of the British economy is going to mean that we can treble or quadruple our own standard of living per head by the end of the century. What half of mankind is concerned about is whether they can avoid, and whether we can help them avoid, a cut in their own miserably inadequate standard of living.That is why we need strength at home, and as we achieve it we shall be increasingly concerned with the broader perspectives of industrial change. We shall be increasingly concerned with investment in human beings as well as investment in technology.More and more we have to concentrate at every level in Government and industry on the basic problems which undermine industrial relations. Problems, not of Britain only or mainly, but problems that are now being faced by Germany, France, Italy, the United States.More and more we have got to ensure that those who give their skill to industry are enabled to contribute more to the de­cisions of industry. More and more we have to find means of making a reality of in­volvement and participation by workers in industry - making a reality of the National Executive Committee document on Industrial Democracy which the N.E.C. pre­pared under the chairmanship of Jack Jones and which was approved by confer­ence last year.Unless we do that, any industrial policy would simply make eleven million indus­trial workers slaves of a process, slaves of a machine. We intend the process and the machine to be the means to a fuller life for them. Fuller, not only in terms of the reward of their labour. Fuller, not only in terms of the increased social wage which a more efficient economic machine will make increasingly possible. But fuller too, in other aspects of the quality of life. In more leisure and in fuller facilities for the enjoyment of leisure.Madam Chairman, looking back over this past decade it is clear that the 1960\u2019s have been a period of immense change and economic crisis for Britain. The politics of the 60\u2019s have inevitably been heavily centred on the problems of economic man­agement. The decade that lies ahead will not be free of economic difficulty. But it is already clear that other problems are moving to the centre of the political stage.First, our environment. There is a two-fold task: to remove the scars of 19th century capitalism - the derelict mills, the spoil heaps, the back-to-back houses that still disfigure so large a part of our land. At the same time we have to make sure that the second industrial revolution through which we are now passing does not be­queath a similar legacy to future genera­tions. We must deal with the problems of pollution - of the air, of the sea, of our rivers and beaches. We must also deal with the uniquely 20th century problems of noise and congestion which will increasingly dis­turb, unless checked, our urban life.First among the priorities of the 70\u2019s is to get rid of the scandal of bad housing and no-housing. That is why all of us here are on the same side as Shelter, indeed we were there first.I am not going to get into an arid and cold argument about how you define homelessness. The problem is those without homes; the problem is those living in slums; and it is the same problem of human misery.Shelter themselves acknowledged how much has been done by this Labour Government. In a few weeks time, in a little over five years, your Labour Government will have built two million homes. This is a record contribution in re-housing the homeless and the ill-housed. Homes for two million families, in just over five years.In the last four years, 340,000 slums have been cleared in Great Britain, we are proud of this record but everyone here is deter­mined to do a great deal more.More to stop 4½ million older houses from becoming the slums of the 70\u2019s. This is the task which our Housing Act of this year - a greatly underestimated piece of legislation - was specifically designed to tackle. An advance in housing standards the Tories were too mean to aspire to.So, on this vital problem of giving all our people decent homes we welcome the job that so many organisations are doing. We welcome, too, the urgent and passionate pressure which organisations like Shelter can bring to this. When it comes down to it, aren\u2019t your ideals the same as theirs?And, when it comes down to it, can their ideals ever be achieved by the Party of ­the Rent Act, the landlords, the Party which let Rachmanism flourish? By the Party which is pledged in national and local terms to cut back on the people\u2019s housing? This should be a target for Shelter. By demo­cratic means. Fighting them city by city and town by town when, in their insensate and insensitive economies, the local councils they control are cutting back in the programme needed to relieve overcrowding and to re­move slums. That is why every fighter against homelessness should be in the attack. But, let every one of them realise that if this problem is going to be solved only a Labour Government can solve it.Time and a Labour Government are needed - needed to deal with problems that have been piling up over decades, and the new problems that a socialist Britain de­mands must be solved.I said earlier, look around you at the new schools going up. But we have to look around, too, at the slum schools in our big towns and cities. And in the country­side where the children have an equal right to modern surroundings. Because, even with a record school building pro­gramme, we have had to concentrate our resources first in the new housing estates and the new overspill areas where there were no schools at all. And the downtown slum schools have remained. Slum schools can no more be tolerated by any socialist than slum houses. We have already in the past two years made a start on nursery schools. To get the priorities right for nursery schools, primary education, slum schools, time - and a Labour Government - are needed.Look too, at the new hospitals that have been built. But look around too, at the urgent need to replace those Victorian buildings. Bastilles in which too many of our sick, including the mentally sick, have to be treated. In the past few months scandals have come to light in the treatment and care of the mentally handicapped, including the very special problem of mentally handi­capped children. Scandals which must not diminish the admiration we all feel for the dedicated care which so many of our health service workers have shown and are show­ing, almost without recognition. Dick Crossman had the courage to insist that these problems should not be swept back under the carpet. This is another area of community concern which had never come into the centre of the stage because other and apparently more pressing problems crowded it out.It calls for a new priority within the health service and already the Government have recognised this. This is a problem that will be with us in the next Parliament and beyond. How we deal with this is the test of a decent society. Time and a Labour Government are needed.There are other social problems which are not problems of bricks and mortar at all. Festering social problems that plague, not only Britain, but every advanced urban community.As socialists, we have equally deep concern about these. And, because we have always asserted that social grievances require social solutions, we have the right to be listened to.Labour\u2019s promotion of community rela­tions and the eradication of social disease spots is making human rights a reality in England, Scotland and Wales - and North­ern Ireland. We reject those who exploit social grievances for political and racial purposes. That is why I today again condemn the trend to Powellist thinking and Powellist policies.There are, of course, no headlines in the patient, dedicated social work which is going on to ease the urgent social problems of our great cities and towns, still less the unsung success of those who are patiently working to bring about integrated social communities. But there are headlines in the contorted hatreds of the dedicated racialist. There are those here and abroad who seek the answer to these problems by the oppressive use of authority. Labour\u2019s answer is that authority must be used to assert human rights. Madam Chairman, we are building in Britain not an authoritarian society, nor a negatively permissive society, but a strong, tolerant and compassionate society.That is why we are concerned not only with the physical environment in which our people live and work but the moral and political environment that determines still more the health and happiness of us all.This is our faith. This is our vision. But faith and vision backed by a policy of socialist priorities.Next week in this hall they will see a gathering to which not only policies, but faith and vision, are strangers. We go forward from today into the year ahead, into the 70\u2019s. We have the faith. We have the vision. We have the means to make that faith, that vision, a reality. We cannot fail.

aVLast year this Conference met in the spirit of pride and confidence. Pride in five years\u2019 achievements in transforming our society. Confidence in the more rapid advance which lay before us once crippling economic deficit had given place to economic strength. This year our task is to resist those who seek to halt and to reverse those achievements, who seek to turn back.18 June should not be seen simply in terms of a rejection of one set of men, of one Party, of the replacement of one Government by another. It was the rejection of a system of society based on a set of values of which our people are proud, but which our opponents discounted as they preached their philosophy of greed. All that is yours, they said, all that you dream of achieving will still be yours, but you won\u2019t have to pay for it. The taxes on what you earn will be cut. There will no longer be a problem of rising prices. Their cynical conclusion was that enough of the electorate would be prepared to place at risk all the Labour Government have achieved for the better and fairer education of our children, for dignity and civilised standards in old age or sickness; all we have done to help the casualties of modern industrial society, to create a fairer and more equal society, in return for the lure held out by the Tories, the lure of increased spending power.Their cynicism was vindicated not so much by those who voted but by those who did not trouble to vote.Now our task, above all others, in the months ahead is to overcome that cynicism by making clear the values in which we believe, by convincing our people that only by our Socialist policies can those ideals be achieved.It means exposing the emptiness of those Tory promises as time reveals that emptiness; it means a determined fight for our principles as others proclaim the doctrines of selfishness and sectional advantage.It means fighting to preserve the concept of the national community, caring for all, and willing to share, against those who have reck­lessly embarked on a course of dividing our people, of promoting conflict and exalting personal advantage.How we are to do that must be, the keynote of this Conference, the task of this Movement, starting now.First we must expose what has happened in the three months since the General Election. Contrary to the promises they held out of immediate action to change the direction of our Government and our society, we have had - as even the Conservative press are beginning to bear witness - a period in which Government, action, decision, have been at a discount.This is not to say that in the first heady days no decisions were taken. There was, indeed, that short burst of \u2018instant\u2019 ideological arrogance. Three decisions within three days before the Cabinet had even met.Sir Alec Foster-Dulles searching for Com­munists on the Indian Ocean bed and concluding that the threat must be met by shipping arms to Apartheid South Africa. The Governess of the Board of Education reversing the trend of a generation of educational thought and advance by giving encouragement and fresh hope to reactionary Tory education authorities in their fight to maintain the 11-plus. The decision to put council houses on the market and diminish the stock of immediately-needed accommodation for the overcrowded and the unhoused.And very soon thereafter the decision to abolish the Land Commission: values created by the community no longer to accrue to the community: values created by the community were now to enrich the speculative developer.Instant decision when it was a question of pandering to Tory prejudice.Indecision, procrastination when problems had to be faced up to.That was why after that first week they pulled the blankets over their heads and hoped the problems would go away. The only recorded case in zoology of hibernation in the summer.This from a Government whose Leader's final clarion election call was: \u2018Britain is in danger of falling asleep.\u2019From a Leader who two days before polling day outlined a policy to be \u2018pursued immed­iately.\u2019 Immediately. An instant economic policy to be carried out at one stroke.Now, a hundred days on, even the Tory press has had to admit what everyone else knows, and most people are saying, that Britain has no government. There\u2019s been nothing like it since the Hans Andersen story when the populace turned out to see the whole imperial establishment parade through the streets - only this time it is the clothes that have no Emperor.Though no words of mine could rival the for-once attributable briefing by a Downing Street spokesman recorded in the Financial Times a few weeks ago: \u2018The Government is in the back seat but it is watching the driving mirror to see what others are doing.\u2019By mid-August Conservative papers were appealing for reassurance that a government existed. Even the Daily Sketch ran a panic headline: \u2018Reassure us, Ted.\u2019And even now, he hasn\u2019t. For what they have discovered is that the mess they are in is the promises they made, promises they cannot keep, promises they knew they wouldnot be able to keep when they made them.It is right that what they then promised must be set on the record. Kept on the record, for now we face a massive nation-wide brain­washing operation aimed at persuading you that what you heard them say is not what they now want you to think they said.They were going to act. The emphasis in that last pre-election week was on immediate action, at a stroke to reduce the rise in prices, increase production and reduce unemploy­ment. They are his words. It\u2019s in the book.A Better Tomorrow. On TV last week he was asked by Mr. Burnett after three months, \u2018When is tomorrow?\u2019 \u2018Well,\u2019 he said, \u2018we are working towards it all the time.\u2019 We are working towards tomorrow all the time. Watchman, what of the night -and how long will it be?That wasn\u2019t the pre-election mood.Sir Alec Douglas-Home, I quote: \u2018In the first month of a new Conservative Government, taxation will be reduced. That would do more than anything to release energies.\u2019 He can be dismissed from the case. Economics were never his strong suit.But what of his Leader, the present Prime Minister? Last week was not his first interview with Mr. Burnett. Before the election Mr. Heath gave a firm pledge to him - to the electorate - that they would abolish S.E.T. and they would cut direct taxation in the first budget. Now, apparently, no budget till April: no sense of urgency, still less emergency there. That\u2019s not what they said in that last week of the election. Already immediate action ruled out.But now they are hedging even about their budget policy when finally they are forced to introduce one. S.E.T. not to be abolished. Reduced maybe - but not yet. Mr. Robert Carr was put up last month to say that the present Government unfortunately could not \u2018make progress with expansion and the reduc­tion of taxation to which the Government is pledged, till we have got this present cost inflation spiral under control.\u2019 Mr. Barber was reported as confirming this. But what his Leader said on 16 June was that cutting taxes, and especially S.E.T., was the immediate way to \u2018break into the price/wage spiral by acting directly on prices and costs,\u2019 to give us a \u2018breathing-space\u2019 while long-term policies were being worked out.I am not in fact today going to embark on a considered attack on the Conservative Govern­ment\u2019s economic policy, because I don\u2019t know what it is - any more than they do.A government whose leader pledged himself in the Manifesto to deal \u2018honestly and openly with the House of Commons, with the Press and with the public\u2019 relies not on open straight talk, but on closed, anonymous hints behind cupped hands.Mr. Heath and Mr. Barber will not deny that the message they are putting out on taxes is this:No immediate action. No abolition of S.E.T. in the first budget;In fact no decreases in taxation until they\u2019ve made those sweeping cuts in public expenditure, the mighty promise of which always set those Tory audiences ablaze;Cuts in expenditure or not, they can\u2019t cut taxes until they\u2019ve broken the wage-spiral.The whole public discussion of Tory economic strategy has now been reduced to a plaintive barnyard soliloquy by the unfortunate Secretary of State for Employment and Productivity about which came first, the hen or the egg. And the price of both is going up under the Tories.But they are not even pretending now that they have a policy for prices, at any rate for stopping them rising. True, the repeated assertion that they had is precisely what won the election. Morning, noon and night. I recall that moving appeal the Conservative Leader made to the housewives of Leicester. Someone had given him a shopping list. Bread, how dear that was. And, oh dear, it\u2019s going up again. Milk - what price does he now think that will be when the better tomorrow dawns? He revealed the most intimate secrets of his larder, jam, sausages, the lot. He wept that the housewives were telling him that they had to go for the cheaper cuts of meat, buying standard eggs instead of large ones.Oh yes, and he mourned that the dinner money at school takes more out of her purse. Strangely I haven\u2019t yet read that school meals have become cheaper under the Tories. But let me put this question to Mr. Heath. (Cap\u2019n, art thou sleeping there below?). Since I know he would not wish his speech to the Leicester housewives to be dismissed as vulgarian vote-getting, will he just reassure them now by giving a pledge, for what that is now worth, that the review of public expenditure they have announced will not involve an increase in the price of school meals?But it was not only in Leicester. To make assurance doubly sure, there was his firm pledge of immediate action on all prices, private sector and public sector, issued with a blaze of publicity, by coincidence just two days before polling-day. In view of the organised attempt to bury this effusion - well, it is being said, after all, Mr. Heath didn\u2019t actually write it, it was written for him - I feel it right that so superb a passage of English prose should not be allowed incontinently to be swept into oblivion. In other words I\u2019m going to read it.But there is a very real alternative which ought to be pursued immediately. That alternative is to break into the price/wage spiral by acting directly to reduce prices. This can be done by reducing those taxes which bear directly on prices and costs such as the Selective Employment Tax, and by taking a fain grip on public sector prices and charges, such as coal, steel, gas, electricity charges and postal charges. This would at a stroke, reduce the rise in prices, increase production and reduce unemployment. It would have an immediate effect on moderating the wage/price spiral which would far outweight any effects of a higher pressure in demand for labour.\u2018Immediate,\u2019 \u2018at a stroke.\u2019 He went on: \u2018In this way we can obtain a breathing space which must be well used to put our industrial relations on a sound footing \u2026 to cut direct taxation and to encourage savings\u2026\u2019 And so forth.In other words, this was to be done at once.And in case any one had missed the point he concluded with the choice which in his view the country was facing: whether to continue with a Labour Government, or (I quote) \u2018Whether it would prefer immediate and determined action to avert such a crisis.\u2019 Well, we haven't had it. The crisis. Or the action.One action he was going to take was to hold prices down artificially in the public sector. We warned him at the time that that would mean Treasury subsidies, and they would mean not lower taxes but very much higher taxes. The Treasury soon told him.So we had a short period in which Ministers fell over themselves to raise charges in the public sector, even when it wasn\u2019t necessary. One was in the field of public transport. In the election, of course, we had had his doleful forecast, in due course, if Labour were returned, of a minimum fare of a shilling for short journeys on bus or tube. A shilling minimum. It may be a surprise to him, but this took effect on 16th August, just two months after he came into office: the shilling minimum fare was imposed. By the Tory Greater London Council.Labour had refused to approve it and sent it for impartial enquiry by the Prices and Incomes Board.The Tory Government, in an unaccustomed fit of exertion, approved it.For good measure, when it came to half-price fares, the Conservative Government further approved a new break-through in the higher Conservative duodecimal mathematics, based on the inflationary principle that half of one shilling is sevenpence.But the Tories said, public sector prices would be scrutinised with vigilance. Not though, to protect the consumer.When Mr. Heath saw Mr. Victor Feather we got the real threat: publicly-owned industries would be starved of finance, and subject to rigid price control, not to protect the consumer but as a sanction to enforce a wage policy selectively directed against public employees.Before Parliament adjourned they told us of their Policy for the private sector. There was to be no further use of the Prices and Incomes Board to deal with excessive price demands; the early warning system for price increases was to go.Then we got this pearl from Mr. Robert Carr: \u2018We believe that where there is competition that is the most effective means of safe­guarding the consumer, and the less it is interfered with the better.\u2019So you must thank all the gods of competi­tion, and Mr. Carr, their earthly spokesman, for the safeguards you are privileged to enjoy against price rises by private enterprise which led first the oil companies, then the tobacco industry, the bakers, the cement industry, to put up their prices.But you should be so lucky. The safe­guards didn\u2019t stop there. A fortnight ago the country was electrified by an announcement that the early warning system, and the agreed system of price-control for the brewing industry, were to be abrogated. This was announced by Farmer Prior who, although he can claim a higher degree of sophistication per live-hundredweight than most of his colleagues, decided that he could not improve on the words of Mr. Carr. \u2018Where there is competition that is the .most effective means of safeguarding the consumer, and the less it is interfered with the better.\u2019I cannot tell you how thirsty dockers in my constituency, tears dropping into their tankards, blessed the name of Prior: nor of their mortification the next day when they read in their Daily Telegraph the headline: \u20184d.-a-pint beer rise forecast,\u2019 for in beer as in bread, the mills of competition grind slowly. But they were happy to read in the City page of their Daily Mail the following Tuesday, with what joy the news had been received in the brewery-shares section of the Stock Exchange.For even this period of inert government has enabled me to acquit the Conservatives of a charge I have sometimes heard, that they lack care and compassion. I was reluctant to believe this because we had that election broadcast of theirs, when Mr. Chataway said: \u2018I care - and Ted cares too.\u2019They lost no time in showing that care when approached by the bankrupt brewers. Indeed I must in fairness to them, record another case, the deep concern shown by the Minister of Housing and Local Government when he overruled the report, made by the inspector after a public inquiry, and decided a planning case on behalf of a major brewery company not 20 miles from here.Not content with falling over themselves to allow private enterprise to raise its prices, the next step was to encourage them to do it.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, whose appointment is the only thing Mr. Heath has ever done to suggest that he has a sense of humour, will not be disposed to dispute the source of the message which one paper after another simultaneously felt moved to announce a fortnight ago.The headline in the Guardian: \u2018Tories to let prices go free.\u2019 In the Daily Telegraph: \u2018Price rises to rebuild working capital in order.\u2019 \u2018Companies may raise prices with tacit Gov­ernment blessing.\u2019The Times: \u2018The shortage of company liquidity is acknowledged; and it is argued that the solution lies in raising prices where this is necessary for maintaining profits, investments and working capital.\u2019\u2018The solution lies in raising prices.\u2019Three months to the day after that dramatic promise of immediate and direct action to break the price/wage spiral, the Government had decided that they had so little to offer their industrial friends in fulfilment of their promises to reduce taxation on industry - on top of all the other pledges to reduce taxation - that their only solution to deal with the prob­lem of the squeeze on liquidity, the problem of cash flow in industry, was to encourage industrialists to get on with it, to put up prices and get more money for them­selves.So now we know. A Government elected precisely because of its pledges to tackle rising prices insists now that in private enterprise prices are not high enough.A Government elected after accusing its Labour predecessor of planning to hold down wages, has embarked now on deliberate action to hold wages down, starting with the weakest and lowest paid. And this at a time of free-for-all in prices.The Government\u2019s strategy has now emerged.It is a strategy first of distraction. To dis­tract the country from the Government\u2019s failure by putting all the blame for their econ­omic difficulties, not on their own irresponsible election promises, but on the trade unions and their members. And in shifting the blame, to use the whole power of Government in enforc­ing a policy of selective interference with wages, to the point where the costly and bitter disputes they were elected to avoid are not only to be allowed to happen, but actively provoked.It is a strategy, second, of ostentatious in­difference to the modernisation of industry, and the needs of the development areas, by discard­ing priority industrial and regional projects.It is a strategy, third, of re-shaping public expenditure on principles which pre-date the welfare state, and by methods which must inevitably destroy the welfare state as we know it today.First, the policy of a deliberate show-down with organised labour. The Government standing aside when their intervention is necessary to avert or end a dispute, in the private sector; the Government acting as provocateur in wage negotiations in the public sector.In the private sector, denying conciliation where conciliation is needed. Deciding that fifty years of conciliation are to be set aside. That the Secretary of State\u2019s job was to be that of a querulous referee who conceives it as his function to stand on the touch-line selectively throwing his bottles at just one set of players.This and his discriminatory wages policy against the public sector, miners, nurses, railwaymen, probation officers, teachers, manual workers in Government employment. Ministers who have talked of anarchy are hell-bent on intensifying anarchy. Those who have talked of disputes are dedicated to pro­voking them.There is one clear and definite message on which this Conference has already shown its determination.The Tories are not going to be allowed to divide one section of our national community from another. To resist the Tories is one thing, and determination to resist is unequivocal. But we all recognise the clear responsibility on this Movement: I mean this Movement, industrial and political. For when doctrinaire Tory measures have been beaten back we shall have the responsibility of showing to the country that, together, we are capable of working out an effective approach for dealing with problems that confront, not this country alone, but every modern industrial society. A policy for full employment based on stability of values and the protection of those within our com­munity least able to help themselves.This eluded us before because in 1964 we came to office in the middle of urgent and immediate problems which never gave us the time and the opportunity to work out the necessary approach. Now we have the time and together we must use it to find a way. It is not a question of formal declarations or treaties. It is a question rather of expressing our common purpose.That cannot be made explicit until, between us, we can set out a climate in which that purpose can alone operate. And it is to define and fashion that climate as well as to agree on our mutual responsibilities, that the future work and co-operation of this Movement must be directed.And putting back the clock in industrial relations is matched by the second part of the strategy, a reversion to the law of ruthless profit-seeking in industry, regardless of national or regional priorities.The law of the market, which recognises only profit, however earned, the balance-sheet to be paramount, ignoring the economic or social claims of employment, of export, of the development of Britain\u2019s productive resources.If the policies they have decided to follow had been adopted by us, the Upper Clyde would not have been saved.Cammell Laird\u2019s - now busy with new orders - would have closed; there would have been no British-owned computer industry, and the last section of the indigenous British motor-car industry would before long have passed into American ownership.We are told that investment grants are to go, investment allowances are to take their place - rewarding those that have profits to show, denying new industries and firms, however enterprising, who need a start.This is not economic policy. It is economic abdication. The assertion of Government, of community responsibility, whether for the strength of our economy or the welfare of our people, is to give place to a new concentration of power, where the take-over bidder, the financial entrepreneur holds sway, regardless of what is produced, regardless of the decay of proud regions, the welfare of their workers, the opportunities for their children.And the third element in their strategy is the re-shaping of Government social expendi­ture, not on new priorities, but on the old priorities; on which until this year, all parties had turned their backs.If a phrase was coined that I regret it was \u2018Yesterday\u2019s Men.\u2019 Why did we have to use that flattery? Yesterday is modernity compared with those who now seek their inspiration in the golden days before World War One - golden for some. Selsdon Man, gagged and muted throughout the election, has now become Selsdon Minister. Remember how we warned that these men would take us back - in the social services back to pre-Beveridge; back in housing to pre-Wheatley; back in health to pre-Bevan. When I warned that they would seek to introduce the concept of first-and second-class status within the Health Service - the test being ability to pay - I was indignantly contradicted by Mr. Heath.I warn them that if they lay their hands on all that has been built up by the British people, by this Movement, then whatever their mask of cold indifference and doctrinaire arrogance, the fight we shall put up by day and by night against their legislation will make even the battles they had to fight to get the Rent Act through seem mild by comparison.We all of us in this Party, in this Movement, have the right to make that warning explicit. We are proud of the achievements of the first post-war Labour Government in creating in those years of unparalleled difficulty, the Welfare State, the Health Service, that great advance in education, and low rent housing.We are proud of the record of countless members of local authorities over a generation, bringing to the legislation passed by Parliament the warmth, humanity and compassion of people nurtured in socialism and social ideals.We are proud of our record over the past six years, when once again we did not allow crippling economic difficulties to daunt us, of the years in which we almost doubled the provision for our social services, health, housing, education and the attack on poverty.It is because of what the Labour Govern­ment achieved that over this past year - indeed this was one of the great themes of the last Conference - all of us recognised and stressed that more and more must be done for the forgotten members of our society. The men­tally handicapped, including very particularly the mentally handicapped children. The problem of shelter and care in old age, the creation of a real equality of opportunity in education, not only at 11 but at 18. So much had been done, so much more still remained to do. For the first time we had been able to create an economic base on which we could build.I warn this Conference, as earlier I sought to warn the country, what irresponsible Tory financial promises must mean for our great national social services, and the essential local services dependent upon national provision. They are failing to get even a fraction of the expenditure cuts they had said would be so easy. That is why I must warn at once about the danger of Tory action this autumn to cut back the real value of Government provision for all the wide range of local social services.The biennial Rate Support Grant has to be determined before the end of the year and secure Parliamentary approval. Of small importance that the record provision made in 1968 was attacked by Mr. Heath as being too small, when he thought there were votes in such an attack - that implied pledge goes the way of all the rest.Now we shall have the Conservative Government blindly swinging their axe. The more severely they cut down necessary provision, then the more will local authorities, at a time when so many are Conservative-led, be tempted to cut and slash essential services to avoid still further loading the rates over and above what will be forced upon them by declared Conservative policies.And it is as these Councils balance essen­tially inadequate central finance with their desire to keep rates as low as possible that the temptation will be upon them, a temptation they are not the men to resist, to economise and pare on all those items of local government expenditure which are the characteristic of a civilised society - what they no doubt will call the frills - what we consider the means to a better and fairer Britain.The irresponsible promises of the Tories have brought upon them, and upon Britain, the problems I have described.And this applies with equal force to the policies for Southern Africa. Recall how this began. Sir Alec told the press his firm decision, our embargo on arms for South Africa would be revoked. But when he was confronted by us in Parliament it was a different story. All he was doing was consulting the Common­wealth. There has been no decision. There would be no decision before Parliament resumed in the autumn.But then there was the strange case of Mr. Heath. He refused to publish the message he had sent to the Commonwealth, of which, for greater accuracy, I had obtained a copy. However, the Prime Minister of Canada pub­lished his own reply in which he referred to Mr. Heath's message as a \u2018decision.\u2019 Nothing like dealing honestly and directly with Parlia­ment, the press and the public, not to mention the Commonwealth.We warned him over the Springbok tour, over his policies for South Africa and Rhodesia. We warned him that his policies would endanger any hopes of a rational policy on equal community relations, regardless of race or colour. Those warnings were con­temptuously ignored.It is my clear duty this morning, not to repeat them, but to reinforce them by saying what the policy of the next Government will be.It is important that, in default of the present Government, someone must assert that, in these matters, Britain stands and always will stand on the side of the eternal decencies.If the Conservatives, for whatever reason - be it an unwillingness to reverse the instant, ideological government of Sir Alec Douglas-Home, be it the pressures of the Monday Club, the Powellites - if they decide to spurn the Commonwealth, indeed to risk its very existence, by a decision to sell arms to South Africa, then whatever contracts they may sign will be repudiated by an incoming Labour Government at the next Election. Any ship­ments arising from them will be embargoed. And let me warn them about any manoeuvrings designed to tie our hands. We have seen before how they were able to turn a commercial agreement into an enforceable international treaty. If for ideological reasons they clothe these indefensible contracts with the enforce­ability of a treaty, then let them know that a Labour Government will accept no treaty which is in conflict with the decision of the United Nations, our membership of which, our commitment to whose decisions, were themselves enshrined in a treaty which we have regarded and always will regard as bind­ing on the individual decisions of Government. I hope that this will help Mr. Heath, despite himself, to be able to attend a full meeting of the Commonwealth in Singapore next January. But should he ignore these warnings, I want to make this appeal to our Common­wealth friends.I know how you feel on this issue. You feel as we do.You know that this is a matter not of a few millions on the balance sheet.That recognising this and knowing how the heart of Britain really beats on this question, that you do not leave the Commonwealth, which I believe to be one of the greatest forces not only for international co-operation but for international decision in the years ahead. Bite on the Tory bit and realise that there will again be a Britain with a different conception of Commonwealth leadership.Rhodesia too.I recall the equivocation of the Tory leader­ship over the years since U.D.I. Not that there were even votes in it, but the Tory leadership had to move very close to appease­ment of a racialist regime in order to keep within their ranks the racialist extremists who never fail to assert their power when they recognise that they are faced with a leadership lacking in moral fibre on these fundamental matters of principle.Again the future of the Commonwealth is at stake, a derisory consideration perhaps, when with a Parliamentary majority of thirty, they are facing the hard-liners of the Monday Club.They have said, it is on the record, that there will be no agreement on a legal independence except on the basis of the five prin­ciples which we laid down. All Parties in this country are committed to them: History will not forgive, nor shall we tolerate a settlement based on the racialist principles of the police-state, now near-fascist regime in Rhodesia.But, Mr. Chairman, the overseas issue which will dominate the life and work of this parliament, will be the decision that has to be taken about Britain\u2019s application to join the European Economic Community. A decision which has to be taken when the Brussels negotiations reach a point where Parliament and the country can measure and assess the advantages and the costs.This is not the time for decision.Last year at Conference I pointed out that Britain\u2019s application had been made, approved by Parliament, approved by Conference, three years ago. Few, if any, were proposing a reversal of that decision. The question was, what terms for entry.The main change since last year has been the physical opening of the negotiations, though there have also been changes and developments within the Community itself which will have an important bearing on the terms of Britain\u2019s entry. It is too early to judge what the terms will be.I have not changed my view, although I respect the view of many here who think differently, that providing we can get the right terms, entry will be advantageous for Britain. A country which depends as much as Britain for our exports to world markets must face the fact that the three principal markets into which we trade are for one reason and another being more and more rigged and systematised and certainly not to our advantage.The North American market, in which these past two years has seen such great success for British exports, is becoming more and more subject to a fever of protectionism against which it was our duty to warn suc­cessive Presidents. I have small doubt that these warnings have been repeated by those who now have the responsibility.The Commonwealth.Some of us on entering office had high hopes that we could reverse the downward trend in trade within the Commonwealth, and at Commonwealth Conference after Confer­ence I sought to establish meetings of trade Ministers and by other means to get agree­ment on means to increase Commonwealth trade.But we have to face the fact here that some of our biggest Commonwealth trading partners are more and more integrating their economies with those of their neighbours, Australia with Japan and the countries of South-East Asia; Canada more and more with her neighbour, and also with the Caribbean and South America; we have had disappointments in Commonwealth countries in Africa and a growing number of these have been making their own arrangements with the European Common Market.And that third great area, the vast European market, is the subject of tight and cohesive trading rules which are made by others, with no British participation. The problem here is not only the rules of that increasingly inte­grated community. There is a problem, too, of the growth of the large multi-national com­pany or trust whose interests and loyalties transcend national boundaries, and who make their own rules. The European Corporation is becoming a reality even if so many of the Europe-wide companies, in motors, in com­puters, in electronics, are in fact American dominated and controlled.It is to face this challenge that we have seen the growth of the huge mergers in British industry with economic and industrial and social consequences which we have not yet fully learned how to meet - another great question on the agenda of our future work.If the terms which emerge from the nego­tiations are such as to impose a crippling and unacceptable burden on our balance of pay­ments and our social structure, I should be the first to say that these terms must be rejected. But we have to recognise that the right terms would give us a greater power of participation in the decisions which will in­creasingly dominate world industry.Last year I said that Britain\u2019s growing strength meant that if the terms were right we need not fear the sharper competition which entry would mean; that we could indeed benefit from the new opportunities British industry would have.But equally, I said that if the terms were wrong, we had by our own efforts, our own restraint, our own self-discipline, created for ourselves the strength to stand on our own feet outside the Community.I believe that is still true, though we shall watch anxiously how far the irresponsible men now in power in this country fritter away that strength by pursuing false economic objectives and by their policy of dividing - where we did so much to unite - our nation.Unlike the situation eight years ago, had it been a Labour Government which secured entry into the Common Market in the present negotiations, it would not have been out of crippling weakness but out of confident strength. That strength must not now be dissipated.But if our warnings about this fall on deaf ears there is one argument we will not accept - we heard it before - that, whatever the terms, we have to go in because we are too weak to stay out.Between 1964 and 1970 the Labour Govern­ment brought Britain through to a position of economic strength. But the political effects of the very measures we had to use have denied to us - for a time - the opportunity to follow through. The opportunity to use that strength we had created, to intensify and accelerate the creation of a better and fairer Britain.For how often have all of us said that economic strength is not an end in itself. It is a means, but a necessary means, to the realisation of everything this Movement stands for. That was the message seven years ago at Scarborough. The message that Socialism must be used to harness, control, humanise, civilise the speed of the new technological revolution. The Scarborough programme for modernising and reorganising industry, and providing for those who suffered through change, was becoming a reality under the Labour Government, forced through against those who, while not resisting change, de­manded that the direction and force of that change should be dictated by private interests, for private ends.If the Labour Government had not been pushing the Scarborough programme through, this country by now would have slipped out of the mainstream of technological and econ­omic advance with all the harmful and social consequences this neglect and abdication would have involved. But if Scarborough was right and necessary for its time, we must recognise that time has moved forward and that Britain must move forward with it. There are new problems now, and tomorrow will bring other problems of whose scope and nature we can only be partly aware. The Socialism of the Labour Party possesses the only approach to match and conquer those problems. We must begin planning now within this Party to create the apparatus which will make that approach a reality.For our experience of the Scarborough pro­gramme has taught us this. First, that the sheer implications of economic and social change imposed by the speed of modern science and industrial technique are such that their planning and control need to be not less wide than we attempted, but wider. That the planning cannot be related to the arbitrary lifetime of a single Parliament only. That we have to have our vision of the Britain of the nineteen-eighties and \u2019nineties to be able to plan the measures of the \u2019seventies.And the second lesson is this. The very facts I have just mentioned about the aggregation of power in vast national and international economic groupings underline the need for a continued assertion of the protection of the increasingly helpless individual against the demands of increasingly ruthless and remote economic, power.Man has to work, in order to consume. He is not a free being simply because society gives him more alternative ways of spending the money he earns, if he becomes less free in how he earns it. Man does not live by the monthly index of retail sales alone.But, and this is the third challenge to modern society, to industrial frustrations are added a wider dimension, going far beyond the dictates of the production-line. The dimension of man in his environment. And here I do not mean only the social costs of technical advance, the pollution of the air and water, and the countryside.The problem of the environment is psycho­logical as well as physical. You can pollute a man\u2019s soul, a child\u2019s dreams, just as you can poison the water and the air around him, if every decision affecting his future is taken by more and more remote, less and less account­able beings. And if technological advance dic­tates that more and more decisions are taken, whether in public or private enterprise, at stages further and further from the point where the work is done, then a modern conception of Government means a greater, not a smaller, degree of concern and protection for the man and woman at the point where the work is done.Government\u2019s task, Parliament\u2019s task, is not only to ensure the accountability of economic decisions: it is to ensure that those affected by these decisions are first consulted and then safeguarded. Three months have dramatised the essential difference between a Labour Government and its successors. The Labour Government insisted that if the coal, industry had to suffer from technological change, the men affected must be given protection and economic security. As a matter of course we brought a Bill before Parliament last June to continue that protection. After three months of vacillation and hesitancy, and despite the urgent insistence of all of us, that Bill has not yet been reintroduced, nor solid assurances given that in the form we laid down, it will be.When a shipyard was in danger of closure under the Tories, the Tory Minister\u2019s message was: \u2018You\u2019re out on your own.\u2019 Palmer\u2019s Yard closed this weekend. But the challenge goes far beyond the loss of work and security. Those who seek to deal with the problems of modern industry by repression and appeals to law and order fail to get at the underlying frustration. Frustration for the individual.When we hear learned and self-righteous individuals who have forgotten even what it was to be young, condemning modern youth, they fail to understand the frustration of young, people lost or trapped in the blind alleys of modern industrial society. Or students who, questioning the basis of the system of indus­trial recruitment or the big brother dossiers, will fight any attempt to transform a free university into an adjunct of industrialism. It is frightened men, and men out of touch, who seek to fight the student frustration by repression alone, without understanding.It\u2019s a frightened and unthinking act, not a confident act, that is inspired by the belief that you can deal with our student problem by sending a sick student out of the country. Law, yes. Order, yes, but these are comple­ments to, not a substitute for attacking the conditions which give rise to the problem. The break-out in advanced but uncaring societies of black power, as men condemned for gener­ations to helotry on no basis other than the colour of their skin, turn to violence - and are exploited by others who can turn violence to their own ends.There are other frustrations too. The frus­trations of working men and women on the factory floor, who see vast changes taking place around them but are scarcely able to influence the forces which dictate the course of their lives. The frustration of office workers and technicians who feel that big power-blocs are elbowing them aside, so that they must cling on to their living standards by their finger­tips.It is for Labour to reunite these sections of the community. It is for us to strengthen the power of the community and make it relevant to the needs of the new decade.The worker is hostile to the student, grumb­ling that his income tax goes to pay for their demonstrations. The rumbling against immigrants goes on, wherever social conditions create tensions. We must condemn violent demonstrations. We must condemn with all the vehemence in our power the manifesta­tions of Powellism. It is not so much that the Powellites have exploited fear and hatred, or even that they have created fear and hatred in order to exploit them. They were exploiting a vacuum. They were taking up a cause - how­ever venomous that cause - because there were so many who, due to the conditions in which they worked, the conditions in which they lived, felt that they had no one to give them a lead, no one with whom they could identify. But we must not make the mistake of dis­carding as beneath our notice the human beings involved in these confrontations. Ugly emotions are the outcome of false hostilities created by social conditions it is our duty to transform.We must convince all these groups - factory workers, office workers, technicians, immigrants, students, that their interests are not in conflict but in common, and can be served only by their combining together to support Labour's implementation of Socialist policies.In the explanations offered last June we became familiar with the word \u2018volatility.\u2019 It wasn\u2019t volatility in the sense of something flashy and insubstantial. It was closer to cynicism, in the case of tens of thousands of our fellow citizens, sullenness, a feeling that political battles had nothing for them. A Parliamentary colleague has told me of a block of old and substantial municipal flats in his constituency, where the total poll was thirty per cent. You\u2019re all the same, he was told, whoever\u2019s in power - and they might have meant in Parliament, they might have meant in the Council - they haven\u2019t fixed my drain, or got rid of the damp.The task of our Socialism is to make Parlia­ment a reality to people who feel that nobody cares. This of itself is a condemnation of a new Government which is resolved - if irresolute on all else - to narrow the area of Parliamentary concern, whether in an economic system which leaves the vital decisions to the irresponsible and the unaccountable, or in social affairs where matters of social concern are to become primarily matters of personal provision, regardless of the power to provide.It is for us in this Movement to challenge that negativism, and to provide the answer to it. To show that man need not be a dwarf in the shadow of his own means of livelihood. To prove that Parliament and local democracy can be made relevant to people\u2019s lives - work­ing lives, family lives - through a Socialism which connects their lives with the mechanisms which dominate them and the decisions which determine them.The Conservatives say that \u2018You\u2019re out on your own.\u2019 That Government must contract and withdraw, only holding the ring while the giant corporations make decisions in their own interests. They call this individualism. But it is the death of individualism.The individual identity, the rights of a man and his family can only be restored and enhanced if individuals join together to con­trol the apparatus they have created.This is Socialism. This is why, if Socialism had never been thought of before, it would now have to be invented. This is why the Socialism of the Labour Party is more relevant and more needed now than ever before.We are now at the start of a Parliament - a Parliament in which the electorate have decided that we are to carry out the role of Opposition.We shall do our job, and do it vigorously. But while we must always be a party of protest, the last six years have proved that we are now also a party of Government.We must begin preparing now for the day when the people of Britain decide that they want to take the Government of the country back into their own hands.This Conference is that beginning.
p224
aVA year ago, Mr. Chairman, I spoke about a quiet revolution. I said that it would change the way we lived. It would change the way we looked at ourselves and the way the world looked at us. I did not use those words lightly. I felt then, as I had long felt, that an era in our history and the world\u2019s history was coming to an end. The post-war years were over and with them went all that they meant in terms of trying to make ends meet, holding on, managing today and letting tomorrow take care of itself.We were now living in a new world. If we wanted to take a place in that new world we must understand that new world, and before we could hope to understand it we must understand ourselves. It was a time to take stock - and taking stock is not always easy. Sometimes history marks the turning points for us. In our recent history two world wars have done just that. After each of them we knew that nothing could ever be the same again. But this turning point was nothing like so well defined. It was a turning point not so much of events as of attitudes. Wars force change upon us. For good or ill, they create their own social revolutions. What faced us was the historic need for change without the impetus to change. This time, the shaping of the future, the decision, was in our own hands.But did we know, as a nation, what we wanted our future to be? Were we not dangerously content to let things take their course, avoiding a decision, confident that everything in the end would turn out for the best? Were we not in great danger of losing our way in a changing world - a world that would go on changing whatever we did? These were the questions that concerned us more and more while we were in opposition. This was the task we felt we had been given in June of last year - to find for this country a new way in this new world.The prospect was daunting but it was not depressing. The task we were given was the most challenging any peace-time government in this country has faced. What kind of a country did we want to be, not just tomorrow but a generation from now, two generations from now? No question demands a clearer answer. No question should command a higher priority from any government. We believe that we are finding that answer. The people of this country have a right to expect their elected government to do so, but equally that government has the right to ask the people to help in putting that answer into practice. A government must have the vision to look ahead, the intuition to point a path, the courage to lead the way. It must fulfil all those needs.But the people of that country must care enough about their country to play their own part, to share in those tasks, to realise that a country - this country - stands for nothing unless every one of us individually stands for something in which we firmly believe - to work and to care, to prosper and to share, and to do it all as one nation. That has always been our goal and it always will be our goal.It was a year ago that we started out together on a journey into the future. We have made good speed. We have come a long way - a lot further than many people dared to hope just 12 short months ago. But there is a long way still ahead of us. We have so far to catch up.Twenty five years ago much of Western Europe lay literally in ruins. Economic and industrial life had come to a standstill. For us here in Britain it was different. We were bruised, we were exhausted, but our economy and our industry remained intact. In Europe they were able again to start from scratch but we had to make do and mend. So it was not surprising when those countries, starting from scratch, first matched and then, in unity, overtook Britain in economic performance and industrial effort. A new world was already emerging; and it is to the credit of our Party that from an early stage we recognised that fact. Later we tried to join the united and prospering efforts of the major countries of Western Europe, but then Britain was foiled in the attempt by the veto of President de Gaulle. We tried to build the firm foundations for a modern, industrial society based on faster expansion and higher real wages and better living standards.But after 13 years of very considerable achievement Britain was foiled again, this time by the sheer unmitigated disaster of six years of Socialist government. I do not propose to dwell at any length on the follies and mismanagement for which they were responsible. Indeed, I must be careful not to accuse the last Labour Government of actually knowing what was going on while they were in office. I might be called\u2026, and then they would ask for time to formulate their defence and to find out what really was going on while they were there. I shall not deal at any length with the present sorry state of the Labour Party, nor do I propose to reply in kind to the shrill attacks against my colleagues and myself. I would simply make one comment on the events which occurred last week in this hall. In my political lifetime I do not recall any party conference in which a party making claim to govern this country showed so conclusively that that claim was false. Day by day the lessons learned in office were abandoned as inconvenient memories. Day by day the Labour Party set off in hot pursuit of the irresponsible and the unreal. The impression left in the minds of sensible people was deep and will, I believe, endure. At the end of their period of office they left such a record of rising prices, high unemployment and slow growth that it is taking all the energies of this Government, indeed of the whole nation, to reverse that process. These are energies diverted from the great purpose of creating a lasting and enduring base for national prosperity.Everyone agrees, of course, that the level of unemployment is too high - far too high. No responsible person in public life today can fail to be moved by the sight of people out of work week after week, the waste of energy and talent, the hardship and the dismay. In the situation of rising prices and rising unemployment with which we were faced on coming into office we continue to do everything we can to help. In the past few months alone we have made available nearly £500 million for new projects intended especially for the areas which are hardest hit. Others may seek to exploit the national concern about those without work to make party slogans. But this Government demonstrates its concern by positive action. This Government has already done more than any before to get the economy moving again and to reduce unemployment. This Government is committed completely and absolutely to expanding the economy and to bringing unemployment down. Industry has shown that it, too, will make its contribution by restraining price increases. The Government and the nationalised industries are doing the same. Now it only needs moderation and responsibility on the part of the unions when presenting their next round of claims for us together to complete a victory over inflation and unemployment. It is a unique opportunity. I say this to the unions and to their members: higher real wages are there for the asking - higher real wages. It is for you in the unions to decide. If you continue to demand increases in money wages far in excess of anything that can be earned from production, you will continue to price yourselves and others out of the market.We stand now on the threshold of a period of growth and prosperity unparalleled since the war. We have the chance to beat the rest of the world at their own game - high production, low prices and high wages. Now it is up to all of us - management, men and Government together - to seize this opportunity. We must deal, of course, with the immediate economic problems and particularly that of unemployment. But we must do so in the context of the future. We are not going to be accused of neglecting the future in order only to remedy the present; for that way, we know, lies frustration, and we have had enough frustration over the past generation or more.Of course, people come to terms with it. For the past 25 years we have learned to live with our tax system. Socialist Governments have put on more taxes, and Conservative Governments have taken them off - a law of nature which I do not propose to alter.But for too long we have all known that, whatever the level of taxation, the system itself had come to mean discouragement and frustration. You do not have to be an expert in taxation - just an amateur in paying it - to realise that the whole system needed root and branch reform. Now, thanks to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, this has been introduced, and he deserves full credit for it. When 18 months are past we shall have a simple system of personal tax, a fairer system of company tax, and a single form of tax on spending. That is an achievement of which to be proud.But while the British people have been frustrated, so has British industry; and we have learned to live with this, too. We have gone on for too long in the same old way: too much of the same techniques of management, too much of the old skills, and, above all, an outmoded system of industrial relations. Well, thanks to the admirable work of Robert Carr and his colleagues, that field, too, has been put right.Today we are seeing the cost of going on too long with the old ways in the present loss of jobs, high cost inflation, high unemployment. But you do not solve these problems by refusing to face them, by taking the easy way of subsidy, and still more subsidy, of Government intervention, and still more Government intervention. The way to solve them is to do our utmost to create a better structure of industry, a better living environment, which will then bring real jobs for our people - lasting jobs - which is what they want.The way to overcome the frustration of old is to show a better way. What we are doing is, once again, to give people a choice and a chance.Of course, it is always hard to be a Government of change in this way. But change there must be, because postponing change, still more postponing it at this late hour, means facing far greater changes at a time which will not be of our choosing. Now is the time to give our people the chance to become strong in world markets, the chance to find and keep jobs which are based on expanding markets. So let us make use of the action we are taking - the urgent action which we have taken - to tackle prices and jobs as the springboard for greater responsibility in management and unions in order to produce still greater economic strength.In the field of the social services, schools, housing, social benefits, we also face a massive need for change. Once again there is the legacy with which we have to deal - the legacy of the housing programme which we found going down instead of up; the legacy of welfare policies which were not even maintaining the advances of the past, let alone moving forward to meet the needs of the future; the legacy of education policies which were simply not giving a fair start to many children; and health policies which were denying decent care to so many of the old and the mentally sick.But, once again, we have to look not just to the immediate needs, but beyond them to the whole framework of policy and the whole pattern of social and economic change.We look back to the mid-forties - to the Butler Education Act, to the Beveridge Report on Social Security, and to the work of successive Governments during and after the war which led to the creation of the Health Service and the present national insurance scheme. We look back that far. But in housing the roots of today\u2019s policies lie still deeper in the twenties and thirties. The Britain of today is separated from the Britain in which these frameworks were laid down not just by a quarter of a century or more; it is separated by the growth of mass prosperity on a scale which few in those days would have believed possible. It is separated by the unprecedented enlargement of home ownership, of educational attainment of economic opportunity and of social mobility. It is separated now by a revolution of attitudes and of expectations.As our policies generate more rapid economic progress, so further change will come and new demands will arise. All this on its own would dictate the need for radical review. And there is another reason perhaps more compelling. It is simply this: that, in the general advance, there are many who have got left behind, many problems which the old policies have failed to meet in the past, and which they are manifestly incapable of solving now. Too many of the retired, the chronically sick, the disabled, and the very low paid stand out against the background of increased prosperity; too many of the old and the mentally ill stand out against a general background of better provision for health; too many slums, too much homelessness, stand out against the background of modern housing and wider home ownership.These are things which cannot be tolerated in the Britain of the l970s. This Conservative Government are determined to bring them to an end. We have been determined, first, as a matter of urgency, to see that those who have been neglected get the extra help they need. We have made a record increase in national insurance pensions and major improvements in the position of public service and armed forces pensioners. The over-80s now have the State pension which the last Administration so persistently denied them. We are making new help available to many younger widows, as well as to the long term sick and disabled. We are tackling the problem of family poverty with wider exemptions from charges, with bigger tax allowances for children, and with the new Family Income Supplement.Secondly, we have been determined to get the priorities right. We have changed the priorities of education policy, because we believe it is more important to see that every child goes to a decent primary school than to provide subsidies regardless of whether they are needed or not. We have asked people to pay more for prescriptions, because it has helped us to spend more in clearing up old hospitals and bringing better standards of care to the old and the mentally ill. We are determined, thirdly, to shape for the future social policies which fit the long term needs of an increasingly prosperous and responsible society.This is the setting for our proposals for reform in the administration of the Health Service. This is why we attach so much importance to our new policy for pensions - a policy which over the years will see that every one can enjoy a pension related to his earnings, on top of the basic State provision.This is the reason for the legislation we shall soon be bringing forward to reform the housing subsidies, so that for the first time the system will put its full weight behind helping those who need help, clearing the backlog of slums and decay.Just as in our economic and industrial affairs we seek not only new policies but new attitudes, so also we need new attitudes to our social problems. Above all, we recognise that, unless we are prepared to take on more of the responsibilities for the things we can do for ourselves, then the State itself will never be able to do properly the jobs which genuinely demand community action - community action in building and improving our schools and hospitals and universities, community action on behalf of us all to help those who are in real need. This is the only way in which we can carry our social concern into effective action.I am sure that it was right that the National Union found time for an emergency debate on Northern Ireland. It was right that you in the Conference should have the opportunity of expressing your views and that the Home Secretary, who has the immense burden of handling these matters, should have the chance to explain our policies. It is a subject on which in recent months we have spent many anxious, indeed many anguished, hours.There have been moments, I must admit to you, when it seemed that violence and the rhetoric of violence filled the whole scene, when the clamour seemed so great that there was small hope that the voice of reason would find a hearing. But we have persevered. On Thursday the Home Secretary set out our aims and the means by which we are determined to achieve them.Let me again make it quite clear, as the Home Secretary did, that there is an essential link between the political initiatives which we are taking and our measures to improve security and to smash the gunmen.The truth is that neither one of these policies can succeed without the other. We cannot achieve a prosperous, harmonious and contented society in Northern Ireland until the minority as well as the majority feel that they have a permanent and guaranteed share in public affairs. But we cannot achieve a political settlement so long as the gunmen are still there, because the gunmen are interested in no solution except one imposed by murder and achieved through chaos.It is right for me to warn the nation that the effort required of all of us in Northern Ireland is going to be strenuous and determined. There are no quick and easy answers. Those who claim that there are show that they do not understand the real nature of the problem. But neither do I agree with those whose only reaction to present events in Ireland is one of despair. Working on this problem since June of last year, I have come to realise the strength of the underlying forces which favour those who are working for peace.We are fortunate in that the Prime Ministers of both Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic are men of proved resource, of moderation and of goodwill. We are fortunate in the patience of the long-suffering people of both communities in Northern Ireland, whose steadfastness we have all learned to admire, who have refused to be provoked by the gunmen into communal strife.We are fortunate in that this country has at its disposal in the services of the Crown armed forces and police forces of a quality unmatched in the rest of the world. No one can have failed to be moved by the restraint and the sheer courage which they have shown. As Prime Minister of this country I thank them today for what they are doing. And to my thanks I add an assurance which is perhaps the best thanks of all. I assure them and the people of Northern Ireland that we are going to see this through. We are going to see it through because to do otherwise would be an abdication of everything for which we stand.On this side of the Irish Sea, I believe that people now see more clearly the underlying reasons for the effort which we are called upon to make. They understand that we are making it because Northern Ireland is, by the wish of the majority of its inhabitants, part of the United Kingdom.They realise that if our troops were withdrawn and our efforts were relaxed, we would be condemning not only Northern Ireland but the whole of Ireland to civil war and slaughter on a scale far beyond anything we have seen elsewhere in recent years.I and the Home Secretary have urged all those in Northern Ireland who wish for a peaceful answer to come forward and join with us in discussing how that answer can be achieved. I repeat that appeal today. Progress cannot be held up. There are many who are already carrying on these discussions and who wish to work out the answer.I add also a warning to those who are interested only in violence, to the bombers and the gunmen. The history of Ireland contains the record of many mistakes and many miscalculations by both English and Irish alike. But if the gunmen believe that they can bully this Government or this people into abandoning the effort which we have undertaken, then that is the greatest miscalculation of all.This Conference will long be remembered for one decisive vote. You have decided overwhelmingly to accept the Government\u2019s recommendation, now that the terms are known, that Britain should become a member of the European Community.Just ten years ago I came straight from making the opening statement in Paris at the beginning of the first negotiations, to this Conference where I received your endorsement. I came, of course, as Lord Privy Seal, not as Edward Heath as I now am.You can imagine with what admiration I have followed Geoffrey Rippon in the skill and determination with which he has handled the negotiations. And with what happiness I greeted the result last Wednesday.But our energies in this last year have been by no means confined to Europe.Since we last met your Conservative Government have consistently followed policies which Sir Alec Douglas-Home outlined to you last year - policies of steadily protecting and advancing the interests of this country across the world.We protected our interests during the Commonwealth Conference at Singapore last January. We protected our interests in the joint arrangements which Lord Carrington negotiated for co-operation with our friends in the defence of Singapore and Malaysia. We protected our interests in Geoffrey Rippon\u2019s negotiations with the Governments of the Six. And we have protected our interests in the measures which we have recently taken against those who have sought to undermine the security of our country by acts of espionage.As a result, we can now record with quiet satisfaction that there has been a real change in the standing of Britain among the nations of the world. We are now once again regarded as a country whose judgment can be trusted and whose promises can be relied on.But let us be clear about the principles which have guided us in these policies. We have no desire to lecture others or to assert ourselves in the world for selfish reasons. We have no desire to make a crude and empty clamour on the stage of world affairs. Our policies are based on a sober, modern and realistic assessment of Britain\u2019s place in the world today.It is in that spirit that I want to speak this morning of the changes which, even as we sit here, are altering the shape of the world as it has been familiar to us for the last 25 years. If we look at that history, one salient fact immediately confronts us. Throughout that period, we and other countries of Western Europe have survived and prospered to a large extent thanks to the help and protection of the United States. Never in modern times has a great Power used its energy and its generosity with such effect to protect the interests of its friends. Everyone in this hall and in our Party would pay tribute to the statesmanship which successive American Administrations have shown.Some of us, however, have for many years foreseen that this was not a state of affairs which could for ever be expected to endure. We have urged the countries of Europe to bestir themselves so as to secure their own defence and their own prosperity, because the time would come when this burden would not be carried in the same way by others on their behalf.I must tell you today that the change which I and others foresaw is now coming upon us. The United States, faced with deep-seated problems at home and abroad, is working - while in contact with its allies - towards direct arrangements with the Soviet Union and with Communist China.Even more important, the United States is acting drastically to protect its own balance of payments and its own trading position against the erosions which they have suffered. Everyone concerned with trade and finance knows that rough winds are beginning to blow across the world. It is in the interests of this country that trade should be as free and unrestricted as possible. We must do our utmost to prevent the development of a protectionist trade war. That is our interest, and that is the aim which every British Government should pursue.With this aim in mind, we must consider today how British interests in this field can best be protected and advanced. I must tell you plainly that if in this changed world we were going to be forced to stand alone, then the prospects for the jobs and the livelihood of our people would be bleak indeed. We all know that decisions on world trade and world finance are not academic for the people of this country. These decisions vitally affect the well-being and the prosperity, the jobs and livelihood, of everyone in these islands.If we were to condemn ourselves to isolation, then we would find that these decisions in world trade and monetary affairs, affecting us so closely, were taken not by ourselves but by others in the world wielding greater economic power - by the United States, by the European Community and by Japan. But fortunately we are not so condemned. Fortunately, this change in world affairs has come upon us at exactly the time when we have the opportunity to associate ourselves with the other countries of the European Community in full membership, and by associating ourselves now we can work together to protect effectively our own interests and theirs in a way which would not be possible were we to remain alone.It is not by luck that this opportunity has come about. It has been created through the foresight and the statesmanship of those who have preceded me as Leaders of this Party and of this country. It was Mr. Churchill who, 25 years ago, proclaimed in Zurich the need for a Europe growing together in unity. It was Mr. Macmillan who put in hand our first application to join the Community. And it is your Government, elected in June last year, which has finally carried these negotiations through to decisive success.The day of need which Sir Winston Churchill and Harold Macmillan so clearly perceived is now upon us. No longer are the problems which they foresaw lodged safely in some distant future. They are upon us now, urgent but not insoluble. They can be tackled and solved precisely because of the courage and loyalty of our Party in supporting our European policy with such consistency over the last ten years. Now that the need is upon us, we are prepared for it. We can join with others in Europe and exert ourselves to work out the Common European policies which will assure the future of every one of us: policies governing our dealings with the rest of the world, our trade, our finance and eventually our defence. That is what statesmanship means, not shifting from one belief to another as a result of some dubious calculation of brief political advantage, not looking simply to the headlines of next week or next month.Our duty as a Conservative Government is to look to the future and to the lives of future generations. This is the habit which your Government has inherited from its Conservative predecessors, this is the task which we are wholly determined to carry through.I have been speaking to you of a new world. That is no vision of the future, it is happening out there for all to see, it is there in the new patterns of power; in the sight of China, the awakened giant, taking up its role in the world; in the sight of America and the Soviet Union looking for a new place to stand. It is there in the sound of the new voices of new nations, some of them voices of violence, all of them questioning the practices of the past. This new world is a place of contrasts, dynamic and dangerous, a place of great risks but of even greater rewards - an exciting world to be part of. In such a world, history has reserved a place for us. At times of greatest stress, when the balance of history was shifting, there has always been a special place for us because we have a special kind of strength. Our strength is not just figures on a balance sheet, although we have those too; our strength is not just courage in adversity, although we have shown that time and time again. Our special strength lies in our sense of history, of knowing the right time to do the right thing.Our special strength is our stamina, in going on with what needs doing until it is done, in running a race as long as that race has to be run. We never know when we are beaten and that way we never are beaten. We know no other way than to win. This new world needs wisdom, judgment and above all stamina. These qualities have always been ours, they have been needed many times in the past. I doubt if the world has ever needed them more than it needs them today. They are qualities that can be given but cannot be bought and no country has more of them to give than our own. Do you suppose it is just a coincidence that today - for the first time in a long time - Britain\u2019s voice is being heard in the world again, not as a plaintive whisper in the corridors of power but as a voice that speaks what it knows and knows what is has learned from history? That is why Europe needs us. We speak our mind. We have something to say, and once more when we give our word the world believes us. Today that new world looks at us with new eyes. And there are plenty of new things for it to see and envy. It sees a country that is doing more to protect its weak and sick, doing more to reward effort with incentive, more to safeguard its environment and therefore its future.In the quiet revolution these things mark the first silent steps. They need to be big strides to keep pace with the way the world is moving. In this same year our revolution has been paralleled by a global evolution - much of it predictable and all of it, many would say, inevitable. Despite all this change, perhaps because of it, this new world needs us as never before. It believes in us, but the important question is this: do we believe sufficiently in ourselves? Are we confident enough in what we can achieve?There can be only one answer to us here in this Conference, to our party and, I believe, to the country - we can be, we must be. For too long we have walked in the shadows. It is time for us now to walk out into the light to find a new place, a new Britain in this new world. That is the choice that history offers us today. It is the kind of chance that only comes, if it ever comes, once in a lifetime. Let history record that when we were shown the way we took the way and walked out to meet our destiny. (Prolonged applause)

aVIt is just 25 years, Dame Peggy, since I attended my first Party Conference, and I have been at every one since. There may well be some in this hall today with a longer record than that. But no one else, as I understand it at any rate, has been present for the last eight years as Leader of the Party, or for the last three as Conservative Prime Minister.Every Conference has its own character stamped upon it; and so it has been with this one. This Conference has been a triumph for moderation, for decency and for good sense; and we all recognise how great a part the younger members of our Party have played in it. It has been a triumph not confined to this hall. It has been achieved with the whole world watching. The media, with their microphones and cameras \u2013 not forgetting their pencils and notebooks - have seen to it that the world outside this hall has watched a Party that knows its own mind is prepared to speak its own mind. What you have said has clearly matched the national mood.You are here representing every part of the country and every aspect of our national life. In your debates and by your votes you have decisively shown that moderation, clearly expounded and firmly pursued, meets the need of the nation.We have shown this week that we reject the equivocations so prevalent in this hall last week - the equivocations of those trying to make us believe that any problem can be solved just by facing both ways. Equally we reject those who react to one extreme by rushing to another, seeking to persuade us that in this way quick and easy answers can be found to hard and complicated problems. We are not a nation of extremists. We are a nation that believes in firmness and fairness; and this week we in this hall have shown that this is where we as a party also stand.The people of this country want a fair society. The Conservative Government is in process of creating just that. We are seeking to create it in the talks that we started with the employers and trade unions about curbing inflation \u2013 talks that will continue next Monday at Chequers. Throughout this Parliament we have been continuously engaged in the battle against inflation. Let no one say that we have not fought, and fought hard. When we have had setbacks, as we have, they have not been for the lack of will in trying to overcome them. We have not always been helped by those who in the past year have constantly made our small majority in Parliament still smaller and led others outside to believe, wrongly, that we could be toppled. But I would like to express my gratitude to all my colleagues in the Cabinet and in the Government for the firm support which they have given in the fight against inflation. It is to all our regrets that Reggie Maudling should not be on this platform with us this morning.At all times we have sought co-operation with those concerned in the country\u2019s economic organisation. It was through no fault of ours that sometimes events led to confrontation. We were returned to office with a clear mandate from the electorate - a mandate to reform the law on industrial relations, to reform the system of housing finance, to reform the social services, to reform the tax system and to reduce taxation. That was a clear mandate to enable the weak to be protected, the poor to be helped and others to be encouraged to expand the wealth of the nation. All of this mandate has been carried out. Yes \u2013 and we were given a mandate to reduce inflation. That we knew had to include bringing down inflationary wage settlements throughout the economy to something much more in line with production. We have been given all too little credit for the success we achieved.Over a wide area of the economy there was co-operation. But in parts there was alsoconfrontation. And so it was that Government, management and unions first met to discuss conciliation. As a result new machinery has been created by the employers and the unions. But that is not enough. We have now, therefore, jointly embarked for the first time in Britain, on the path of working out together how to create and share the nation\u2019s wealth for the benefit of all the people. It is an offer to em­ployers and unions to share fully with the Government the benefits and the obligations involved in running the national economy.I have always emphasised my belief in more open Government. For the parties to these talks to be able to work together better, they must tell each other all the facts. It may well be that employers and unions will recognise the need for more skilled and experienced staffs to carry through their part of the opera­tion. For what we are involved in is not just another argy bargy. It is a real attempt, a rational attempt and a sensible attempt to create greater prosperity and to make it more secure. What is more, this should be a continuing process, flexible enough to adapt itself to economic circumstances as they change. For the three parties cannot be expected to solve all the problems at once. But neither can the country wait until we have agreed on all the solutions before we act in order to contain inflation. We must act now and we ought to act together speedily, knowing that the machinery we have created at different levels can meet regularly and frequently to deal with the problems that remain, to deal with the new problems as they arise. Knowing that, we can look ahead year by year to consider the means of creating further expansion and look ahead to agree upon the priorities to which the nation wishes to devote its increasing wealth. This, then is our offer as a Government. No one should underestimate its importance. There are two reasons why I believe there is a better chance now of achieving our objectives.First, everyone has learnt that the cost of confrontation is high for all concerned, whatever the settlement \u2013 in empty pay packets, in lost production, in damage, often permanent, to a firm to an industry. There is another reason why I believe responsible union leaders are now readier to join with the Government and the employers in a co-operative effort to fight inflation. It is that for the first time they are being asked to do so against a background of expansion. For years under Labour the unions were being asked to make sacrifices as part of a policy of restriction and deflation. This time they are being asked to make their contribution to a rate of expansion that has not been achieved for more than a decade. As we sat around the table we soon came to realise that we had much more in common than the differences which divided us. In other words, we found a common desire to pursue economic policies for all people - not for one sectional interest, but for all. It is for the social partners, as I would call them, to acknowledge publicly and unequivocally that sometimes wider and common interests will conflict with their own sectional demands. It will be for them to have the courage to override their sectional interests. But in this the Government also has a part to play. It is for the Government to help them towards what we ought to recognise will be for them an act of imagination requiring very great courage.All the evidence shows that this approach of the Government has the support of the vast majority of the people in Britain, and to have that it must have included the support of millions of rank-and-file trade unionists, who also see that the offer we have made is fair. They also realise that it contains for every one of them a safeguard for their standard of living if the expectations jointly expressed, of the Government, the employers and the unions, should not materialise.On Monday at Chequers we can discuss and assess the statistics. No one partner can dictate to the others, nor insist that only their views can carry the day. But all will have a responsi­bility to ensure that agreements freely negoti­ated and entered into through the procedure we are adopting are fully supported and carried out. But the British people now expect us jointly to move to a settlement which will honestly deal with inflation, which will provide them with that improvement in their real standard of living which we have shown to be possible in an expanding economy.There will always be some who do not want to achieve a strong economy. There are those who do not want a strong Britain at all. There are those who cannot bear to see Britain strong under a Conservative Government.But for the most part I believe that people in this country want to have a fair and reasonable prospect of beating inflation. They have enough in common to override the vested interests; they are sufficiently at one to turn their backs on false sectional loyalty. The people of Britain want to unite in a common purpose.When I was given the Queen\u2019s commission to form this Government two and a half years ago, I declared on the steps of 10 Downing Street: \u2018Our purpose is not to divide but to unite, and where there are differences to bring about reconciliation.\u2019 It is precisely because we are setting out to do this, precisely because your Government represents all the people, that we have arranged the talks and put forward our plan. We repre­sent all the people, but especially those who have no powerful organisation to speak for them, especially those who are most vulnerable to rising prices, especially those, the weakest in the community, who have most to gain from a strong economy. This is the purpose of the specific proposals which we have put. This, I am convinced, is what the nation needs. It is what the nation expects - nothing less.It takes a united country to make a nation strong socially and economically. But to achieve this it is not enough to be united in our economic objectives. We need also to renew and strengthen the bonds within our society \u2013 the bonds which, over the years, have given this country a strength and stability that has been the envy of the world: the bonds of family, the bonds between employers and employees, between Parliament and people, between Government and governed.We hear a good deal these days of how these bonds have become weakened. It is easy to exaggerate this and talk ourselves into a crisis of self-confidence. Young people insist on having a greater say in the decisions that affect their lives today and tomorrow - and so they should.Employees insist on having a greater say in the decisions that affect their jobs and the prosperity of their families - and so they should. And the good employer will increasingly adapt himself to this desire and seek to carry his employees with him in taking management decisions.People everywhere want to be more and more involved in the decisions that affect them, and one of our aims in carrying through the reform of local government is to make this participation more real and more meaningful. And yet I know what disturbs so many of you here, so many watching or listening in your own homes. It is the fear that freedom and democracy are being abused by those who seek only to suppress free speech and free action. It is wrong that employers should be tyrannised, wrong that fellow workers should be terrorised by industrial action that erupts into violence. You know it is our determination, and I believe the determination of responsible trade union leaders, to stamp out lawless picketing; and it is wrong that those who themselves claim to be in positions of authority should deliberately set out to defy the law of the land. Hence our decision to warn those local authorities - few in number - in England and Wales who are bent on refusing to imple­ment the fair rents law carried through by a democratically elected Parliament.Robert Carr has told you how this Govern­ment will intensify the fight against law­breaking within the principles of law and free­dom of which this country is proud. But the fight against lawlessness is not one for the Government alone; it is one in which every single one of us has a role to play. And it is one where those who lead or aspire to lead must themselves be ready to give a lead. In the past year we have had too much breaking of the law in the name of the law, too many attempts to disrupt the democratic process in the name of democracy. I believe that the people of Britain are tired of this double-talk and fed up to the teeth with this humbug. For you cannot pick and choose which law you want to obey and which to defy. Let those who value the law stand up and repudiate those who defy the law. Let them repudiate those who refuse to accept the verdict of the courts. Let them repudiate the lawless pickets. Let those who value democracy repudiate the fair rent rebels. Let been repudiate those who want to tear down what Parliament has built up.A strong Britain. Strong in its economic foundations. Strong in its social fabric. Strong in the bonds that bind us together as a nation and have over the centuries made us the most cohesive and most powerful national force in Europe, if not in the world.A strong Britain is a confident Britain, confident in its ability to take on the duties and the obligations which are imposed by history on any nation with a claim to greatness. We have shown ourselves ready to face our responsibility in Northern Ireland, to defeat the forces of terror and violence, to give the people of Northern Ireland \u2013 all the people \u2013 a chance to choose a system of government that will secure the political and social rights of all the people, irrespective of their religion or their political alliance.This is, in terms of human misery, the most terrible problem that we as a Government and as a country have to face. It haunts us every day. It requires patience, imagination and indeed humility to resolve. I promise you in this Conference that they will be forthcoming. How fortunate we are in having Willie Whitelaw as Secretary of State!We have shown ourselves ready to face our responsibility over the plight of the Ugandan Asians, to accept this survival of our imperial heritage, to prove that the promise of a British Government is not to be broken, to show that it means what it says, to bring order out of chaos, to confront cruelty with sympathy and with humility.In the immediate future we must be confident enough to look ahead. For our future is now about to take on a new dimension. Over years you as a party have always encouraged and supported us in our European policy. You have always by substantial majorities urged us whenever and wherever possible to move towards partnership with the other members of our Continent. We are no longer talking of possibilities; we are talking now of a great achievement. Within a few years how incredibly short-sighted will appear our opponents who urge us to throw our achievement away, particularly when they do so simply because the credit for that achievement belongs to your Conservative Government and not to them.At the Summit Meeting next week my aim will be to join with our partners, the other Heads of Government, in settling the lines on which our new Europe will grow and work together in the next few years.In this new partnership we have a chance as a great people, as a formidable nation, as a shaper and moulder of the modern world, to get back into action, to take up a part which I believe we have a unique capacity to fill. This contemporary world of ours is, after all, the world which Britain in the last four hundred years has profoundly influenced. When the cockleshell boats set off with a Drake or a Cabot their new commerce united the whole world. Their settlements sprang up in every continent. The new markets stimulated our science and technology to launch a whole new industrial way of life. The institutions we adopted - of enterprise and personal freedom and social responsibility - broke open the ancient world of absolute government.For an offshore island of a few million people, it was and remains a staggering achievement. We did not secure it by staying at home. In fact, there is hardly a great movement of post-renaissance man, be it national statehood, scientific endeavour, economic expansion or worldwide discovery that has not been profoundly marked at every stage by British energy and endeavour and backed by the hard slogging dedication of the British people.If we realise today how large is the part we have played in moulding the modern world, it is above all because that same world now cries out to us for even more drastic and constructive change. For every one of the colossal achievements of the last four centuries, there are now shadows of danger across us on an equal scale - the problem of keeping the peace and how to break down distrust between East and West without taking risks with our own defences. The economic problems \u2013 in Europe, how to transform the grim cities and impoverished countryside which years of uneven development have left behind; in the world, how to bring hope and betterment to the two-thirds of humanity who live in poverty.The problems of the environment - and, here again, let us remember that these problems respect no frontiers. This week\u2019s territorial waters in the Baltic are next week\u2019s waters off Aberdeen. The pesticides carried up the Rhine can be washed off down the Thames. The sulphurs and particles in Britain\u2019s air fall in dirty rain on the Continent of Europe.This today is the contemporary world of economic imbalance, of environmental insecurity, of national rivalry, and yet at the same time global involvement. It is the world which we have helped to create and which we now inherit. We have all been, as it were, part of these problems. Now we can be part of the solution.This is the context of our entry into Europe. This alone makes sense of what we have to do. For these problems do not respect frontiers, and neither should frontiers restrict our efforts to solve them.I see in these immense problems, not a block to British action and ambition, but a deep and satisfying challenge to carry on the work of world building in which Britain in the past has played so great a part. As we reach the last quarter of the twentieth century, we are beginning to see so clearly where the paths of renewal lie. They lead us towards a new community with our European neighbours and, through this community, to a new epoch of British service and influence on the whole society of man.It is to make a start upon that work that with your support and encouragement I go to Paris as your Prime Minister next week.I have spoken of the challenge of change, because that is how we see it. And as with so many things in life it is a question of how you look at it. What some people seem to see as an intolerable burden seems to me an incredible opportunity, an opportunity for every one of us. I suppose when you come down to it most things are a question of attitude. You are either on the side of doing things or you are on the side of believing that they just cannot be done. I think we are getting to a point where each of us in this country of ours has got to decide where he stands. I ask our fellow citizens - do you want to say \u2018No\u2019 all the time; \u2018No, it cannot be done\u2019; \u2018No, we never did it this way before\u2019; \u2018No, leave it alone and it might just go away\u2019; \u2018No, we are scared\u2019? Or are we going to have the courage to say \u2018Yes\u2019 \u2013 \u2018Yes, this is how it should be; yes, this is what I believe in; yes, this is for the good of us all; yes, we are going to have a try\u2019? It is a decision a lot of people still have to make. They are unsure, they are undecided.So I say this to all of you as members of our Party. The balance of any future general election lies not with you but with those who are yet undecided. If we cannot give them a lead, then we shall have failed, and we shall have deserved to fail. So let us tell them where we stand, where this Government stands. We are going to build on the past, but we are not going to be strangled by it. We are going forward to take the place which history has reserved for us, and we are going to speak with a voice that has been silent for too long. We are out in the world again. It will take courage. There may be mistakes. But they will not stop is from doing the things that must be done, the things that are going to be done.But most of all we are going to stand up and be counted. And when our voice is heard its message will be clear. We shall say \u2018Yes\u2019 \u2013 \u2018Yes\u2019 to decisions that may be hard - so long as they are fair; \u2018Yes\u2019 to this country of ours that is finally on the move again; \u2018Yes\u2019 to a future brighter than anything in the past. And if \u2018Yes\u2019 seems a harder word to say than \u2018No,\u2019 well, it could just be be­cause when we know that \u2018Yes\u2019 is the right word it is the only word worth saying.

aVMr. Chairman, I beg to move the Parliamentary Report. This has been a session of great intensity covering the mounting and increasingly obvious demoralisation of the Government.The total reversal of incomes policy; Stages I and II of the Government\u2019s statu­tory prices and incomes shambles; the collapse of the Government's economic policies; the breakdown of the Government\u2019s housing policy.There have been the almost endless Northern Ireland debates; the debates on the Common Market, as month by month we have reaped the bitter fruits of the. Government\u2019s entry terms. But what we have been concerned with is not related to these islands only. Yesterday I called on this conference to accept a new dimension in internal policies. If we are really to dare to accept the measures necessary to create one nation, one community, one family, this cannot be inward looking, nationalistic, xenophobic, whether we are inward looking within our own coasts or inward looking within a West European campus.In these past three years we have seen the horizons of this country not expanding, but shrinking; a Prime Minister who re­fuses to attempt to give a lead to a Com­monwealth and only seems to be fidgeting in his chair to get away; a Foreign Secretary incapable of peering beyond his vision of a reconstructed concert of Europe. Let it at least be said in defence of Metternich that the Holy Alliance itself was never under French patronage. A Government insensi­tive and protocolaire about the brutalities of Chile\u2019s counter-revolution; a Govern­ment whose view of the open seas to the West of us is limited to the thought that they provide a means of shipping military jets via the United States to a Spain that denies freedom to her own people and seeks to enslave the people of Gibraltar.We censored a few weeks ago the Govern­ment over the Mozambique massacres and their wining and dining of the Portuguese dictator. We have been proved right. We have restated the role of Britain in the world fight for freedom. A century ago that fight was in Europe. Today it is in Africa and the wider third world, and we have welcomed to this Conference repre­sentatives of those who are leading the fight for freedom in Africa and elsewhere. (Applause)If a century ago Palmerston, Gladstone and Disraeli could see that Britain\u2019s interest meant a breach with the ancient empires and the support of national revolutionaries in Greece, Italy, Spain and Portugal, can­not the present rulers of this country see that not only the moral future of Britain but its real interests are bound up with the support of freedom movements in Southern Africa? There may be African freedom fighters who would appear incon­gruous in a Belgravian drawing room, but I guess Garibaldi and Kossuth did not bath twice a day either.Our debates that we have had on the state of the nation, on prices and incomes policy - the Government have rejected all the advice the Labour movement has given them: our own debate here a year ago, the TUC\u2019s warnings. We warned - both of us - that unless they tackled prices, unless they countermanded the rent increases for which they had legislated and which this week hit the council tenant yet again, unless they helped the lower paid, unless they lifted the standard of living of the pen­sioners, unless they included within their freeze and in Stage II protection for the owner-occupier, unless they brought all these requirements into their policy, their proposals would fail: fail because they were unworkable, unworkable because they were fundamentally unjust.But when last November, in defiance of a score of categorical election pledges, Mr. Heath proclaimed a total statutory incomes freeze he did not deal with food prices. It was a total wage freeze but not a freeze on rents, a total salary freeze but not a freeze on mortgage interest rates. He did not increase pensions, but he increased the burden on the lower-paid. His achievement \u2013 his first achievement - was to create anomalies affecting some of our most poorly rewarded industries and services - the farm-workers, local authority manual workers, gas workers, civil servants and others.He rejected the Parliamentary Labour Party\u2019s demands for action to protect these groups. He preferred to await the report of a Pay Board which had not been set up, under a Statute that had not been intro­duced into Parliament and which, when it was established, would not be answerable to Parliament.A year after our warnings here, we now have a report from the Pay Board unconvincingly putting forward useless proposals which are not even sustained by its thin argument. The fact is that those who were prejudiced by the Government\u2019s action a year ago have not caught up and never will. The fact is that he has repudiated all the principles of fair dealing between one group and another.He has breached a long-standing arrangement of comparability between one sector of public industry and another - gas and electricity, for example. He has repudiated a principle accepted by successive Governments since 1957 about the comparability of civil servants\u2019 salaries and wages with those of the rest of industry. He has gone further: he has prostituted the position of the Head of the Civil Service, long regarded as the protector of the rights of the Civil Service, by involving him in the devising and enforcement of the Government\u2019s policy, and requiring him to communicate to public employees the breach of policies previously agreed. He has in fact rejected the principle which a year ago I demanded he must insist upon - no discrimination against the public sector.Now even the CBI are in revolt. Exports are being frustrated; delivery dates dishonoured, because of a famine in the over­heated areas of the country of both skilled and less skilled labour. For private em­ployers now, it is every man for himself. Some of them are unable to get labour, and to meet delivery dates they are bidding up wages and salaries by every device legal and illegal, while other employers are reacting in the same way to hold the labour they have. Outside the manual field, at any rate, there have never been so many creations of new titles, new grades, new and honorific job specifications, as we have seen in this great campaign by employers to beat the pay policy.But for the farm worker and the miners, the steel workers and the textile worker, the railwayman and the post office worker, there are no bogus titles.And we have seen the deadly effect on our essential services, seen the police in London and other big cities, and those who drive the buses, and the students, on the hospital service, and last week we even read of a famine of linen supplies for hospitals be­cause of a shortage of labour in the laun­dries. And even while we have been here in Blackpool, employers honourably seeking to implement agreements they have entered into with their workers, agreements related to new patterns of productivity, are now appealing, in vain, to the Government to allow them to honour their undertakings. It is Cornish Clay one day, it is British Leyland the next. But Mr. Heath and his colleagues insist on accumulating the grapes of wrath and dishonouring agreements and dividing the British people.Let us tell him, whatever may be said from this platform next week, you cannot solve the problems of inflation with a public relations exercise; still less can you solve it by appointing a Cabinet Minister, Sir Geoffrey (Alibi) Howe, to camp outside the BBC \u2013 \u2018Today\u2019; \u2018The World at One,\u2019 \u2018PM\u2019 and \u2018Tonight\u2019 - as an apologist for an indefensible policy. (Applause)For the first time in the history of this movement, the Labour Party - the National Executive Committee and the Parliamentary Party - and the Trade Union Congress - have reached agreement on a categorical programme for fighting inflation.We have set out the measures which in our view must be taken as a minimum programme if we are to secure a policy for fighting rising prices and rising rents.Action to control prices, where it counts, w here the housewife does her shopping.Direct action to deal with essential foods, using food subsidies.A freeze on all council house and new town rents.Action, such as I called for yesterday, to control the London capital market and freeze market interest rates.A crisis tax on land and property specula­tion.An adequate pension increase now.A declaration that in the next Budget provocative and divisive tax concessions to the wealthy are to be reversed, and the proceeds used to help the less well off.The country has rejected the Govern­ment\u2019s excuses. And no wonder.This Government, elected on a pledge to reduce prices, in fact came into office determined to force up prices. This was made clear by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in September, 1970. He called for higher prices then, in order to secure higher profits, in order to secure higher investment. We have had the higher prices. We have had the higher profits - record profits. But investment is still lagging sadly behind the level of 1970.We know with what determination the Government set out to increase food prices with their food levies. Again, let us not under-rate their successes in forcing up food prices. After all no-one in this country can now be in any doubt about the effect on the price levels, now and so far as he is con­cerned, forever more of the humiliating terms Mr. Heath accepted from M. Pompi­dou in May 1971. (Applause)But what this Government have con­spired with Europe to ensure is that when prices come down again, as they do from time to time, they won\u2019t come down in Britain.Even the Beaverbrook Evening Standard told us in August: \u2018the traditional British breakfast could soon become a meal of the past because of escalating prices for bacon and eggs. And now the cost of cereals is going up.\u2019 And that was after its stable mate had confessed what every housewife knows: that for millions of families the roast beef of old England has disappeared from the Sunday table.To complete the trilogy, we have from the same source - Beaverbrook Newspapers - the confession that beef prices will never come down to anything like traditional levels because of the British Government\u2019s acquiescence in recent decisions of the Common Market.Mr. Heath has not only gone along with rising prices stroke after stroke after stroke; he has built in a ratchet to ensure that once risen they stay risen.The Government\u2019s inflationary policy is one, but only one, of the reasons for Britain\u2019s economic crisis. The other is their headlong rush into creating a free market, a free market in name, but one where every­thing which affects the concerns of the financial interests they serve is rigged before you start.The consequences we know only too well. Prices in peace time rising faster even than in wartime. The national debt in peace time rising even more than in wartime. We remember in Election week 1970 his scare story that a Labour Government would have to introduce a wage freeze and would devalue sterling within three years. He did both and did it in two years. Now his devaluation means that the £ abroad has plummeted by 20 per cent.He has not in fact received the same treatment as happened on an earlier occa­sion. In fact it was all quite cheery. The Daily Express had the headline, \u2018£ Floating. Proud,\u2019 \u2018Holidaymakers told \u201cGet your pounds changed here.\u201d\u2019 The story began, \u2018The £ bravely floated to freedom last night.\u2019 Like a brick, as it turned out. (Laughter and applause).Now, as each dismal set of trade figures follows another, we see Mr. Peter Walker rushing to the studio, or the nearest mobile broadcasting car, to proclaim them as a triumph of the Government\u2019s policies.But we remember a few days before the election of 1970, when the monthly trade figures were published - a very small deficit - Mr. Heath deliberately falsified their message. He was inevitably successful in orchestrating a great Press and broadcast­ing lamentation at the impending collapse of the economy. We were in fact in surplus, and our balance of payments was soaring to a £1,000 million surplus on the plus side.But month after month this year we have seen trade deficits of £150 millions and above. In June they published the worst ever figure - a deficit of £209 million in a month; an average deficit for the preceding three months of over £150 million. Where were the screaming headline writers of June 1970? (Applause) Perhaps it was the news-­print shortage. (Laughter) One great London evening newspaper printed a perfunctory statement in the bottom right hand corner of the front page, referring the reader to page 50 of the City section if he cared to read all about it. In later editions it disappeared altogether from the front page.After the trade figures had been pub­lished, the other great London evening newspaper produced an afternoon edition with a main headline across seven columns: EXCLUSIVE \u2018Soccer Star Marriage shock\u2019 - (Laughter and Applause) - A London striker\u2019s \u2018Wife goes home to Mum.\u2019 This I can assert with confidence, recalling our experience of Mr. Heath conducting the mighty press orchestra of June 1970, if there had been trade figures in that month such as those he has achieved three years later, they would have been trumpeted abroad across all the columns there are. Even if the wives of every footballer in the First Division, the Second Division (Laughter), the Third Division and the Fourth Division, the Scottish First Division, the Scottish Second Division, the Central League, the Southern League, the Lan­cashire Combination, (Laughter), the Isthmian League, the Spartan League, the Athenian League, indeed the entire football Combination had all collectively gone home to their mums.What, month by month, is destroying the last vestiges of confidence Mr. Heath still enjoys, even among his own friends in industry and the City, is the growing realisation that the Conservative Party, at home and abroad, after all their boasts, has become tainted as the Party of unsound finance and clipped money. And all the country is given is that repetitive speech about growth.Growth? A stretch of jungle, a foetid swamp, are certainly not deficient in growth; an unweeded garden \u2018"things rank and gross in nature possess it merely.\u2019But Mr. Heath has achieved a distorted growth by the unique prescription of applying fertilisers to the weeds and Para­quat to the fruit and flowers. (Applause and Laughter)In no area of our society have we seen the consequence of hard-line Tory policies and distorted growth more clearly than in housing. Reports are coming in from all over the country of the breakdown in other public building programmes. Hospital building in several parts of the country delayed by a year or more. Schools held back, shrunk in size, or not even started.It is ludicrous, not least after all the pledges about the place of housing in the \u2018Better Tomorrow,\u2019 that the city of Shef­field should now be totally precluded from building by the Government\u2019s actions. Other cities are still maintaining some sort of a programme, but the unreal yardstick controls mean that even those authorities that are doing some building are in many cases being forced into building broiler estates with no room to breathe. With broiler estates, you can always be sure that the Liberals will be there to rifle the nests.The Government are in fact using their yardsticks to cut back public expenditure on housing without having the guts to tell Parliament or the country. They have not cut the programme; they are simply mak­ing it impossible to achieve. The coward\u2019s way out.In the private sector, to the shortage and chaos, as I said yesterday, they are adding the financial anarchy. It is ridiculous, and essentially divisive that the cost of paying for Dunromin should depend on manoeuvr­ings in the Euro-dollar market. This is not all.I said yesterday that in my view the finance of housing should become a national responsibility. But one thing is urgent as soon as Labour comes into office, even while this major financial reorgani­sation is taking shape. A short sharp Bill should go through Parliament cancelling the built-in escalation of rents for council tenants and for private tenants. (Applause)That is the first step towards the repeal of the Housing Finance Act. We will draw its teeth before we cut its throat.That is why when we look at these things in the public sector we find a mere­tricious vulgarity in Mr. Heath\u2019s \u2018You\u2019ve never had materialism so good\u2019 speech. There is little that is surprising in the fact that there are now more colour television sets or dish washers than there were three years ago. Each decade sees an increase in the purchase of the products of technolo­gical advance. I should be very surprised if in 1933, when there were three million unemployed, there were not very many more radio sets than in. 1930.But we have to lift our eyes above the sales figures of an over-advertised society.There are other values, and they are neglected by the kind of Government Britain has got and the kind of people they exist to promote.Is the Admass profession capable of ex­pressing - still less satisfying - the real desires of average parents, their hopes for them­selves, their dreams for their children?Is it not possible, if they were asked and if society were to respond to their answers, that they are more concerned with getting a good school for their children? That they would give higher priority for the demo­lition of a Victorian barracks of a school and its replacement by a school worthy of their new generation? Might it not be that they would measure their family\u2019s standard of living not by consumer goods but by the chance their children would have the size of the classes they will attend? For as Ted Short reminded us last year education de­privation and inequality begins not at 11+, or even at 5+, but in the years before the child is 5.Are not working mothers more concerned to have adequate nursery facilities for looking after their children during working hours? Are not so many of our people concerned that they should not have to bring up their children in homes whose structure and amenities are a blot on our civilisation?Is this age not guilty today of building slums which shortly will take their place? Is not our system of society guilty when we build a Fort Yardstick to take its place beside slums inherited from the past? Would not our people give much more to live in a home where children could sleep in quiet, not subject to the roaring and belching of a juggernaut society, or the ever-demanding requirements of nocturnal jets?Would not our old people prefer to live the retirement they have earned in better amenities than so many of them get, rather than hear on radios or TV about the material symbols of a society from which they are so largely excluded? Would not all - young and old - yearn for greater access to green fields and open space in the countryside? Or when they go down to the sea or the river to have some confidence that their day or their week or their fort­night is not ruined by the pollution of modern society?These are the ideas so many of our people have in mind when they think or dream of the luxuries which could exist in that narrow margin between outgoings and income, and to achieve those dreams is not only a question of the organisation of in­dustry and finance and the extension of public enterprise we were talking about yesterday. It is still more a question of the values which inspire our society.We must be prepared to dare to produce the policies, to venture upon the measures that will make a reality of the freedom of choice, the degree of involvement, the right of a voice in all the major decisions affect­ing the life of the individual and the individual family - the Edinburgh theme.But the challenge which faces us lies not merely in widening the area of individual choice but in providing a means both in industry and in society generally to create a more responsible society. Responsibility not conferred from above.Conference now has come to terms with the implications of the programme I presented yesterday. Above all, in education. Because it is about education that we are in fact speaking.We in the Labour Party reject the idea that education is simply to train techno­logical lobby fodder, or to instil into our children the particular degree of smartness required to compete in a commercial rat race.We have always said that education must be for the fuller appreciation of life and an ability to appreciate the riches of this and of past civilisations.But that is not all. We are talking about citizenship. What I asserted in my Edin­burgh series of speeches was the need for individual citizens, individual families, to be brought more and more close to the decisions which affect their lives.But the programme that this Conference clearly accepted yesterday adds a new dimen­sion to the educational challenge. Yesterday, I put before you a massive programme, on behalf of the National Executive Committee, for bringing the land, the minerals and great sectors of industry into social owner­ship.To do that will be meaningless unless all our people are identified in the wider responsibilities that will pass from boardrooms that are not accountable to the national interest, to a new system which is accountable to the nation through an elected Parliament.The 19th century educational revolution was designed to produce a middle-class elite for meeting the requirements of the new Establishment at home and in the Empire.The educational revolution in the 20th century was based certainly upon the ideals of great educationalists and teachers, but in its higher reaches it is still far too greatly concentrated on meeting the requirements of a predominantly commercial society.A century ago Tennyson said, \u2018We are not spinners all.\u2019 Today we are not com­puter programmers all either, and none of us accept an educational system designed mainly to feed the requirements of a society orientated on profits and marketing and capital gains.But above all we have got to ensure that our system of education is directed not to the creation of school-leavers who will be so involved in the rat race that they never begin to live until they are too old to enjoy it. We have to end the artificial system under which education ceases for the majority of our people one day in one July; their past school life and their con­tinuing education must be part of the same process.In Blackpool six months ago I rejected the argument which suggested that there is any defined ordinance that every newborn child should be automatically assigned to either the officer class or the operative class in industry and in our wider society.That is why any programme for industrial democracy must provide for an obligation on the employer, public or private, to enable every employee to have continuing education, with compulsory facilities for day release not only in vocational training but in all forms of study which he wishes to follow so that he can play his full part in industry and in all the wider calls of citizenship.The Victorians said \u2018We must educate our masters\u2019 and they produced a Daily Mail. But in the context of yesterday\u2019s debate those responsible for decision making in industry will come increasingly from those who are working in industry and they must have facilities for continuing educa­tion and must have them more abundantly.Including the Open University, created by the Labour Government, which has now been acknowledged by the world\u2019s leading educational authorities as the greatest advance in education in this or any other country in the world in this century. (Applause) Although the then Conservative leadership said they would destroy it when they came into office, even they are now applauding its foundation and taking pride in it. Pride too in the fact that other countries all over the world are emulating it or improving our balance of payments by buying our teaching material.I now want to come to this. This Con­ference at Blackpool is the second in the autumn series of Party Conferences.There was another at Southport. Immediately afterwards I learned from the press that Mr. Thorpe, following the distinguished precedent of Mr. Grimond 10 years after Orpington, was already preparing his dis­positions for the day following the next General Election.I am not opposed to innocent amusement provided he does not take himself seriously. (Laughter) After the next election he and his little band will have the same freedom to vote for the Tory Opposition that they exploited to the full when the Labour Government (Applause) was surviving with a majority of two in the autumn of 1965.The claim that the Liberals now have clear policies on the great issues of the day is shaken a little if one studies their record in this Parliament, a record no less maverick than that of the years after 1964.On the Industrial Relations Act, on which the next Parliament is going to take a clear decision, they voted for the second reading and against the third reading. On the issues which reduced Britain to a state of industrial chaos in the summer of 1972 they voted, when the bill was going through, in favour of the cooling-off period; but on the provision for the strike ballot they abstained. On the important vote on the code of industrial practice under the bill, three Liberals voted for it and three abstained, or had other engagements.On the Second Reading of the EEC Bill five Liberals voted with the Government and one against, in a division which gave the Government a majority of eight.On our call for a general election so that the people could decide before Britain entered the Market, all the Liberals voted with the Government against us and against community politics by the British people. (Applause)On the vote for a referendum before entry three voted for it and three against. There was no clear Party line, though two of the recent Liberal by-election victors in Rochdale and Sutton and Cheam decided they would get more votes be falling over themselves to adopt our policy for a referen­dum before a final decision was taken.Their voting record on VAT is even more difficult to fathom. In any case, their vote for the Market decided the issue. On prides and incomes, on which the next Parliament must have a clear view, they supported the Government in every vote on all aspects of Stage I and Stage II. In our censure on the Government for the treatment of hospital and ancillary workers and other lower paid groups, the Liberals voted with the Government. They are, we understand, campaigning for a national minimum wage though there is some confusion about whether this should be £24 or £25 a week. But when they had the opportunity to vote for lower paid workers, they trooped obediently through the Conservative Lobby against them. (Applause) The press build-up to our conference here this year is reminiscent of what hap­pened exactly eight years ago. When we met here in Blackpool then, you would have thought from the build-up that one issue dominated the Conference, namely, what my response would be to Mr. Grimond\u2019s offer to keep the Labour Govern­ment in office as long as it dropped its programme in favour of whatever the Liberal programme happened to be at any particular moment of time. (Laughter) I rejected this out of hand. We then had a majority of two, and the Speaker\u2019s seat was vacant.Now there are ancestral voices heralding a new alignment of political forces. With all the authority of a twice-defeated Conservative candidate, the. Editor of The Times is thundering out his canonicals.As a first step - and what has happened to the public opinion polls we had at the last Conference? Are they showing something different? (Laughter) As a first step, he and his fellow manipulators dream of an election result in which the Liberal Party holds the balance in a newly elected Par­liament. This, they pray, will lead to a situ­ation which would mean a permanent majority for the Conservatives by the creation of a new Liberal Party out of the ashes of the Labour Party. They are wast­ing their time. This Party is not for burning. (Applause)Let this be clear: as long as I am Leader of this Party, Labour will not enter into any coalition with any other Party, Liberal or Conservative or anyone else. (Prolonged applause)As long as I am Leader of this Party there will be no electoral treaty, no political alliance, no understanding, no deal, no arrangement, no fix, neither will there be any secret deal or secret discus­sions. Whatever the results of the election, a Labour Government will go forward boldly on its policy, challenging any manoeuverers to make their position clear in vote after vote. On land, on housing, on industrial relations, on education and on the rest of this programme that we shall be carrying out. If, as they never dared to do between 1964 and 1966, they make it impossible for us to implement that pro­gramme, then the issue will be taken openly back to the people of this country for a final decision. (Applause) And let the danger light upon those who thought they could exercise an electorally unearned control over a constitutional government. That is that and will remain that. But one conclusion follows. If there are those of undefined political allegiance who devoutly wish to see a coalition, they must understand that the only coalition possible is a coalition of the two Tory Parties, the Conservative Tory Party and the Liberal Tory Party. (Applause) So let everyone recognise, a vote for the Liberals is a vote for a Tory dominated coalition. (Applause)Now finally, from the dreams of South­port back to the realities of this Conference. I do mean this Conference. In recent weeks, visiting constituency parties, I have stressed the good fortune of those who have been chosen by their Constituency Parties to represent them at this Conference. Their Parties have paid the pooled fare. I told them that they would get good value - two for the price of one. For one pooled fare they would get two Conferences - the one we have been attending this week, the other we read about next morning. (Laughter and Applause)I have to confess that I understated the contrast between them. I ought to have realised what was going to happen a few days ago when I read those fanciful accounts of the transactions of the NEC over the 25 companies - no relation to reality whatever.If there is one thing some of our Fleet Street friends cannot stand, it is a successful and united Conference. They are having a bad time. They began to prepare for their new line, as we see this morning, before we even met. The Editor of The Times had a leading article about the screaming nightmares to which he appeared to be subject about Marxists under the bed.Following that leading article, another is now a front runner for the Aims of Industry prize for independent journalism. (Laughter) Should you in fact have missed it I should like just to lint before you to give you a chance of savouring yesterday\u2019s Daily Express report of our Conference. It began like this:'THE SCENE, at first glance, in the Winter Gardens, Blackpool, might well have resembled Moscow\u2019s Palace of Congresses in Stalin\u2019s time.'(Laughter)'All those massive crystal chandeliers under the gilded stucco ceiling, with its coats of arms and dancing cherubs, and | below, those serried ranks of grim-looking delegates'(Laughter)'in their square-cut lounge suits \u2013 not a smile between them \u2013 at the opening of the Labour Conference.'Then he goes on:'Not forgetting the few women kept firmly in their place, so it seemed, well at the back.'(Laughter)'And, on the presidium \u2013 sorry, platform \u2013 the same grimness, the same authoritarian aspect.'Around all was the colour red as the basic theme of the affair.  Red plush seats.  Red draped platform.  Red back-grounded slogan, \u201cLabour Leads to a Better Britain.\u201d'And red costumes worn by MPs Mrs Barbara Castle, Miss Joan Lestor and Mrs Lena Jeger.Small wonder the smile of expectancy on the face of the Tass man on the Press table.'(Laughter and applause)'Small wonder the approving clouds of Georgian tobacco smoke from certain sections of the diplomatic enclosure.'This reference to red costumes - let us get this out of the way first, shall we? It is a very dated phrase of the fifties. I do not know who thought that one up. It really is a tribute to my lady colleagues\u2019 sartorial conservatism - they always wear red on Conference Mondays! And then that smile of expectancy on the face of the Tass man on the Press table. Has anyone ever seen a Tass man smile? And that egregious tobacco. What was it \u2013 \u2018Small wonder the approving clouds of Georgian tobacco smoke from certain sections of the diplo­matic enclosure.\u2019 Speaking as one who is rapidly becoming an authority on tobacco, I have never learned how to make clouds of tobacco smoke approving. But if this is possible, I suppose next week in this hall it will be Rhodesian tobacco curling upwards in satisfaction. (Laughter and Applause)Then the Express lists a diplomatic gazette of ambassadors and ministers attending this Conference. And, I do not like to mention this, even an accusation that you, Mr. Chairman, in your opening speech, were plagiarising Leonid Brezhnev.I hope the Diplomatic Corps, not only East European, but the whole range of Excellencies from the South African to the Portuguese will know with what sinister interpretations the Daily Express must now greet their attendance at the Conservative Conference next week.Seriously though: no wonder the Express is losing circulation. If they, and others, printed the football results with the same accuracy they devote to our Proceedings here, not only would Huddersfield Town be the top of the First Division (Laughter), but no-one would buy their paper.But let us face it, in 28 years the Tories have not changed; 1945, Clem Atlee was the Gestapo; 1973, I am the KGB (Laughter), and the ideals underlying this Conference are to be disinterred from the archives of the Marx-Engels Institute. I thank them very much for that.You, Mr. Chairman, sought them in the words of Robert Blatchford.I could go back earlier to another im­peccably democratic source, to the words of a statesman - who more than a century ago, fought for democracy and. indeed, died for democracy. And I want to sum up what I think this conference is about by quoting Abraham Lincoln, and this is what he said:'In the early days of the world, the Almighty said to the first of our race \u2018in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread\u2019; and since then, if we accept the light and the air of heaven, no good thing has been, or can be enjoyed by us, without having first cost labour. And, inasmuch as most good things are produced by labour, it follows that all such things of right belong to those whose labour has pro­duced them. But it has so happened in all ages of the world, that some have laboured, and others have, without labour, enjoyed a large proportion of the fruits. This is wrong, and should not continue. To secure to each labourer the whole product of his labour, or as nearly as possible, is a most worthy object of any good government.'That, Mr. Chairman, is the message of this Conference, of this Party, to the people of Britain and to the world.

aVI present the Parliamentary Report, a report on the implementation of the Manifesto we put to the people in the election of February 1974, and the one on which we fought the October election a year ago.The word \u2018Manifesto\u2019 is constantly heard these days, and that is right. No new Party grouping, over the whole spectrum of Party thinking, now considers itself respectable if it does not include the word \u2018Manifesto\u2019 in its title.We are all Manifesto custodians now. Never has there been such unity in the history of the Party in supporting the Manifesto - or such diversity in its interpretation. (Laughter)As Leader of the majority group in Parlia­ment, the MPs elected by your efforts and by a groundswell of national opinion last year, I have from 4 March, 1974 onwards regarded myself as a full-time, one-man Manifesto group. (Laugh­ter)The Parliamentary Report gives solid back­ing to my claim that no previous Prime Minister - no Labour Prime Minister and certainly no Conservative - has been able to present a record of a Government which has carried through so much of its Manifesto, by legislative and executive action in so short a time.In the four and a half months in which the House was sitting during the Short Parliament of last year, 35 Bills became law, and I ask you to bear with me for a moment while I list them.We passed the Trade Union and Labour Rela­tions Act which repealed the 1971 Industrial Relations Act, preserved and extended existing unfair dismissals provisions and extended trade union immunities; the Health and Safety at Work Act setting up the Health and Safety Commission; the Prices Act which abolished the Pay Board, provided £500 millions for food subsidies on key essential foodstuffs and strengthened the Price Code; we ended the sticky labels racket by prohibiting upward re-pricing of goods already on the shelves in the shops, and we restricted the frequency of implementation of price increases. In the National Insurance Act 1974 we fulfilled the Manifesto pledge to raise pensions to £10 for a single person and £16 for a couple; the Finance Act introduced major changes to eliminate tax dodgers. The Rent Act gave security of tenure to those in furnished accommodation. We doubled the Regional Employment Premium which Labour had introduced in 1967 and which the Conservatives were committed to abolish.That was the Short Parliament. With a minor­ity Labour Government. (Applause)Now the Manifesto on which we went to the country a year ago.First, Bills which have already been placed on the Statute Book in the terms of the Manifesto:Child Benefit, creating a new scheme of child credits; those are on the Statute Book; Finance (No. 1) introducing the Capital Transfer Tax; Finance (No. 2) tackling the lump; the Housing Rents and Subsidies Act, replacing the Tory Rent Act with a new financial system for public sector housing; the Offshore Petroleum Development (Scotland) Act nationalising land for oil construction sites; the Oil Taxation Act, fulfilling the Manifesto proposals for taxation of oil companies\u2019 profits on the North Sea; Pen­sioners\u2019 Payments; the Referendum Act fulfil­ling our pledge to give the British people the final say on membership of the EEC; the Social Sec­urity Benefits Act maintaining the real value of pensions and creating the new non-contributory invalidity benefit, invalid care allowances to help those families with disabled members, and increased family allowances; the Social Security Pensions Act totally reforming the whole system of state superannuation, and introducing the mobility allowance for the disabled. All those are on the Statute Book. I thought I would men­tion them just in case you might have forgotten any of them. (Applause)Now the Bills introduced, but not through all their Parliamentary stages:The Community Land Bill, providing for the public ownership of development land; the Employment Protection Bill providing new rights for workers at work; the Industry Bill turning into legislative form the White Paper on which we fought the election, creating the National Enter­prise Board and the system of Planning Agreements; the Petroleum and Submarine Pipelines Bill creating the British National Oil Corpora­tion and providing new powers of control over the pace of depletion and for the provision of pipelines; the Scottish Development Agency and Welsh Development Agency legislation establishing these two important new institu­tions in Scotland and Wales; the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Amendment) Bill remov­ing unacceptable Lords amendments forced into the previous year\u2019s Act in the conditions of our then minority Government; the socially re­distributive budgets of November and April; the Sex Discrimination Bill asserting new rights for women and creating the Equal Opportunities Commission. All these measures are before Parliament now.I clearly cannot anticipate the Queen\u2019s Speech opening the second session of this Parlia­ment, but a commitment has been given to the re-introduction of the Bill already published to take the aircraft and shipbuilding industries into public ownership; work is advanced - in some cases involving the drafting of the necessary legislation - on:Devolution; ending the 11-plus; abolishing agricultural tied cottages; the Development Land Tax; the transfer of New Town housing assets to local authorities; liberalising official secrets legislation; introducing an independent element into the procedure of complaints against the police; and a Race Relations Bill, to strengthen the existing legislation protecting minorities.Work is also going on on legislation to phase out pay beds; to bring the ports into public ownership; to create the Co-operative Development Agency; on weights and measures legislation to provide for unit pricing.Our outline proposals for a wealth tax have been published, and are being studied by a Par­liamentary Select Committee in advance of the introduction of legislation.The Government has announced its policy in respect of our pledge on industrial democracy and is setting up an enquiry to prepare the way for legislation.That is a breathtaking list. It is a record of which the whole Party should be proud. But it is too easily forgotten, as many of our Party mem­bers may already have forgotten it.It is a record made possible only by Ministers working full-time, MPs working full-time, and above all the Whips working full-time, all of them long into the night.But it is made possible by something else too. The Manifesto we are fulfilling provided the best programme on which this Party has ever fought a General Election.And that programme itself was made possible only by the fact that its preparation, in those Opposition years, was one which involved the whole Party, constituencies, affiliated organisations, the NEC and its sub-committees, and the 1973 Conference which spent the whole week on \u2018Labour\u2019s Programme,\u2019 in readiness for the preparation of the Manifesto which was agreed three months after that Conference, in accor­dance with Clause 5 of our Constitution, by the Executive and the then Shadow Cabinet.This legislative achievement, representing over half of our five-year programme commitments in the first twelve Parliamentary months since March 1974 (and it should be three\u2011quarters implemented by next year\u2019s Conference) is enormous by any standards, historical or international.Everyone in this Conference can be more than a little proud, as I have the right to be proud, as we recognise how much your Ministers have achieved in such a short period of time and in the most difficult economic climate for over 40 years.It is not just a question of quantity, of scores of bills and hundreds of clauses sweated through in days of committees and long nights in Parlia­ment itself.This record of pledges fulfilled is rooted in the philosophy and beliefs of the Labour Move­ment. It was constructed in consultation with MPs, trade unions and representatives of the Party in the country. And it reflects those themes and priorities which the Party estab­lished in opposition and which we believe are the ones which should now most concern a Labour Government. Let us take, for example, our industrial relations policy under Michael Foot which has replaced conflict with co-operation and, as we promised in the election campaigns, has healed the unnecessary wounds inflicted by the Tories on industry and, in so doing, has reunited the nation. From the repeal of the Industrial Relations Act, to our new Employ­ment Protection Bill. The Health and Safety at Work Commission. The ACAS which has been playing such a positive role in ending disputes.Just pause for a moment to contrast this wise and constructive attack on the problems of industrial relations with what we saw in the early 1970s. Cast your minds back: the then Conservative Cabinet - yes, all of it, not just those who are now on the Tory backbenches - approach­ing the sensitive and intricate system of human relations in industry with all the sense of purpose and sublime delicacy of a mob of football hooligans approaching a mainline railway sta­tion.It seems almost impossible to believe now, that so recently, the T& G were mulcted for £50,000 by an Order of the Court; to recall those bailiffs skulking round the back door of an Urban District Council in Durham to seize an AUEW investment.Or the expensive farce of a railway ballot when a Minister of the Crown was required by his legalistic-minded colleagues to spend public money printing and distributing ballot forms to 170,000 railwaymen for the purpose of asking them to give an answer to a totally convoluted question which in plain terms simply sought to inquire whether, after due consideration, they agreed with their General Secretary. They did, in the event, agree by 6 to 1.Or to recall without disbelief that a Cabinet, to the chagrin of the then Secretary of State for Employment, actually sat in Downing Street, duly pooling their collective Cabinet ignorance of the coalmining industry and the coalmining community to reach a decision - already decided by the Courts of the land 70 years earlier - on the question whether time spent by mineworkers bathing off the coal dust was or was not properly to be regarded as taking place in their employers\u2019 time. But all this did happen, and less than two years ago. It all seems like a different age. Neolithic.Our budgetary and social policies, have been governed by the pursuit of greater economic and social equality which has always been an ideal and objective of this Party. Redistribution of income. Restoration to the people of the wealth from land development; control of, and a fair share of the profits of, the oil beneath the North Sea.In the tax field, ending the loopholes in the taxes on wealth by the introduction of the Capi­tal Transfer Tax. Our proposals for wealth tax and our strong action against the lump.Major resources have been devoted to the expansion of the social services. These reflect our concern for the pensioner. Concern for the disabled and the under-privileged. The one-parent family. The long-term sick. The widow.Perhaps most dramatic, the Sex Discrimina­tion Bill which will come into force before the end of the year. Its radical proposals are in advance of anything in the world and will ensure equality of opportunity in all aspects of em­ployment, education, housing, services and facilities. This means that that half of our popu­lation will no longer be treated as second class citizens.Nor will they be paid as second class citizens. By the end of this year the Equal Pay legislation carried into law by the Labour Government in the late Sixties becomes 100 per cent effective. (Applause)But above all we have placed concern about housing, about building homes and protecting tenants in every section of our society, top of our list of priorities.Housing finance based on reflecting and cov­ering rising costs, tempered by the recognition of housing as a primary social service, and emphat­ically rejecting the Conservative 1971 doctrine that municipal housing should be a means of making a profit out of the tenants, for the municipal budget.These are the human, socialist values which underlie the legalistic titles of our Parliamentary legislation. Conference will see that we have kept faith with those values.Another thing: three weeks ago the Cabinet and National Executive met together to review what had been achieved, and to identify our priorities and to discuss the nation\u2019s most pres­sing problems - above all, inflation and unem­ployment.You did not read much about that meeting. It was entirely harmonious and constructive.But I felt it right on that occasion in giving my Parliamentary Report to the NEC to go beyond the Government\u2019s achievements in legislation and economic and social policies and to refer to Britain's role in world affairs.We all remember, and anyone studying the records of the NEC, and of Conference since the war, might estimate that the NEC has prob­ably spent 60 per cent of the time it devotes to policy discussions, and Conference 40 per cent, on overseas affairs.In some years these discussions were directed towards a very friendly and always constructive criticism of the Labour Government of the day. In other years, long years of opposition, we were trying to shape Party attitudes about what we thought the then ruling Conservative Govern­ment should be doing in foreign affairs.The fact that there have been less deep and fundamental arguments about overseas affairs in the last 18 months of Labour Government is not a reason for ignoring foreign affairs this week.On the contrary, what I can point to is a record of achievement and influence in significant areas of world affairs which I believe to have been unparalleled by any Government, Labour or Conservative, at any time since the war - and indeed long before that.Let us take, first, relations with the United States. I know that not everyone here is equally enthusiastic on this subject, though during the Referendum campaign I thought I detected a new-found insistence in certain quarters - unexpected quarters - that we must do nothing to endanger our transatlantic relations. I am sure this enthusiasm was not a passing phenomenon. (Laughter)What I was able to tell the Executive three weeks ago was that relations between Britain and the United States are now closer, are now more constructive, both in political and economic issues, than at any time in the political life of most of us. And that judgment is not mine - it comes from American leaders.Over the years we have had many debates about relations with the Soviet Union and other East European countries. The situation in 1975 has been described as \u2018historic.\u2019 Not my phrase - it is that of one of the top Soviet leaders during my visit last February.The Commonwealth. Anyone who was pre­sent at the meeting of 35 Commonwealth Heads of Government in Jamaica last May would have concluded - as my Commonwealth colleagues did - that Britain\u2019s relations with the Com­monwealth, again both political and economic, had never been better in our history.This is partly because Rhodesia no longer divides the Commonwealth. Tragically it divides only the African parties within Rhodesia, to the immense satisfaction of the white regime.It is also because South Africa does not divide us. The Commonwealth was torn apart a few months after Labour lost office in 1970 by the Conservatives\u2019 insistence on supplying arms to South Africa.On taking office in 1974, as in 1964, I gave immediate instructions that arms to South Africa should be stopped forthwith. (Applause) The arrangements to end the Simonstown Agreement followed soon after. And your Gov­ernment it was that declared the South African presence in Namibia to be unlawful and called upon them to withdraw.Again with Europe. Following renegotiation, the Government gave the people the final right to decide, as we had promised in our Manifesto.The people decided.And the way we conducted the campaign - particularly the then much-criticised \u2018agree­ment to differ,\u2019 within the Cabinet, within the Executive - fulfilled my very confident predic­tion at the time, which many doubted, that the Party would come out of that campaign not weaker but stronger, not divided but more united.That is what happened. The issue was settled by the people themselves and it has now been virtually accepted.The argument is over.We are using our influence, Jim Callaghan at the Council of Ministers, both of us at the regu­lar Summits, not only to assert British economic interests and those of a wider Europe but on political matters too. Remember it was the Commonwealth Prime Ministers who recorded - on their own initiative, not mine - that \u2018British membership of the Community was of value in encouraging the Community to be more outward looking towards the rest of the world.\u2019Take one issue - Portugal. The Communi­ty\u2019s joint decisions, at Council of Ministers and Heads of Government level, our Declaration offering aid to Portugal on the basis of the resto­ration of pluralistic democracy, and only on that basis. Our decision to approach Eastern European powers at Helsinki to assert the right of freedom, democracy and socialism in Portugal.This was supplemented by the emergency meeting in Stockholm last month of Socialist Prime Ministers and other leaders, followed by the meeting I convened earlier this month in London of Socialist Prime Ministers.Conference should not underrate the part Bri­tain\u2019s Labour Government has played in what we hope will be a lasting, peaceful, democratic, socialist settlement. Nor should it underrate the contribution of this week\u2019s Conference to his­tory, in what was said here and what was done here, yesterday, on Spain.Relations with America; with the Soviet Union; relations with the Commonwealth; rela­tions with Europe, particularly directed towards democracy in Europe.That was my report to the National Executive three weeks ago.Following that report I felt justified in asking my colleagues, some with 30 years in Parlia­ment, some with a record of political activity going back well before the War, if they could recall a time, and if they could to name the year, when relations with the United States were bet­ter.If they could recall a time, and name the year, when relations with the Soviet Union were bet­ter.If they could recall a time when relations with the Commonwealth were better.If they could recall a time when relations with Europe were better.Still more, could anyone name some halcyon period when relations with America, with the Soviet Union, with the Commonwealth and with Europe were better than now - and all at the same time? Not one such era was recalled by my very experienced colleagues on behalf of Her Majes­ty\u2019s Government; not one year was nominated.In twenty-two years on the Executive this was the first time that we could record a measurable period of absolute silence on the Executive. (Laughter and applause)Today, to this Conference, I put the same thought - is there anyone here, however long their apprenticeship and work in the Labour Movement, who can answer those questions, who can name a comparable period? You do not need to answer now. Take your time, I will give you notice of the question and you can let me know. There are many reasons why I can make this claim, but you cannot exclude as a major one the conduct of our foreign and commonwealth affairs by Jim Callaghan and his team, nor the remarkable and widely-acclaimed record of our two successive Ministers for Overseas Development at a time of great financial string­ency.But not only in the political aspects of world affairs, but in advancing those ideals in world economic relationships which have inspired Socialists, and so often illumined the work of Conference.The proposals, for example, which I tabled at the Jamaica Commonwealth Conference represented the biggest international economic initiative ever put forward by a Prime Minister of this country.It incorporated ideas frequently debated here, ideas which were incorporated by some of us in War on Want 23 years ago, which led to the creation of the \u2018War on Want\u2019 Organisation. But they were recognised by Commonwealth leaders last May as relevant to the acute prob­lems facing the Third World today. The old division between advanced industrialised, importing countries and developing countries, which are primary producers, food and raw mat­erial exporting countries, a division which has been revolutionised by the economic cataclysms of the past two years.The increased cost of oil - now increased again - the increased cost of many raw materi­als and food have certainly hit advanced coun­tries such as Britain and other European and North American countries. But how much more has it hit developing countries? Developing countries fall into two general groups: the new rich, or potentially rich, who have gained from the higher oil and com­modity prices, and the rest - right down to some already on the very margin of starvation who have suddenly found themselves forced to pay vastly increased amounts for their oil, their oil-based fertilisers, their feeding stuffs, their raw materials and their agricultural implements. The old poor and the starving within the world are now the new very poor.Our proposals, therefore, calling for stabilisa­tion not only of commodity prices, but of stabilising developing countries\u2019 earnings from their exports, were deliberately directed to this problem.More than that, they recognised the deep and undeniable desire by Third World countries to get a fair division of the world\u2019s resources and prosperity.In my initiative I made it clear, and I quote: \u2018the British Government fully accept that the relationship, the balance, between the rich and poor countries of the world is wrong and must be remedied. That is the principle on which my proposals rest: that the wealth of the world must be redistributed in favour of the poverty stricken and the starving. This means a new deal in world economics, in trade between nations and the terms of that trade.\u2019I called for the recognition of the \u2018inter­dependence\u2019 of producers and consumers. I said that, especially in the General Agreement we proposed, there was a need to \u2018lay heavy emphasis on the special needs of the poorest countries.\u2019Now that initiative was given a warm wind by my fellow Commonwealth Heads of Govern­ment in Jamaica. It was warmly welcomed - welcomed indeed as being directly designed to achieve some of the principal aims of those many Third World countries there calling for a New Economic Order.The report of the Commonwealth Experts\u2019 Group on those proposals and others played an important part in the special session of the UN General Assembly earlier this month.Our proposals were welcomed by the US Government immediately after Jamaica. They were reflected in the decisions of the Council of Foreign Ministers of the European Community on 22 July. Now they go forward for further action by the UNCTAD Conference in Nairobi next spring.I remember previous Party Conferences 20 and more years ago, when some of us put for­ward some of these ideas, when there was great enthusiasm for them in this Party, qualified by a feeling that this was never going to happen under what proved to be 13 years of Tory Government; and that when we looked at the reac­tionary attitudes of the Parliaments and Governments in power in so many advanced coun­tries, there was a bit of cynicism, a feeling all this would remain a pious Socialist vision, a blue­print, never likely to become a reality.But now those ideas are the policy of this Government, widely acclaimed in advanced and developing countries alike and occupying the centre of the stage for the world economic discussions of the next few months.The issues this Conference faces, above all, are inflation and unemployment. I am not today going to apportion the blame for successive phases of inflation. Whether it be the Tory free-for-all under Barber or the oil price rise or the rapid growth in pay settlements or the decline in the exchange rate - or all of then.But inflation is our great enemy. The threat to our objectives and ideals. It is inflation which has stopped us re-expanding the economy and getting rid of unemployment. In this sense infla­tion is the father and mother of unemployment.We are in, and we all recognise this, for a harsh winter. The toughest part lies ahead. We have to face up to the consequences of the situa­tion in which we and the world find ourselves. The worst world recession since the thirties. Our inflation more than twice that of our com­petitors. Because of this and the five-fold oil price increase, we spent abroad last year 14 pence in the pound more than we earned abroad. Less this year - a great narrowing of the gap - but still a formidable total and a serious addition to our already heavy overseas debt.The country recognises, and the world recog­nises, the Labour Government\u2019s determination to conquer the problem of inflation.The Conservatives kept telling us that either we had to have a legally binding incomes policy or we had to abandon ourselves to the free mar­ket, to the rigours of monetary control and the dismantling of our social services, including housing.On this they agreed there was no middle way. The only thing they were incapable of seeing was the only sensible course in a modern democracy: the course of agreement and consent.While our opponents pursued their barren alternatives, with increasingly tedious repeti­tion, we were in the process of reaching an his­toric agreement with the TUC. The policy was based on consent, endorsed by the trade union movement, and overwhelmingly accepted by the country.The months immediately ahead, I have said, are going to be hard. But this tough period, so far from providing an excuse for relaxing our attack on inflation, is itself a reason for pressing it home. It would be fatal to relax now - fatal to this country, this Government, this Movement. This is the only means, this is the one way only, by which we can bring unemployment down as the world recession gives way to expansion; the only means to moving forward to full employment.And the way forward now is to build on our negotiations with the TUC and all sides of industry. This will inevitably be a constantly develop­ing relationship in which not just the TUC but trade unions and management will become more involved in the fight against inflation and the wider management of our economy.Reflation cannot start before we are certain that inflation is stopping.The Government last week announced our measures for dealing with the immediate threat of increased unemployment this winter and especially to deal with the problem the school leavers of 1975 are facing.The steps we have introduced are direct, immediate, relevant. They will not sustain any further growth of inflation. They will not involve any lasting increase to local government or to national government expenditure, other than specific help to industrial investment, restruc­turing and modernisation. They are directed to fulfilling social objectives, for example in urban renewal and other urgent programmes; they are directed to providing not only jobs but training, by apprenticeships and in other ways, for our young people. These are emergency measures for the period immediately ahead. The way we must drive towards full employment, once inflation is dealt with, will require different methods, and every one of us knows that one of the biggest long-term problems we have had to face for a generation past has been the total inadequacy of new capi­tal investment. The amount of our annual national dividend ploughed back into capital investment for the future. And not merely the amount, but the quality of that investment.But that is not all.We have been getting less out of the invest­ment we have made. Over the last 20 years, for every extra unit of output that we have obtained in this country from a given amount of investment, France and Italy have gained half as much again, Japan twice as much and West Germany well over two and a half times as much.And we cannot get the benefit of increased investment in industries or firms if strikes are to condemn the equipment to idleness, or if over-­manning cancels out the gains from the new investment. But more than that. If we spend our time arguing how to work less and spend more we shall end up having to work more and being able to spend less. Our policy for industry was set out a year ago in the White Paper \u2018The Regeneration of British Industry,\u2019 on which we fought the October Election and on which the legislation on the National Enterprise Board and Planning Agreements now before Parliament is based.What we promised in that White Paper we have carried through.I repeat, Britain\u2019s failure is that we have con­stantly not invested enough throughout the post-war period. But particularly not invested where we need it most: in the markets that are expanding, on which future jobs depend. We have to make the products for which there is a demand both at home and abroad. For this, it is not enough just to invest in our traditional indus­tries. We have to be ready to support new initiatives and to seize opportunities. And this is the importance of the NEB and the direct sup­port now given by the Government to industry.The urgent action which we had to take to deal with areas of industrial and social policy neg­lected by the Tories caused us to increase the real volume of public expenditure by nearly 8 per cent in the first year of this Government.It was a catching-up exercise to reverse three-and-a-half years of increasing inequality, and to provide the help that we promised, as a priority, to those in greatest need.But the very speed and determination with which we acted means we are close to the limit now, and for some time ahead, for public expen­diture as compared with take-home incomes.The Chancellor has made it clear that he rejects panic cuts in public expenditure this winter. Indeed, as I have said, we have increased the funds for training and short-term work to meet social and industrial priorities. But in the regular reviews which we undertake each year of the programme, into the period when full employment and high industrial activ­ity may cause production problems, in the reviews we have to make, up to five years ahead, long after the immediate recession will have ended, we shall make sure that our expenditure is strictly related to our priorities. Once those decisions on priorities are taken - and they will not be easy decisions - our methods of control will ensure that spending is strictly controlled within the objectives we have chosen. Faced with these vast economic problems, I propose to reflect the political realities of this country by sparing only a very few moments to refer to her Majesty\u2019s Official Opposition. Not personalities, of course. Every time I look at the anonymous characters who from time to time rise from the Opposition Front Bench, I can discern there no more than the occasional retreads (Laughter), relieving the otherwise drab landscape of the failed young Conser­vatives of a succession of non-vintage years. (Laughter) I bet not one delegate in fifty at this Confer­ence, not one in a hundred at next week\u2019s Tory Conference, not one in ten of our skilled and omniscient press correspondents, could name the top 12 Conservative spokesmen on major subjects, without access to the reference books. (Laughter)So I will not deal with personalities, but policies, and clearly that will not take long either. (Laughter)On none of the major questions of our time have they put forward an alternative economic, social or, for that matter, foreign policy. We have not heard from the Shadow Foreign Secretary. The deep divisions on almost every issue which we now know to have dominated the life of their 3½ years in Government, have persisted, deepened and become articulate.The country knows the depth of their scarcely disguised divisions. Half of the last Tory Cabinet could not run fast enough to dissociate from the policies they agreed with when they were in government - policies on which, let us remind them, they so strongly fought the two general elections in 1974.But on the major issues of 1975, the Labour Government\u2019s attack on inflation, both on the White Paper and the legislation, on these we have had this summer a humiliating spectacle across the floor of the House. The Opposition timidly moving an ineffective and totally unspecific form of words by way of amendment. Then, when the moment of decision came - twice, in successive weeks, first the vote on whether to accept or reject the White Paper, and, a week later, whether to accept or reject the legislation - Her Majesty\u2019s Opposition collec­tively sat on their collective hands. Nothing to say. Nowhere to go. No alternative. No gui­dance to their own people, still less to the country.In fact, all we get, week in week out, is their reiteration of their demands for swingeing cuts in public expenditure, by which they mean, of course, social expenditure.But what they still have not learned is you cannot demand massive expenditure cuts with­out committing yourself to devastating decisions on policy, including some of the main spending programmes of the last Conservative Govern­ment. As the Conservative Party now hurdles backwards - and it is a very difficult athletic feat (laughter) - as it now hurdles backwards over two centuries to Adam Smith, let me remind them of the words of the now discarded Disraeli, in the House of Commons:Mere abstract and declaratory opinions in favour of reduction and retrenchment are of no use whatsoever. I have so often maintained it in this House that I am almost ashamed to repeat it, but unfortunately it is not a principle which has yet sufficiently entered into public opinion - expenditure depends on policy.That was Disraeli, 1862. But more. The Con­servative Party are, in fact, committed to vast increases in public expenditure.They voted against the cuts of £600 million in defence which the Government announced. This means they must obviously want to add £600 million to the Government\u2019s expenditure. They opposed us when we cancelled Maplin. They opposed us when we stopped work on the Channel Tunnel. This was the Party which last October sought a meretricious electoral bonus by their promise of 9½ per cent  mortgages -  and, what is more, by Christmas, at a cost of £180 million. The Building Societies\u2019 own estimate was £300 million.Let our people not forget that their means of paying for this electoral bribe was their carefully prepared plan - never, fortunately, put into effect - to confine local authority houses, and no doubt new town houses, to particular limited social groups, ghettoes for the old, the sick, the disabled and handicapped. That was their poli­cy. To pay for increased defence expenditure, for Maplin, the Channel Tunnel, 9½ per cent mortgages and the abolition of domestic rates, they would have to reduce the social services and all other Government expenditure by many thousands of millions of pounds even to get back to where they started from.Ask them to be specific, ask them what they would cut, and their only reply is: \u2018slash or abolish the housing subsidies and abolish the food subsidies.\u2019They are specifically committed to increasing the cost of the shopping basket by 76p per week to an average family, 46p to a pensioner. They are specifically committed to forcing up housing rents to undreamed-of figures. Their answer to inflation and rising prices is to put a surcharge on the shopping basket of every family and a further surcharge on the rents of millions of households. The basic needs of every family are shelter and food, and the Tories\u2019 sole prescription for tackling inflation is to put up the cost of both. At last they have told us why. I want you to mark this. The Party which a century ago Dis­raeli committed to the doctrine of \u2018One Nation\u2019 is now proclaiming across the world their resentment at what they regard as \u2018the rich becoming poorer and the poor becoming richer.\u2019They talk about class politics. Who is it now who is insisting on introducing class policies into England\u2019s green and pleasant land? For 18 months we have challenged them to produce an alternative economic policy - apart from put­ting up food prices and rents. In Parliament, in the country, we have had no answer. Now the message has been flashed to the people of Britain, even if it has had to be bounced off a transatlantic satellite. The politi­cal philosophy of a once great Party has now been asserted. Not a claim to unite the nation, but a policy to divide it.We have been told, on impeccable and unde­niable authority, that the pursuit of inequality for its own sake is now to become an end in itself. It is now to become the altar, the deity, before which they seek to prostrate themselves - and the country.The hard-faced doctrine - proclaimed last week - is that to get taxation down we have got to cut spending on the social wage - now £20 for every family in Britain.What is this social wage? It is the Health Ser­vice, the kids\u2019 education, the people\u2019s housing, the help for those in greatest need, including the unprecedented provision we have made for the disabled and those least able to help themselves.That is their social philosophy. Their economic policy, at least, is more specific. After two months\u2019 lucubrations their Shadow Chan­cellor has emerged into the light and suddenly announced their fiscal policy: a demand for immediate changes in the tax laws to enable us to keep three distinguished pop groups safely within the three-mile limit. (Laughter)Your Government, with I believe a great swell of public support going far beyond our own Party, has taken and is taking the action neces­sary not only to bring Britain through the world crisis, but also to create, in the words of last year\u2019s Manifesto, \u2018a fairer, more democratic and more socially just society.\u2019Recent years have seen a great change in the role of this Party. After spending the greater part of our 75 years of history in Opposition, from being the Party of protest we have now become the natural Party of Government in this country. (Applause) Given that this present Parliament runs its full term, then, of the 15 years from October 1964 to October 1979, we shall have been in office for nearly 11½ of them.And let us have the humility to recognise that this is so not because of the merits of any of us, but because of those in the Party nationally and locally, to the trade union movement and the co-operative movement, who, over 75 years, in a vastly more daunting and difficult political environment, fought on with that unconquerable optimism that \u2018these things shall be.\u2019It is now our task to see that these things shall be. And, as the Party of Government, we have to ensure that simply because we are the Party of Government we are still able to fulfil the role of protest. All of us. Ministers, Members of Par­liament, constituency parties, affiliated organisations, Executive, Conference, the wider Party.All those who have reason to protest should recognise our Party as the natural voice to express that protest; for there is none other.That is why I want to stress today the respon­sibilities falling on this Party, and every member of it, in the new historic role we now occupy and will continue to occupy for the foreseeable future. I have spoken of the role of the whole Party in creating and preparing the policy which this Government is carrying out.What I call for now is nothing less than the regeneration of the Party in this role, the regeneration of the Party on the basis of mutual toler­ance and respect.We have an unprecedented national consen­sus, the trade union movement, Party and Government.At national level we have given the lead. We need the stimulus of support and constructive criticism from the Movement throughout the country.What is appalling is that so many of our Con­stituency parties, particularly in safe seats, are so small in number and in some cases so unre­presentative.This was a fact which was emphasised in the Wilson Report on Party Organisation debated at Conference 20 years ago this week, together with the specific proposals we put forward for creating mass membership. This has not hap­pened. We drew attention then to parties, particularly in safe Labour seats, deliberately kept small for the purpose of concentrating power and local authority seats in small cliques. This has not ended.But there is also the fact of some Labour seats, not always strong Labour seats, where there is great public support for the Party, but where membership is kept abysmally low mainly because those who would wish to join in the Party work come once, come twice and, feeling unwelcome, come no more.This Party needs to protect itself against the activities of small groups of inflexible political persuasion, extreme so-called left and (Applause) in a few cases extreme so-called moderates, (Applause) having in common only their arrogant dogmatism. These groups, equally the multichromatic coalitionist fringe or groups specifically formed to fight other maraud­ing groups, these are not what this Party is about. (Applause) Infestation of this kind thrives only, and can thrive only, in minuscule local parties.We have all talked at one time or another about City sharks who lie in wait until they can make a take-over bid for some small company which has some rich asset or large liquid funds. But in our democracy, in our Party or any other, there is no richer asset than a seat with a five-figure majority. As Socialists we should do all in our power to control and sublimate pre­datory instincts in all situations.However, this happens, whether through lazi­ness and apathy or by infiltration, often mig­ratory infiltration - what in Yorkshire we used to call \u2018comers-in\u2019 (Laughter) - the result can too easily be groups of little exclusivities insist­ing on a monopoly of doctrine, thriving on noisy debate reflecting some esoteric theory which has nothing in common with a century of the politi­cal idealism and purpose of this Movement. Because what has proved possible is a take-over bid for a 20,000 majority seat based on an incur­sion of little more than a dozen.Nor does the answer lie in the formation of the kind of anti-party group which has been disporting itself in Blackpool this weekend (Applause) leaking, as is their wont, their smears to an ever-ready Tory press. We have seen them at it before, a coup executed a few weeks before the last February election, a coup designed not to help the Labour Party, a coup designed to make it impossible for some of us to carry on.The success of this Government depends on two things. First, the participation of the whole Movement in our programme and our Manifes­tos as in these recent years. Second, a determined Government, a determined Parliamen­tary Labour Party, such as we have today with well over 300 Labour members, there with the backing of 11.5 million Labour voters.Can anyone in a broad democratic movement such as ours assert the claim that a man or a woman elected by 25,000 Labour voters one week, should be given his cards the following week by a small group of 50, who in themselves represent only 1 in 500 of the Labour voters who elected him and who, only last year recommend­ed such a man to the electorate? (Applause) We need bigger membership, a membership fully representative of our people. Even a Party with a thousand members might embody only 1 in 25 or 1 in 30 of those who voted Labour.At local level - I make this appeal - while the record of some unions is good - we need much more popular trade union identification not only by the fact of affiliation but by active work and influence. (Applause)I am expressing here, of course, a personal view, as Leader of the Party. But it is based on a little experience, of having, for my sins, chaired the Organisation Committee of the National Executive for longer than anyone else since the War.But there is another consideration. I have led this Party, so far, for 12½ years in unpre­cedented and difficult times for all of us.During those 12½ years \u2013 and this is without precedent - I challenge anyone to dispute this - not one of the near 600 Labour Members of Parliament who have served in Parliament over these years has had the Party Whip withdrawn. I am proud of that. I am proud, too, that almost my first act on being elected Leader was to insist, against a more than resistant Shadow Cabinet, that the Whip be restored to six Mem­bers of Parliament, one of whom is now in the Cabinet. He replied to the economic debate yes­terday, with the full acclamation of Conference. (Applause)I therefore have the right to ask who are these self-appointed Samurai who seek to assert a power of political life and death which the lead­ership of this Party and the Whips\u2019 Office and the Organisation Sub-Committee of the Labour Party have not in modern times sought to assert. (Interruption) I did, not ask anyone to identify themselves; it was a rhetorical question. (Laughter and Applause)As a Party we are committed to real industrial democracy. What we say should take place in industry, we cannot deny to our own Party members.We demand more participation; if we mean what we say then democracy means the full participation of every Labour member in the biggest decision a constituency Party is asked to make - the decision who shall, or who shall not, rep­resent them in Parliament.Still more, when a candidate has received the stamp of electoral support, extremely grave cause is required, and the fullest participation of party democracy is needed, if the electorate is to be denied the right to re-elect him as an endorsed Labour candidate.Our strength lies not in enforced uniformity of Party doctrine. It is based on tolerance, and argument, on the ferment of political ideas and political passion - not regimentation. I do not want to lead a Party of zombies.For those who arrogantly seek to impose their doctrine, other than by the democratic machinery of the Party or the Party institutions, including the Parliamentary Labour Party, would, if they succeeded, strike a great blow not only against our Movement, but against democ­racy in this country. What we are seeing is not the means of creat­ing democracy and socialism. The strength, the support, the stimulus, the democratic criteria, the Executive, the Conference, the Government need in a democratic Party can only come from Constituency organisations much more rep­resentative of those who vote and those who work for Labour victory.I call then for the regeneration of our Party, as a requisite to the regeneration of our country. Active, lively discussion in all our constituent organisations, national and local, political and industrial, acting not only as a stimulus and spur to Government, and Government\u2019s keenest cri­tic, but as a source of fresh ideas for the Man­ifesto we shall all before long be involved in - when this Parliament has spent its course.Let none forget that \u2018Labour's Programme, 1973,\u2019 which provided so rich a quarry of mater­ial for our Manifestos was projected not for one Parliament only but for the years ahead in this decade and the next. The Manifesto on which we fought last year\u2019s elections, put before the country a programme for one Parliament, for five years. I understand, indeed I welcome, the impatience of so many in the Party who are disappointed that we have not in fifteen months carried through to the last dot and comma, everything we promised the British people as our programme for a whole Parliament - not to mention those who are just disappointed that we have not carried the whole 15-year programme through in 15 months.But it is not too early now, in the light of our experiences, to be testing and developing that 15-year programme for the years ahead.Conference knows that on the four occasions when I have received the commission to form a government, those appointed have joined together at a service of dedication in the Crypt Chapel in the Palace of Westminster.Taking the service some years ago - nine years ago - Lord Soper, one of our Socialist peers, expressed the spirit of dedication in words which have now been embodied in suc­cessive services and which will be invoked again as each successive Government is formed. I do not think any words are more appropriate to express the ideals of this Movement as we celeb­rate the 75 years of Socialist endeavour and achievement. This is what he asked:Grant us a vision of our land, fair as it might be;A land of righteousness where none shall wrong his neighbour;A land of plenty where evil and poverty shall be done away;A land of brotherhood where all success shall be founded on service, and honour shall be given to excellence alone;A land of peace, where order shall not rest on force, but on the love of all for the common life and weal;Bless our efforts to make the vision a living reality;Inspire and strengthen each one of us that we may give time, thought and sacrifice to speed the day of its coming.At this grave testing time for our nation, I shall be content that we be all judged not only by those whose trusteeship we keep - the British nation - but by history, and judged by what we together, each of us, contribute to turning that ideal into a reality. (A standing ovation)

aVI want to speak to you today about the rebirth of a nation. Our nation. The British nation.It is customary at Conferences to talk mainly about winning elections, to concentrate on the Party interest. There is nothing dishonourable about that. I am not against winning elections. On the contrary, I think that one of the problems facing this country is that our Party has not won enough of them lately. A situation we propose to remedy.But for the Conservative Party politics has always been about something more than gaining power. It has been about serving the nation. We are above all a patriotic party, a national party; and so it is not we who have been obsessed this week with how to take party advantage of the present crisis. What\u2019s good for General Motors may be good for the USA. But nothing that\u2019s bad for Britain can ever be good for Conservatives. What we have been concerned with is how we car tackle this crisis, how we can ensure the prosperity, the freedom - yes - and the honour of Britain. The very survival of our laws, our institutions, our national character - that is what is at stake today.Economically, Britain is on its knees. It is not unpatriotic to say this. It is no secret. It is known by people of all ages. By those old enough to remember the sacrifices of the war and who now ask what ever happened to the fruits of victory; by the young, born since the war, who have seen too much national failure; by those who leave this country in increasing numbers for other lands. For them, hope has withered and faith gone sour. And for we who remain it is close to midnight. As Ted Heath said with such force on Wednesday, Britain is at the end of the road. As we all know, he is a man who never sold the truth to serve the hour. I am indeed grateful for what he said. Let us all have his courage.The situation of our country grows daily, almost hourly, worse. As the bailiffs approach, can nothing be done? If the Labour Government is no longer able to act in the national interest, is there no alternative to the ruin of Britain? Yes, indeed there is - and that alternative is here at Brighton today.But if we in the Conservative Party are to shoulder the responsibility of government, to chart a fresh course for our country, then we must first understand what has happened to us - where things have gone wrong - and why I believe there are several reasons for what is known as \u2018the British sickness\u2019 - and they are not a criticism of the people of this country. They are a criticism of the Government of this country.First, we have become the big spenders of Europe - spenders of other countries\u2019 money. The Labour Governments of Harold Wilson and James Callaghan have spent and spent and spent again with unbridled extravagance. And they have exhausted the means to pay for it. They have nearly exhausted the patience and tolerance and respect of our friends. Under Labour the land of hope and glory has become the land of beg and borrow. Today, the Government are back once more at the money lenders for what may well be their last chance - and ours. For this time they are about to pledge the nation\u2019s credit to the hilt.Secondly, increasing interference and direction of industry have stopped it doing its job properly. The Government have chopped and changed policies; they have created confusion and uncertainty. They have added countless burdens. They have destroyed profits. They have raised the cost of borrowing to intolerable heights. And they have demoralised management and they have sapped the will to work. No wonder investment in industry has slowed to a crawl.The third reason - and it goes hand-in-glove with the second reason - is political rather than economic. It\u2019s the Labour Party\u2019s chronic schizophrenia about the future of free enterprise - although the world over, free enterprise has proved itself more efficient, and better able to produce a good standard of living than either Socialism or Communism; and although wherever free enterprise is strangled, freedom is strangled too. Even so, even against all that background, the Labour Party has remained confused and divided over whether free enterprise should be allowed to survive. Yet, in spite of everything, it has survived - so far. Not only that, but, taxed to the limit, it has been the prop and stay of the public sector. Today that survival is in danger. As everyone saw on their television screens last week, the Labour Party has now been taken over by extremists. After years of gnawing and burrowing away in the background, they have at last crept out of the woodwork - at of all places the Winter Gardens, Blackpool. It was a sight the country is unlikely ever to forget.The Labour Party is now committed to a programme which is frankly and unashamedly Marxist, a programme initiated by its National Executive and now firmly endorsed by its official Party Conference.In the House of Commons the Labour Left may still be outnumbered, but their votes are vital to the continuance of Labour in office, and that gives them a strength out of proportion to their numbers. And make no mistake, that strength, those numbers are growing. In the constituency Labour parties, in the Parliamentary Labour Party in Transport House, in the Cabinet Room itself, the Marxists call an increasing number of tunes - in addition to \u2018The Red Flag.\u2019 With the Labour Party more bitterly divided than ever, let no one imagine that this country will be protected by Mr. Callaghan\u2019s avuncular umbrella any more than it was protected by Sir Harold Wilson\u2019s raincoat. That umbrella was blown inside out at Blackpool.Let\u2019s not mince words. The dividing line between the Labour Party programme and Communism is becoming harder and harder to detect. Indeed, in many respects Labour\u2019s programme is more extreme than those of many Communist parties of Western Europe. So I hope that anyone who votes Labour in future will be aware both of the people and the ideas they are in fact supporting. It is not surprising that after the events of last week Mr. Callaghan should speak about a totalitarian threat. He should know all about that. He faces it in his own party. But it is arrogant and utterly wrong of him to suggest that the only alternative to his Government is dictatorship. He should have a higher opinion of the British people.Ours is one of the oldest democracies in the world. Our citizens have a passion for liberty. They have fought for it, and died for it. Provided they know what is happening, they will never surrender to the extremists, whether of the Left or Right. We are made of sterner stuff than the Labour Party. The trouble about the Socialist leader is that he talks tough but he never acts tough - until it\u2019s too late. He talked tough last week. He condemned the pawn-shop philosophy of his supporters. He even spoke of the need to earn wealth before it\u2019s distributed. He even mentioned profits - and at a Labour conference!Apart from reading our speeches, where have Mr. Callaghan and his colleagues been for the last few years? After the energy crisis 3 years ago, who was attacking us for cutting public spending and tightening the money supply? Callaghan and Co. Who fought the October 1974 Election saying that inflation was under control? Who said that there would be no great rise in unemployment? Who claimed that the Social Contract would take care of all our troubles? Callaghan and Co. Who doubled public spending? Who doubled unemployment? Who saw prices go up by more than 50 pence in every pound? Callaghan and Co. Who said \u2018Steady as she goes\u2019 - and then steered straight for the rocks? You\u2019ve guessed it. Callaghan and Co.Now half the Cabinet are beginning to tell half the truth. So what are the chances they\u2019ll change course? Nil, I\u2019m afraid. Because the very nature of the Labour Party prevents a Labour Government from doing what some of its members at long last realise must be done. For example, we are told that to cut public spending further is impossible because the Labour Party wouldn\u2019t stand for it. What an appalling admission! If the country\u2019s economy is bleeding to death, the Labour Party must stand for it. We must all stand for it.This brings us, not for the first time, to the question: \u2018Which comes first with the Labour leaders - party or country?\u2019 Don\u2019t tell me. It\u2019s too depressing. With their approach it\u2019s hardly surprising that Labour\u2019s record over the last 2 years has been so disastrous. First, there was Harold Wilson\u2019s administration. There\u2019s no secret why he resigned. He took to the hills while the going was bad but before it got worse. Now we understand he\u2019s been found and brought back to the City. A plunging pound and Wilson found. There\u2019s no end to our troubles. And now we have Mr. Callaghan. Between the pair of them, Sir Harold and Mr. Callaghan and their wretched Governments have impoverished and all but bankrupted Britain. Socialism has failed our nation. Away with it, before it does the final damage.Yesterday we heard that the Bank Rate had been raised to an unprecedented 15 per cent. You will remember in your time, Mr. Chairman, 7 per cent was a crisis measure. Now 15 per cent. The Government are going on taking stopgap measures to try to restore confidence in the £. They still won\u2019t or can\u2019t change course and take the painful steps that are needed.What would be the attitude of the Conservative Party if the Government did at last lay the right measures before Parliament for its approval? That is an important question for us all. In our response to it, we must be careful not to fall into a trap; a trap in which the Government look to us to support them over difficult decisions, knowing full well they can then buy off their own Left wing by putting through further Socialist measures which the Left will demand.It is no part of Conservative philosophy to help build a Socialist Britain. I have already said that the Conservative Party puts the national interest before short-term party advantage. But the national interest now requires not only that the Government should cut back their expenditure to reduce their borrowing, but also that they should drop the divisive legislation which they are steamrollering through Parliament: Bills like the Dockwork Regulation Bill; like the nationalisation of aircraft and shipbuilding; like the controversial Education and Health Bills. These Bills have nothing to do with saving the British economy. Indeed, they can only make that task much more difficult.We must distinguish clearly between governments and the measures they introduce. A few good measures dictated by events cannot redeem the appalling record and intentions of this Labour administration. We do not oppose good measures, but we will fight ceaselessly against bad government. Because the Britain we are seeking is a Britain which could never be founded on Socialism.The task of the next Conservative Government will be formidable. The sooner we start the better. We have two great obstacles to overcome - doubt and bewilderment. First, bewilderment about what should be done, because we seem to have tried every trick in the book. We have had National Plans and Pay Pauses, Price Freezes, Productivity Awards, Industrial Strategies and Growth Targets.We have been promised that the next bright ploy will hit the bullseye: that blue skies are just around the corner; that we will soon turn the corner; that the light is about to appear at the end of the tunnel - I quote from Mr. Callaghan\u2019s speeches in the past - that we are emerging from the valley of gloom; that we are heading for an economic miracle. We have bad whole regiments of clichés marching into the sunset; but the problems just go on getting worse. So it\u2019s not surprising that people are bewildered. It\u2019s not surprising that they are uncertain. Uncertain whether the task of doing what needs to be done - whatever that may be - is possible for a government of any party. For the Labour Party. Or for the Conservative Party. They are cynical about politics and politicians. They fear that a free future cannot be saved. It can be saved.We can overcome our doubts, we can rediscover our confidence, we can regain the respect of the rest of the world. The policies which are needed are dictated by common sense. That is the right approach. We have set out the broad lines in our strategy statement and we have shown how they stem from a clear, coherent political philosophy.We have first to put our finances in order. We must live within our means The Government must do so. And we must do so as a country. We can\u2019t go on like this. We are paying ourselves more than the value of what we produce. We are spending more than we earn. The gap has to be bridged. It can only be bridged at present by borrowing from overseas. But it cannot be bridged that way forever. And at any moment, if we forfeit the confidence of those who lend to us, that bridge can collapse. It is crumbling now. The only way to safety is to stop borrowing, and stop borrowing soon; and, moreover, to show that we can and will repay our debts in a strong currency and on time. That is usually the task of a Conservative government. To do that, the country must consume less than it produces. That means a drastic change in policies and in attitudes. But we shall have to proclaim openly that this is our purpose.Once we have taken the immediate emergency measures which are needed, we must chart the course for years ahead. There, the country faces a choice. Who is to spend less? At one extreme the Treasury can try to make us, the people, economise by putting up taxes. At the other it can concentrate all its economies on the Government\u2019s own spending. There is not much doubt about the right decision. The Government is spending about £200 a year more than it is raising in taxes, for each man, woman and child in the country. Surely no one, (that is no one outside the National Executive Committee of the Labour Party), can believe in the long term that taxes should go up still more.So the only common-sense answer is to reduce government spending. That is our answer. Economies started as a matter of urgency must he sustained deliberately, carefully and humanely over the period of a full Parliament. They won\u2019t be easy. They will not be popular, and we shall have to defer some of our hopes.We have indicated in The Right Approach those areas where cuts must be made. By getting rid of Socialist programmes. By removing indiscriminate subsidies. By rooting out waste and extravagance. By applying cash limits. By economies in most major spending programmes other than defence, the police and those on which the needy must depend. That is a very similar strategy to that which the Australian Liberal Party, our counterparts, fought their election upon. They are now doing it. That shows it can be carried out in practice; and the people are supporting them because they knew the measures must be taken.In opposition we cannot write our own public expenditure White Paper; it would be foolish to do so. But we may not be in opposition that much longer. So let me pledge that once we are the Government, what we have said we will do about public expenditure, we will do; and we will keep our word just as those other Conservative Governments that I have seen in action recently in Australia and New Zealand have kept theirs.If the present Government have no stomach for the fight, let them depart.Let us realise that their almost total commitment to extravagant government expenditure is not borne solely of compassion. Not a bit of it! It reflects a stubborn desire to regulate the day-to-day lives of rich and poor alike. The more a family has of its own money to spend, the more independent it is of the State. The more that is taken away from that family by taxation, the more that family are under the heel of the State; and that is where Socialism wants them.The Socialists\u2019 battle cry is always the same; we hear it in Parliament, \u2018The Conservatives,\u2019 they say \u2018want unemployment. Conservative cuts,\u2019 they claim, \u2018would double or treble those out of work.\u2019 Now this is nonsense. And we must recognise it as nonsense. No party deliberately seeks the misery and waste of unemployment. But what is the history of the last two-and-a-half years? It is a Labour government that has doubled the numbers out of work and set a shameful post-war record. And however well intentioned, it is Labour\u2019s policies that have brought this about.Yet curiously enough they have neither the wit to acknowledge it nor the courage to change those policies. They doubled public spending. That led to a doubling of unemployment, because they bled productive industry white of the resources it needed to provide jobs. Today their policies threaten the ultimate disaster. An economic earthquake that would ruin the livelihood of thousands of families.Of course we\u2019re not going to solve our problems just by cuts, just by restraint. Sometimes I think I have had enough of hearing of restraint. It was not restraint that brought us the achievements of Elizabethan England; it was not restraint that started the Industrial Revolution; it was not restraint that led Lord Nuffield to start building cars in a bicycle shop in Oxford. It wasn\u2019t restraint that inspired us to explore for oil in the North Sea and bring it ashore. It was incentive. Positive, vital, driving, individual incentive. The incentive that was once the dynamo of this country but which today our youth are denied. Incentive that has been snuffed out by the Socialist State.We Conservatives have to recreate the conditions cited by that wise French philosopher de Tocqueville - conditions which \u2018give men the courage to seek prosperity, the freedom to follow it up, the sense and habits to find it, and the assurance of reaping the benefits.\u2019 That says it all; everything that is not being done now but which we must do. We must break out of restraint if we are to have a prosperous and successful future. We shall do this by providing a stable economic background so that expansion and growth will pay and be seen to pay. We shall do it by letting profits rise to a level which offers a real incentive to expand. We shall do it by ensuring that men and women who invest their savings in their own business, or in someone else\u2019s business, can once more earn a reasonable return. We shall do it by following the example of other Conservative governments and cutting taxes as soon as we can. We shall encourage the production of wealth by spreading a share in its growth among those who have helped to create it.That is the programme which will lead to expansion - picking up speed over the years. Expansion - leading to more jobs. Expansion - leading to higher wages. Expansion - leading eventually to more resources for the nation, so that we can have the same standards of social services as our more successful competitors enjoy. That is a realistic strategy, and it is one which offers hope to our nation.These, then, are some of the guidelines of our strategy - prudent financial management and soundly based expansion. But there are many who will say: \u2018We agree, broadly, with what you want to do. But we are frightened that the trade unions won\u2019t let you do it.\u2019 This does less than justice both to us and to the trade unions. One of the best debates that we have had here was on industrial relations. During that debate one speaker after another, Conservative trade unionists, Conservative negotiators and shop stewards, distinguished the role of trade unions from that of Parliament. What shone through was the difference between what we understand by a social contract and what the Socialists mean. If the phrase social contract means that the job of the trade union negotiator in a factory or office is to secure good pay for good work, to secure good terms and conditions of service, to secure extra rewards for extra skill and responsibility, then we support the Social Contract wholeheartedly.We want to restore the right of unions and management to make the best bargain they can in circumstances they both know. So do most union leaders, But we believe that ideally there should first be a generally agreed basis for wage bargaining. This is a system which has worked elsewhere for years - in countries which have inflation rates far lower than ours. So, the first meaning of the Social Contract presents us with no problem. But Labour\u2019s social contract is not like that. It apparently allows a handful of trade union leaders to dictate to the Government the level of public spending, the number of industries to be nationalised, what the tax system should be, the terms on which we can borrow from the IMF - and so on and so on. I am bound to say to them: \u2018With great respect, that is not your job. It is Parliament\u2019s.\u2019 Parliament is the only body which represents all the people. The most famous definition of democracy is government of the people, by the people, for the people. Not government of a section of the people, by a section of the people, for a section of the people.I agree with the speaker who said that if a trade union leader, or anyone else for that matter, wants to run the country, he or she should stand for Parliament. In the Conservative Party we would welcome some more of them as candidates, although I should warn them that Selection Committees are a law unto themselves, as many non-trade unionists have discovered. But those who believe in good jobs, in raising their standard of living by their own efforts, in working hard for themselves and their families - all of those people, whether they are trade union leaders or shop stewards or ordinary union members, whether they belong to a union or do not belong to any union at all - all of them should welcome the return of a Conservative government.Let me make it absolutely clear that the next Conservative government will look forward to discussion and consultation with the trade union movement about the policies that are needed to save our country. As for confrontation, the confrontation that matters to us is confrontation with rising prices, with rising unemployment, with rising debts and with the grave threat to Britain\u2019s future. So nobody should allow the Labour Party to frighten them into thinking that there can be no domestic peace if we do what has to be done to save our economy. Common-sense policies must and will prevail if we fight hard enough.And those who share our common-sense views are not a small, beleaguered minority. We are a party of ordinary people with ordinary hopes and beliefs, but with extraordinary qualities of tenacity and purpose. Not for nothing are we privileged to belong to probably the oldest and certainly the most successful democratic party over the world.But in recent years we have had more than our share of disappointments at the polls. We have all too often won the argument, but lost in the ballot box. We have won minds - but we must now win hearts. This I believe we can do. Because today the Conservative Party is the truly national Party. On matters that concern ordinary men and women, it is we who represent the majority view, and the Socialists the minority. People are increasingly concerned about the quality of their children\u2019s education, but we are the Party that puts standards as our first priority. People want to buy rather than rent their homes. It is we, not the Socialists, who want to offer the opportunity of home ownership to everyone. People want protection from crime and vandalism in particular and it is we who are the Party that will emphatically not economise on the Police Force.People are becoming increasingly frustrated by the crushing weight of personal taxation in Britain, where we now have the highest starting rate of income tax in the world. We are the Party that wants to reduce taxation while the Socialists never stop trying to raise it.And we are the Party that believes it should pay more to work than to stay idle. A growing number of people are anxious about the strength of our Armed Forces. We are the Party that regards the defence of the Realm as the overriding duty of any government. We want to see a defeat of terrorism, especially in Northern Ireland. But what a distortion, what a travesty of the truth it is for the Socialists to call themselves the party of working people. Today we are all working people. Today it is the Conservatives and not the Socialists who represent the true interests and hopes and aspirations of the working people. Above all else, let us get that message into every corner of the United Kingdom.We are nearing the end of one of the best Conferences we have had since the War. Speaker after speaker, from every walk of life, has come forward to join in debates that have not only been of high quality but have reflected the grave position in which our country finds itself.Today I have tried to speak the truth to you as I see it - and through you to the nation - and beyond the nation to those who wait and watch from abroad, asking anxiously \u2018Where are the British going? What will they do?\u2019I call the Conservative Party now to a crusade. Not only the Conservative Party. I appeal to all those men and women of goodwill who do not want a Marxist future for themselves or their children or their children\u2019s children. This is not just a fight about national solvency. It is a fight about the very foundations of the social order. It is a crusade not merely to put a temporary brake on Socialism, but to stop its onward march once and for all. To do that we must reach out not only to the minds but to the hearts and feelings and to the deepest instincts of our people.Let us be clear in our thinking. Let us be confident in our approach. But above all, let us be generous in our understanding. If, as has been said and I believe, the Conservative Party is the last bastion between Britain and disaster, then let that bastion be broad enough and large enough to accommodate all our people, Conservative and non-Conservative, trade unionists and non-trade unionists, those who have always been with us and those who have never been with us but who are prepared to support us now because they put country before Party. Let no one be excluded from our crusade and let no one exclude himself. We are one nation. We may not know it with our brains but we know it with our roots.I am deeply conscious of the challenge to our Party and of the responsibility I face as its Leader, but I believe we shall be sustained by millions who are hoping and praying today that we shall rise to the level of events. We must not fail them, and we will not fail them. As I look to our great history and then at our dismal present, I draw strength from the great and brave things this nation has achieved. I seem to see clearly, as a bright new day, the future that we can and must win back. As was said before another famous battle: \u2018It is true that we are in great danger; the greater therefore should our courage be.\u2019So let us be in good heart. We are not alone. Across the world, from Australia to Sweden, from New Zealand to West Germany, Socialism is on the way out. The tide is turning. Be in good heart and we will give this nation back a sense of pride and purpose. Be in good heart and we will give our people back their self respect. Let nothing narrow or vindictive or self-righteous be any part of our crusade. Rather let us say with humility: \u2018We offer you hope and a new beginning. Together we shall meet the crisis of this country - and tomorrow the day will be ours.\u2019 (Prolonged applause.)

aVI want to begin with a confession. I do not greatly care for being in opposition, but we have certain plans to deal with that situation. I believe the essence of politics is not what you say, it is what you do, so I look to the day when we put Conservative principles into practice - in Government.I look to the day when we throw off the Socialist yoke and turn together to the task of setting our country on the road to a real and lasting recovery. That day can be postponed but it cannot be put off for ever. One Thursday - it will be a day just like any other Thursday, and yet, I believe, it will be a day that will prove the turning point of our time - one Thursday the Labour Party will have to keep their appointment with the voters. It is a prospect I relish.\u2018Either back us or sack us,\u2019 says Mr. Callaghan. Just give the people the chance, Jim, just give \u2019em the chance. He will not, of course, until he must. He dare not, which is why, instead of having a government with steel in its backbone, we have got one with Steel in its pocket.Last week at Brighton we were accused of \u2018an insatiable lust for power.\u2019 It is not the Tories who have wheeled and dealed and manoeuvred and manipulated to avoid one thing at all costs - facing the voters; it is Labour\u2019s limpet Government. Hence the Lib-Lab pact.So much for Labour\u2019s political principle. So much for the Liberals\u2019 genuine conviction, and so much for the courage to stand by what you believe in, even if by standing by it you lose your seat. Better to lose your seat than your self-respect.Just what is it that the Liberals have kept in office? A Government that for two and a half years overspent, over-taxed, interfered, nationalised, debased our currency and all but bankrupted Britain; in short, that acted like a Labour Government.Mr. Healey blandly refers to the horrors of 1974-5, but who was Chancellor of the Exchequer then? You have guessed - they were Healey\u2019s horrors. After him the deluge? No, because of him the deluge. \u2018The financial position has been reversed 180 degrees,\u2019 says the Chancellor with a flourish. Quite so, because his policies have been reversed 180 degrees - by order of the IMF. Twelve months ago, the four-budget-a-year man all but took the country over the cliff with him, until at the eleventh hour he turned back from Heathrow in a panic and headed for home to take out the most massive mortgage in our history. The prescription the IMF forced his Government to swallow is the prescription we have long been advocating - a good sound sensible Conservative prescription. So my message to Moses is this: keep taking the tablets.If Labour wants an election slogan I suggest - it is just a thought but one likes to be helpful - \u2018You know IMF government works.\u2019Some of the commentators are saying that the Prime Minister is stealing our clothes. Well, it is true that he has lost his own but he is going to look pretty ridiculous walking around in mine!Of course, all of us are deeply thankful that the wealth of the North Sea has started to flow; but the North Sea is not a Socialist sea and its oil is not Socialist oil. It was found by private enterprise; it was drilled by private enterprise; and it is being brought ashore by private enterprise. So let us put the picture in perspective.As the oil comes on stream, our balance of payments is going to look healthier. That is good news for Britain. Sterling should be safe from another Socialist slide. That is good news for Britain. The standard of living of our people might rise again, if only a little after its catastrophic fall. That would be good news for Britain, too. As I have said before, good news for Britain is good news for the Conservative Party.But look closer. The truth is that we are still grinding along in bottom gear, with our factories producing less than they were when Labour came to power. Real profits and therefore investment are still abysmally low; the number of men and women without a job is the highest since the War. And that is bad news for Britain.Now take prices, if you can catch them! The Government boasts of its success in bringing down the rate of inflation. But even if it falls as far as Mr. Healey predicts - and today not even his own No. 2 believes him - prices in Britain will still be going up faster than in other countries. If Labour survives into next year, prices will have doubled while they have been in power. Doubled! That is not an economic miracle. It is an economic and personal disaster.At Brighton last week we saw Socialism wearing its pre-election face. Beware the leopard when it is quiet. It has not changed its spots, it just does not want its victim to know that it is there. Why was it so quiet last week at Brighton? Because it wants the people to believe that it is a gentle, well behaved, social democratic pussy-cat.We all know the drill. In the run-up to each election the claws of Labour\u2019s extremists are not drawn; they are just withdrawn. The front men are paraded to talk quietly, moderately, almost sensibly. The Left-wing just allows them their little outing until the voters are once more in the trap.Now suppose the election is over. Make a supreme effort and imagine that Labour has won, only for a moment. What then? The trap is sprung and Labour\u2019s extremists resume the drive towards a Britain modelled on Eastern Europe.\u2018It cannot happen here,\u2019 you say. But at Brighton the annual election to Labour\u2019s National Executive produced the same line-up as before; not a single Left-winger lost out. It is the same Executive which produced Labour\u2019s Programme for Britain 1976, and that programme remains official Labour Party policy 1977. Mr. Benn was frank enough to say so, perhaps hoping the public was not listening.Nationalise the banks and insurance companies. That is Labour policy. Do you like the idea of their hands on your savings? How do you fancy Mr. Healey or Mr. Benn as your friendly neighbourhood bank manager?They want to nationalise all the land, not just some of it. All of it! They demand a free hand to take over almost any firm big or small, the building industry, the food industry, fishing, forestry, ports and many more. That is their policy, too. They want the power to make every business obey them. They want to cut tax relief for home buyers. They want higher income tax to pay for their plans. They want an immediate wealth tax on top of Capital Gains Tax, on top of Capital Transfer Tax. What is the point of building up your savings or your business if they are going to take it all away from you? But it\u2019s all there in their little red book. It\u2019s all official Labour Party policy. And to make it easier to ram through this frightening Socialist programme, they have just voted to abolish the House of Lords. There, behind the cosy Brighton front, you have the reality of Labour. Although, Mr. President, I rather agree with you about the House of Lords, they will not find it easy to abolish it, because while half the Labour Party are trying to abolish it the other half are trying to get in!When the election comes, will this actually appear in their Manifesto? Some of it will, and if they were to win, sooner or later they will do it all. Because, whenever Labour win an election, the Tribune Group grow stronger and stronger and stronger. From one election to the next, Labour\u2019s programme gets meaner, more narrow, more Marxist. Britain, beware! The signpost reads: \u2018This way to the total Socialist State.\u2019 Destroying freedoms we have cherished and defended down the centuries doesn\u2019t worry the far Left. They like everything about Eastern Europe - except, alas, going to live there - because, after all, the living standards there are very low for them.So let no one say today there is no true difference between the parties, no real choice before the nation. That is not what the people think. Many men and women who had voted Labour all their lives turned to us in Ashfield, Stechford, Workington and Walsall. They know the Labour Party they used to vote for is not the Labour Party of today. The Party of Hugh Gaitskell has become a Party fit for Andy Bevan and Peter Hain. The disillusioned, the disenchanted, the courageous, the converted, we welcome them, one and all, to our cause. But the job of cleaning up Labour the job of ditching the extremists, is not in our hands. It\u2019s in the hands of the people on that special Thursday for which we watch and wait and work.If just 5 or 6 out of every 100 voters switch from Labour to Conservative at the election, they will slash the size of the Tribune Group by about a third, and on a swing of that size 25 Tribunites will lose their seats. And Britain will have a Conservative Government, a truly moderate Government, moderate not by order of our foreign creditors, but by genuine conviction, a Government in touch and in tune with the people, carrying out the sort of sensible, prudent policies that work so well in other countries.Of course, that is not the picture our opponents are going to paint. And here let me make a personal prophecy. In the coming months you are going to see a carefully orchestrated campaign by the Labour Party and Labour Government to portray me as \u2018extremely this\u2019 or \u2018extremely that\u2019 - not to mention \u2018extremely the other,\u2019 A whole battery of extremist labels are going to be bandied about. Indeed, they are being bandied about already; and the closer the election looms, the faster and more furious will the bandying become. So just let me tell you a little about my \u2018extremism.\u2019I am extremely careful never to be extreme. I am extremely aware of the dangerous duplicity of Socialism, and extremely determined to turn back the tide before it destroys everything we hold dear. I am extremely disinclined to be deceived by the mask of moderation that Labour adopts whenever an Election is in the offing, a mask now being worn, as we saw last week, by all who would \u2018keep the red flag flying here.\u2019 Not if I can help it! The Conservative Party, now and always, flies the flag of one nation - and that flag is the Union Jack. So much for my so-called \u2018extremism.\u2019There is another word our opponents like. The word is \u2018reactionary.\u2019 They say that a Thatcher Government - and I must say that I like the sound of that; I like it a little more each time I hear it and they use it quite a lot so they must believe it - they say that a Thatcher Government would be reactionary. If to react against the politics of the last few years, which undermined our way of life and devastated our economy - if that is reactionary - then we are reactionary, and so are the vast majority of the British people.They believe, as we do, that Government is far too big - indeed, the next generation were telling us so earlier in the week. They believe, as we do, that Government does not know all the answers, that it has downgraded the individual and upgraded the State.We do not believe that if you cut back what Government does, you diminish its authority. On the contrary, a government that did less, and therefore did it better, would strengthen its authority. Our approach was put very simply by a Chinese philosopher centuries ago: \u2018Govern a great nation,\u2019 he counselled, \u2018as you would cook a small fish. Don\u2019t overdo it.\u2019if you ask whether the next Conservative Government will cut controls and regulations and keep interference in people\u2019s lives to a minimum, my answer is \u2018Yes, that is exactly what we shall do.\u2019 The best reply to full-blooded Socialism is not milk and water Socialism, it is genuine Conservatism. For 13 years from 1951 we curbed the powers of the State. Ask those who remember which they preferred: the steady increase in prosperity of the 13 Tory years or the white-hot Socialist stagnation of Messrs Wilson and Callaghan?By their fruits ye shall know them. What are the fruits of Socialism? Where is the prosperity? Where are the new jobs, the stable prices, the low taxes? Where is the money created by a thriving economy, to spend on our schools and our hospitals, on the pensioners, on the sick and the disabled?Today we know Socialism by its broken promises; above all, by the broken promise of a fairer and more prosperous society. Socialism has not made society fairer, it has made it less fair. It has not made Britain richer, it has made it poorer. It has not distributed the rewards of achievement more widely, it has decimated them.Just let us ask, and keep on asking, the question Labour can never answer: \u2018If your policies are right, why do they never work? And why is it only when you start doing some of the things we have told you to do that you ever take a few steps forward?\u2019But a few steps are not enough. If I have one message above all else it is this: I am not prepared to settle for the second, third or fourth best for Britain. I do not believe that our decline was inevitable any more than I believe that an accident of nature off our coasts has made our recovery automatic. I believe that if we confront - yes, \u2018confront\u2019 is the word I use - if we confront reality, if we pin our trust on the skill, the resource, and the courage of our people, then this country can work out its salvation and regain its prosperity, regain the respect of others and its own self-respect.Some people regard this as dangerous talk. \u2018The Tories,\u2019 they say \u2018want change; they want to challenge the rules and ideas and policies that govern Socialist society.\u2019 \u2018Risky,\u2019 they murmur, \u2018Right, of course, but risky - might upset Arthur Scargill or Jack Jones - better not do it, better not do it.\u2019 And there you have the root and heart of the choice facing our nation. What worries Jack Jones is that the leaders of his Party are living too well. What worries us is that ordinary people are not living well enough.That is why the next election will be so crucial. All elections are crucial, but this time the choice could be decisive for a generation, because this time how the country votes will settle which party is entrusted with the immense benefits of North Sea oil. If it is the Socialists, then the profits of free enterprise will be used to purchase Socialism, and to take more powers for the State. If it is the Conservatives, they will be used to give power back to the people. The choice is the classic choice. Labour will do what it has been doing for the last three years, only more so. We shall do what we have said we will do set the people free.The key question I am asked over and over again is, \u2018But will a Conservative Government be free? How will you get on with the trade unions, and will the trade unions allow a Conservative Government to govern?\u2019 Yes, the word is \u2018allow.\u2019 People who ask that question are already half way into Labour\u2019s trap. They have swallowed the bait and they are ripe for the catch. Here is the position: The Government dare not fight on their record or on any manifesto that would be acceptable both to their Marxist Left and to the people of Britain. So, like an unimaginative parrot, they keep on repeating: \u2018The Tories won\u2019t be able to work with the unions.\u2019 When the time comes, Jack Jones will be expected to mutter it; Hugh Scanlon to go along with it; David Basnett may actually say it; and Clive Jenkins - he will almost certainly shout it. And it will not be true, unless the union leaders are determined to make it true.Now let us take and face a hypothetical situation. Suppose they are so determined, suppose they have already made up their minds, to make the task of an elected Conservative Government impossible. Then we would face a situation in which an unelected minority was intent on getting rid of a government that it could not control and replacing it with one that it could. Is this what the union leaders seriously intend, to use then industrial muscle for political ends? I do not believe it. But people are asking: if it were so, what would happen? Could a handful of men with great power hold the nation to ransom? The answer is: it is possible. Should such a situation arise, for example in a vital nationalised industry, it would be presented as a conflict between Government and trade union. This would be false. The real conflict would be between union and people, because it would be the people who would suffer. It always is. In that case the duty of the Government, any Government, would be to act through Parliament on behalf of the nation as a whole. In a vital issue such as this, in which the Government had to take decisive action on a single specific matter, it would he important for the Government to know that it had the support of the majority of the people.It is in that context, and that context only, that I have suggested a referendum to test public opinion. In those circumstances in those special circumstances I say: \u2018Let the people speak.\u2019 But I hope, and believe, the situation will never arise.I would like to make two final points about the unions. First, a strong and responsible trade union movement is essential to this country, and its rights must be respected. Second, the belief that those rights take precedence over all other rights, and even over the law itself, could be fatal to this country. Happily, the great majority of trade unionists know this as well as, if not better than, some of their leaders. They know that while their leaders represent them at work, we represent them in Parliament.We in the Conservative Party look forward to a long and fruitful association with the unions, because a Conservative Britain will be as much in the interests of union members as of the rest of the community. They know that taxes today are too high, that they torpedo talent, and that they must be cut; and that is what we Conservatives will do. We shall cut income tax, so that once again it is worthwhile to work harder and to learn a skill. We want to keep our best brains in Britain. We want to bring home some of those who have been driven abroad. We want to hold out to the enterprising businessman a reward which matches the risks of building up a firm. We want to renew the spark of incentive in our economy, because without that, new jobs cannot and will not be created. We want to leave everyone with more of his own money in his own pocket to spend as he pleases.Our aim is to make tax collecting a declining industry. There are more civil servants in the Inland Revenue than there are sailors in the British Navy. If governments do not cut what they spend, we have to cut what we spend. There is one hand-out that the people really want today. That is the Government\u2019s hand out of their pocket.This is the positive approach, and it is the key to getting industry going again. We do not believe that Government can run industry better than the people who work there. It cannot. Countries that are more successful than we are owe their economic achievements above all to free enterprise, and the benefits are not confined to a few of their citizens. They are spread among the many. The whole community benefits, because, \u2018when the tide comes in, all the boats rise.\u2019 Of course, no Government in a modern industrial society - and certainly no sensible Conservative Government - can wholly withdraw from the market place. But Government support for ailing industry will only produce an ailing economy unless it is selective, unless the circumstances are exceptional, and unless that support is directed to two overriding aims: moving the firm out of the red into the black and then back to independence as quickly as possible. A sure recipe for industrial blight is a Government that gives what amounts to a blanket guarantee that virtually any firm will be saved from the consequences of its own mistakes. No firm and no nation can behave indefinitely as though there is little difference between profit and loss, high production and low, success and failure.In this as in so much else, Winston put his finger on it. \u2018It is a Socialist idea,\u2019 he said, \u2018that making profits is a vice. The real vice is making losses.\u2019We would like to see the workers who help to create the profits sharing them. The Labour Party want union leaders on boards of directors. We want more employees voting as shareholders at company meetings. Under a Conservative Government we hope that more of them will own a stake in industry and that more of them will own their own homes.We Conservatives are a family Party. We believe that in a healthy society more and more people should be able to buy the roof over their own heads. That is why we will give council tenants the right in law to buy their homes. That legislation, I promise you, will be announced in the first Queen\u2019s Speech of the next Conservative Government.Let the Labour Party go on offering newlyweds a place on the waiting list for a house on a council estate which they can never call their own. We offer them a place that belongs to them, their own home in which to start life together and later to bring up their children.What happens when the children go to school? We have got to stop destroying good schools in the name of equality. The main victims of Labour\u2019s recent attack on the direct grant schools have been able children from less well-off families. People from my sort of background needed grammar schools to compete with children from privileged homes like Shirley Williams and Anthony Wedgwood Benn.Our aim in education is simple: it is to raise standards for all our children. That means fighting far more vigorously against that small minority which believes that the principal purpose of education is to instil contempt for democratic institutions. That is not education, it is political propaganda, and I see no reason why you and I and every other taxpayer should pay for it. These destroyers would also destroy respect for our laws and the order on which a civilised society is based.People have asked me whether I am going to make the fight against crime an issue at the next election. No, I am not going to make it an issue. It is the people of Britain who are going to make it an issue. The old people in our city centres who are frightened to go out at night are going to make it an issue. The taxpayers and ratepayers who have to meet the bills for mindless vandalism - they are going to make it an issue. The parents, worried sick when their children go out on their own - they are going to make it an issue.Yes, law and order will be an issue, and it will be a vital issue, at the election. If anyone thinks that is Right-wing, they should talk to the workers in the factories and the women at the supermarket.The next Conservative Government will give more resources to the police. They are under-manned and poorly paid. We will bring them up to strength. We will give them the money to do the job. I do not intend to sit on the sidelines wringing my hands while London, Glasgow, Manchester, Birmingham and the rest of our cities go the way of New York.But if the violence in Britain is deeply disturbing, it is nothing to what has been endured by the people of Northern Ireland for nearly ten years. What happens in Ulster touches us all; it is part of our country, our United Kingdom. So let the people of Ulster be assured of this: the Conservative Party stands rock firm for the union of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.Today I would like to express our deep and lasting admiration for Betty Williams and Mairead Corrigan, the Belfast Peace Women who have been awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Their courage symbolises to us and to the whole Western World the yearning of the people of Ulster for peace.We honour with them the Royal Ulster Constabulary, the Ulster Defence Regiment and our servicemen in Northern Ireland. I only wish that all the members of our armed forces who defend freedom there and in other parts of the world had a higher place in Socialist priorities. The Labour Party have cut present and future spending on defence by the staggering figure of £8 billion. What sort of Government is it that so neglects the welfare of our servicemen? What sort of Government forces front-line soldiers into claiming rent rebates and makes many of them worse off than people who do not even try to work at all?Our armed forces are poorly paid. They are denied the equipment, the stores, the back-up and the training that they know are vital to the job they do. Worse, they see the anti-Western wing of the Labour Party calling for still more gigantic cuts in defence, which a former Labour Defence Secretary said would mean, at best, neutrality and at worst, surrender. We have a Government that neglects our defences, a Government that lets down NATO so badly that our allies have rebuked it publicly. What a disgrace! A Government which spends money on nationalisation while cutting spending on the defence of the Realm. As I promised President Carter last month, the next Conservative Government will give defence the high priority that it demands. The Conservative Government will see that our troops are properly paid, increase defence spending so that we can meet our obligations to our allies and, by strengthening the defence of the West, restore the morale of our fighting services.Let us not forget - our first duty to freedom is to defend our own. It was to that end and purpose that I entered politics, and two years ago, in this hall from this platform, I spoke to you for the first time as Leader of our Party. I remember well my nervousness, and pride, as I tried to tell you something of my personal vision and my hopes for our country and our people. I felt deeply my responsibility then. Today I feel it even more deeply. For much has happened between those two Octobers. Two years ago I spoke of a man\u2019s right to work as he will, to spend what he earns, to own property, to have the State as servant and not as master. And today the threat to those democratic values has doubled and redoubled.I know only too well, as I go about the country, the fears felt for our British way of life. I know it from the letters I receive. And I know how many hopes ride with us today the hopes of millions who are Conservative, and millions who are not, but who look to us because they feel instinctively that what is happening to their country threatens not only their freedom but everything that made it materially and morally great.Paul Johnson expressed it movingly and with a writer\u2019s clarity, the other day, when he resigned from the Labour Party. \u2018I have come to appreciate, perhaps for the first time in my life,\u2019 he wrote, \u2018the overwhelming strength of my attachment to the individual spirit. The paramount need to keep it alive, I now see, is so great as to override any other principle whatever.\u2019These are deeply anxious and disturbing days for those whose eyes are open and who value freedom, but provided we are alert and alive to the danger, then the human will of the growing and quietly determined majority must prevail. The responsibility that rests upon the Conservative Party is huge and humbling. But as autumn moves towards winter, and we brace ourselves for the great task that lies ahead, let us make this promise to the British people: We will discharge that task with all our strength and all our faith. We shall not fail our country. (Prolonged applause)

aVI must first thank you, Madame Chairman, for the wonderful heart-warming welcome. I confess that this is the biggest birthday party that I have ever had. I just do not know whether my parents had in mind the timing of the party conference, but if that is what is meant by family planning I am all for it.One of the distinguished members of my shadow Cabinet sent me a birthday card today and said \u2018Don\u2019t think of it as another birthday; think of it as another year spent mastering the intricacies of a rewarding and demanding life.\u2019 That seemed to me a pretty fair description of the job.Let us turn to the nation\u2019s business. Political life may be unpredictable. Dull it isn\u2019t. Last month the nation was privileged to watch on television the first broadcast ever to present a chronic case of cold feet as a noble act of patriotism. \u2018Let\u2019s see it through together,\u2019 said the Prime Minister in his now notorious announcement that there would be no election, \u2018in the national interest.\u2019Of course, by seeing it through together he meant seeing it through with Labour. I am inclined to think that the people of this country will reject that invitation the moment that they are given the opportunity. Whenever the moment comes we are ready. As soon as Parliament reassembles we shall do all we can as a responsible Opposition to end the present damaging uncertainty, to defeat the Government and to bring about a general election.But I must warn you that the dying days of this administration may well see one last wretched round of manipulation and manoeuvre, of private deals or public pacts or cosy little understandings - always, of course, \u2018in the national interest\u2019 - before the Government are finally dragged kicking and screaming, to the polls. If that should be the case, so be it. I believe that the longer they wait the harder they will fall. But the harder, too, will be our task of halting and reversing the decline of Britain. Our party offers the nation nothing less than national revival, the deeply needed, long-awaited and passionately longed-for recovery of our country. That recovery will depend on a decisive rejection of the Labour Party by the people and a renewed acceptance of our basic Conservative belief that the State is the servant, not the master of this nation.But the problems we shall face are daunting. After nearly five years of Labour Government living standards have just got back to where they were when they took office. The Wilson-Callaghan years have left Britain close to the bottom of every international league table in terms of prices, in terms of jobs, and, above all, in terms of what we produce and what we owe to the rest of the world. Where they have left our country in terms of self-reliance and in terms of self-respect, in terms of national security, I hardly have to tell you.That is the legacy of Labour, and no amount of whistling in the dark by the Prime Minister or the Chancellor can change it. There is only one service they can do the nation now. It is to stand not upon the order of their going, but go. The damage that they have done to Britain is immeasurable. Our ancestors built a land of pride and hope and confidence in the future, a land whose influence grew out of all proportion to her size, whose constitution guaranteed a balance between freedom and order which used to be the British hallmark and became a model for the world. That was the heritage they handed down to us.What would they think of Labour Britain today. A country in which people ask, \u2018Why work if you can get by without?\u2019 \u2018Why save if your savings are taxed away, or inflated away or both?\u2019; \u2018Why do a good job when you will probably make out just as well if you do a bad one?\u2019; \u2018Why bother to get extra qualifications when differentials and earnings so often depend on political muscle, not personal merit?\u2019At home we are a country profoundly ill at ease with ourselves, while abroad a darkening and dangerous world scene confronts us. This is not just a Conservative analysis, it is a view shared here and overseas not least by those who love this land and wish it well. In their franker moments even some Labour Ministers subscribe to it. \u2018Land of hope and glory, mother of the free\u2019 sounds as stirring and moving as ever, but it is less and less like the land we live in today. Why is that? What has happened to this country of ours that we thought we knew? It is not just a question of pinning down who is responsible, important though that is. The first step in clearing your mind about where to go is to understand how you got where you are.Does what has happened to Britain over the last four and a half years imply that we have been governed by remarkably foolish people? No, though you may be able to think of one or two who would qualify under that heading. Is it the result of having been governed by unusually wicked people? No. There have been enough good intentions to pave the well-worn path twice over. The root of the matter is this: we have been ruled by men who live by illusions - the illusion that you can spend money you haven\u2019t earned without eventually going bankrupt or falling into the hands of your creditors; the illusion that real jobs can be conjured into existence by Government decree like rabbits out of a hat; the illusion that there is some other way of creating wealth than by hard work and satisfying your customers; the illusion that you can have freedom and enterprise without believing in free enterprise; the illusion that you can have an effective foreign policy without a strong defence force and a peaceful and orderly society without absolute respect for the law.It is these and many other Labour fallacies that have brought Britain to where we are today. Of course it is true that things have not deteriorated quite so quickly since the crisis of 1976. It was then, you will remember, that Denis Healey was put on probation to the International Monetary Fund. A strange man, Mr. Healey. He seems to think that being put on probation is some sort of achievement demanding recognition. Someone ought to tell him that you do not give the man who sets fire to your house a medal just because he phones for the fire brigade.Last week at Blackpool he was boasting again about his success. He could see growing confidence throughout the economy. We are poised, he said, for another \u2018great leap forward.\u2019 But, he told the assembled comrades, there were two conditions which Labour had to fulfil to win the election. First, and I quote him again, \u2018we have got to keep inflation under control.\u2019 Agreed. \u2018And we have got to strengthen, not weaken the authority of Jim Callaghan in this movement and in this country.\u2019 Disagreed. \u2018Those,\u2019 said Mr. Healey \u2018are the things you have got to ponder before you cast your votes.\u2019 Well, the brothers pondered and then they voted. They voted overwhelmingly to throw overboard the government\u2019s whole economic strategy, and with it, according to the Chancellor, the Prime Minister\u2019s authority.The following day Mr. Callaghan tried to restore it by speaking of the Government\u2019s \u2018inescapable responsibility\u2019 to deal with the present situation. He said nothing about his own inescapable responsibility for bringing that situation about. That is the charge against M.r Callaghan. Ask Sir Harold Wilson and Barbara Castle what they thought of his \u2018responsibility\u2019 nearly 10 years ago when he fought tooth and nail against their plan for reforming the trade unions, for making them - yes - more responsible. \u2018In Place of Strife\u2019 they called it. The unions did not like it. Mr. Callaghan saw it straight into the waste paper basket. The road to Blackpool 1978 was opened in 1969 by Mr. Callaghan. He cut the tape, and so long as it suited him, he travelled steadily down the road he had himself opened without so much as a backward glance.In 1974 during the dispute with the miners how did he define responsibility then? I will tell you how. He went to Wales and said to the miners: \u2018I am here as chairman of the British Labour Party because I wanted to come into the mining valleys to place the Labour Party firmly behind the miners\u2019 claim for a just and honest wage.\u2019 What would he say, what would the people of this country say, if the chairman of our party had gone down to East London and announced: \u2018I am here as chairman of the British Conservative Party because I wanted to come to Dagenham to place the Conservative Party firmly behind the Ford workers\u2019 claim for a just and honest wage\u2019?Well, now that the boot is on the other foot, what will the Conservatives do to him? Let me put his mind at rest. We are not going to follow in his footsteps. We won\u2019t accuse him of union bashing. We won\u2019t support a strike in breach of an agreement. We won\u2019t act irresponsibly, and he knows it. Nor do we rejoice at his discomfiture, for his problems are the country\u2019s problems. But a man who whets the tiger\u2019s appetite cannot expect much sympathy when it turns and bites him.Today the nation has a Prime Minister whose party has disowned his principal policy and destroyed the chief plank in his election strategy. Until last week that strategy was simple. Labour would play its union card, the one called \u2018special relationship.\u2019 The idea was this. A group of union leaders would try to persuade the country that if they were not allowed to call the tune there would be no music. Mind you, no union leader ever said: \u2018I shall overturn a Conservative Government.\u2019 It was always the union next door that was going to do that. For Labour this device would have had one splendid virtue. It would have made it possible for every Labour candidate to say in effect: \u2018Suppose Labour has created more unemployment than any Government since 1945; suppose it has produced a stagnant economy; suppose it has doubled prices; suppose it has nothing to offer but more and more nationalisation, more and more State control. The fact remains that only it can keep the unions happy, and without this the economy will grind to a halt.\u2019That, in a nutshell, was to be the Labour case when the election came, but the election did not come. Blackpool came - and with it, the great illumination.Today, Labour\u2019s policies are at a dead end, economically and politically. This is not something to crow about. We do not hope for a country in ruins so that we can take over. We want to be elected so that we can do better, not because we could not possibly do worse.This country is looking for a sign that we can succeed where socialism has failed. Labour\u2019s dead end has to be our beginning. The idea that only Labour can talk to labour drowned in the sea at Blackpool. Let me now at our Conservative Conference start the Conservative dialogue.Here are the facts as I see them - and I am talking now straight to the union leaders.\u2018We Conservatives don\u2019t have a blue-print for instant success. There isn\u2019t one. But at least we start with this advantage.\u2018We know what not to do. That path has been clearly signposted.\u2018If a government takes too much in tax, everyone wants higher wages.\u2018If a government bails out those who bargain irresponsibly, where does the money come from? The pockets of those who bargain responsibly.\u2018If a government tries to level everyone down, with year after year of totally rigid incomes policies, it destroys incentives.\u2018If a government enforces those policies with the underworld sanctions of blackmail and blacklist, it undermines its own authority and Parliament\u2019s. \u2018For years the British disease has been the \u201cus\u201d and \u201cthem\u201d philosophy. Many in industry are still infected with this virus. They still treat the factory not as a workplace but as a battlefield. When that happens, the idea of a common interest between employers and employed flies out of the window and so does the truth that if your company prospers, you will too.\u2018Now, you the trade union leaders have great power. You can use it well or you can use it badly. But look at the position of your members today, and compare it with the position of workers in other free countries. Can you really say, can anyone really say, you have used your power well? You want higher wages, better pensions, shorter hours, more government spending, more investment, more - more - more - more.\u2018But where is this \u201cmore\u201d to come from? There is no more. There can be but there won\u2019t be unless we all produce it. You can no more separate pay from output than you can separate two blades of a pair of scissors and still have a sharp cutting edge.\u2018And here let me say plainly to the trade union leaders, you are often your own worst enemies. Why isn\u2019t there more? Because too often restrictive practices rob you of the one thing you have to sell - your productivity. Restrictive practices are encrusted like barnacles on our industrial life. They\u2019ve been there for almost a century. They were designed to protect you from being exploited, but they have become the chief obstacle to your prosperity. How can it be otherwise? When two men insist on doing the work of one, there is only half as much for each.\u2018I understand your fears. You\u2019re afraid that producing more goods with fewer people will mean fewer jobs, and those fears are naturally stronger at a time of high unemployment. But you\u2019re wrong. The right way to attack unemployment is to produce more goods more cheaply and then more people can afford to buy them. Japan and Germany, mentioned several times this week - and rightly so - are doing precisely that and have been for years. Both have a large and growing share of our markets. Both are winning your customers and taking your jobs.\u2018Of course, we in Britain see the German success and want it here - the same living standards, the same output, the same low rate of inflation. But remember, what they have also had in Germany is strict control of the money supply, no rigid incomes policy, less state control than we have, lower personal tax and unions which are on the side of the future, not re-fighting the battles of the past.\u2018We shall do all that a government can to rebuild a free and prosperous Britain. We believe in realistic, responsible collective bargaining, free from government interference. Labour doesn\u2019t.\u2018We believe in encouraging competition, free enterprise, and profits in firms large and small. Labour doesn\u2019t.\u2018We believe in making substantial cuts in the tax on your pay packet. Labour doesn\u2019t. We will create conditions in which the value of the money you earn and the money you save can be protected.\u2018We will do these things. That I promise you. We\u2019ll play our part, if you, the trade union leaders, play yours responsibly.\u2018Responsibility can\u2019t be defined by the government setting a fixed percentage for everyone, because the circumstances are different in every concern in the country, whether nationalised or free. It\u2019s up to you, the trade union leaders, to act realistically in the light of all the facts, as the government must do. If you demand too much, you will bargain your firm into bankruptcy and your members on the dole. And no one wants that. \u2018Our approach works in other countries which are doing far better than we are. It worked here during 13 years of Conservative government. You did better, Britain did better - infinitely better than today under Labour.\u2018Let\u2019s make it work again.\u2019That is our message to the unions.You can hear the same message in country after country.You can hear distant echoes of it even from Labour Ministers. It would be nice to think that this was due to an irreversible shift in the distribution of common sense. But it\u2019s really due to the nearness of an election and a swelling tide of protest from every taxpayer, every home owner, every parent in the land.I look forward to Labour\u2019s continuing conversion to good sense, and after the election, to their becoming a helpful Opposition in the new House of Commons.So far I have spoken mainly of the practical and material failure of the last four Labour years and how we shall start to put things right. Let me turn now to something deeply damaging to this country.Many of us remember the Labour Party as it used to be. In the old days it was at least a party of ideals. You didn\u2019t have to agree with Labour to understand its appeal and respect its concern for the underdog. Gradually over the years there has been a change. I have no doubt that those ideals, those principles, are still alive today in the hearts of traditional Labour supporters. But among those who lead the Labour movement something has gone seriously wrong.Just compare the years of Clement Attlee and Hugh Gaitskell with those of Harold Wilson and James Callaghan. Today, instead of the voice of compassion, the croak of the Quango is heard in the land. There may not be enough jobs for the workers, but there are certainly plenty of jobs for the boys.That is the house that Harold built, to which his successor has not been slow to add a wing or two of his own.Many in the Labour Party wonder what has happened to it. Socialism has gone sour. Today Labour seems to stand too often for expediency, for greed, for privilege, for policies that set one half of society against the other.There are many reasons for this. One stems from that least attractive of emotions: envy. This spirit of envy is aimed not only at those privileged by birth and inherited wealth, like Mr. Wedgwood Benn. It is also directed against those who have got on by ability and effort.It is seen in Labour\u2019s bias against men and women who seek to better themselves and their families. Ordinary people, small businessmen, the self employed are not to be allowed to rise on their own. They must rise collectively or not at all.Object to merit and distinction and you\u2019re setting your face against quality, independence, originality, genius, against all the richness and variety of life.You are pinning down the swift and the sure and the strong, as Gulliver was pinned down by the little people of Lilliput.A society like that cannot advance. Our civilisation has been built by generation after generation of men and women inspired by the will to excel. Without them we should still be living in the Stone Age. Without the strong who would provide for the weak? When you hold back the successful, you penalise those who need help.Envy is dangerous, destructive, divisive - and revealing. It exposes the falsity of Labour\u2019s great claim that they\u2019re the party of care and compassion. It is the worst possible emotion to inspire a political party supposedly dedicated to improving the lot of ordinary working people.From there it is but a short step to the doctrine of class warfare. The Marxists in the Labour Party preach that this is not only just but necessary and inevitable.But let me put this thought to you. If it is wrong to preach race hatred - and it is - why is it right to preach class hatred? If it is a crime to incite the public against a man simply because of the colour of his skin - and it is - why is it virtuous to do so just because of his position?The political organisation of hatred is wrong - always and everywhere. Class warfare is immoral, a poisonous relic of the past. Conservatives are as fallible, as human and therefore as given to making mistakes as the next man. But we don\u2019t preach hatred and we are not a party of envy.Those who claim that we are a class party are standing the truth on its head. So, too, are those who claim that we are racists. Our determination to deal with the very real and difficult problems of immigration control has inspired Labour to a shameful attempt to frighten the coloured population of Britain.Last month the Liberal leader added his voice to the chorus. No doubt in an effort to distract attention from his many deep and pressing problems, he too did his best - or worst - to pin the label of \u2018racialism\u2019 on the Conservative Party.I realise that a drowning man will clutch at any straw. But let me remind young Mr. Steel, millions of Conservatives were among those who spent five years of their lives fighting a war against racialism when he was still in short trousers.It is true that Conservatives are going to cut the number of new immigrants coming into this country, and cut it substantially, because racial harmony is inseparable from control of the numbers coming in.But let me say a word to those who are permanently and legally settled here, who have made their homes with us. Your responsibilities are the same as those of every other British citizen, and your opportunities ought to be.Compulsory repatriation is not, and never will be, our policy and anyone who tells you differently is deliberately misrepresenting us for his on ends.Many other smears and charges will be thrown at us as election day comes nearer. But let us not be too concerned, however large the lie or absurd the charge. They are a sign of our opponents\u2019 desperation. For instance, you may have noticed, and so, I suspect, has the public, how often these charges contradict one another. One moment it is said that we have no policy, the next that our policies would bring about every disaster known to man. One moment, Shadow Ministers are said to be notorious villains - well, here the \u2018villains\u2019 are. The next minute, they are said to be unknown. Unknown? There\u2019s a charge from a party with household names like - let me see, now - Stanley Orme, not to mention Albert Booth. But then, no one does, do they?Well, Mr. Prime Minister, if there are any unknowns in the Shadow Cabinet we are all looking forward to becoming a lot better known at your earliest convenience.Until then, national uncertainty continues, and with it the continued weakening of one of our most ancient and deep-rooted traditions - respect for and safety under the law. When a rule of law breaks down, fear takes over. There is no security in the streets, families feel unsafe even in their own homes, children are at risk, criminals prosper, men of violence flourish, the nightmare world of \u2018A Clockwork Orange\u2019 becomes a reality.Here in Britain in the last few years that world has become visibly nearer. We have seen some of the symptoms of the breakdown of the rule of law - the growth in the number of unsolved and unpunished crimes, especially violent crimes, overcrowded courts, an underpaid and undermanned police force, judges insulted by a senior Minister of the Crown. Sometimes, members of the Labour Party give the impression that as between the law and the lawbreakers they are at best neutral.We Conservatives are not neutral. We believe that to keep society free the law must be upheld. We are 100 per cent behind the police, the courts, the judges, and not least the law-abiding majority of citizens.To all those engaged in law enforcement we pledge not just our moral but our practical support. As for the law-breakers, whether they are professional criminals carrying firearms, or political terrorists, or young thugs attacking the elderly, or those who think they can assault policemen with immunity, we say this: \u2018You will find in the new Conservative Government a remorseless and implacable opponent.\u2019The Conservative Party also stands for the defence of our realm. I am often told that there are no votes to be won by talking about defence and foreign policy. Well, I intend to go on talking about them, especially with elections to the European Parliament approaching. And, unlike Labour, we shall work to make a success of our place in the community, and we shall not need to be prompted to honour our obligations to our NATO allies.It was nearly three years ago that I warned of the growing danger of Soviet expansion.  I was at once attacked by Labour\u2019s Defence Secretary and the Soviet leaders - strange company, you might think, for a British Cabinet Minister. What has happened since I made that speech?The Soviet Union, through its Cuban mercenaries, has completed its Marxist takeover of Angola; Ethiopia has been turned into a Communist bastion in the Horn of Africa; there are now perhaps 10,000 Cubans in that continent, a deadly threat to the whole of Southern Africa. And as the Soviet threat becomes stronger, so the Labour Government have made Britain weaker. It has cut our forces time and again. We now have only 74 fighter planes to defend our country. We lost twice as many as that during one week of the Battle of Britain.I am well aware that modern Phantoms have many times the firepower of the Spitfire or Hurricane, but how does that help if you run out of Phantoms? There is a minimum level below which our defences cannot safety be allowed to fall. They have fallen below that level. And I give you this pledge: to bring them back to that minimum level will be the first charge on our national resources under the Conservative Government.It will not be easy, but there are no short cuts to security. There are only short cuts to defeat. Conservatives too will see that our Armed Forces are properly paid. They do an indispensable job abroad and at home, not least in Northern Ireland.I spent three memorable and moving days in Northern Ireland in June. The constancy and patience of the men and women of the Province who have endured so much pain through 10 years of terror is something that I shall never forget. I know that there are those who say: \u2018Leave them to solve their own problems and bring our boys back.\u2019 To them I must reply: \u2018If you wash your hands of Northern Ireland you wash them in blood.\u2019 So long as Ulster wishes to belong to the United Kingdom she will do so. That is the policy of the Conservative Party and it will be the policy of the next Conservative Government.The next Conservative Government. I have spoken of what four years of Labour Government have done to Britain, materially and morally, at home and abroad. I hope that after this afternoon it will not be possible for anyone to say again that there is really not much difference between the parties. There is all the difference in the world, and if it is the will of the country we will show the country and the world what that difference is.May I end on a personal note? Long ago I learned two lessons of political life - to have faith and to take nothing for granted. When we meet again the election will be over. I would not take the result for granted, but I have faith that our time is coming and I pray that when it comes we use it well, for the task of restoring the unity and good name of our nation is immense.I look back at the great figures who led our party in the past and after more than three years I still feel a little astonished that it has fallen to me to stand in their place. Now, as the test draws near, I ask your help, and not only yours - I ask it of all men and women who look to us today, who share with us our longing for a new beginning.Of course, we in the Conservative Party want to win, but let us win for the right reason - not power for ourselves, but that this country of ours, which we love so much, will find dignity and greatness and peace again.Three years ago I said that we must heal the wounds of a divided nation. I say it again today with even greater urgency. There is a cause that brings us all together and binds us all together. We must learn again to be one nation or one day we shall be no nation. That is our Conservative faith. It is my personal faith and vision. As we move towards Government and service may it be our strength and inspiration. Then not only will victory be ours, but we shall be worthy of it.

aVMr. Chairman, I know you were correct in your rul­ing a minute ago about, I think, the delegate from Thanet who wanted to move a motion of no confidence, but he should not feel too lonely in that, there are a lot of other people who want to do the same. He will get his chance, I am sure, in due course. There is no reason why special privileges in this Party of ours should be afforded to any one person to do a job that other people want to do.This Parliamentary report is divided into two parts. First of all, the period up to 3rd May, when we were the Labour Government, and, second­ly, the period since then. And I want to deal first, and clearly, with the part of the record that runs from the date of the last Conference up till 3rd May. I also want to review in general what hap­pened in the period of the Labour Government from 1974 to 1979 in order that we can all examine as fairly and as dispassionately as pos­sible how true is the charge that the Labour Government and the Parliamentary Labour Party failed to carry out the Manifesto or ignored the policies put forward by Conference and by the National Executive Committee. I wish to put the record straight. No one need think that the Parliamentary Labour Party, or myself, comes here in any apologetic mood this morning about our work from \u201974 to \u201979. (Applause) We not only carried out much of the Manifesto, we carried out much of it without a majority in Parliament. (Applause)Let me remind you of some of the matters. You asked that North Sea oil should be brought under public ownership and control: we did it, and now the Tories are fooling around trying to dispose of it. You asked that the Price Commis­sion should be set up: it was, and consumers were saved hundreds of millions of pounds in higher prices and now the Tories are abolishing it. You asked that there should be a National Enterprise Board to stimulate British industry with new capital, new management and now the Tories are fettering it. You asked for Scottish and Welsh Development Agencies: they were set up. Ask Scotland and Wales. They safeguarded old jobs, they developed new jobs, they built new factories and now the Tories are reducing the resources that were devoted to them.Reference has been made to the Employment Protection Act. Was that not worthwhile, giving greater security to men and women in jobs and now the Tories are seriously weakening and undermining it. The aircraft industry, the ship­building industry, both nationalised and nationalised with a majority of one - and now the Tories are trying to sell them or shut them down. I say to Conference, with the benefit of 34 years\u2019 experience in Parliament - and there are now only a dozen of us who are left from that great 1945 victory - I say to you that those two Acts of Parliament got through by the Parliamen­tary Labour Party represented a vast parliamen­tary effort by every member that compares in intensity and in devotion, because of the fierce­ness of the Tory opposition, because of our slen­der majority, that intensity of effort compares with any Act that was put through by the \u201945 to \u201951 Government when they had a majority of 100. (Applause) We only had a majority of one.Women\u2019s rights were established more firmly by legislation; legislation against discrimination against women in employment and in housing and now the Tories are undermining those rights. The improvement of the real standard of life for the pensioner by linking their pension increases to wage earners\u2019 pay increases - not worthwhile? Well, the Tories think it was; they are now abandoning it and every pensioner will suffer as a result. Eighty-three per cent of chil­dren at the end of our period of office in com­prehensive schools, and now the Tories are try­ing to reverse that.And what about the other achievements? Legislation for a new Race Relations Act. The effective ending of the agricultural tied cottage. New benefits for the disabled. The highest number of doctors and nurses ever; 45,000 more nurses when we left office than when we came in; 5,800 more doctors. The largest number of teachers ever. Is that not Socialism in action? And so I could go on. (Applause) The Devolu­tion Bills, the Mobility Allowances for the dis­abled, the child allowances, invalid in-care, and I have left out a score of others.The Chairman yesterday gave a list of some of the things we did not do, and I readily acknowledge that this is so. But, if we are going to have a balance sheet, let us have both sides of it. (Applause) Indeed, he could have added a cou­ple. He could have said we did not introduce a Freedom of Information Bill, and we did not, although we tried to make more information available. He could have said that we did not introduce a Wealth Tax, that we introduced a Capital Transfer Tax. He would have been right and he knows, and we all know, the reasons for some of these difficulties. But I claim, and I claim without apology, I claim proudly, that any fair-minded member of the Party who looks at the balance sheet reads a fine record of Manifesto achievements carried out by a minority Government. (Applause) Every constituency delegate and every trade unionist is entitled to be proud of it, and, indeed, you were proud of it when you went on the doorsteps before May 3rd.The Government\u2019s troubles and differences, especially with the National Executive Commit­tee, came over some aspects of economic policy. That is where the troubles were. Let me remind you, therefore, what the position was when the Labour Government began office. Let me remind you what the Manifesto said. The most serious statement in the Manifesto of 1974, which was the backcloth to everything we had to undertake, was that - and here I quote - Bri­tain faces its most dangerous crisis since the war for years. I need not remind you of that back­ground: the three-day week, the balance of pay­ments deficit, rapidly increasing inflation, money supply out of control. Harold Wilson came to this Conference just after the General Election of 1974 and he said to you, at the very beginning of the 1974 Government, that Britain would have to wait for improvements in our standard of life for at least two years or more. You applauded him, and it was true. And then, last year, the improvement came. He said two years or more, perhaps a year out, but the improve­ment came and last year the Chancellor, Denis Healey, was able to say that there had been the biggest improvement in the previous months, in the previous twelve months, in our standard of life for many years, and it was true. And we met the difficulties and thanks to the co-operation of the trade union movement we overcame them. But way back in \u201974, and that is where we start from, you know, on this record, it was inflation that was the overriding preoccupation of the nation. To the housewives it was undermining their daily lives, it was making long-term economic decisions about new jobs and new investment almost impossible and the policies that we followed, with full co-operation, were successful in reducing the inflation, the major problem that the country felt.So, when we met a year ago we were reporting that the rate of increase had gone down from 25 per cent a year to under 8 per cent a year; nearly double again now. And we had an objective agreed with the trade unions to try and bring it even lower to 5 per cent or thereabouts. And we achieved what we did when we got to the lowest figure of 7.4 per cent a year ago because of the close co-operation, because we worked out agreements between the Government and the trade union movement on the broad ranges of social and economic policies, including the yearly level of earnings.Last autumn was the worst testing time, as those who were here a year ago and remember the dates will recall. But I was very sorry to hear repeated in authoritative quarters yesterday in this Conference, the myth repeated that the Labour Government took no notice of our Con­ference discussion last year on pay. That is sim­ply untrue and Michael Foot gave the real account in his great speech yesterday afternoon. (Applause) If there is still any slight dubiety remaining let me then underline and comment on one or two of the things he said.This time a year ago, presenting this very report, I undertook, in the light of the discussion we had had on the Monday afternoon, that we would make arrangements for further talks. Those talks, Mr Chairman, were actually arranged whilst delegates were sitting in this Conference, during Conference week. They actually began on the Tuesday after Conference - that is to say, as it were, Tuesday of next week. And they began between representatives of the General Council and Labour Ministers. How can it be said we took no notice? There was a series of meetings that went on for three weeks. Intensive negotiations took place. Has it all been forgotten? At the end of it we reached a new agreement between the representatives of the trade union movement and the Labour Ministers.When the Ministers came to me, I put it on the Cabinet Agenda on Thursday, November 9, five weeks after the last Conference, and the Labour Cabinet on that morning agreed that new understanding. That was what I did in the way of responding to the Conference discussions. Do not let anybody dare say we did nothing about it. (Applause) It was a great blow to me personally, and to the Government, when the news reached us on November 14 - six weeks after Confer­ence - that opinion was equally divided in the TUC and so the agreement could not come into effect. I offer no criticism of that. These approaches were made in good faith. The dis­cussions took place in good faith. It was not possible to reach an agreement, but do not let anybody say we did not try. We tried our damn­edest and we nearly succeeded. (Applause)I have always taken the view that unless there is agreement with the trade unions a Labour Government cannot, in the long run, survive. And four months later we fell. I cannot say I saw it coming in the actual way it did, but I knew that there was little hope, once that second major effort had broken down. So, what I have said supplements the account that Michael gave yesterday. Let the myth be destroyed once and for all, that after last year\u2019s Conference we took no notice of what was said.The lesson I draw is the lesson I have always drawn, consistently uttered and tried to follow, that a Labour Government\u2019s economic policy will only succeed when we work in close con­junction with the Trades Union Congress. If I thought our present Prime Minister would listen to me, I would offer a word of advice to her, that as soon as she ends her arms length hostility to the trade unions, the better it will be for this country. Let her swallow her prejudices about this.We all know the consequences of last winter\u2019s breakdown. We are going to live, the people of this country, with a Tory Government this wint­er. David Basnett in ten minutes yesterday gave a devastating exposure of the effect of Tory Party policies, the Government\u2019s policies, and I do not intend to take your time by repeating it this morning. Every delegate knows where their policies are leading. Every trade unionist is already feeling it. Every local councillor is aware of it and the public are becoming conscious of it. This winter the housewife, the wage earner, the industrialist will live with a rate of inflation that has been doubled; industry starved of cash; more bankruptcies; even higher unemployment, and an international forecast that in 1980 Tory Britain will have a higher rate of inflation and the lowest rate of economic activity of any industrialised country in the world. Put that up against those 48-sheet posters that we saw displayed on every hoarding during the General Election \u2013 \u2018Don\u2019t just hope for a better life,\u2019 they said, \u2018Vote for one.\u2019 I wonder how many of the people who took that slogan seriously now repent and regret that they did.Mr Chairman, I have every faith that our Labour Party will win the next election, but it will not be enough to win it by default. I think we will all agree about that. It will not be enough to win it just because people are disillusioned with the Conservatives. If we do, we shall be back in the same trouble that we were in last time. We must make sure that the next Labour Govern­ment starts with a clear mandate and agreement of what it will do, and that means that we should now embark - and I know we intend to do so - on a period of lively discussion and argument. I have no objection to that. I have taken part in many of them in my time. I dare say I will con­tinue to do so. There is nothing new in it. There has always been intense discussion in this Party. We are a Party of protest as well as being a Party of government and there is a genuine reason for the present discussion. Perhaps some people have different motives, I do not know. I am not here to attack peoples\u2019 motives, but there is a genuine reason why we should have this discus­sion and try to be willing to learn the lessons from our defeat.There are many delegates, good delegates to our General Management Committees, many trade unionists who are genuinely concerned because of the way in which the Labour Government\u2019s efforts finally came to an end. So, there is widespread agreement on the need for a full inquiry and we must examine carefully the argument that is put forward. I do not wholly accept it myself, but it is put forward and it must be examined - that it was the structural relationships between the various parts of the Party, especially the Parliamentary Labour Party and the National Executive Committee and the Con­ference, which were the cause of our defeat. Yes, let us examine it.I heard the Chairman yesterday say he was not looking for new policies, he wanted existing policies to be implemented, but, as every dele­gate knows, there is a world of difference bet­ween us passing a Resolution at this Conference and facing the task of translating that into legislation and action by a Labour Government. (Applause) There is nothing new about this prob­lem. Our old friend, Manny Shinwell, was telling me on Sunday that he himself raised the issue, before he got into Parliament when he was a young delegate at a Conference in the early part of the 20th century, 1907 I believe, 60 or 70 years ago; he said he was given a severe ticking-off. He was told there could be no outside interference with the Parliamentary Labour Party. Since then, the issue has been raised from time to time. The last time I can trace there was a serious debate in the Conference about it was in 1960, when the independence of the Parliamentary Party was once again affirmed. But now 20 or more years have gone by since 1960. There is no reason, when you are convinced of the strength of your case, why you should not be willing to sit down and examine the matter again, no reason at all; let everybody do so. Labour Members of Parliament and a Labour Government - and I state this as a principle before we begin the dis­cussion - are bound, both in duty and in consci­ence, to pay the closest attention to what Con­ference decides and any Member of Parliament who did not accept that obligation would not be worthy of his responsibilities.The General Secretary said yesterday in words that I wrote down at the time that it was the duty of the Parliamentary Party - I quote \u2013 \u2018to take serious note of those policies.\u2019 Is that what is being demanded? If it is, then we can have the discussion very easily. Or, is it more? I agree that that is the duty and the conscious responsibility of the Parliamentary Party to do that and every one of us must take it seriously, and I believe that in general we try to do so. But I affirm the independence of the Parliamentary Party and of the Labour Government - at the end of the day they must take the decisions, they are responsible. They have the responsibility of facing the electorate. They have the responsibil­ity of arguing for their policies before they can be elected, not by Conference but by the people of this country. I say to you that this Conference will settle nothing today if it passes the resolutions that are on the Agenda that Members of Parliament should have no part in deciding the Manifesto on which they fight except, yes, they will be consulted, they will be asked about it, and that the decisions should be left solely to the National Executive Committee - well, that is the decision you are being asked to take today. That is the one. And the situation, even if the Motions were passed, would not endure. A Labour Government would always be faced with the practical problems that do not obtrude them­selves when we are passing Resolutions at Con­ference.Now, this has a relation in some way, you know, to this question of reselection. I have not joined in this debate so far on reselection of Members - (Laughter) - no, as a matter of fact, I have not. It is one on which I have kept quiet. But, you know, it has got a bearing on it. Perhaps I have not played as much part as I should have done because, who knows how interested I shall be in ten years\u2019 time. But what I have noticed - and here I place my experience before Conference - is that over the many years that I have been in Parliament that Members of Parliament have become more independently minded than they were when I first entered. They want to play a greater part in checking Government. We had trouble in the last Parliament with some of our own Members who sat on the Select Com­mittees because they wanted to go against the policy of the Government, and my colleagues will remember it, but they were sitting on a Select Committee and they said, \u2018We are inde­pendently minded; we want to reach our own conclusions,\u2019 and they did, and we are seeing further evidence of this change in the attitude of Members of Parliament of all parties, not just the Labour Party, of all parties - the Conservatives are moving in the same direction - by the setting up of these 12 departmental committees that are going to monitor and check on the work of Ministers in 12 separate departments.And another change. Being a Member of Par­liament is becoming much more of a full-time occupation for Members than it was when I first entered the House. That is something that you should applaud. I do not take all the arguments that are put forward on this mandatory business about the consequences that are going to follow. I do not believe it is going to have too much effect on the security of sitting Members of Par­liament. It may have some effect in a small number of cases, but I think in the great majority of cases it will not have that effect because in the overwhelming majority where there is a sitting Member of Parliament he has a good relationship with his General Management Committee. That is the truth of the matter and we all know it and those of us who go regularly to our GMCs - and allow me to have a modest boast; I am a delegate from my own ward and branch to my own GMC, as I have been for many years - those of us who go regularly know that Members of Parliament and their GMCs work for the most part very closely in harmony.No, I do not care for it, but we have got the new rule already. That, I think, is a compromise that Members of Parliament thought should be accepted, but this new one that is going much further, in which you are going, apparently, to have a continuous process of reselection in between Parliaments during the lifetime of Parliaments, I think my worry about it would be not the loss of security - I think most Members of Parliament will win the day - but I think it will mean that GMCs will be much more divided; it will make it much easier for carpet-baggers and factions to grow up. It will be up to the Member of Parliament and the GMC to try to settle that sort of thing. (Applause) Having disposed of what I regard as the sec­urity argument, although I accept fully the words of my shop steward, Joe Ashton, that he uttered last year. Let me say to those who advocate it - and I understand that they advocate it on the grounds that it will make Members of Parliament become more responsive  to their constituencies - they had better face the possibility that if Members of Parliament become more responsive to their constituencies they may become less responsive to the Whip in the House of Commons and even to the National Executive Committee. (Applause) If the Parliamentary Labour Party or the National Executive Committee, when it assumes full authority over us all, if it seeks to secure a common line of action, I tell you you have got a second think coming because my view is, and I am looking at this as objectively as I can - my view is that because you are strengthening - (Laughter) - well, I have no vested interest in it, whatever some of the young members may have - my view is that the effect of what you propose to do - and I gather the votes are in the bag, well, good luck to you - but the effect of what you are going to do will be to strengthen local Party control and weaken central Party control.Do not believe that all the constituencies have the same views about policy, especially where there are sitting Members of Parliament. Look, be serious for a moment. We are a party of change, and a party of change by its very nature requires common, concerted action, and such a party should consider very carefully before it fractionalises into 635 pieces. The central thrust that comes from common action, so the result may not be what the movers of these proposals think it may be.I think that if the votes go through, and I understand they are already in the bag, it will throw an even heavier responsibility on that committee of enquiry that we have agreed to set up to look at all these factors and see what you want to do about it. Of course, if any of you want to recall your delegations during the lunchtime and think again, I shall feel this speech has been worthwhile. (Applause) And when the enquiry report comes back, then I hope Conference will consider what I have said and also what the enquiry report itself will say.Now, I am glad that on the question of the Manifesto the National Executive Committee went part way to meet me and others on Sunday by deciding to withdraw their own proposal. That would have been an intolerable proposal, trying to push it through this week without any discussion with the Parliamentary Party and they saw the wisdom, or the unwisdom, of doing that and so they withdrew by a majority. So, they have come some way to meet the objec­tions. But, you know, there are similar resolu­tions on the same subject today which they are ready to accept, so it was a tactical withdrawal and not a strategic withdrawal. What they would have the effect of doing would be that these changes would come into force in 12 months time instead of coming into force immediately.I repeat on this issue, to pass these resolutions will not settle the issue and I assume that is what we want to do. We have to sit down together, the National Executive Committee, the Parliamen­tary Committee and the trades unions and con­sider seriously the nature of the relationship that should exist between us. This is the fundamental issue and I believe, having settled that relation­ship once again, having looked at it and decided what it should be. What is the role of the National Executive? What is the role of the Par­liamentary Party? What is the role of Confer­ence? Having settled that, I believe, you are more likely to get agreement after you have had discussion and these other questions that you are so anxious to vote on today, they will begin to solve themselves automatically because you will have settled the fundamental question. So, first, let us settle by agreement the nature of the relationship between the various parts of the Party, then we can settle for some years to come these questions about election of leaders, con­trol of the Manifesto, reselection, and so on.These questions are important, but it is illogi­cal, in my view, to take the decisions first and then ask a committee of enquiry to look into them afterwards. (Applause) That is why I believe the Trade Union Committee for Labour Victory were right when they asked the Execu­tive to request that these matters should be remitted; not to sweep them under the carpet, not to get rid of them but in order that there should be a proper and serious discussion. Then you will carry people by agreement, because I promise you, in this Party you will not carry them by anything else.The enquiry committee will also have other things to look at; issues like membership and finance and structure and organisation of the Party. I hope they will look at some of the other matters that were raised here yesterday morning in the debate on the result of the General Election. What about the regional pattern of our vot­ing? Why did we do so well in Scotland and yet, as was pointed out by the candidate for New­bury, we won only 11 seats out of 161 in the South of England. We had first class candidates in both areas: what cost us seats in the industrial Midlands? I wonder whether it was because there was no agreement about what the place of the low-paid worker should be against the place of skilled worker? (Applause)Let them inquire into why so many women, especially young women, did not vote for the Party. I can understand young women voting, perhaps, for others rather than me, but I think there may be more fundamental reasons. There was a poll taken during the General Election that, I must say, I found profoundly disturbing. It said - taken in the month of April - it said that the Tory Party was regarded as having more concern for ordinary people than the Labour Party. Well, we know what we think about that, but it is not what we think about ourselves, it is what other people perceive about us. That is the problem.It is the first time in the history of politics in this country that I have known such a result. So, let us all examine ourselves, everybody, and see what reasons we give for these things. After all, everybody wants a Labour Government to suc­ceed; we are all united in that, so let us avoid a lot of internal party-bashing among each other and let us have a bit of Tory-bashing for a change. (Applause)We fought on the slogan that \u2018The Labour Way is the Better Way\u2019 and I challenge anybody in this hall - and everybody agrees with me - to say that that is totally and absolutely accurate. It was the better way. It would have been the better way, and our major task in the next 12 months is to rebuild our action programme, to reorganise and mobilise support against the Government backed by their big money, by their obedient press and by their cynical advertising. Let this Conference, by its decisions, show that our unity is together, that we mount the great fight back our people need - and that they expect from us. We fight for the housewives and for the families, for the pensioners, against the increase in the VAT and the decreases in benefits; for the children and their schooling, for the sick and their proper care; to shield the reg­ions of England and Scotland and Wales against the cutbacks in public expenditure that are so damaging to our society. I challenge the Tories. Let them name any­thing that is as important as a National Health Service in which we can all take pride. Let them name anything that is as important as a fair deal for our pensioners.Let them name anything as important as giv­ing the child the maximum opportunity for its future. Let them name anything as important as giving the young training and skills for the new technology. That is what public spending is about, and a Labour movement must call upon the nation with a united front not to pit prejudice against prejudice, but to fight by strong and hon­est argument, to fight the Conservative assault on essential community services and to fight until we drive home the truth to every man and woman in this country right through the armour plating of Conservative prejudice.How dare the Government tell these groups - the children, the pensioners, the sick - come back in two generations; the money supply is more important than you. (Applause) Conserva­tive idea of values is to stick a price tag on everything. Some things and some values cannot be priced. People do expect community support. They do expect the Government to bring for­ward programmes of action to protect our basic rights. The Government is neglecting that responsibility today and it is our duty to take up the challenge.I do not pretend that every problem can be solved by throwing money at it, but we do know that these problems will not be solved by the undermining of our essential services that is tak­ing place.Mr Chairman, there are many other problems that I would like to discuss but time is going by, so perhaps you will allow me a few more minutes to bring up one or two other matters that I believe to be of importance.Let me begin with the problem of South Africa\u2019s apartheid that has been thrown into promi­nence by the arrival of the South African rugby team here this week. We are against this tour. Ted Rowlands and Dennis Howell together vis­ited the Foreign Office to tell them of our opposi­tion. Then, at the National Executive Committee meeting on Friday, we unanimously agreed a statement condemning the visit. The Tory Sports Minister, Hector Munro, has advised against the visit. Lord Carrington appears to be against the visit. The French Government has banned the tour. The Irish Government has ban­ned the tour and the team is still coming to Bri­tain. The powers are there: why do not the Gov­ernment use them? (Applause) Why do they now show the same ruthlessness in banning this tour as they can show when they dismiss an area health authority or close an old peoples\u2019 home? (Applause)Conference will make clear its views. Change comes in South Africa only when it is put under pressure politically, economically, culturally and in sport.I must also now quickly pass on to the ques­tion of the whole future of Zimbabwe Rhodesia. It will not be enough for the Government to get agreement on a new constitution - an important advance, but not enough. If peace is to come with majority rule and the security of all races - yes, we care about the white people there as well as the black people - if security is to come to all of them and to be guaranteed at the Lancaster House conference, then it must settle other major questions: the structure and powers of the transitional government that will lead to full majority rule; devise the arrangements for supervising the election; arrange the conditions for a cease-fire and agree the main principles which will merge and integrate the armed forces, three armed forces, that are now operating inside and outside that country. These problems are extremely difficult. Many attempts have been made and have failed.There is a prospect of success now. I have spoken personally and privately with all the leaders attending this conference and I say to you that given the follow-up to the initiative that began at the recent Commonwealth Conference, these problems are not insoluble.Mr. Chairman, the Parliamentary Labour Party will be ready to vote for a continuation of sanctions if they cannot be achieved, but we would prefer and will much more welcome our ability to support a just settlement that is agreed on these matters.I speak about Northern Ireland. I do not think that any of us have become inured or insensitive to the continuance of death and violence in Northern Ireland, nor do we forget the long-term impact that living in the midst of it must have on the young minds of those whose childhood is spent in such surroundings - ten years now in which it has been going on. But if anyone had forgotten, surely that powerful and moving plea and appeal by the Pope last weekend would have stirred us all again.During the last General Election, when I was asked questions on this, or, more frequently, shouted at, I said that despite the many attempts made by Merlyn Rees and Roy Mason, and their disappointments in trying to bring the political parties of the province together, a Labour Gov­ernment after the General Election would make a renewed effort. And let me now pay tribute to the work of Merlyn Rees and Roy Mason and to their courage, and, indeed, to all others - (Applause) - and, indeed, to all others who, in the pursuance of their public duty, take their lives in their hands.Well, we tried. I said we would do it. Unfortu­nately, it is not now in our power as a Govern­ment to do it and since the present Government took office we have, up till the moment, seen few signs or clear statements of their political inten­tions. The National Executive Committee has tried in the past to produce a properly thought out policy. We did not find it easy for there are no blueprints waiting for someone to pick up. Quite separately from the efforts by Labour Ministers during the period of the Government, the Executive took its own initiative, set up a special study group which we welcomed, visited Ireland, both North and South, saw representatives from the trade unions and from the political parties, but at the end of the day I have to record - and the Executive Committee has indicated that they wish me to say a word about this - I have to record that we were not able to come forward with an agreed statement. The Execu­tive Committee decided last Friday to talk once again to the parties involved so that we make a new effort to prepare a comprehensive policy. We must work closely with all concerned and it is the duty of the Government itself to make a renewed effort, and I call on them to do so and to consult once again; not only with all the parties but to maintain close contacts with the Govern­ment of Ireland, the Irish Government.I know there are some who hold this view - I heard it many times during the Election cam­paign - that a solution will come when British troops leave Northern Ireland. It is a view that is expressed by American politicians too. But at the present time, both they and the police are playing an indispensable role and it would be irresponsible for our Government, or for this Government, to abdicate its responsibilities for the lives of its citizens. We pay our sincere thanks to our soldiers and to the police, and to all others, for their efforts, which will be made all the more successful with full co-operation from the South. But none of us believes that there can be a military solution in Northern Ireland. We all know that the overwhelming majority of people, both North and South, wish nothing more than to live in peace. If a working agreement could be reached, and this I think is the task to which the Government must now apply itself, if a working agreement could be reached between the politi­cal parties it would enable the people as a whole to share some common ground in the immediate future that lies ahead; it would be the greatest blessing for them.We call on the Government and the Northern Ireland parties to come together for meaningful talks about the future and we, for our part, will continue to support all efforts to reduce the level of violence and to come forward with positive and constructive proposals in due course. Mr. Chairman, I should have liked a discus­sion about the Middle East, where next week I shall be visiting for talks with President Sadat, Prime Minister Begin and King Hussein of Jor­dan. We welcome and we support the peace treaty between Egypt and Israel as an important beginning for a new settlement that will cover a wider area, especially the future of the Palesti­nian people. (Applause) President Sadat and Prime Minister Begin, by their imaginative actions, brought about a potentially more hope­ful situation than we have known since the foun­dation of the State of Israel in the Middle East, and so let me add - especially in view of the attacks that are made on him at the present time - and so, let me add, without the patient deter­mination of President Carter whose great efforts on this part I applaud, this process, I doubt, would have gone so far. But what has been shown, and this is important for all of us - this is not just some issue that is extraneous to us - what has been shown by this peace agreement is that negotiations can yield results in the Middle East and I hope that lesson will not be lost on the Palestinian people or their leaders, whose legitimate desire to choose their own future must be subject only to one main condition, that the final arrangements must not thereby endanger the security of the other states in the area.I hope the Conference will allow me to carry that message in my discussions next week, for we are directly concerned with peace in the Middle East, not only for its own sake, not only for its effects on those who live there, but also a direct concern because of the impact of war in that area on the industrial economies of the West, including our own.Mr. Chairman, I have spent some time on these things because we, in this Party, are the heirs to the Labour Party\u2019s great tradition of internationalism and I wish that Conference could find more time to spend on international affairs. We might then see some of our own policies in a truer perspective, and we might also, incidentally, have a clearer idea of how we appear to the rest of the world. One thing I am certain of, whilst it is true that we have problems that are particular to ourselves, as well as advan­tages, the changing nature of world relationships means that we cannot solve all our problems by ourselves. We must co-operate fully with others. There is one attempt through the European Community.As far as that is concerned, it will continue to be hampered by its wasteful and costly agricul­tural policy, as well as by its institutional arrangements. I said before, and I say again now, that if Britain cannot get a satisfactory new financial settlement then we should announce, this Government should announce, that we will put a net financial ceiling on our contributions, but, having said that, do not throw the baby away with the bath water: Europe shares many problems; our trade unionists know this, they see it every day in their international contacts. Many of the same problems they share with us - steel, textiles, the micro-economic revolution with its effect on jobs, all examples of issues that we will not solve by ourselves but would be better solved by co-operation.The problems of the 1980s are before you. They are almost here now. They are almost upon us, the world. I sum up to you in six or seven words what they will be - employment, pover­ty, the use of resources yes, the Ecology Party may not score many votes but they got to the root of the problem - (Applause) - race and peace. The prospects for peace now are not as good as when we signed the Helsinki Agreement four years ago in 1975, and this movement should be taking note of this and we should be applying our minds to it.All these problems have international dimen­sions. A start has been made in a primitive way to co-ordinate the economic policies of the major industrial nations. A kind of beginning has been made through the North/South dialogue to recon­cile the conflicting needs of the industrial nations, the developing countries and the oil powers, but we in the community of nations are still novices in the art of international survival. Some of the powers can destroy large parts of the world in minutes. Other powers are even now seeking to acquire the same deadly means. Yes, we can all make the world worse in a few moments. But to make the world measurably better will take years or decades. It cannot be right that the world should collectively spend a billion dollars a day on weapons. It cannot be right that 700 millions of our fellow human beings are suffering from malnutrition. It cannot be right that across the world each year 15 mil­lion children die under the age of five and 15 million of these tragedies occur in the poorest countries. It cannot be right that a person\u2019s average lifespan in a poor country is 30 years shorter than in a developed nation. It cannot be right that two-thirds of the people in the poorer nations do not even enjoy fresh drinking water.Here is the challenge for the international community for the rest of this century. Here is the challenge for international socialism. (Applause) Our task is to re-order our priorities and this is why I have ventured to spend so much time on this matter this morning, quite apart from our internal affairs which, although vital are not the only issues in the world. It is vital to re-order our priorities so that every member of the family of man can be liberated from hunger and from disease and the acute hardship that is the lot of so many.We, I am glad to say, in our small way, thanks largely but not wholly to the insistence of Judith Hart in the Cabinet, we increased substantially our international aid and had plans to increase it by 6 per cent a year, the largest increase in our programme of any. Well, it was only a drop in the bucket but it was worth doing and I contrast it with the miserable penuriousness of the present Government, whose first act is to cut what we did. Our task is to do this, because without these basic foundations of human dignity all talk by Western leaders of democracy will sound like humbug to hungry millions of people. If we want our democratic values to triumph, and I do above all, then we must embark upon an interna­tional programme in the 1980s of partnership and sharing that has been unmatched in history. Indeed, if you will forgive the word, what we need is a new international social contract.In the words of Hubert Humphrey, and I will end with this: \u2018Our strength is not to be meas­ured by our military capacity alone, by our industry or by our technology. We will be remembered not for the power of our weapons, but for the power of our compassion and our dedication to human welfare.\u2019 Those were his words and that, Mr Chairman, should be the true face of socialism that this Confer­ence, and we ourselves, should present to our people - (Applause) - and let me add, in this increasingly interdependent world, our compas­sion and our dedication which we should show in our own internal matters, every one of us, whenever we appear, not the arrogance of pow­er. Let us show what socialism really is about when we appear on the television or talk about our rights and what we demand; that is in this increasingly interdependent world our compas­sion and our dedication cannot stop at our own frontiers. That is our task for the 1980s.

aVI am not sure whether that applause was to enable the photographers to get their photos and get out of it, or whether it was a genuine appreciation. I am going to assume it was the second. (Applause)Every succeeding Conference has its own atmosphere, sets its own objectives, and they are all different. Last year, in the face of our defeat, we had a Conference that was basically looking backwards - backwards to what had gone wrong, why we were defeated. A period of self-criticism is healthy. But you know we have got some very strong-minded individuals in this movement of ours. But despite all of them, I believe there is in every Conference a general will that seems to emerge almost unknowingly to set its own objectives. And I believe this Conference is in the process of doing the same thing.Yesterday I listened, as we all did, to some very important and good debates, beginning with the resolutions on the economic situation, moved in forward looking, not backward looking, constructive terms by the General and Municipal Workers and seconded by the National Union of Mineworkers. We listened to one of the best debates on energy that I can recall, to an excellent debate on education, and on transport. I must say I enjoyed the high level of debate and some out­standing speeches - I found myself in agreement with some of them more than with others. But I was confirmed in my view that a general will is emerging and will emerge as the week goes on from this Conference, and it is this: that every­thing that we say and do shall be directed towards achieving a basis of unity and a basis of unity that will develop the thrust that is required to rid our country of a reactionary, hard-faced and incompetent Government, headed by the most self-opinionated Prime Minister since Neville Cham­berlain. (Applause)What is there that can divide us when we have a reactionary Government in power now that can reduce the real value of national insurance be­nefits to the 1930s, or a mean, hard-faced Government that does not even spare the nation\u2019s physically and mentally handicapped children from their penny-pinching economies? And an incompetent Government that cannot even con­trol the supply of money - the instrument which they told us was all that was required to settle our problems and to bring down inflation. We did not believe them then and we have been proved right since.But how different it was all going to be when Mrs Thatcher was campaigning 18 months ago. It was to be a land of tax cuts, where everybody would be in work, either standing on their own feet or somebody else\u2019s. (Laughter) Just like the good old days. Well, 18 months later the good old days look remarkably like the bad old days. Even the tax cuts have turned out to be phoney. The total tax burden on the average family in this country is higher today than it was when Labour left office. As in the 1930s, the depressed areas of industrial devastation have re-emerged in Wales and in Scotland and in the North and on Merse­yside, and this time in the West Midlands. They are to be added to the list. Last time it was the town of Jarrow that symbolised the political ban­kruptcy of the system. This time it is the men and women of Consett. And no one could have heard the delegate speaking yesterday and listened to him without feeling anger and a new determina­tion that the men and women of our country shall not become the pawns of the market-place and the market economy.There is a callousness about the attitude of Mrs Thatcher and Keith Joseph and Geoffrey Howe that compounds the wickedness of their policies. Firms are being made bankrupt, whole sectors of industry like textiles and footwear are closing down, order books are at a low ebb, output is slowing, new investment in plant and machinery is cut back, interest rates have never been higher, over two million men and women are out of work. And the reaction of Thatcher, Joseph and Howe is that what is happening is clean, healthy and will purge us, and we will emerge leaner and fitter. They go on saying it as if it were a matter of pride. It will get worse before it gets better. To them every company that goes to the wall is a sign of economic realism. Every new man or woman on the dole is proof that competition is working, even if they are not.In this new Britain, failure has become success. Rising bankruptcies become the rejuvenation of British industry. According to Mrs Thatcher, an increase in unemployment means that we are still on course. Words that will rank with \u2018let them move house\u2019 for insensitivity. There used to be an advertisement with the caption, \u2018Even her best friends won\u2019t tell her.\u2019 (Laughter) But they are, and telling her loudly and clearly. Even the newly ennobled proprietors and editors of the newspapers are biting the hand that lifted them up. The magisterial Times sums up the Government\u2019s plight with a lofty leading article - well, what else would you expect? - headed \u2018Miles Off Course.\u2019Let us look at the evidence for that. Compare the record of our last 12 months with their first period in office. Employment - not unemploy­ment: when we left office 160,000 more jobs had been created than in the previous 12 months. Now there are 400,000 fewer jobs. Unemployment: with Labour unemployment fell by 90,000 in our last 12 months. Under the Conservatives 600,000 more men and women are out of work in the last 12 months. Job vacancies: 50,000 more in the last 12 months of Labour\u2019s office. 130,000 less in 12 months of Tory office. When we left office there were too many school leavers seeking jobs - 190,000. Now there are over half a million. Interest rates: May 1979, 12 per cent. Under the Conservatives, 16 per cent. Money supply - the totem pole of the Tories: Labour, 12 per cent. Under the Conservatives, 18 per cent. Inflation: 10 per cent when we left office, now over 16 per cent.Take some of the price rises that go into inflation. Gas prices did not rise in the last two years of the Labour Government. Under the pre­sent Government, up by 26 per cent. Coal price increases: 13 per cent in Labour\u2019s last 12 months, 37 per cent under the Tories. Electricity: a 4 per cent increase in Labour\u2019s last year, 100 per cent under the Conservatives. Dental charges: £5 a head, now £8. Prescription charges: 20p, now £1 in December next. School meals: 25p with Labour, now an average of 55p. Mortgage rates: 11¾ per cent with Labour, 15 per cent and an additional £20 a month with the Conservatives. Economic growth: 3 per cent higher in Labour\u2019s last year, 2 per cent lower under the Conservatives. Industrial production: 4 per cent higher with Labour, 9 per cent lower under the Conser­vatives. Manufacturing output: 3 per cent higher with Labour, 5 per cent lower under the Conser­vatives. Private manufacturing investment: 10 per cent higher with Labour in the last 12 months. It will fall this year by 10 per cent under the Conservatives.That is the Tory balance sheet, a record of unrelieved failure. And every company chairman and director who is driven into the bankruptcy court and has to call in the liquidators should send the bill to Saatchi and Saatchi. (Applause) And if anybody wants to ask why we need unity in this movement, it is to ensure that we can reverse that calamitous decline that has taken place since they have been in office. (Applause)Of course I know we got a lot of things wrong. We are not archangels and we never were. Yesterday I heard a delegate advising Conference on how to vote. You may remember him. He came to the rostrum and told us how to vote on all the resolutions, and particularly to beware of the resolution that had been moved by the General and Municipal Workers, seconded by the National Union of Mineworkers, that called for a different strategy. And he asked us to beware of it because he feared the consequences of working out these arrangements between the Party and the trades unions. Beware, he said, or we shall find ourselves in the position we were in before. Friend, there are millions in this country today who would love to be in the position they were in before. (Applause)David Basnett rightly said that the next Labour Government will need to retrieve what he called a crisis situation. And faced with such a situation, we shall need priorities. We must determine those priorities and I have no doubt what they must be.The first priority and our first pledge to our people must be that we shall so organise our affairs that we aim once more at securing a high and stable level of full employment for our peo­ple. That is and must be the top priority. (Applause)Some people have told me that after 16 months of hibernation I have woken up in the last couple of months. (Laughter) Well, I can never get to sleep with that fellow behind me. (Laughter)I tell you what it is. There are fewer of us now. Many of you younger delegates are experiencing for the first time and seeing for the first time what we grew up with in the Thirties, what brought us into the Labour Movement and what, inciden­tally, will mean that we shall die in the Labour Movement and will never leave the Labour Movement. (Applause) However bad a socialist I may be in the eyes, of a great many of our col­leagues, I know why I and many others of my generation were bound to be in the Labour Party. We were determined that the Thirties should not be seen in our lifetime. And as I reach - and draw no conclusions from this - and get near the end of my political life - see what the commen­tators make of that - (Laughter) - but as I see the conditions being repeated once again, the policies being followed once more that we thought we had destroyed forever as the result of the 1930s, I cannot but feel a deep indignation and anger that this generation should be required to go through the things that our generation went through. And I am determined to fight it as hard as I can. (Applause)There are a lot of initiatives that will be needed in this crisis situation that was  referred to by David Basnett and Lawrence Daly - many initiatives, and I cannot outline them all this morning. But this Party has a responsibility for outlining them in detail during the course of the coming week. But more than that, over the next 12 months, in conjunction with the trade union movement, to work out a policy that can be agreed. It must be agreed. I have never seen so much talent as there is burgeoning in the Labour Party at the present time. But you have got to work together. You will not succeed unless you do - all of you. (Applause)But what we need, both urgently and in the longer term, first of all on the international front is joint decisions by the industrial countries to reverse the mistakes they made at Venice, to promote economic growth and employment as the top priority of the world. We need international agreements to stimulate world trade. Tem­porary import controls Moss Evans referred to yesterday - yes, he said temporary: I accept that. I think it is necessary in view of the clamping down on demand that has taken place and the fact that this Government has certainly not done what is necessary to re-stimulate demand. But I emphasise that they cannot be long-term protec­tionist policies. Beggar-my-neighbour policies are no policies for socialists. And I am glad to see that the Transport and General Workers agrees with that. Yes, recycle the huge OPEC oil surp­luses and revenues that they have now got and which they cannot use. They cannot absorb the imports that would ensure the employment in the debtor countries to pay the debts, so they have got to be used in the Third World. And I want to come back to that a little later. Use the North Sea Oil revenues to modernise Britain\u2019s core indus­tries instead of financing unemployment. Lower interest rates and the exchange rates. We must secure an agreement and understanding to keep growth in money incomes, as David Basnett said yesterday, and the growth in productivity in line in order to avoid inflation. That is the purpose of it.We must stimulate more public spending, especially on public and private projects. There are times when public expenditure has got to be controlled. But now is the time to expand it. When Ray Buckton painted the picture yesterday of what is happening to the railway system of our country, how penny-wise pound-foolish can this Government get by keeping down the public sector borrowing requirement to its present level? More resources to the National Enterprise Board at the present time, more money on training and apprenticeships. Stan Orme has pointed out more than once that a whole generation of our young people today are missing the chance of apprenticeships. How can that be replaced? It can be replaced by the Government now. A conservation of energy programme. Those are only some of the things that need immediate attention by the Government. Others are set out in the Liaison Committee\u2019s document.And I say one other thing. Our Party has always been the Party which has used local authority resources as a means of improving the lot of our people in education, in housing and in some aspects of health, trying to build up a decent environment in our cities and our towns. This is a form of practical socialism - municipal social­ism, if you like. But once again we must restore - and we pledge ourselves to restore - to our own local authorities, to our own people who were elected to those authorities, the responsibility for determining how the needs of our people locally are to be met in that direction. (Applause)I would like to move on. The posters around this hall are headed \u2018Peace, Jobs and Freedom.\u2019 And there are no bigger tasks for the world than peace and its security. I would couple with that the relationship between the developing world and the industrialised world. And the world\u2019s leaders must take note of the growing demand for peace throughout the world.During the last 12 months we have seen out­breaks of war and violence in South East Asia and in South West Asia. One war in particular is going on even now. Europe, although it still remains comparatively stable, has seen a heigh­tening of tension. But it is obscene to observe the nations of the world rushing to spend more on armaments, the Western industrialised nations setting a bad example and even the Third World countries following in our footsteps.Overshadowing all this, bad as it is, all these regional disputes, important as they are, in the Middle East, in Latin America, in South West Asia, in Afghanistan, is the dread horror of nuc­lear war, on a scale that would totally transcend the destruction of Hiroshima. The consequences are unimaginable in the destruction of our civil­isation, in lands laid waste and the populations that will be decimated and the survivors deformed.Don\u2019t think that any of us who have had any responsibility for these matters are less caring than those who have not had that direct responsi­bility. I have said before and I repeat again: I do not believe that there is anyone of the generation that fought through the last war, be it Brezhnev, Carter or anyone else, who would release a nuclear weapon. I do not believe it. I have had the advantage of personal talks with all of them. I know the horror. They know the horror. Those of us who are perhaps closest to it know more than anybody else what the consequences could be.But the nature of the problem has changed since that idealistic CND agitation of 20 years ago. Then there were four - at the most five - countries which possessed the nuclear weapon. Now middle-sized industrial countries, even some classed as developing countries, are now possessing themselves of the technology. How do you deal with this? This is one of the two great problems that the world has to face, important for the whole future of mankind.How can Britain\u2019s influence best be used in order to achieve this for all mankind - not just for ourselves but for everybody? There is no one here who would suggest that our policy should just be governed by fear. That is not an argument that I would expect to hear advanced and I do not believe it will be. Fear is a bad counsellor. We want to see not only our own country rid of these weapons but other countries too. And Britain has an important role to play.At the end of last year the situation turned rapidly for the worse by two events. First of all there was the decision of the NATO countries to station Cruise missiles in Europe. That was fol­lowed by the invasion of Afghanistan by the Soviet Union. The consequence of those two actions was that tension became heightened, and I must say I felt more pessimistic than I have felt for a long time. Admittedly the Cruise missiles were to be stationed in Britain and in Germany in three years\u2019 time. But it led the Soviet Union to say, rightly or wrongly - in my view wrongly - that they would not negotiate on a reduction of nuclear weapons in Europe unless this decision by NATO was reversed and therefore three years would elapse and the Cruise missiles would come. I never believed it was right and said so to those who would listen in the Soviet Union. Until NATO had reversed its decision, they said, no negotiations, ignoring the fact that the Soviet Union itself was adding every week one new SS20 with three warheads to its arma­ment, 30 new backfire bombers every year. Well, our own Prime Minister would be one who reacted in the way you would expect. She rattled the sabre, she stepped up the pressure and she called for strong measures. Thank God there were other statesmen in the world who could see the situation a little differently.It was left to Helmut Schmidt, the Chancellor of Germany, a man who had seen war at first hand, to take the initiative on this matter. And by skill and by mediation he has achieved a shift in the Soviet Union\u2019s position that is of profound importance. He went to Moscow, he discussed this matter with Brezhnev last July and he sec­ured, either because Brezhnev was ready to do it or by the force of Schmidt\u2019s own convictions, a change in the Soviet Union\u2019s attitude so that after July Schmidt was told by Brezhnev that he would withdraw that pre-condition. Schmidt then sent Genscher, his Foreign Minister, to Washington to confer with the Americans and President Carter, in the middle of an election. He sent him to see how the United States would respond to the changed Soviet attitude, where the Soviet Union were no longer insisting that Europe should reverse its decision on the Cruise missiles as a precondition to any talks and any negotiations. They have now limited their preconditions to two. One is the ratification of the SALT II agreement, and the second is the desirability of including the forward-based sys­tems in Europe in the negotiations. Both are conditions that should be accepted.President Carter is under great pressure in his own country, fighting art election. Nevertheless, he took a decision for which we should congratu­late and thank him. He took a decision that Mus­kie and Gromyko should meet as they did and he indicated a readiness to initiate and to begin fresh talks. Secretary Muskie and Mr Gromyko met, as you may have read in the newspapers. They cleared the way for new negotiations. Those new negotiations will begin in Geneva on Monday week, on 13 October. These talks are of the greatest significance to the world. They can lead to a new and lower balance between East and West, to limit the arms race in medium range ballistic missile systems in Europe.Some people say to me, \u2018Look, if Britain would give a lead, if only you would take a moral stand on this, you would get a response.\u2019 Com­rades, I know of nothing to justify that assertion. I wish it were true. I would like to think it was true. But look at the record. I recall that shortly after he came to office President Carter renounced the building of the new B1 bomber - one of the most significant weapons that was likely to emerge. Was it followed by any response from the Soviet Union? No. Then we had the proposal to introduce the neutron bomb. That too was dropped. Did it meet with a Soviet response? No.I have recently spoken at length with Chancel­lor Schmidt on these issues. I can only tell you his views, and in my view he is the leading statesman now in Europe on this matter as on so many others. It is his view that not only does the present build-up go far beyond the security needs of the Soviet Union, but that it is the fact that the NATO alliance refusal to reverse its decision to abandon the Cruise missile that has made the Soviet Union come to the conclusion, fearful as they are of the use of this dreadful weapon, that if there is to be serious and mean­ingful negotiation then they must start from the present position. It wasn\u2019t giving up anything that put them in that position. It was because they saw that the Western Alliance\u2019s position was cohesive. That happens to be my view but it is - even more importantly perhaps - the view of the Germans who have at least as deep a concern about this matter as we do. I do not believe that the great Labour Movement is going to say in the face of this, \u2018Stop the world, we want to get off.\u2019 It is surely our task to back to the hilt, seriously, and sincerely, the negotia­tions that will begin on Monday week in Geneva, agreed in the middle of an election campaign by President Carter, and to press our own Prime Minister that she should stop the sabre rattling and join in the effort by others who possess greater insight about these matters than she does. (Applause)Let me repeat our task - the Labour Move­ment\u2019s task. And we have great influence with other parties in Europe and elsewhere. It is not an influence that if we take a view that they think is self-regarding totally that they will follow. They will then say, \u2018What is happening to the British Labour Movement?\u2019 But we have an influence if we put our weight behind these negotiations and if we put our weight behind a search to rid the whole of the peoples of the world of the nuclear weapons, then we have an influence which is out of all proportion to the fact that we are still in opposition. And I beg of you not to weaken the position of anybody in this particular matter. The Germans have as vital an interest - as great or greater an interest - as we have in the growth of this weaponry and there­fore of achieving a new equilibrium at a lower level which itself would lead then to further steps on this path of eventually ridding the world of these dreadful weapons. That is the position of our sister party now fighting an election, and how profoundly all of us must hope that Chancel­lor Schmidt and the SPD win this election in Germany. (Applause)I see that Herr Strauss says that he aims to be the Mrs Thatcher of Germany. Well, we would willingly transfer her at a much lower transfer fee than they paid for Kevin Keegan. (Laughter and applause)But truthfully we cannot wish the German people such harm as that.Let me turn to the other aspect of this prob­lem. The preservation of peace is of vital importance and underlies everything else. But just a word about what is happening with the Third World today. Our movement must take note - and indeed does take note - of the develop­ments that are taking place. The poverty in the world is growing and not diminishing. The Third World is sliding even more deeply into debt because of the oil price increases. World popula­tion - this will affect the younger delegates - is increasing at a faster rate than ever. Four billion people today. By the year 2000, 6.3 billion peo­ple is the best estimate that can be made. Think of the strain that is going to be placed not only on resources, not only on food, not only on energy, but also on the stable political relations that are needed in a world where resources may be get­ting less. Populations of the great cities esti­mated by the year 2000: Cairo, 20 million people; Calcutta, 20-30 million people; Mexico City, 30 million people. Think of the cost. Think of the strain on these developing countries that do not have our infrastructure to build on and ask your­selves what are going to be the political tensions in the world that will arise from that.The problems are beyond the capacity of any one country to solve. There is a need for mutual world interdependence on these issues, not only out of charity - although it fits in with our principles of mutual interdependence. The Brandt Report - another great German - has indicated some steps forward on commodity agreements, access for industrial products, the measures to stimulate economic growth, the relief from indebtedness. We have to put together three things, and we ought to be in the forefront of doing it, as indeed Brandt has taken it up.First, the industrialised world now has vast excess capacity and over 20 million people out of work. Secondly, OPEC has vast oil revenues that they are unable to use and absorb the imports that are represented by those revenues. Thirdly, the Third World has vast needs to relieve poverty and hunger and illiteracy and disease. Surely it is not beyond the wit of man to put those three ideas together and to see how we can work it out. And for socialists it cannot be impossible to achieve that. We do it because it would provide work for the industrialised world. We do it because it would provide the aid and assistance that the developing countries need. We do it because it would ensure that the growing interdependence of the world is recognised. If we had the vision and imagination to do this - and I intend to pledge myself to work for it: I believe it is one of the greatest tasks there is - we should ensure that our growingly vulnerable world has a better chance for new generations.Now let me have one word about constitutional issues. I have offered my own advice and views on this to the Party in my speech at Brecon on July 3 and I need not repeat it now. There\u2019s nothing new about the discussions we have been having. The relationship between the constituency parties and the trade unions, and between the PLP, the National Executive and the Conference, have been discussed on many occasions in the last 75 years. As long ago as 1907 the Conference decided that they would instruct the Parliamen­tary Party to do certain things. Seventy-three years ago - rough lot this Parliamentary Party is, isn\u2019t it? But of course it is experience that has altered the situation, because what experience shows is that policy cannot be laid down. If it is to be successful, it must be agreed, and no amount of constitutional wrangling will produce a solu­tion. A satisfactory relationship between all the elements of the Party and its affiliated bodies such as the trade unions can be achieved subject to one condition, and only one condition. It will be achieved provided that it springs from mutual trust and confidence between the various bodies and personalities. (Applause)The most perfectly devised constitution will not work unless mutual trust is present. And if proposals are conceived because it is believed that some are traitors, that some do not have the will or lack the capacity, if that is the basis of proposals when they are put forward, then they will not be accepted. Now look, we have got to work together. For heaven\u2019s sake, I have emphas­ised this time after time. Proposals that are considered must not be on the basis that you cannot trust some other section of the Party. We are all comrades and we have got to work as comrades and believe in each other\u2019s good faith as com­rades. (Applause)And that mutual confidence is what I want to build up between the federal structure of our Party. It is a federal structure. It is essential. The trade unions and the constituency parties are the principal elements in that structure. They are. Never let it be forgotten, incidentally, that the membership of these two sections largely consists of the same people. But as I see from my vantage point on the National Executive Committee, they are apt to look at their common problems from slightly different angles. So what do we need? We need understanding that the role of each is essen­tial to the health and success of our movement.Hugh Dalton once compared the Labour Movement to a strong, growing tree. Without the trade unions, he said, there would be no roots and no stability, but it is the constituency parties who provide the heavy crop of political fruit. I believe that to be as true now as when he said it 40 years ago. As for the Parliamentary Labour Party, the one thing to which it is bound under the constitu­tion is the election manifesto, because the Par­liamentary Party has to carry it out. They are the people who have to do the job day by day, and that is why, quite simply in one sentence, the Parliamentary Party must be involved and share joint responsibility with the National Executive Committee and why the National Executive Committee in my view - and I say it in all good comradeship - are wrong to try to assume sole responsibility for the preparation of the man­ifesto. (Applause)Having said that, I do not want it to be thought that I believe the constitution is unchangeable or is perfect. It is not. We are an evolving Party. We can change it. But changes have got to be made against a different atmosphere from the present one. We have got to get away from this. For pity\u2019s sake, stop arguing. The public is crying out for unity in order to get rid of the Thatcher Govern­ment. (Applause)Mr Attlee is coming back into favour. He is being quoted by all and sundry. Every time I read an article or hear a speech I hear a quotation from Clem. I must say it only goes to show what hap­pens to us after we are dead. There may be a time when even I shall be cheered by the constituency parties. But in 30 years\u2019 time, not now. I do not ask for it now. (Laughter) But listen to what Clem said, because it is very apposite in my view to the present situation:'Self-criticism is a healthy thing as long as it does not lead to a paralysis of the will. But there is a danger that a party may be so concerned about its own health that it becomes a political valetudinarian incapable of taking an active part in affairs. It may discuss its own internal conditions to such an extent that it disgusts all those with whom it comes in con­tact.' (Applause)Comrades, for the time being we have had enough discussion I think we have all learned lessons from what has happened over the last two or three years. I do not exempt myself from that. I never have done. But I say to you that it is our job this week to look to the future after Thatcherism. We shall need both emergency measures to staunch the bleeding and, a long-term plan. Peo­ple have now seen that Mrs Thatcher\u2019s appeal to self-interest, to private profit, to the free market, is a failure in the modern world. We assert instead that everything depends upon the response which can be drawn from men and women acting for the common good, wherever they work - in indus­try, in local government, in education, in the health services, wherever. As one of the early socialists said - and I want to finish on this theme - we should take to socialism because it is ethi­cally right, otherwise we shall stop short at collectivism.To all of us, to all our colleagues, I say that we must begin with a framework of principle to give unity of purpose and action. The posters on the walls proclaim, \u2018Peace, Jobs and Freedom.\u2019 Let me add two more: \u2018Equality and Fellowship.\u2019 We are discussing all these issues this week. Yes, we believe deeply in freedom. It is as essential as the air we breathe. But we all believe that it is not just freedom as an absence of restraint, but freedom in fellowship, freedom as a positive fulfilment of a man\u2019s or woman\u2019s personality as a member of society.We are all united about this. And what a won­derful team we are when we get together and work together. It far transcends and outshadows anything the Conservatives can put up. But we all believe, everyone of us, that socialism is not just a fixed set of institutions. We are all agreed that it has an ethical basis and an underlying idealism. Sometimes our ideals may seem to conflict. We may conflict with each other. But the ultimate value of our society, to which we must all work, and to which we all want to work, depends on the way we uphold our ideals and - here comes the practical man creeping out - the extent to which those ideas can be applied in practice and realised.Now all my colleagues know that our task is to apply this to the Britain of the Eighties: the workers and the trade unions to seek more control over their lives and the direction of their own industries; women to build on the gains that they have made so far in pursuit of a true partnership and equality; the young in search of a society that will enable them to develop their personalities to the highest level of which they are capable; all of us, whoever we are to rid ourselves of inequality, whether it springs from educational differences, colour and race differences or differences of wealth. As a movement we must guard against becoming a mere agglomeration of sectional interests and pressure groups - many of them worthwhile, many of them utterly worthy in the objectives they seek, but taking only a limited view of society as a whole. Above all we agree, all of us - and this is the unifying factor - that the brotherhood of man was born out of a rejection of the view that a good society can be created from a mass of competing, self-seeking individuals.Comrades, we have won great battles. There is no need for us to be ashamed of what the Labour Movement and Labour Governments have done in recent years. (Applause) Now there are more to win: the battle for industrial regeneration at home, the battle for equality, the battle against world poverty, the battle, above all, for peace. That is our mission for the 1980s. Only the Labour Party can fulfil it. Nobody here, I think, talks any nonsense about centre parties or the rest of it. It\u2019s as dead as a dodo. Mere fluff. (Applause)But you cannot do it divided. You can only do it if you work together. Unite. That is the call for this Conference. Unite. And I call on every one of you to unite to roll back Thatcherism and forward to democratic socialism to save our people and our country. (Applause)

aVChairman and comrades, perhaps you would permit me to start my remarks with one personal recollection. It is 47 years ago that I joined the Labour Party in the city of Liverpool, and just about a year after I joined - or a year and a half - a general election was declared by Mr Stanley Baldwin. I got on the next train from Liverpool to London and I went along to Transport House and I went along to see the then national agent of the party, because I wanted to see whether it was possible to fight in that general election. I said to the national agent: \u2018Have you got any seats left where you haven\u2019t got Labour candidates?\u2019 They showed me the list. The general election was only three weeks off - they did things a bit quicker in those days. (Laughter) They showed me the list. I looked down it carefully and I saw some rather unattractive names, but along with them I saw a reference to the constituency of Monmouth. I said to the national agent: \u2018That\u2019s in Wales, isn\u2019t it?\u2019 (Laughter) I knew that much. I said: \u2018Can\u2019t I go there? Isn\u2019t that a good Labour seat?\u2019 They said: \u2018Well, you know, that\u2019s the country part of Monmouthshire and they\u2019ve also had a bit of a split in the party down there recent­ly. Maybe you can go down and heal it.\u2019 (Laugh­ter) So, you see, I have had quite a lot of practice at the game I am up to. (Applause)I will give you another lesson from the same recollection. The following day we set off on our election campaign, because I went down to Newport that night and was adopted by a properly-organised selection committee, I can assure you. (Laughter) There were only ten people there, but we managed the business very successfully, and we set off the next morning without any loudspeaker, one van and the mes­sage of democratic socialism. We went along to open the campaign with my friend Tom Powell, who was the agent of the Monmouth constituen­cy, and we set up our little stand just by the plinth that some people know in the little town of Usk. There Tom Powell got up to open our cam­paign and he said: \u2018Well, here we are in bloody old Tory Usk.\u2019 That is how he opened our appeal to the people of Monmouth. (Laughter) I learned from him that, even if that is what you feel, there are other ways maybe of successfully saying it. (Laughter) Those two lessons I got from that occasion.Yesterday's debate, I believe, revealed some of these other ways of saying things. Yester­day's debate on economic affairs exposed Gov­ernment policy in the way it ought to be exposed. It showed what we could have been saying and should have been saying effectively and unitedly over the past twelve months. (Applause) Much of it has been said and was said, I underline, by the Labour Opposition in the House of Com­mons, and I reject the charge that the socialist case, the party's case, has not been put there over this period; but we can do it better if we concentrate all our energies on the task. We all know the need to expose this terrible record of crime and folly which mounts every month and day by day. Perhaps it is not properly noticed everywhere that, almost week by week, the col­lapse of the Government\u2019s economic policies causes them to attack our free institutions. They must find scapegoats. So with every economic failure they turn more viciously on the local authorities or the trade unions or the nationalised industries or on the obligation of Parliament itself to provide full employment. I hope to try and illustrate these matters as I pro­ceed.Yesterday showed to the party and to the country, I trust, that we have an alternative strategy, we have an alternative policy. It was presented by Denis Healey, it was replied to by Tony Benn. I fully acknowledge to Tony from this platform the strong part that he has played in the preparation of that alternative strategy and the contribution that he has made to the party. (Applause) I want to see a new Labour Cabinet in which Denis Healey and Tony Benn and a few others - I will mention them too - play leading and honourable parts. I believe it is my duty to try and work for it, and the duty of everybody else. (Applause) Tony said yesterday that he did not want a Cabinet drawn up by the Tory newspap­ers; I fully acknowledge that. I do not know if he would like to see the list I have got. (Laughter) I can show it to him some time. There has been a bit of difficulty about some of these matters from time to time, you know. I have thought occa­sionally of going along to consult my old friend who, I think, is pretty well the best man in the business, Brian Clough. (Laughter) He is pretty good at picking teams, but he has had some difficulties himself recently. I thought at one moment that I might be losing Trevor Francis and John Robertson all in the same season, but I hope we can avoid any such troubles I think that this Conference is going to be a sign to the coun­try that we have.Tony referred yesterday to some of the events that are happening elsewhere this week: black Monday on the Stock Exchange - we do not know whether they have recovered on Tuesday, but there are many places up and down our coun­try that have had black Mondays where they have not had any recovery. (Applause) Black Mondays in Liverpool, black Mondays in Bir­mingham, black Mondays in Manchester, black Mondays in Ebbw Vale, the blackest days we have known in the last 30 or 40 years for our people. This is what we have to face above all other matters. I have only one or two additions to offer to what was said in the debate of this subject yesterday, but I say it in order that we should underline the terrible reality. The whole country knows - ought to know - that the total unemployment is the worst ever recorded. Of course we used to make the comparisons in reg­ions; we still have to do so. Some, like Wales and Scotland and the others, are even harder hit - Merseyside and some of the others - but now we also have to make comparisons in terms of age and sex and colour. The Manpower Services Commission prophesies that - today the figure for long term unemployment is 630,000 out of work for more than a year - and the Manpower Services Commission forecasts more than one million of long-term unemployed under that definition, by the end of 1983. Young people - we had the arguments most passionately and properly put about them in the debate yesterday. The numbers of women unemployed: over the past five years the numbers of women workers without a job have increased twice as fast as the number of jobless men. The figure is up to 900,000 on the register - that means it is well over one million unemployed women in this country today.Every day since the Tories took office, since Mrs Thatcher became prime minister, for every day since then 750 women have been added to the dole queue - every day. As to what has been happening in the figures for coloured workers, the unemployment figures are equally appalling. Unemployment totals, if they continue along this scale for any period, are going to drive deep fissures into our society. What happened in Moss Side, Liverpool and the rest is what we in the Labour party are dedicated to stop, but when I went to Liverpool and walked through the streets of Liverpool to see it with my own eyes, it is a monument to Thatcherism and to our failure in allowing Thatcherism ever to have occurred. (Applause) They tell us it is not their fault. It is all the fault of the world recession and Britain's chronic inefficiency. Well, that is a lie. But even if it were the truth, it is no exoneration. They could still act to reverse the decline. They tell us that they cannot, and that means they will not.The immediate alternative to this unparallel­ed disaster is clear. The Government can step in to get people working again. There is an enorm­ous amount of work which our battered country needs and there are vast armies of people waiting to do it. What is missing is the money which will enable those people to be paid to do the work. It is this which the Tories have set their face against. They will restrict credit; they will not extend it to the private sector or the Govern­ment. Yet it is the expansion of credit which enabled this and every other industrial country in the world to escape from peasant economies. They say that the funds available to finance gov­ernment expansion or industrial expansion do not exist. They apply this principle, for example, to the gas-gathering pipeline in the North Sea. Here is something which would be of enormous benefit to the economy by harnessing North Sea gas cheaply and effectively, but to say that you are going to leave it, as the Government does, to the individual operators, is like telling people that they must each be responsible for building the piece of road outside their own front door. (Applause) The Government is in a unique posi­tion to organise the project, but the Tory obsession about finance, and about public-sector finance in particular, blinds them to such oppor­tunities. If they are so concerned about the short­age of money, why are they encouraging so much money to leave this country by the removal of exchange controls? (Applause) Port­folio and other direct investment is now leaving the country at a rate of £6 billion a year, enough to finance a 50 per cent increase in Government borrowing.Or turn to another project which illustrates the whole abject hopelessness of this Government for our people. President Mitterrand paid a visit to London a few weeks ago. I am sure you would wish me to say from this platform how we send from this great Conference to him and to the socialist party in France every godspeed and good wish for the success of that government. (Applause) There are many issues on which we may have differences and arguments and discus­sions. I promise you we will arrange the meet­ings to do so, but I assure you that we will do everything possible from our party's point of view in the interests of our party and in the interests of theirs and in the interests of Euro­pean socialism as a whole to conduct those discussions in the friendliest and proper comradely spirit. But I was referring to the visit of President Mitterrand to Downing Street.Falling momentarily under the influence of President Mitterrand, Mrs Thatcher agreed to go ahead with the Channel tunnel. Considering the number of jobs and the kind of jobs - steel and all the rest - the idea is certainly to be wel­comed, but we must put to Mrs Thatcher the question she keeps putting so fatuously to us and the nation and, presumably, to her hand-picked, thick-skulled Cabinet: \u2018Where is the money to come from?' Where is the money to come from for the Channel tunnel?\u2019 Is she to print it? No, that would be wicked; she cannot do that. Is she to borrow it? No, that is wicked too. According to her theory, you cannot get it that way. So is she to raise it by more taxes? Of course that is more feasible? Contrary to her election pledges, she happens to have raised taxes in this country higher than ever before in British history. (Applause) As far as I know, she is not proposing to raise the money from extra taxes. So is she to raise the money by cutting somewhere else? That would not help very much either, because wherever she cut, she would be cutting jobs, probably, and not increasing them. So on her theory, which she has told the country and preached to the country with such tireless reiteration, she cannot carry out the promise that she made to President Mitterrand.I suggest she goes along and has another talk with President Mitterrand and ask him where he is going to get the money. He will tell her, I am sure. He will tell her in the best French and then translate it for her. (Laughter) He will say he is going to borrow it. And because he is a persuasive kind of chap, you know, he may add: \u2018Of course it always helps, you know, if you are able to give orders to the bankers instead of taking orders from the bankers.\u2019 (Applause) Of course the money can be borrowed; that is how every such great project in our economic history has been advanced.And if it is sense to build the Channel tunnel that way - or the French tunnel, as some of them may call it - why is it also not sense for the reconstruction of our inner cities, for the improvement of our homes, for the rebuilding of all our shattered industries after another? That is the task on which we have to embark. I am most grateful to President Mitterrand for his visit and for having illustrated this simple matter so well.Let me turn, however, to what happened after he had left, because President Mitterrand\u2019s visit gave us only a temporary respite from the monetarist lunacy. Within a few days she and her Cabinet were back in the old asylum - I will not go through the whole story, there was a very good debate on the subject yesterday, but they are working on the principle that during the next period of Parliament they will introduce an even more ferocious attack on what local authorities are seeking to do to protect our people and an even more ferocious attack on the money they need for the job and also on their rights as demo­cratically elected bodies. I can tell you that some of the most agonising discussions we have had on the National Executive throughout this period are precisely those in which we have seen how our local authorities up and down the coun­try have been driven into the most appalling dilemmas on the subject.My sympathies are on both sides of the ques­tion, I tell you, because I can see how fierce is the argument, how difficult is the problem for those elected on intelligent programmes of community and socialist action, and then finding themselves thwarted by this Government intervention. We must do our best to mobilise all our resources against them, but I say to you one thing in particular, and I hope this will be prop­erly understood, because the latest proposal the Government is making to deal with this situa­tion, as far as I can see, is that there should be a so-called referendum.If, in certain circumstances, the local author­ity wants to go ahead to raise rates - if neces­sary to carry out pledges that they may have made or to protect elementary services in their area - the Government is saying that they are going to have some enforced referendum to decide whether the public supports it or not. You know, there have been referendums - I am not talking about any in this country - elsewhere; the kind of referendum they are talking about sound very much like the kind of plebiscite they used to have in some fascist states - very much like them. Because of course the proposition that would be put to the ratepayers and the peo­ple in different parts of the country under these proposals would be a scandalous proposal. It would not be one that bore any genuine relation to democracy at all. So I say in advance - I have not got the full agreement of either the Shadow Cabinet or the National Executive to this proposal, but it must not deter me - that if they go ahead with any such idea of enforced referen­dum from the central Government on local authorities, the Labour party will boycott. We will have nothing to do with it. (Applause) The boycott will expose the grisly farce of the whole business.All right, if they say that is undemocratic - they have no case for doing so - I will offer them another offer. We will let them have a referendum in one or two places, if they like, on local rates, if we have a referendum on their next Budget. (Applause) If they let us have that one - or on the last one, if they think it was such a good one - they can take their choice, but that is a fair, democratic offer, otherwise I tell them here and now that we will have nothing what­soever to do with such a gross invasion of the rights of local authorities in this country. (Applause) I would wish, if I had time, chairman, to speak also about their grotesque attacks on the public sector, the nationalised industries. There are many such topics on which I would wish to speak, but I do not wish to proceed too long on this occasion. We will have many such opportunities to present them, but I underline afresh that in my judgment what we are living through - it accords very much with what was said in the debates yesterday - is not merely an attack upon our economy, we are living through the most serious attack on our democratic institutions which we have seen for generations. We must mobilise all our strength and intelli­gence and unity in order to resist it.Let me say a few words on some of the topics which seem to have aroused some interest in other parts over these last few months. There was an election for the deputy leader. There was also, as was kindly noticed, a non-election for the leader. (Laughter) I have never been very good at arithmetic, but I have to tell you that my majority was slightly larger than Denis Healey\u2019s. (Laughter) Anyhow, on that reckoning I have every right, I think, to say what I think on the subject. Even if I did not have the right, I would probably still say it. (Laughter) I think we have to acknowledge what has happened and then see how we can make it more effective. I have not the slightest doubt about the decision of this Conference to have an electoral college for the election of the leader and the deputy leader on suitable occasions - occasions that are suitable for the party as well as everybody else I think that on that basis, of course, I am sure it is right that we should accept and acknowledge the whole arrangement to have an electoral college. (Applause)But I do think - and I do not think anyone will dispute it; indeed the chairman at the beginning of his remarks at the beginning of our discus­sions underlined this too - we have to look at the way in which it works. I do think we have got to see how we can improve it. I think we have to look at many of the provisions that were made for the way in which Members of Parliament vote, and others; I think these matters have all got to be examined, but I think we should accept the principle and then see how we can translate it into better effect.Tony, if I can also comment on a remark he made yesterday - and this is in one sense the central question that I am elected as leader of the party to try to solve, that is the balance between the Party Conference and the Parliamentary Par­ty. This is not a new question; it is one that has prevailed in discussion about how the balance should be operated and how it should be con­ducted, right from the very first time when Keir Hardie became the first leader of this party. I accept what Tony said yesterday on this subject; if we can translate that into effect, I accept part­ners - that is what it has got to be. The partner­ship has got to be one in which the Parliamentary Party does not presume the right to dictate to the Party Conference, and the Party Conference does not presume the right to dictate to the Par­liamentary Party. (Applause) They have both got to do it, and in doing it we have to show a spirit of tolerance. I accept what Tony said too. Tony said - and I quote his words, and I lis­tened, as they were addressed especially, I think in a sense to me - He said about the Parliamen­tary Party that he wanted to have: \u2018a better internal democracy so that he is never again told he is there being a \u201cdog licence issued by a prime minister\u201d\u2019...Or, I presume, a leader of the party. I give Tony and everybody else concerned this abso­lute undertaking here and now that no such dog licences for Members of Parliament will be issued by me. Indeed, I can recall the first occa­sion when that was said, because I was in the party meeting when it happened. It was said by Harold Wilson. I occupied a place on the back benches and I protested against that statement then. I have protested against the idea behind it ever since, and will go on protesting against it to my dying day. No dog licences for Members of Parliament. Their right to exercise their own judgment on these matters, their own consci­ence, their own political knowledge and experi­ence - that must be part of our democracy too. I believe that I have a special duty to try and protect that right of free judgment of Members of Parliament because I would not be here if that had not prevailed. (Applause) That applies not merely to me, but it applies, I believe, to the whole range of those who have been elected to office inside the Labour Party, and I believe we can restore that principle. It is not only a question of intimidation suggested by prime ministers or leaders of the party: intimidation can come from other places, too. What we want to see is a proper tolerance established and sustained throughout the party as a whole. (Applause)I would wish, if I had time, to discuss some other matters too. I would like to tell you all the secrets of what happened in the last Labour Cabinet. (Laughter) I have read about them everywhere else. (Laughter) I have my own point of view. You know it is not the case, but I will only do this very briefly now because there is something much more important still that I wish to speak about. It is not a question, usually in Labour Cabinets, of an argument between right and wrong, a clear case and a bad case. Very rarely - I do not say it never happens, but it is very rare. That\u2019s not the way the place works - it is usually one Cabinet Minister who has a very strong view for one reason and may indeed come to the Cabinet meeting equipped with the party manifesto commitment on the matter, and another Cabinet Minister who will also come to the same meeting also equipped with a party manifesto, or even a Conference resolution, because it is not the case that all Conference resolutions throughout the whole history of the Labour party have always been consistent. It is not the case. So there is an argument, and they are very important argu­ments. I do not say that we have never had some bad eggs; of course we have, but the overwhelm­ing majority of those I have seen - I have not been in quite as many Labour Cabinets as Tony has, but I have been in one or two (Applause) - but I say the overwhelming majority of those who come to those Cabinet meetings, according to my experience, are coming there to try to give their contribution for getting the best solution to the problem. That applies to previous Cabinets and, indeed I am sure it will apply to future ones. It is all part, you know, of what Tony argues. Here I fully accept what he says about the abso­lute necessity that we should make our position credible. Of course that is right. We have at this Conference been adding up a whole list of items which we are going to present to the nation: health, education, employment, our great indus­tries that have got to be repaired, our housing policy and the rest. It is going to be a huge total, and quite right, because the pressures come from every quarter of our movement and they explode in Conferences such as this with all the passion and feeling that we have seen at this Conference too.But we have to persuade the nation that we are capable of discriminating between the things we can do first, the things to which we give the highest priority. That is what Aneurin Bevan meant when he talked about the language of priorities being the religion of socialism. We have to choose. You have to choose all the time. Mendes-France says \u2018to govern is to choose\u2019; of course that is correct. But we have to make a lot of the choices now, and one of the choices I say that we have got a long way to go on is to make a better agreement with the trade unions than we have ever had before. Certainly none of the things that we talk of can become credible in any sense unless we have that undertaking and understand­ing with the trade unions. The national economic assessment which we have written into our document, unanimously accepted by the TUC and by this Conference. That assessment, I believe, can be translated into practical action. I hope that before every budget we are going to have the most detailed examination and discus­sions with the trade unions to ensure that we carry out not merely their will, because we shall be representing in Parliament a wider franchise still, but in those discussions we will be translat­ing into action the reality of what we have dis­cussed here. I believe that on that basis we are also going greatly to improve our chances of victory. Indeed there is no other party in the country that can talk on these matters in the way and in the sense of comradeship that we speak with the trade union movement. (Applause) It is the source of the foundation of our movement and it is our great strength here at this Confer­ence, and it will be our great strength to the end of the century and beyond.I will take a few more minutes, if you will permit me, because there is another subject even more important than anything else that we have been discussing. We shall be discussing it again tomorrow in the Conference, but I wish to put my views on the subject to you, the greatest question of all: how to live in peace? How we are to use the influence of the Labour Party, even before we get power, to stop the nuclear arms race. (Applause) Is mankind capable of the imagination and exertion necessary to stop that race, to put it into reverse and to substitute for it a determined, sustained attempt to negotiate our way back to sanity and to safety? This is the supreme question, and we may be at the most critical moment of choice. If this immediate opportunity is lost - by that I mean the discus­sions that have started between Mr Gromyko and Mr Haig from the United States and later of the so-called theatre nuclear weapons in Europe - we may never have another one of equal potentiality. Certainly no one can say with any assurance: \u2018Don\u2019t worry. We will wait. We\u2019ll have a few more years of nuclear rearmament and see what it looks like then.\u2019 I must say that, following my visit to Moscow with Denis and a few others from our party in the House of Com­mons, I do not believe - I repeat what I said when I came back - that anyone who attended those meetings we attended could have come away with a different impression from the one I had. Of course the Soviet leaders want to negotiate. They are ready for it, they are eager for it. Indeed they give every impression that the necessity has now become desperately urgent. If they do speak of the matter in desperation, who can say they are wrong?But what about the others? What about the Americans, the United States government? It is not anti-American, it is no more than a plain statement of fact, that the United States gov­ernment, or some powerful sections of it, have not shown much readiness or eagerness. I give you one quotation:The political problems in Washington are also far from resolved. There\u2019re people in the administration who are profoundly sceptical and who have the power to delay and compli­cate the whole process.Now I have said that, I have no doubt I would be accused of being a Soviet spy, or something of the sort, but those are the words that were printed in The Times on the day that Denis and I returned from Moscow. It was partly at least pressure from some of the United States allies, from many of our socialist allies in Europe, the Western German Government amongst them - it was partly pressure from them that finally persuaded President Reagan to agree on the talks.I understand that there are some in the Foreign Office who take a different view - our own Foreign Office. What have we got to say about them? On the very day that we arrived, before we had even given a report of what we had seen or the talks we had had, they put up some over-ambitious underling in the Foreign Office to say that we had been deceived by the Russians, and to pour cold water on anything that we suggested. It was a very strange out­burst, because, according to the Western case - there is something in it - one of the most serious things that has happened in the arms race over recent years is the stationing of the SS-20s on the other side of Europe in the Soviet Union. Many people in the West have claimed that it is that stationing that has upset the balance. The Russians deny that, but that is part of the argument. They say they were merely rectifying a previous disbalance; of course that is the way the arms race goes.But what we brought back from the Soviet Union - on some other matters too, but more clearly expressed than ever before on this ques­tion - was that the Soviet leaders were saying to us - (they said it to us quite emphatically after we had gone through it in very careful detail): \u2018Yes, we are prepared to reduce the numbers of SS-20s.\u2019 If you are to get to what we want - that is to get them all abolished - of course that is one of the ways in which you have to proceed.But the Foreign Office came out in their denunciation of what we had said with a most extraordinary tale. They said \u2018ah, all this was offered by the Russians and the Soviet leaders way back before December 1979; you have been deceived.\u2019 Well, its very interest­ing, isn\u2019t it? Before December 1979 was before the invasion of Afghanistan, before the decision in the West to go ahead with cruise missiles and the Pershings and the rest, and the Foreign Office says to us that they were offered then a reduction in the SS-20s. Remember that there were many fewer SS-20s at that time, maybe some 50, 60 or 70; there are many more now. If we are ever blown to pieces in these islands, it may be by the SS-20s that it is done, although we shall never probably know if it happens. So you would think that, even in the Foreign Office, they would be interested in the numbers of SS-20s, wouldn\u2019t you, instead of trying to pour cold water on the whole effort that we were seeking to achieve? I wish I had time to elaborate what I believe is the highly dangerous course which the United States government has taken on so many of these questions, particularly in Latin America and El Salvador and the rest. (Applause)Our Government on the great arms question - and so many other things - seems to trail along behind without having any influence whatsoever. We are not prepared in the Labour Party to proceed along those lines at all. I know tomorrow there are the discussions and debates here - very important debates - on the resolutions and the party\u2019s statement on this subject, carrying the proposals, on nuclear disarmament a good deal further. Such proposals command all my sympathy and support. (Applause)But I say also, I am also interested, as every sane man and woman on the face of the planet must be interested, in the possibilities of negotia­tions here and now. I think there could be a chance of getting some agreement between the super powers. I think from what I heard in Moscow that they understand the impossibility of seeking nuclear superiority. I think they also understand the outrage of any ideas of so-called limited nuclear war in Europe. I think there certainly could be an agreement stopping the development of the neutron bomb. I think there could also be considerable advance towards all the ideas of nuclear-free zones. If we could get breakthroughs in the next year or so on some of these questions, the whole prospect for mankind could be altered. Do not let anybody tell me, as some attempt to do, that these are just the ravings of an old nuclear disarmer like myself. Nothing that I have seen persuades me that the CND campaign was wrong; indeed I think it was right. (Applause) There are many moving in our direction along some of these other lines that I have been suggesting too, and there can be a very important convergence between them.I would like in a minute or so to read to you - I apologise for its slight length, but these, as I say, are the most important questions the world has ever had to discuss. I underline that the declara­tion I will read in a moment is that which was passed at the Socialist International in Paris a few days ago. I underline that this declaration represents the views of socialist parties inside NATO and outside NATO, socialist parties in the Common Market and out of the Common Market, so do not let people tell us that if we come out of the Common Market, we cannot have international action with our friends - of course we can. (Applause) Indeed, I think the declaration that I read to you now is one that commands a growing, wide support amongst all democratic socialists in Western Europe. There are still many differences and shades of difference, but if you look at the advance that has been achieved over the past year or so, then I think we can have real hope for the future. This is what they said:'In Europe the objective should be effective reductions and eventual elimination of theatre nuclear forces on both sides. The Socialist International regards as encouraging the resumption of talks between the United States and the Soviet Union, as repeatedly urged by the Socialist International. The negotiations should be resumed without further delay and with a political will to succeed not later than 1983.While opposing the introduction of all new theatre forces in Europe on both sides, the Socialist International also rejects the man­ufacture and deployment of the neutron bomb. In order to provide the negotiations with a constructive starting point, the parties should make an interim agreement on the qual­itative and quantitative restrictions at a level preferably lower than the present one.The parties should not undertake any action anywhere in whatever form which might endanger the outcome of those negotia­tions.'They go on to say further:'The Socialist International welcomes the continuing endeavours aiming at the creation of nuclear free zones, particularly in the Pacific area and in Northern Europe, and regards the already existing nuclear free zone in Latin America as positive example.'I hope to live to see the day when we in this country are part of a nuclear free zone. (Applause)Let me just say, if I may, one further word in conclusion. When I returned, one of those Tory newspapers referred to me, and they referred to Gulliver\u2019s Travels. They made a bit of a mistake there, because I know more about Gulliver\u2019s Travels than the Foreign Office. (Laughter) I can tell you what happened. Gulliver, as far as we know, when he came back from his travels, lived happily ever after for quite a long time, as I propose to do. He also came back very much wiser, indeed probably one of the wisest men who ever put pen to paper, because if you read Gulliver\u2019s Travels properly, you will see it has some most extraordinary things. He came back from his travels in a flaming state of anger, such as I am in now, about what he had seen of the infamies being done in the world. In one sense he saw those infamies expressed in imperialism, one nation trying to subdue another nation, but even beyond that he saw it in terms of war and the infamies of war itself. And you know, wonder of wonders, he also described how the brilliant scientists of those days or the generals of those days, getting together in some military, industrial complex, invented a weapon. A weapon of such power and strength and absurdity that it could only be used by the nation that invented it at the price of their total destruction.It is all in Gulliver\u2019s Travels. We should see that every member of the Foreign Office gets a copy. (Applause) We should see that we are not deterred by anything from the greatest crusade that our Labour movement ever set its hand to. The world is crying out for peace as it has never cried before. I tell you - I hope I am not boast­ing - that I am a peacemonger, an inveterate, incurable peacemonger. (Applause) I ask the support of this whole movement to translate that into action. (Applause)
p234
aVI think the scene which we have just witnessed a few minutes ago must have the effect of making us all feel proud and humble at the same time, and I believe all of us can draw inspiration from what they have said to us.  I take some special encouragement from the political scene.  If my arithmetic is correct \u2013 it usually is except when I rely on advice from Denis Healey \u2013 I have got about 17 years to go before I reach Mrs Coombe\u2019s standards of withdrawal.  (Applause)I know that some latitude is often allowed to those who make the parliamentary report, and I would like to draw upon that tradition, if I may, in order to be able to say something to the party which I hope can be of benefit to us all and help us in the outward struggle that all of us wish to engage in, over these weeks and months ahead in order, to save this country.  So I must start by looking at the scale of the human and industrial tragedy which has befallen our country over recent years.Sometimes the scale of that tragedy is underestimated; sometimes there is an attempt by our opponents to conceal it.  But it is necessary that we should strip aside all the disguises, and tell the country the full truth about it.  Last year the unemployment figures went up by something like 350,000 \u2013 45,000 in the past month.  They go steadily and remorselessly upwards.  Sometimes our politic opponents tell us mendaciously that this is something not so very different from what happened under the Labour government.  But, even so, they were much higher than anyone would have judged to be proper in a civilised society.But something far worse than that has been happening in recent years.  During the period of the Labour government, despite the fact that the unemployment went up, the jobs went up too.  And, curiously, there were more jobs available in 1979 when we left office than ere were when we came in in 1974.  Nothing like that is happening now.  Job destruction has happened on a scale that we have never seen before in our history, and it is happening on a scale which has not been seen in almost any other country of the world.  I am not disguising for a moment the scale of the world economic crisis \u2013 and I will have, of course, something to say about that too \u2013 but the excuses that are made by Mrs Thatcher for what has happened are ones that cannot bear a moment\u2019s examination.She tells us en that similar increases are happening in other countries, and that we can take comfort from the fact that \u2013 in this same period when our unemployment has gone up over 350,000 or so \u2013 it has gone up half a million in West Germany, two million in America and that it has increased in many other parts of the world as well.  And, of course, there is some likeness.  Reaganism is like Thatcherism, and the other way round.  But what she does not seem to appreciate is that both of them cannot be defended, and the combination of the two together is what threatens the world on a scale that we have not known for generations.There is, indeed, an eerie likeness in reading the comments of some of the people in the United States about how their policy is now developing, as if they are surprised about it.  They are following the same tragic policies that she initiated here, and they are having the same tragic results \u2013 although the consequences will be even wider because of the greater economic power and influence of the United States itself.  But to read the people commenting on what is happening in the United States at the moment is almost like seeing an old television programme on the big screen: you cannot understand why the actors do not realise how the story is going to turn out in the end.Thatcherism, Reaganism or monetarism \u2013 whatever you like to call it \u2013 is threatening our world on a scale that we have not known for generations, and in some respects the threat to the world economy is even worse than what we experienced in the Thirties.  This is the seriousness of the situation.Sometimes, true, we disguise from ourselves what may be the consequences of it.  We can see in our own country how Thatcherism and her policies hit the weakest of all, but what is happening on the world scene is even more serious.  Thatcherism, Reaganism, monetarism, the policies of parts of the Western World (I will come to some of those who are seeking to fight against it in a moment) \u2013 are hitting the poorest people in the world, the people from the developing world.  The poorest people in the world are suffering from these Thatcherite policies applied across the world.  And we in the Labour Party must never forget what they are doing, and must always seek to put the argument on that same world scale.But do not let us imagine that in any way absolves the Tories from what they are doing.  What they are doing is to intensify the world crisis that was already prevailing on such a scale.  Indeed, you might say, in one sense, that what we are suffering from now is not so much the slump as the Tory means of recovery from a slump.  And the means that they are applying are intensifying that crisis on a scale that has not been seen for generations.But do not let anybody disguise the fact from us, or seek to conceal it, that here in Britain \u2013 despite our interest in the worldwide international crisis and its scale \u2013 people have suffered even more, and our industrial collapse has been an even bigger collapse.  Since 1979 Britain has lost 9 per cent of its jobs.  Only Spain comes anywhere near, with 6 per cent.  All other industrial countries, except Germany and France, have had increases in jobs over that period, and the loss of those two countries has been less than 1 per cent.  This trend has continued unabated in the latest figures: in the last year for which such estimates are available, Britain continued to lose 3 per cent of its jobs; Spain 2 per cent; Germany and Canada 1 ½ per cent; Italy, France and Sweden 1 per cent; and the United States and Norway 0.5 per cent.  So that though job destruction is massive in many other parts of the world in world slump terms, here it is on a bigger and more massive scale than anything we have seen in this century.And it is not only the jobs that are destroyed in individual places and for the individuals concerned: one industry after another has been misapplied on a scale which almost passes comprehension.For much of the period of the postwar world, as we know \u2013 those who were in the previous governments know \u2013 one of the biggest constraints we have had on expanding our economy has been that of the balance of payments itself, and the fact that we were not able to carry through the policies of expansion that we wanted, because of the deficit.  The oil should have saved us from all that.  But instead this government has squandered the oil.  Instead of using it for the purpose of industrial investment, for providing for the future, for transforming our industrial structure \u2013 they have used it solely to pay for mass unemployment and to conceal for a short period the appalling injuries that they have inflicted on this country.  (Applause)Some of you may remember the famous remark that Aneurin Bevan made at the end of the war; he said that in a country made of coal and surrounded by fish, it took an organising genius to produce a shortage of both at the same time.  This Thatcher government has outdone all the Tory predecessors in the massacre of national assets, and it has taken the genius of Thatcherite economics to ensure that the one western economy self-sufficient in energy has been transformed into the worse industrial wasteland in postwar history\u2026 (Applause)What are they going to do about our oil industry now?  It is barely credible, but when they come back and we meet in parliament \u2013 of course, we will resist it with all our strength \u2013 the next proposition that they have on the agenda for us and the country is that we should sell off our oil to their friends, or maybe even to the country\u2019s enemies \u2013 because nobody knows exactly where it is going to be sold.  (Applause) We will do everything in our power to resist that gross betrayal of the rights of the nation. Or steel.  I agree with the resolution that is on the order paper for this conference, and I understand the shiver of anxiety which is now going through the great steel areas of our country about another great blow to be inflicted on that industry.  I know it because of the part of the world where I came from; but I went up to the North East the other day and, of course, they are shivering with anxiety too that a further blow on top of everything that has happened to steel is going to be inflicted upon them.The Tories do not seem to need a steel industry, but we in the Labour Party and in the next Labour government \u2013 we will need a steel industry, so we must fight to protect it now and to protect the jobs there now.  (Applause) You will never be able to build full employment in Britain, as we are pledged to do, on 12, 11, 10 million tonnes of steel.  We have got to get back to the targets that we had before us a few years ago.  We will need 20 or 25 million tonnes of steel in order to build real full employment in this country. (Applause) We must stop the wreckage of the steel industry now, not only in the interests of the steel workers and all those associated with them, but in the interest of the whole nation.One of the very first tasks which the last Labour government undertook was to establish and introduce and finance and back the Plan for Coal.  It looks as though that is one of the very first tasks we will have to do as a Labour government when we come in again; and certainly we will carry through the Plan for Coal \u2013 bring it up to date, and ensure that we protect one of the most essential sinews of the future industrial strength of this country.But look at how they have wrecked one industry after another.  Look how they have been prepared to accept mass unemployment on a scale we have not known since the war and, indeed, perhaps since before the war.  You would think that that was sufficient; you would think that these were the problems to which they might be applying their minds in the cabinet.  Not at all.  If the reports about their so-called Think Tank are correct, they have chastised us with whips, and all they have done at the recent cabinet meetings is to prepare the scorpions.  What they are proposing to do now, it seems, is \u2013 even to consider it at such a moment as this is an outrage against human decency \u2013 to dismantle the higher educational system of this country at the very moment when the country is going to be crying out for more skill and more brains over the next 10 or 20 years.  (Applause) What they have been considering is the destruction of the system, dropping even the pretence \u2013 because we know that they have already injured it \u2013 of trying to sustain social security provision to keep pace with inflation.We know that they have done everything in their power over the past two or three years to undermine those principles applying to a whole range of members of the public.  But now what they are doing is a larger scheme to dismantle the social security system itself.  And further and beyond that, what they are apparently considering is the dismantlement of the health service itself, and the destruction of the essential socialist principles on which that health service was founded.  Well, we will fight them on all those matters with every power \u2013 in parliament, out of parliament, and everywhere else.  (Applause)I congratulate all those who organised and participated in the day of action on September 22.  I agree with everything that was said in the debate which opened this great conference on Monday on the subject, and I certainly believe that what happened then can be an example and an inspiration to us all.  But what we have to do in that field \u2013 the name of it is low pay.  That is what we have to deal with, and we have got to have a  policy, not only for tackling this government on it, but of ensuring that, when we get the next Labour government, we deal with that problem in perhaps a more ambitious way than we have ever done before.  (Applause)I am not saying that in any derogation of what we attempted before, because I know what we did attempt.  I know that one of the first things we did in 1974 was to proceed with the trade union minimum which we had discussed with the TUC beforehand.  It was some mitigation of the situation; it was a move in the right direction.  But I know also what happened later and the misunderstandings that arose.  I know also of the discussions \u2013 because I participated in them all \u2013 which took place right at the end, and involved the establishment of the Trade Commission and the other comparability studies that were prepared then.  I believe that, if that policy had been followed, this strike need never have occurred and, indeed, the whole of the health service would have been in much better shape on that account.But I am not merely saying that we should revive the Clegg procedure or something comparable to it; I am not merely saying that we should proceed on these lines.  As I have said, in the field of low pay alone, I believe that we have got to use that as the way in which we design a whole new policy for ensuring that we shall avoid such industrial disputes when we have the next Labour government, by seeing before hand how we can provide the means of fair treatment for the lowest paid and a real low pay policy.  I know the TUC passed a resolution on this subject a few weeks ago; I think we should follow that up \u2013 I believe these matters should, of course, be devised in full consultation with the trade unions.And that is the great difference between us and the other parties in the state.  We are the only party that can shape an economic policy for the nation in association with the trade unions.  We are the only party that understands that that is absolutely essential; in that sense, we are the only party that can recruit the genuine democratic forces of the nation to enable us to escape from this catastrophic slump in which we are caught.The idea peddled by some \u2013 that somehow or other the British people can escape from such a crisis as this when the whole of the trade union movement has had the door slammed in their faces and there is no discussion with about how we should deal with the crisis \u2013 such nonsense is barely credible, particularly after the experience of the last 30 or 40 years.  Well, we in the Labour Party and in the labour movement as a whole must draw the moral more closely than ever; right from the very first day we must have the closest possible co-operation with the unions.  Indeed, the more we can prepare those plans in advance, the better we are likely to be able to put them into operation on the first day.  Indeed, many, most, all the policies on these economic matters presented to conference have been devised by those methods, by those means and by those discussions, and thereby offer the possibility of success.In this context, when I say that we are the only party in the state that can offer this to the nation, I should make some passing reference to the other parties.  I notice that Mr Roy Jenkins a few days ago, having dealt with the momentous questions of proportional representation and the disposition of seats in the Alliance, has now been kind enough to indicate that he is prepared to give his mind to the affairs of the nation.  It is very gracious of him, is it not?  I think it is very gracious of him to make such a splendid gesture.  But I have to inform you \u2013 and I will do it quite quietly, because I do not want to cause too much offence \u2013 that in these discussions (I have looked at them fairly closely), he has been diddled by David!  If you want to find the list of seats that the SDP is not going to win at the next election, Bill Rodgers has got it \u2013 he\u2019s been handed it.  And if we do our job properly there will not be enough SDP members in the next parliament for them to be able to have a three-way split when we carry through the repeal of the Tebbit legislation.  (Applause)Of course, we have still got other matters to settle between ourselves and the trade unions.  I have followed with the utmost care the discussions and debates that took place at the TUC on this subject and on the national economic assessment, about which we have agreed.  We have had lengthy discussions about them, and we recognise the importance for the trade union movement and for the future Labour government in having those understandings and, indeed, in building on them and making them even clearer and more ambitious than they are.  That does not mean that a national economic assessment is a codename for an incomes policy \u2013 because it is not.  I am opposed to any statutory incomes policy.  Indeed, in the last Labour government I was one of the people who played a prominent part in abolishing the Heath statutory policy.  And I do not think that any such policy would ever work.  But I do say this too, and I say it especially because I heard the speech of the spokesman for the National Union of Mineworkers at the conference at the TUC when he referred to these questions.  He talked as if all the arrangements made under the social contract were not any use to anybody in the unions.  I tell you \u2013 and I do not think any miner will deny it \u2013 that pretty well the two best settlements that the miners had in this last 30 years were the two settlements made under the social contract.I was associated in all the discussions with the miners in the first two or three days when we were seeking to get the strike called off.  We had to have a proper settlement to do that.  We had to bring pressure on the Coal Board in order to achieve it.  What the miners stood out for then, even after we had won the election (and I think they were quite right to do it), was a demand which at first the Coal Board were not prepared to accept, but which we were prepared to back.  The miners were demanding that the surface workers should get a decent deal, as well as the people at the face, and that the proportion between the two should be altered.  And it was altered.  It is a kind of primitive incomes policy if you like to call it that.  You can call it anything you like; but it is a way of trying to ensure \u2013 and individual unions can seek to do it and they can do it in their bargaining.  Indeed, if we are going to carry out what I talked about before, and what is in many of the resolutions about low pay, then we shall have to have policies that cover a much wider field.I believe that that is well understood by everyone who has participated in these matters before, that we are determined that when we get that new Labour Government that we shall carry out our pledge to get the unemployment figure down to less than a million in five years.  It is a huge commitment that is going to take tremendous energy, application and determination.  There is no possibility of that happening if we have got a Labour government that is quarrelling with the TUC \u2013 not the slightest chance of that happening.  (Applause) So we have got to get it together; we are the only party in the country that can offer that road of salvation for our people.But we have got to do it in the wider context too, we have got to do it in the international context.  It I sour plain duty as socialists to think in those terms, but it is also in our economic interest.  Because if anybody imagines that we can carry out our commitment to get the unemployment total down to a million in those five years in the context of an international economic blizzard without trying to stop that blizzard, that of course is nonsense.  So we have got to have an international economic policy too, a policy to deal with what the scourge of monetarism has inflicted on the rest of the world besides.  And although the task is an enormous one, we have got some considerable allies in other countries, many of them fighting for the same things that we are fighting for.  Fighting for them often in their own national context \u2013 but there is nothing wrong with that \u2013 but fighting for them to try to lift this Western world of ours out of this hopeless groove in which it is now stuck.In France the election of President Mitterrand and a socialist government was a momentous event in the history of Western Europe.  (Applause) Do not be misled by the Tory tale that President Mitterrand is going to abandon all his policies.  President Mitterrand is a man who has shown considerable persistence throughout his political life, and I am sure he is going to do so over the next six or seven years when he is there to carry through his policies.  And it can be, if we co-operate, a great help to us.There are many other places where it is happening.  In Greece they elected a good left-wing government, also dedicated to an expansionist policy.  We also welcomed the return of Olaf Palme to power in Sweden.  (Applause) It was Sweden under the socialists which, maybe, set as good an example as any other country in the world in dealing with this economic crisis.  It was a shame and a shock when they were turned out, but we are very glad to see them back, able to apply socialist doctrines there once more.Austria has a good a record as any country in the world in dealing with this crisis, not merely in economic affairs but also in seeking to keep open the door of détente in this highly dangerous world.  And with Austria too, we welcome the work that they have done.Even more, it is possible this autumn, when they have the election in Spain, that there will be elected for the first time since 1935 as prime minister of Spain a democratic socialist.  That will be an event of great significance, I believe, and certainly for all us in the Labour Party who remember some of those times.  I tell you, the Labour Party had got quite a good record in these matters because throughout most of the period of the Franco oppression \u2013 thanks primarily to the Transport and General Workers and Jack Jones, but not solely them \u2013 we kept open a Spanish workers\u2019 defence committee which came to the aid of many socialists threatened with gaol and murder by the Franco tyranny.  We came to their aid \u2013 and the aid of many of those who now figure in the government which, I trust, is going to come to power in Spain.  (Applause)We follow, too, with great anxiety the affairs in Germany.  It has been a fortunate matter, not merely for Germany but for the whole of Europe, that there has been a socialist government there in Western Germany over these years \u2013 a socialist government which has sought to apply some of the policies we agree with, not all of them but some of them, and also to keep open the door to a détente in Europe that has really got a chance of working.  And if, in fact, after all the work that they have done, if that government was set aside, it could be a grave setback for all democrats all over Western Europe.  We trust that nothing of the sort will happen.However, if you look at that list, it is a somewhat different picture from the one that is sometimes presented, that of democratic socialism in retreat.  I tell you that that is not the case.  In many parts of the world, democratic socialism in coming back into its own precisely because it is the only creed truly relevant to such modern industrial conditions.  (Applause) Some of the countries I mentioned in that list, you may note, are in the Common Market; some of them are out of the Common Market.  That does not prevent international co-operation.  We are committed as a party to come out of the Common Market.  (Applause) That is a conference decision, like the one we took yesterday.  (Applause) But I say to you also \u2013 and I say it, I am sure, with the concurrence of everybody, in our party alongside that commitment (and I am not seeking to weaken it in any way at all) we are also committed as socialists to understand our international obligations, both in our own interests and in the interests of other countries and other socialist parties as well.  We must carry through our commitment in that field in a manner which is in proper conformity with our international obligations and our obligations as socialists to other people in other lands.  In the Eighties, more than ever, socialism is international or it is nothing, and if we do not understand that we have not understood the kind of world we live in.  (Applause)This is the reason why we place such emphasis on the Brandt Report \u2013 we want to take it out of the pigeon holes, or the dungeons or wherever it is that they have buried it.  We want to improve the Brandt Report, we want to strengthen it; we want to make it a central feature of what is to happen in the Eighties throughout the world and between the poorer countries and the richer countries.  It is essential.  And I cannot help saying in passing that, in doing so, we shall be carrying out the instructions and the wishes of one of the spokesmen on this subject recently \u2013 one of the finest socialists most of us have ever met \u2013 Frank McElhone, whose death we so deeply deplore.  (Applause) If he were here, he would speak to us in these international tones, and we should not forget it. But I tell you also another reason, even more important.  Tomorrow Joan Lestor will introduce the international statement to the party.  I hope, by the way, that Joan Lestor \u2013 she is not only our spokesman on international affairs, she is also our spokesman on women\u2019s rights, the first appointed in the history of the party \u2013 and I hope it will not be long before she is exercising that job in a cabinet as well.  And the sooner we can get there, the better.  (Applause)Returning to this scene where, indeed, we need the co-operation and the enthusiastic co-operation of allies in order to succeed, I come to the most desperate question of all.  It is incomparably the greatest question, as I think we in the labour movement understand, even if it not to well understood elsewhere.  I mean the nuclear arms race, of course, and the other interlocking dangers.  Our policy for dealing with it is in that document.  I believe it is a very good document; it is going to be presented to conference tomorrow and I think it will be carried in the same terms that I have referred to some other conference decisions.The situation is underlined afresh by the news we get from strange quarters, if you like to call it that.  I read only a few days ago the leading article in The Times, headed \u2018India and the Bomb\u2019.  It describes how India is one of the countries that refused to sign the non-proliferation treaty about nuclear weapons, because they did not believe that they should agree to accept the pressures which at that time were put upon them by the Americans, the Russians, ourselves and many others.  They did not sign, but they did not want to go ahead with building nuclear weapons; my guess is that they still do not want to do so because the burden for the people of India on top of their other burdens would be a very heavy one indeed.However, like other people, the Indians look to see what is happening in some of their neighbouring countries: they have seen how some people have been not merely re-equipping Pakistan with so-called conventional weapons, but seeking to assist them in other nuclear fields as well.  And the Indians know that they have had arms races in their subcontinent \u2013 arms races fed, I am ashamed to say, from the West.  Some of the worst evils that are happening in the Third World are fed from the policies pursued here in Britain and the United States.  (Applause) So I want to see that we stop that arms traffic in other kinds of weapons, because \u2013 heaven knows! the scale on which that has increased is an obscenity almost as great as the nuclear arms race itself.But I take note of what I read now.  This is why I was a supporter of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament and why I remain a supporter of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament.  (Applause) I warn you that I am not reading from Tribune or even from Militant, but from The Times.  However, after they have discussed \u2013 and I think intelligently discussed \u2013 in this article the dangers for the world, the perils for India if in fact, they felt themselves forced into this ugly business of going into the nuclear arms race themselves, they go on: \u2018However, it does not lie with existing Western members of the military nuclear club to argue that nobody else should be allowed to achieve the same status\u2019.  Quite a powerful argument.They go on to say: \u2018If they were prepared to show their readiness to give up nuclear weapons, their arguments would be more convincing\u2019.  I think that is true too.  I do not say it would all be done by an example, but I do say that if this country insists on saying \u2018we will sustain our nuclear status whatever happens\u2019, then a lot of other countries are going to say exactly the same.  (Applause)But then The Times goes on about the sale of arms to Pakistan, which is part of the cause of the crisis: \u2018Their methods\u2019 \u2013 that is, the methods of the Western nations \u2013 \u2018of controlling nuclear supplies have been subverted by the lure of commercial gain\u2019.Profit: people have been selling these arms for profit.  That is part of the danger, and it is all there in The Times.  It says that India may only decide to go nuclear if Pakistan does, and that applies in some other parts of the world as well.  I say that the greatest tasks that this labour movement of ours will ever have to undertake, when we get that next Labour government, is to carry out our policy for securing nuclear disarmament in this country and throughout the world.  (Applause)But I say to you also that if we can realise that opportunity, it can be the greatest opportunity in the history of our movement.  And we have done some great things for our people and for other people \u2013 we do not need to be instructed in patriotism, or anything of the sort, from elsewhere.  (Applause) All through the Falklands crisis the phrase of George Orwell kept drumming in my ears: \u2018I do not want to see England humiliated or humiliating anybody else\u2019.  That is a very good form of patriotism, even if I ask my fellow Celts to join in such a tribute to English patriotism, because George Orwell would have put it in English terms.  That is not imperialism; it is upholding international authority and international rights.  It is upholding the international authorities which we, as socialists, have always said have got to be substituted for international anarchy.  We have got to hold to that doctrine too \u2013 more especially because there are fewer voices in the world raised on that account, and we have got to multiply their number.We have got to prepare for that day \u2013 the day when we set about rescuing our country, the day when we set about changing the whole climate of international affairs.  It is going to be a great day when we start on that task, a great day that we will all wish to celebrate.  But we all know in our hearts, that if we are going to be able to succeed \u2013 particularly because our people, the British people, are a sensible, commonsense and intelligent people, and a compassionate and a tolerant people \u2013 the party that wins them has got to have those qualities too.  If we do not have those qualities we will not win.  (Applause) I believe that those qualities are deeply embedded in the whole of our inspiration.  From what we heard of the merit awarders a few minutes ago, they spoke to us in those terms too.  We have to revive that compassion and tolerance, the good nature and good will of our movement, on a scale we have never done before.  We have got to demonstrate to people with every possible power of advocacy at our command; we have not got all the newspapers assisting us and therefore we have got to say it all the more clearly and, on occasions, all the more in unison.  I am not in favour of doing it in unison all the time, because I know you have got to argue about lots of things; but I do say that you have also to set the world in its proper perspective.  And democratic socialism is relevant and more relevant than ever today, precisely because it does that.  H G Wells used to say; \u2018You can throw socialism out of the window and you will come in and find it astraddle your hearth\u2019.And that is what is happening in so many parts of the world.  People are discovering, particularly in the poorest parts of the world, that the only way that they can lift their people from the gutter is by the power, intelligence and purpose of democratic socialist ideas.  (Applause)So I ask you at this conference, although we concentrate on our own affairs, I ask you also to think in these international terms.  I would like to read to you the words that I came across in a book the other day, written by a great Italian socialist, Angelica Belabanov.  She wrote a book called My Life as a Rebel in 1936-37, under the fascist dictatorship.  But she put at the beginning of her book words quoted from a great German socialist, August Babel, and she wrote in terms that I believe elevate democratic socialism on an international scale to where it should be.  This is what she said:And if in the course of this great battle (she was describing the battle against our political enemies) for the emancipation of the human race we should fall, those now in the rear will step forward and we shall fall with the consciousness of having done our duty as human beings and with the conviction that the goal will be reached, however the powers hostile to humanity may struggle or strain in resistance.  Ours is the world despite all!Ours is the world!  That is what I say to you as socialists, here and throughout the rest of the world! (Standing ovation)

aVAs you may have heard I took a few days off this summer. But I\u2019m back now and I must say you\u2019re all looking a good deal better for it.I did notice that during my absence my own rating in the Gallup poll reached record levels. There must be a moral in this somewhere.I saw this week that another party leader was asked by a reporter whether her hectic day trip to Holland had been too much for her. She replied, and I quote: \u2018It might be too much for a normal person, but after all it is me,\u2019 or as Miss Piggy would say, \u2018C\u2019est moi.\u2019Talking of \u2018The Muppet Show\u2019 reminds me, I must thank Alan Beith for looking after the parliamentary party in my absence.But seriously, I am sure you will agree from what you have seen at this Assembly how lucky Alan as Chief Whip and I as Leader are to have such talented new additions to our team.This 1983 Assembly meets three months after a general election which has seen the return of the largest Liberal Party in the House of Commons since 1935. For our Alliance it was the largest third party vote since 1923. We have made a remarkable climb back from our seven hundred thousand votes in the 1951 election to our seven and a half million votes on June 9th this year.So my first words must be of warm congratulation to everyone in the party who has contributed to this achievement. I have had a chance to thank many of you personally in the last few days. But for those outside this hall who supported us so magnificently during the campaign - my heartfelt thanks. Of course we still have a long way to go to reach power - the power to implement Liberal policies - but another leap forward at the next election, of the same size as this last one, will see us there.For let this be clearly understood, the scale of our achievement has been masked only by the cruel distortions of our electoral system. In what other democracy could the official opposition poll 27.6 per cent of the popular vote and get 209 seats while our Alliance polling just 2 per cent less got only 23? In what other democracy could the Government suffer a loss of support of 1½ per cent of those voting, polling the lowest Conservative vote since Bonar Law, and yet end up with such an increased majority capable of being described wholly incorrectly as a \u2018landslide\u2019 in their favour?I warn Tory and Labour politicians as they sit and manipulate a House of Commons which is now wholly unrepresentative of popular opinion that they go on doing so at their peril. A democracy which is deliberately insensitive to the real changes in public feeling sows the seeds of its own destruction. As I found on the doorsteps in the Penrith by-election, and as our remarkable vote there showed, there is now an enormous wave of public sympathy and support for the cause of electoral justice.And I also warn them that while we fully support the all party Campaign for Fair Votes, we Liberals are not going to sit around whingeing: \u2018we was robbed.\u2019 It is my intention that we regroup and mobilise our forces to go on to win the next election under the present system and then to change it.It has been said that the weakness of our Alliance is that our vote was evenly spread; that we piled up 313 second places throughout the land but that our vote was insufficiently concentrated in specific areas. That may be a short-term weakness but I believe it to be our long-term strength. We do appeal to all ages and classes and regions.That is something neither of the other parties can any longer claim. How can the Tory party possibly pretend to be a genuinely national party when with their inflated majority they cannot muster a single MP in the great cities of Glasgow or Liverpool?The Labour Party has been almost wiped out throughout the whole of the south of England below the London to Bristol line. There is one other feature of the last election which is highly significant and merits greater recognition. Ever since 1950 the Liberal Party has been caricatured as the lost deposit party. In that election we lost 319 deposits and Labour lost none. At this election we lost just five deposits - the same number as the Conservative Party. But Labour candidates lost their deposits in 119 constituencies. The mould of British politics many not have been smashed at this election, but we have cracked it beyond repair and it will not be used again.What does that mean for us?First and foremost it means we must start to look like a potential government. It means that without question our Alliance with the SDP must continue. The sight of two parties working together for the common good for the first time since the war has had dramatic impact. It must not only continue but develop organically and democratically at every level. Inevitably at the beginning of our Alliance a lot of ad hoc decisions had to be made at the top. Now we must move on from that.It means developing policy with our allies over the next few years instead of waiting till the manifesto drafting period. We have set an example already in Parliament by creating groups to co-ordinate policy.We must let the local friendships and partnerships, forged in the election, grow stronger. But at the same time, our proper commitment to decentralisation should not go so far as to leave us looking like a loosely-knit rag-bag with people free to act against the spirit of the Alliance in their region, city or constituency. The Alliance has meant and will mean taking and accepting some tough decisions.We have worked out a way of fighting European seats together which will require us to respect each other\u2019s rules but which I am sure will be successful. In the coming discussions on Westminster seats we must be careful not to upset the excellent local understanding which now exists in the great majority of constituencies by initiating any attempt at a general reshuffle.In the relatively small number of constituencies where either Liberals or Social Democrats seek change, it is essential that both parties face up to the obligation of sorting things out together fairly and locally. That is the way to avoid another round of national involvement and intervention.But important as \u2018who fights which seat\u2019 may be to the two parties of the Alliance, it is not what matters to the voters, They want to know and they are entitled to know whether the Alliance has worked out answers to the growing problems of Britain.That means that, we must think together and we must campaign together on the great issues of our country\u2019s future. I want the Liberal Party to be a Thinking and Campaigning Party. I want us to be a Thinking and Campaigning Alliance.Between 1974 and 1979 the Tory privateers captured the political debate. They imposed their ideas upon the national agenda.Now it is up to us to recapture the intellectual initiative. Their ideas have proved impractical and their ideology barren, but it is up to us to show that we can do better. We must redefine and sharpen up our policies in a way that is both adventurous and responsible. We must command the debate.Our policies must be developed step by step with our allies over the coming years. We must not be afraid to hammer out our differences. We must be willing to advance new plans and ideas which draw upon the traditions of Liberalism and Social Democracy to solve the crisis of our time. Like Keynes and Beveridge in their day we must be innovative and ambitious. The Tories believe they have so cowed the British people that all sense of confidence has ebbed away. \u2018A frightened nation is a conservative nation,\u2019 they say to themselves.We must prove them wrong by being prepared to put forward bold and radical plans for the renewal of Britain, and we must campaign vigorously upon them. I am determined that the very special style of campaigning which Liberals have developed so successfully over the past two decades should not be confined to local issues.The Party in the Alliance must take its case to the people. We must take our campaign for the renewal of Britain into every home in this country with a message that will rekindle the hope which Tory policies have done so much to destroy.It is to the contents of that campaign that I want to divert your attention today. Over these next four years we must work together in five key areas of policy, to sharpen our impact.I begin with the economy. In a speech during the election Sir Geoffrey Howe had the nerve to claim \u2018we have created and will maintain a stable economic environment. Business confidence and employment opportunities are growing.\u2019 Scarcely a day of the election passed without some Tory minister assuring us that recovery was just round the corner or that light had been sighted at the end of the tunnel. We now know that the June recovery was an illusion. How bitterly I find CBI members resenting that their leaders were swept along in the Tory euphoria.This month the National Institute of Economic and Social Research told us that the growth expected in the economy over the next 18 months would be \u2018too low to make any mark on unemployment.\u2019 This Government, faced with the problems of a world recession, has deliberately used unemployment as its sole means to control inflation. By cutting public expenditure they have reduced productive economic activity and added an extra British recession on top of the world one.The Government\u2019s financial targets for 1983 are the most restrictive of any of the big seven Western economies. The Tories cannot deny that since they took office in 1979 our industrial production has slumped seven times faster than the OECD average. Over the same period Britain had by far the worst record on overall output of all the 24 OECD member states.The National Institute\u2019s report goes on to say, \u2018it is difficult to see a significant and national reduction in unemployment taking place without a fairly substantial stimulus.\u2019 That is precisely what we called for before and during the election and we do so again today.I must make it clear that when we oppose Tory economic policies and present our own alternatives we are not just talking of detailed changes here and there. We are saying that the present economic policies stem from a crude political philosophy that we Liberals find socially irresponsible and wholly unacceptable. Today\u2019s Tories are fired with the Friedmanite view that human improvement can only be achieved by unrelieved competition. We reject that view.So do a long list of Tories who nowadays sound like a roll call from distant history: Soames, Gilmour, Carrington, Pym. The Prime Minister instead surrounds herself with the new hard-faced men who share her failed dogmas: Lawson, Brittan, Parkinson, Tebbit. I hear the BBC is trying to negotiate for a series of documentaries on the workings of cabinet. I have a title ready for them if they succeed: \u2018Yes Prime Minister.\u2019But it is a tragedy, not a comedy. The new Thatcher Tories are like the Prime Minister herself totally out of touch with the harsh reality of the life they have created for many of our people. I say they are out of touch because I believe that is true of leading Tories today. The only other and much less charitable explanation is that they do know and don\u2019t care.The number of families caught in the poverty trap has doubled since they came to power four years ago. The Government\u2019s lack of concern about this reminds me of the Victorian Archbishop of Dublin who suggested to the Poor Law Enquiry Commission that all paupers should be tattooed on the foot or some other place so as to deter them from begging or receiving additional relief. He also suggested that any female receiving relief should have her hair cut off, pointing out with true devotion to the market economy that a good head of hair would fetch from 5 to 10 shillings, which represented a fortnight\u2019s maintenance. These are the Victorian values we can do without.Whole areas of our great cities are so riddled with unemployment that we now have a law and disorder problem of serious proportions. Our newspapers week by week bring us reports from the courts of suicides brought on by failure to find work. NHS prescriptions for sedative drugs have shown an alarming and costly increase in areas of high unemployment. The picture of despair among the young who\u2019ve never had a job is matched only by the prematurely retired people in their 50s who fear they will never work again.Let the Prime Minister listen to the words of her great predecessor Disraeli instead of the false prophets she has been following: \u2018It is community of purpose that constitutes society. Without that men may be drawn into contiguity but they still continue virtually isolated.\u2019 It is that community of purpose which is so devastatingly lacking in the philosophy of this Government - leading to the creation of two nations between whom Disraeli saw \u2018no intercourse and no sympathy; who are as ignorant of each other\u2019s habits, thoughts and feelings as if they were inhabitants of different planets.\u2019 That is the main achievement of the Thatcher philosophy today. She and her advisers have perverted the Liberal concept of liberty. We believe that unless participation in the fullness of life in our country is treated as a right for all, liberty remains an empty word, a pretty veil behind which privilege may thrive.So our first duty as an Alliance must be to advocate constructive ways of putting people back to work. And so the second priority of the Alliance is the maintenance and revival of our country\u2019s public assets. The way they have been eroded by the Tories is a scandal. Because of our Liberal inheritance from the days of Lloyd George we are particularly incensed at the erosion of our health and social services.The Tories have partly succeeded in persuading our people that as a nation we have been living in the lap of luxury, enjoying benefits in excess of other countries and which we cannot afford. This is just not true. I found when I was in Canada during the summer that our Liberal colleagues there spend more of their Gross National Product on health than we do. They have more doctors and more hospital beds than we do per 1000 population. The same is true of Australia.What economic and social lunacy it is to have empty wards, longer waiting lists, and nurses and ancillary workers drawing unemployment benefit. What a tragedy that at a time of falling school rolls and empty classrooms we should have teachers in the dole queue instead of improving the quality of our education by reducing class sizes.The crude and intermittent financial attacks on our universities and colleges have meant the abandonment of the right to higher education which all post-1960 governments until this one supported. We have been failing to invest in our material infrastructure and in private industry. To add on top of these the failure to invest in the skill of our people for the future is disgraceful.Mrs. Thatcher claims to be a disciple of Winston Churchill, but she is highly selective in her knowledge of him, for in his book The People\u2019s Rights he dealt at length with the need for the public utilities and went on to say that \u2018the State must increasingly and earnestly concern itself with the care of the sick and aged, and above all, of the children.\u2019 Today\u2019s Tories are doing the very reverse, and in the process frittering away the benefits of our greatest contemporary asset, North Sea oil. Let us therefore in our Alliance renew our faith in the public assets of this country - our railways, airports, road network; our coal, gas, electricity, steel and shipbuilding, to replace public shoddiness with public pride.The industrial world may be running out of jobs in the ordinary sense, but it is certainly not running out of work. There is plenty waiting to be done - enough to restore everybody\u2019s self-respect and give meaning to their lives.There is a lot of nonsense talked about the wisdom of growth, about this country having to choose between jobs and the environment. Mrs. Thatcher has proved that isn\u2019t true. She has succeeded in destroying both at the same time.On the contrary, the right investment in the repair and rehabilitation of this country we could get the economy moving, get people back to work and enhance and conserve our precious physical environment for future generations.There is a massive job to be done in reclaiming our inner cities, in repairing, insulating and refurbishing old housing stock, in cleaning up urban wastelands and building new parks and playing fields.That\u2019s the way to get the construction industry moving again, not by building a new rash of commuter towns deep in the Green Belt.Yet Mrs. Thatcher cannot escape from the prison of her own ideology.  For her, energy use can only be limited by putting prices up. For her, land is a commodity to be bought and sold by her friends in the City, not a precious national asset. For her, public investment is anathema - even if it helps encourage private industry to get going again.So we have been condemned to another four years of these squalid and short-sighted policies which will leave a landscape of dereliction behind them, with concrete where there should be green fields and city slums where there should be thriving communities.The opportunity to use this time of economic crisis to create a more sustainable society is there for the taking. We must do it before the North Sea oil runs out, poured away by a deeply irresponsible government on a wave of imported foreign goods.I want future generations to look back and say: This, our generation of political leadership, had the sense and foresight to build a country which is fit for us to inherit.My third theme is that we must search for an enhanced role for the individual in our society. \u2018Less government\u2019 is a legitimate demand in our over-bureaucratic society. It. means more autonomy for individuals, groups, regions, businesses, organisations, decentralised groups of all kinds. We Liberals have long proclaimed the need for partnership in industry. The message is catching on slowly but surely, yet we have still not given this subject the priority it deserves. We should spell out the advantages of our policy in far more dramatic terms.Why for a start should we not require all nationalised industries to operate genuine industrial partnership? One of the most original speeches at the TUC this year was made by Bill Sirs, the leader of the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation, when he said that the labour movement had with the best of intentions created monsters out of the public industries. \u2018Under nationalisation,\u2019 he said, \u2018we the shareholders have no mechanism for controlling them at all.\u2019 He is absolutely right. I believe the whole public sector would be much more efficient if those who work in it were given a proper say in its running. Indeed where possible, as in British Leyland, a cash share in its increased productivity and success. That is the way to greater prosperity for the nation and satisfaction for the workforce.In the private sector the government should not order industry into new forms of organisation but it should give far larger tax carrots for those who switch to approved partnership schemes. We should as a movement study and publicise those firms like Baxi Heating who have in recent years successfully adopted partnership principles, and look at experience overseas. In America for example the airline People\u2019s Express makes it a prior condition of employment that you own at least 100 shares in the company and if you haven\u2019t got the money they will let you pay by instalments out of your wages. The chairman of the company declares that everyone in his company is a. manager. Everyone makes between a quarter and half their basic salary through profit sharing. The firm operates with half the usual ratio of employees to aircraft and the result is lower fares for the customer.Let us inject some zeal into our advocacy of these policies. It is only through them that we can for example get an incomes policy generally accepted as a more civilised method of controlling inflation than unemployment. It is only through industrial partnership that we will break down the class barriers which so bedevil our national life and which are in the interests of the Conservative and Labour parties to maintain. It is only in an atmosphere of co-operation that we will get people to face the necessary reappraisal of work in the face of the new technologies.One of the central issues of the world of tomorrow is how do we transform our dependence on jobs into a wider dependence on activity, including part-time work, education, leisure and voluntary assistance in developing the otherwise costly personal social services in an ageing society. Our Alliance parties still have a great deal of thinking to undertake in this area.My fourth theme is that our Alliance demonstrates a coherent and well thought out concern for our future human environment, and especially the health of local government as the main agency for securing this.A deep concern for the individual is the heart of our approach. But that means safeguarding his liberties and rights from bureaucratic intrusion; it means exercising a firm control over the pace of technological change so that the new technology remains our servant and not our master; it means giving the citizen rights of access to information; it means proper protection for ethnic and other minorities - giving equality before the law, providing equality of opportunity, whether in education or in work, and welcoming cultural diversity. Let us live up to our Party\u2019s constitutional aim that none should be enslaved by a narrow mass conformity.And it means rejecting those who would impose a set blueprint of what constitutes human happiness whether that be the product of Tory paternalism or State socialism.That is why a responsive, open and alive system of local democracy is so important.But over the last four years we have seen a relentless assault on local government, with a procession of White Papers, legislative proposals and a maze of mind-numbing and unworkable financial formulae. These financial controls are imposed with no regard to the human consequences, and are constraints which central Government would not dream of accepting in Whitehall.Of course there may be provocation from authorities controlled by the Labour left. I have a peace proposal to make. Mrs. Thatcher should promise to stop trying to run the GLC if Ken Livingstone will stop trying to run the country.The greatest damage has been caused to local government by forcing it to be an instrument of the Government's monetarist obsessions. My own regional council earlier this month warned me that maintenance of services in the Borders - our roads, bridges, school buildings - is gradually disintegrating.There is a desperate need to spend more merely to get back to the standards of 10 years ago. But instead, the Government permits only a ludicrous 2.6 per cent for inflation next year. We all know that inflation is going to be much more than that. Therefore inevitably there will be a serious reduction in real terms in local authority services.Now we have the latest proposals for rate-capping - hitting at the remaining power local authorities have to raise their own funds and set their own level of services. So my Regional Council cannot even remedy this disastrous position by its own actions, Is it any wonder that councillors feel there is little point in giving up their time in service to local government when it\u2019s so hamstrung by central government?If we believe in local democracy, we are going to have to fight for it. We have our shock troops on the ground, 2,000 Liberal councillors ready to take the argument into their council chambers and on to the Government itself.Together our MPs and councillors must unfurl the banner of local freedom.I now turn to the last of my five points, but by no means the least - the assertion of a new international role for Britain. Some say we found that role in the Falklands. We did not. I have been unstinting in my praise for our military achievement. We backed the expeditionary force because we backed the rule of law and the United Nations charter so brusquely ignored by the Argentine Junta. We paid a heavy price for those principles and for rescuing the Falkland Islanders from the cruel invasion. Some of our fellow citizens paid the ultimate price. The triumph was one in which we all shared.But the ugly jingoism which once or twice surfaced in the Prime Minister\u2019s vocabulary during that war has led to the most outrageously futile policy in peace - that of Fortress Falklands. Here we have a Government which at every turn tells us how it must limit public expenditure in every direction, seriously proposing to spend (on the garrison, new airports and other services in the Islands) one and a half million pounds per Islander.And what for? Such expenditure will not lead to permanent security or immunity from attack - only a political settlement can achieve that. And in any case, as a report I have just received from the Islands privately confirms, the conversion of the Islands into a military fortress threatens to ruin the very way of life of the Islanders which we are meant to be protecting.Common sense must prevail. The Argentine is due to return to democracy next autumn. We are alienating Latin America, the United States, and indeed the whole United Nations by our obdurate policy. Instead we should be making it clear that when democracy returns we will of course resume direct discussions with the Argentine for the long term future of the Islands. In the meantime, we should welcome any help from the UN or the Organisation of American States to establish international guarantees of their security. We are now paying too high a price for Mrs. Thatcher\u2019s vanity, and we shall say so loud and clear.The international role for Britain is not and cannot be that of Britain ruling the waves. It should be of a Britain using her world-wide Commonwealth connections, her special relationship with the United States, her membership of the EEC and NATO, as a major force for peace, stability, arms control and a just distribution of resources in our troubled world. There is no need to be hesitant in assuming such a leadership. The background of mutual paranoia of the two super-powers rules them out of this task. We could assist in reducing these global tensions, suspicions and distrust by promoting political dialogue between East and West. It is scandalous that the Prime Minister prevented Francis Pym from doing that. Political summitry may have gone out of fashion but I believe it is the quickest way to increase understanding and create a better atmosphere against which disarmament talks can operate.We as a people have a common interest with both the Americans and the Russians in achieving major reductions in expenditure on nuclear weaponry. The Soviet Union spends two or three times as much of its gross national product on military purposes as the NATO powers. It does so inevitably at the expense of progress for our citizens. Military expenditure throughout the world over the last four years has been increasing at a rate of 4 per cent a year twice the rate of the previous four years. This is an insanity which must be stopped, for as President Eisenhower once remarked, \u2018Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired, signifies in a final sense a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, from those who are cold and not clothed.\u2019That is even more true of today\u2019s expensive hardware. Every week three hundred thousand people die of starvation, a death toll equivalent to two Hiroshimas a week. Assuredly the Brandt Report was correct in saying that the twin causes of disarmament and world development go hand in hand. Far from adopting its proposals, our Government has brazenly lopped a further 2 per cent off the already-declining overseas budget since June. Governments which go round penny-pinching from the arts and overseas aid tell you something about what kind of tawdry values they have.If they want to penny-pinch they might look instead at the fact that Britain has almost four times as many brigadiers, admirals and above for every 1,000 troops as the Americans, and all of them with increased salaries protected under this Government\u2019s special pay policy for top people.But serious disarmament is not just a matter of economics, it is a matter of survival. Both sides build increasing numbers of nuclear weapons and stockpile them to prevent their use. There is a logical malfunction here somewhere. Nuclear war is unlikely in my view to come about because of political confrontation between the two superpowers. It is now much more likely by accident. The ill-fated Korean airliner had its course set by computer. The communications systems set between it and the Russian fighters were different. If tragedy occurred after a 2½-hour flight, how much more likely is error on the short missile flights between East and West. To err is human, but for a real cock-up you need a computer. So the stakes are high and getting higher, and the need for a sustained impetus for nuclear disarmament becomes the highest priority for the peoples of this world.I am not saying that the creation of a new concept of common security is easy. I hope that those who think those nice Russians can lightly be persuaded to abandon their SS20 deployment programme will have thought again after the callous destruction of that airliner. Even the latest Andropov proposals would leave the fire power of three thousand Hiroshima bombs directed at Western Europe.But today the talks at Geneva stand at a critical point. The British Government\u2019s attitude and activities in the days and weeks ahead could make all the difference. There have been some hints of movement on the Soviet side in the talks recently. Our European Allies would welcome British pressure for constructive disarmament counter proposals from an American Administration which has too often seemed frozen in its own cold-war rhetoric. The trouble is that Mrs, Thatcher seems to be content to be President Reagan's echo rather than his ally. I don\u2019t want Britain to be the East Germany of the Atlantic Alliance.One of the major obstacles to agreement at Geneva is the refusal of Britain to put Polaris into the Geneva equation. There has been no flicker of response from Britain to this not unreasonable suggestion. Why?It is easy to see one reason why the Government is reluctant, If allowance is made today for the 192 Polaris warheads, allowance will have to be made tomorrow for the 896 Trident warheads. It would then become embarrassingly clear to everyone how this misbegotten Trident project would give a. vicious upward twist to the nuclear arms race worldwide. We know already that this subject has become an obstacle to agreement in Geneva and yet, rather than abandon Trident, Her Majesty\u2019s Government is willing to put the Geneva talks at risk.If we are confronted with the deployment of Cruise missiles this autumn, it will not only be the position that the Russians and the Americans have taken in the negotiations that will affect this Party\u2019s attitude. It will not just be the presence or absence of a dual key system. It will also be whether this Government has helped or hindered the prospects for peace by their conduct and policies over the coming crucial weeks.There is a further major risk of nuclear war. It lies in the lesser powers indulging in conventional wars which get out of control. It is high time that we took the lead in saying that the developed powers stopped whetting the appetites of these countries with arms sales promotions. The world is sadly full of Galtieris, Ghadafis, Begins, Bathos or Khomeinis whose aggressive concept of their national interest is to trample on the rights of others. That during this summer France should sell jet fighters equipped with Exocet missiles to Iraq, or that we should have sent a cross-Channel car ferry loaded as an arms sales exhibition round the Middle East is unforgivable. We seem to have learned nothing from our arms trade with the Argentine.And as candid friend to President Reagan it is time the Prime Minister told him bluntly that we do not regard the harassment of Nicaragua or the propping up of El Salvador as being the first line in the defence of human freedom.Britain is in a unique position to be a new and vital force for world peace. We are determined to make her so.If I try to sum up my five themes, they amount to a plea for us to listen to what people are telling us in Britain today. To listen to the cry of men and women who feel themselves the victims of blind economic and political forces beyond their control. To recognise the frustration of people excluded from the process of making decisions even over their own lives, the feeling of hopelessness and powerlessness to shape their own destinies.The duty of our political movement is to display such conviction, imagination and responsibility that we establish ourselves as the mainstream reformers in touch with the feelings and aspirations of ordinary folk. We have to restore faith in democratic politics, and invite new recruits in to help us.In my first speech to you as leader in 1976, I said that the road I intended us to travel back to power would be a bumpy one. And indeed we have climbed some rough terrain together. But look where we\u2019ve got to. We have established for the first time in fifty years a really secure base camp. We are ready to begin the final assault on that summit.First we must be confident. Confident of our cause and our chance of success. Confident in each other and in our allies.Second we must be united. Healthy debate is essential. The party needs new ideas and vitality. But the time has come for us to operate more as a team, now and especially during the next election itself.Third, and most important, we must be far-sighted. Liberals have always led the way in responding to new political opportunities with vision. That has never been more needed than now.A timid, divided and short-sighted Party would fail, and would deserve to fail because it would have lost its nerve. A confident, united and far-sighted Liberal Party will give the lead to the Alliance.Politics is so often just about parties chasing after votes. Yet in contrast today we have the extraordinary phenomenon of the public seeking a movement worthy of their support. We must respond. We have clearly touched a chord in the hearts of the British people.Now we must build a new consensus, with an honourable role for our country. As we\u2019ve seen in these last two years, to die for one\u2019s country is still recognised as noble. But to live and work for its best purposes is noble too.We must redefine true patriotism. A Britain famous once more for its civilisation, competence and compassionate domestic leadership could be a forceful example in the quest for international order and justice.Our party and our Alliance have an historic role to play in the renewal of Britain. It is our duty. It is expected of us. There is no limit to what we can achieve together if we believe in each other and in our cause.I commend to you the words of Oliver Cromwell: \u2018know what you fight for and love what you know.\u2019

aVChair, comrades, as you say, for the first time but certainly not the last I rise to move the parliamentary report for the past year. Frankly, after the last half hour, I was rather more disposed to simply get up and move a vote of thanks to our guest speakers.For us it has been a year of advance. Twelve months ago we came to this conference licking our wounds in defeat. We stood at 24.5 per cent in the opinion polls; we were stunned by our worst post-war election defeat.The commentators, with all of the insight and foresight for which they are famous - at least among each other - were talking about us in deathbed terms. Now, in 1984, we have made great gains in the European Parliament elections, and in the local government council elections in the spring of this year. In the four GLC by-elec­tions, which our party correctly called, Labour scored huge victories and - more important, in many ways - we completely vindicate our belief in using democracy to try to defend democracy, in London and everywhere else.That in anybody\u2019s book should be strong evi­dence of substantial and sustained recovery, and it is. Only one thing could possibly arrest that recovery: amnesia, memory loss. It is an awful affliction for anyone, but for a political party it can be an absolutely crippling disease. Indeed, a political party cannot afford any degree of infec­tion by amnesia. It must vaccinate itself completely against such an event. It cannot afford any loss of memory. And in this party, the vaccine is simply to recall what defeat felt like last year, and that should immunise each and every one of us completely against any attitude or activity that can impede our progress towards victory.And all of you who have been winning those European, local and by-elections, know the great feeling of taking an extra pace towards the victory we must achieve at the next election.That is how it has been in this Labour Party, and that is how it must go on: with patience, with understanding, with persuasion, with co-opera­tion, with campaigning, with hard work. Turning outwards, listening to people, and learning from them. Working for the people, working with the people. That is the way the Labour Party will win the election.The prize for that effort is great: it is the demo­cratic power that we need to save our country. And the prize is there for us to win. Think about it: we have to advance as much in three years as we already have in one year. That is the knowledge that spurs our effort, that gives us confidence and sets our course for victory.Every month that passes increases the need for that victory. For in this year, whilst we have been building recovery, our country has been pushed further into slide and shambles by the govern­ment elected in June of 1983.In this year in which the government kept on telling us that the economy is recovering, unem­ployment has risen by 125,000.In this so-called year of recovery, an extra 350,000 young people under 25 find themselves unemployed for more than a year.In this year of recovery 91,000 more manufac­turing jobs have been lost, to add to the 1.7 million manufacturing jobs lost since 1979.In this year interest rates went up by a third, and mortgage rates soared to 12.5 per cent as the government further applied the very policies that brought the pound tumbling in the first place.In this year industrial production has stagnated - fewer cars and commercial vehicles, steel and ships have been produced in this country than in the previous year.This was a year when our trade deficit in man­ufactured products - in this country of makers and traders, that for all the foreseeable future must try to live by selling the things that it makes for the rest of the world - doubled to a rate of over £4,000 million.As for the so-called sunrise industries, we heard this year that in Britain the sunrise industry of information technology is being eclipsed before it has properly risen.These are the statistics of slump, and not the records of recovery. I register them with misery - for our people are the victims of that shrivel­ling economy. I wish with all my heart that it was true that we were experiencing a recovery - even Mrs Thatcher\u2019s recovery. For there is no profit, no comfort, no joy for us in this labour movement in the drudgery, poverty, despair, and insecurity of anybody\u2019s unemployment.This was the year, too, when tax was intro­duced on fish and chips; and, in an industry with over 400,000 unemployed, tax was introduced on home improvements.This was the year when farmers slaughtered milk cows.This was the year when old age pensioners were charged for their spectacles and lens replacements.This was the year when the health service \u2013 \u2018safe in their hands\u2019 - was squeezed into further closures and contractions.This was the year when the school class-sizes stopped falling; when university admissions kept on falling; when medical and technological research was cut back by the government because of its cut.This was the year in which cruise arrived. This was the year in which the cost of Trident soared past £12,000 million.This was the year when cuts pushed public and local services below the level of legality, while simultaneously government threatened prison to those who tried to spend to keep services up to the levels of decency and service to the community. (Applause)This was the year when the elections for the Greater London and metropolitan county coun­cils were abolished: Why? Because the results would be politically embarrassing and devastat­ing for the government.This was the year when the government ban­ned trade unions at GCHQ, Cheltenham. Why? In order to demonstrate its view that security, patriotism, commitment to the national interest, is incompatible with trade unionism. What vile rubbish, utterly unacceptable in any democracy.This is the year when Sarah Tisdall went to jail with a punishment vastly in excess of anything that was merited by the offence.This was the year when Clive Ponting is on trial and being prosecuted by the government.This was the year when national policing was introduced in Britain.This was the year in which young mothers were refused help with maternity costs, and families were denied help with funeral bills, because the fathers of those families were on strike.This is the year when soup kitchens came back to Britain: 1984, the fifth year of Thatcherism.And for seven months of this year, all of those elements - the erosion of civil rights; the with­drawal of welfare support; the cutbacks and closures; unemployment and civil disorder - have all been brought together in a great turmoil of the miners\u2019 dispute.That turmoil is the product of Thatcherism - the combination of ignorance and arrogance, of pride and prejudice, that now rules and overrules this country and makes Britain in this fifth year of Thatcherism less free, less fair, less productive than it was for years before 1979.The erosion of our economic standards, our standards of liberty, of compassion, of care, and of opportunity; it is all that which is, of course, part of the reason for this dispute. Families and communities in the coalfields, like those in my constituency in South Wales, know that pit closure would trap them, entomb them, in unemployment and deprivation for all of the foreseeable future under Toryism. They know that under Thatcherism no alternatives exist and no alternatives are coming to their areas. That is why the resistance has been so determined. People who do not comprehend it should under­stand that the communities now engaged in this dispute are like someone fighting for air to breathe. That is literally the case under Margaret Thatcher.Let everybody be clear. This dispute was caused by the fact that the National Coal Board wanted to impose production targets on the industry which would in this year, by the spring of 1985, bring the closure of 20 pits, the loss of 20,000 jobs, and the reduction of output by four million tonnes - and that was just for starters. They said that the cutback was to bring produc­tion into line with the market for coal - that was the phrase they used; they said that the closures were necessary to save £350 million - that\u2019s what they said.As it happens, that programme could not have benefited Britain in any event. In Britain\u2019s coal­fields now, the male unemployment rates are 15, 18, and 20 per cent. There are no jobs for redun­dant coal miners to go to. That is the simple, sour fact. And that means that closures would simply turn producers of coal who pay taxes into produc­ers of nothing who have to claim benefits. (Applause) That\u2019s the loss we would be making. It would cost the country more; the whole scheme would, to coin a phrase, be \u2018uneconomic\u2019 for Bri­tain. Even apart from that plain argument of arithmetic, the fact is that this dispute itself has torn the purposes claimed by the board for their cutback and closure programme into absolute ribbons.Since the Board tried to impose those demand early this year, there has been a seven-month dis­pute which has cost at a minimum the country a minimum of nearly £2,000 million in extra oil-burn, in lost taxes, in lost production and in polic­ing costs. Since those demands were made by the Board early this year, there has been a seven-month dispute and 54 million tonnes of coal pro­duction has been lost. I want this conference, the whole country, and the government to get hold of the facts that the loss of coal production in this dispute is 14 times more than the loss originally required by the NCB. I want the whole country to get hold of the fact that the financial costs of continuing the dispute are six times as great as any so-called savings that were anticipated from the programme of closures and contractions. (Applause)If people understand that, they will com­prehend that those are the unrelenting facts which would now persuade the board and the government to get away from their stupidity and their inflexibility, from their vanities and their posturing, and step out of their \u2018B\u2019 movie script, and act like responsible people and go back to the arrangements before the compilation of the hit-list. That is the pre-condition, the basic require­ment, of saving this country and the coalmining communities and much else, from the awful pain of the continuation of this dispute. The govern­ment and the Board should get back to the sys­tem, and restore confidence in the system of negotiation about exhaustion, which has stood the industry in good stead for many years. They should understand that the National Union of Mineworkers has been prepared to make its case for new investment, and new development of workable reserves, when pits were reported as exhausting. They should remember that, on those ground of foreseeable and acknowledged exhaus­tion, agreement had already been made before the dispute started, between the NUM and the NCB, to close about a dozen pits in the next two or three years.They should revise their coal investment strategy to improve existing pits capable of development, and stop the distortion whereby eight-tenths of investment is going into a small number of coalfields, including pits that will not even produce coal for the next 10 years. (Applause)And, in Mrs Thatcher\u2019s case, she should stop saying about the miners, as she said to the Financial Times: \u2018Some of their arguments apply just as much to exhausted pits as to uneconomic ones. If you listened to their arguments [though I never know when she did] you would go on pro­ducing mud to keep a community going.\u2019She ought not to have said things like that, because it only demonstrates her crass ignorance of miners and her gross misunderstanding of the issues in this dispute. There is not a miner who wants to take the purposeless risks of working an exhausted pit or a seam that is anywhere near to such uselessness. There are other occupations devoted to provide fruitless fripperies, and Mrs Thatcher may be used to them and paying exotic prices charged in those occupations; but they don\u2019t include coal mining.The fact is that there is no rational, financial, technical, economic or market reason for the Board and the government to keep the dispute going. Mrs Thatcher has no rational economic case for maintaining the dispute. She has no case based on costs; she has no case based on savings; no rational case. But she does have an irra­tional purpose in continuing the dispute: it is the purpose of political vanity on a manic scale. And she can only sustain that cause by uproar. That is all she has left now. That is the game.We must not play the game: we never have; we never will. It is their game not ours. They have used it through the ages. They have always created the conditions of disorder and then sought political credit out of the use of force against that eruption. (Applause)It is 50 years or more since they did it last. Fifty years in which people thought those days had gone for ever; fifty years in which another kind of Toryism which remembered the conflict and chaos of that system actually refused to operate that tactic.But now there is a different Toryism: one that is empty of all of the subtle and genteel concern; one that is devoid of consensus values; one that has no compassion, no instinct for conciliation. It is a Toryism that is all spite, bile and arrogance; it is a Toryism exhumed from the past - a Toryism led by an historical throwback, Margaret Thatcher.Ask the assorted retired senior civil servants; ask one or two bishops; ask the odd judge or two who in an assortment of statements (some with great salvos of publicity, others more subtly) are demonstrating that right across this society - yes, from the men and women struggling in the coalmining communities now, up to the lords and judges and all stations and classes and ages and sexes in between - the comprehension is grow­ing of the nature of the government that is ruling this country.The fact that she is tearing the society apart is therefore increasingly obvious: but perhaps what is less obvious is that it is exactly what Mrs Thatcher promised to do.This conference didn\u2019t need warning. This party tried to warn people. They thought we were exaggerating; they thought we were simply engaging in the partisan knock-about; they thought we were just trying to frighten people. There are millions in this country now who wished they had heeded our lessons, and under­stood that Thatcherism is a personal fixation turned into a system of government.That is the state of affairs. And in all economic policy, in all social policy, in their very appearance and their conduct of government, this gov­ernment creates the climate of confrontation, the conditions of conflict: it speaks only the language of conquest. And, in the midst of all of that chaos, in the midst of all that assault on the essentials of civilised life in this country and of values of this country, they call for the condemnation of vio­lence.I do not respond to that, because it is a taunt, a call to forswear intimidation from a government that bases its whole policy on intimidation. (Applause) I do condemn violence. I condemn the violence of despair; I condemn the violence of long-term unemployment; I condemn the violence of loneliness, decay, ugliness, and fear. I condemn the violence done to hope, the violence done to talent, the violence done to family sec­urity and family unity. I condemn the violence done to civil and personal rights in this country.I condemn the violence, too, of the stone-throw­ers and the battering-ram carriers. And I condemn the violence of the cavalry charges, the truncheon groups, and the shield bangers. (Applause) I condemn violence, I abominate vio­lence, I damn violence - all violence. All violence, without fear or favour. That\u2019s what I do, and that is what makes me different from Margaret Thatcher. I don\u2019t have her double standards (Applause). I do not take her selective and blinkered view of conflict.Of course, I do take sides in this dispute. I couldn\u2019t do otherwise with my background. But in any case, even if I didn\u2019t come from where I came from, I would find the case for coal compelling, and the case for the communities over­whelming. So I take sides in this dispute; this movement takes sides in this dispute. But the only side I am prepared to take when it comes to violence, is to oppose it. The prime minister should do the same thing, instead of delighting in turmoil and using the police as a replacement for policy.Yes, that she is doing, and the police know it too. (Applause) They realise that they are being made into the \u2018meat in the sandwich.\u2019 They realise the pressures are on them to make them depart from the most basic, resilient and most orderly value of British policing - the feeling that they have that they are citizens in uniform. They know that pressure is being applied by the government to make them move away from that tradition; and they also know what the cost, the bitter cost, of being the \u2018meat in the sandwich\u2019 will be. We will be paying that cost for a very long time to come in many of the mining communities.In our society on every side we see things being torn apart. We see terrible wrongs done to the young and the old, we see wrongs done to the poor and the disabled; we see industries decimated, communities deprived, liberties lost. We see unjust laws - laws which are nothing more than prejudice made statute. And every fibre rages against the injustice and the waste of all that. And we ask ourselves: what we can do about it? For socialists that is the question of the ages - because it is in our very nature, in our conviction, that we want to do something. Especially when it is injustice. It was a question faced by our move­ment in the 1930s; and they came back with the answer that the democratic road was the only route for British socialism. All other options, they said, were closed since socialism by insurrec­tion was pure fantasy, and socialism without the ballot box would simply never secure the support and understanding of the British people. They were right. (Applause) They were right in times even more dangerous than ours, when fascism was pressing of every gate of liberty. Democracy is the first premise of our socialism; it is a matter of principle, not of convenience; it is a matter of commonsense, not of tactics.With its absolutism, its dogmatism, its controls on local councils, its destruction of opportunities, its war on trade unionism, it is Toryism which defaces and relegates democracy in our country - not Labour, or the cause of Labour. (Applause)In saying that, we are not being smug and cosy, and giving in for the duration of the Tory govern­ment, when we hold to our belief in democracy.We are upholding the only system which can give us power; the only system that we want to give us power; and the only system that we are prepared to wield when we have that power. Democracy is our cause at all times and in every respect. (Applause) That is not a call to wait in idleness; it is not a call to relax until the election comes along. On the absolute contrary, it is a call to action - action to articulate and publicise the complaint of the people, for if they cry quietly, they will cry alone; action to break through the indifference to the scandals of social deprivation and industrial destruction in this country; action to pressure ministers and promote concessions; action to rouse and rally and resist; action to pro­tect and promote the interest of the people that we are in politics to help; action that is continual; action that recruits and mobilises new people in our cause.That is the action of democracy. We are democ­rats.At the earliest possible time we want to pass and enforce laws to redress grievances; to prom­ote justice and opportunity, to punish race and sex prejudice; to change economic ownership and rewards. We want the power of the law to do that - so we cannot sharpen legality as our main weapon for the future, and simultaneously scorn legality because it doesn't suit us at the present time. (Applause)To recognise that is not to be defeatist. It is to recognise the facts as they exist and as they are supported by the great mass of Labour people and Labour supporters in this country. To recognise that is not to bow down before a vague and variable idea called the \u2018sanctity of the law,\u2019 because we all know how that can be built and bent to defend massive interests. It is to acknow­ledge that our greatest service to those who need our protection and provision from different laws, is to get power and turf out the authors of the pre­sent injustice.We have to work for that incessantly, single-mindedly. It is a great cause but it is a care­ful and cool-headed cause. The people who need the support and safeguard of trade unionism and of public services, cannot afford to be part of any political \u2018Charge of the Light Brigade.\u2019 There is no glory in defeat for them; there is just nothing but extra miserable burdens of insecurity and insufficiency. In those circumstances, it is they - the poorest, the weakest, and the most needy - who are the martyrs. That\u2019s the fact.Our political mandate to change the Tory laws and conditions arises partly out of the evidence of their injustice. That exposure must be fierce and relentless; and, when we gain that mandate, we will use it with the full rigour of our power to pro­mote fairness and freedom, and to punish those who dodge their taxes, or pay sweatshop wages, or practise racialism, or any of the other evils of our society. We will do that, we will have the right to do it, and we will have the power to do it. And we will need that power. You see there is not an aspiration listed this week, or any other week, by this labour movement that will be fulfilled unless we achieve the power of democratic government. (Applause)Our ideals inspire, our policies offer the answers; but however much they intrigue us and encourage us, they are adornments, even enter­tainments, unless we have power to put them into practice. That is the reality. (Applause) That is what we know. That is the understanding. Grip it like you would grip a weapon, that reality; hold on to it as we, work for an election. Understand that we must have power to house the homeless; we must have power to release the poor; we must have power to provide care for the sick, to refash­ion and extend the National Health Service.Power to change the balance of power itself, to restore and develop the structure of democratic government in this country - so that local authorities can have real rights, and so trade unionism can have real rights in this country. We need the power to provide girls and women with the full practical entitlements of equality and no less. We need the power to take prejudice and partisanship out of industrial relations and trade union legislation. We need that power to respond to the needs of pensioners, and to give liberty, choice, comfort, and security in old age. We need the power to meet the justified demands of black people; that they shall have personal and economic status that is equal to any of this coun­try\u2019s citizens - regardless of their colour or creed. We need the power to provide the full equipment of educational training for our chil­dren. We need the power to provide the effective defence of our country and our values, by meet­ing the obligations of modern conventional defence and of alliance - without nuclear weapons, which by their possession make us a nuclear target and would by their use terminate our existence and all future forms of existence. (Applause)We need the power to work for peace and co­existence between East and West and to make it resilient and dependable. We need the power to achieve a new contract between the North and South of this planet, power to ensure that those countries of the Third World do not use up all of their pitiful earnings in debt repayments to the financiers of the industrial countries, but are able to achieve economic progress and freedom by using what they have and what they can be given to sponsor development, and become consumers instead of supplicants.Most of all, comrades, we want and we need power to operate a full policy for employment. It will not be the full employment conceived in the 1940s. It will not be the re-establishment of a society which is ethically, socially, and economically depended upon work for over 40 hours a week between the ages of 16 and 65 for most people - or, more accurately, for most men. Those days have gone, and they are not coming back. You and I know it, but what we need now is a policy for employment in this decade, and in the 1990s, and in the 21st century.This must have three main elements. First, it must be led by a strategy for investment that means that in the very course of expenditure we add value and strength to our economy. That means investment to use and to develop new technology, so that it is a servant and never a tyrant. It means investing in our economic infras­tructure of transportation, communication, construction and energy: Second, it must sponsor the growth of production and demand in order to deliberately generate jobs in our country. Third, it must also decrease the supply of people seeking employment through a shorter working year and a shorter working life. (Applause)The tasks of the modern world need extra prep­aration and we can get it by the comprehensive provision of extended education and training for youngsters, with reasonable pay so that they as individuals and their country collectively are bet­ter able to conquer the challenges of future employment, future, technology, and future development.And at the other end of working life, we need to provide for the gradual voluntary and systematic reduction in retirement age - both by the pro­vision of proper pensions, and by ensuring that the extra years of leisure are attractive and fulfil­ling, and not a condemnation to loneliness and semi-poverty.When people hear that message of a rational way of approaching the real employment, economic and technological requirements of our age, they say \u2018yes, we like that. Sponsor jobs and at the same time reduce the number of people needing to look for jobs in any given generation. We like that.\u2019 But, they say: \u2018Can it happen?\u2019My answer is: \u2018It\u2019s happening now.\u2019 But it is happening in the most clumsy and cruel way. Men and women in their early fifties are now being forced through redundancy into terminating their working life. Nobody asked them if they wanted to; nobody planned it; nobody made additional provision. They are out - and it\u2019s happening now. And for the youngsters, over a million under 25­ year-olds in our country are out of work, and many have never experienced full-time work. Can it happen? they ask. It is happening now, in the worst possible way. Better to civilise it, to turn it, to organise it; to make it supportive to the needs of the people, instead of making that change trample all over the people. That is why our approach is rational.And then they ask: \u2018Can we afford it?\u2019 I say that we are paying the price now, both in the direct £17,000 billion bills of unwanted idleness, and in the indirect but massive postponed costs of despair, of frustration, of conflict. The rational course is to recognise the change, and then to make it work to the advantage of the people. That is why we are socialists; that is why we seek power - to seek that mastery of change for the benefit of the people. If we don't, we shall see with terri­ble speed, and with awful results, the irrational response to technological and economic change which the market economy and he social market economy makes, and has always made - huge numbers of unemployed, millions more who live in a constant fear of unemployment and the insec­urity which it brings; and an affluent few who are safe in their jobs but in danger everywhere else.That isn\u2019t the society we want. In short we want a new concept. Modern full employment by these means before we allow the advent of an unpre­cedented scale of mass unemployment. That is not an option which we will tolerate. I\u2019ll tell you why I won\u2019t tolerate it, in the simplest terms: it is not an option that I am prepared to offer my child­ren, and therefore it is not an option that I am prepared to offer my children, and therefore it is not an option I am prepared to offer anybody else\u2019s children, either. (Applause)That, above all, is why we need power. Let us in this labour movement together with the people of this country plan for it carefully. Let us have the courage to make honest choices and practical priorities; let us work for it together. And when we win, let us use that power to keep our promise of liberty and of peace. For that isn\u2019t just the way to get power, it is also the way to keep power. (Applause)

aVIn thanking you, Mr. President, for that wonderful welcome, my first words must be of gratitude to those who organised this Conference and looked after our security, bringing us safely to this great meeting.There are many here today who still bear the scars of injury and bereavement inflicted last year by terrorists when they struck in the hours of darkness. It reminds us of the risks we all take and will continue to take for freedom. I should like, too, to say a word about our friend and colleague John Gummer, whose dedication and tirelessness in those traumatic hours and for many days afterwards won universal admiration. We thank him for his Chairmanship of our Party, for his unfailing sense of duty and loyalty, and wish him well in his new work as a member of our ministerial team. Nobody could have followed this Conference or listened to the speeches made here this week without being struck by one overriding impression. It has been a serious, friendly and responsible Conference, a conference of those who know what it means for a political party to hold office, a conference of those who understand the realities of power exercised responsibly, the limitations, the dilemmas and the agonised choices which face those in government. Thank you for a marvellous Conference.Not for us the partisan rhetoric of class warfare, uttered with clenched fists through clenched lips. Not for us the bland never blueprints of those who have never sweated on the actual building site of responsible office, nor ever will. For us the keynote has been idealism tempered by realism, and I am sure you have been very impressed by the quality and confidence of our whole team of Ministers.For my part, I would like to add my congratulations and thanks to all those who have taken the Chair at this Conference with skill and unfailing good humour. In our Party we really rather like one another.It is ten years, Mr. President, as you reminded us, since I first addressed this Conference as Leader, in the same town - we all love Blackpool - in the same hall and on this same platform. I remember that meeting as though it were yesterday - the welcome, the warmth, the generous support that came from the hall. I already knew only too well the task that faced me, but I had not fully realised the strength that would be given to me by our people, and it was to sustain me first in the years of Opposition and then as Prime Minister.In that speech I said that it was not part of my purpose to preside over the continuing decline of Britain, over diminishing international esteem, or over the ebb of our independent spirit. I also said it was no part of my policy to perpetuate Socialism by proxy. Do you remember the Labour Britain of 1979? It was a Britain in which union leaders held their members and our country to ransom; a Britain that still went to international conferences but was no longer taken seriously; a Britain that was known as the sick man of Europe and which spoke the language of compassion but which suffered the winter of discontent. Government had failed to tackle the real problems. They dodged difficult problems rather than face up to them. The question they asked was not \u2018will the medicine work?\u2019 but \u2018will it taste alright?\u2019When we Conservatives said \u2018this is the way,\u2019 they said \u2018forget it.\u2019 We were told \u2018you can\u2019t reform trade union leaders; you can\u2019t reform trade unions, their leaders won\u2019t let you.\u2019 But we did. We were told \u2018you can\u2019t abolish price and wage controls; inflation will go up.\u2019 But we did, and it came down. We were told \u2018you can\u2019t give council tenants the right to buy. But we did and the houses sold like hot cakes.\u2019 They said \u2018you can\u2019t denationalise; the unions won\u2019t wear it.\u2019 But we did, and the workforce positively snapped up the shares. And we were told \u2018you\u2019ll never stand a major industrial strike, let alone a coal strike.\u2019 It lasted a whole year but we did just that \u2013 and won.It was a strike conducted with violence and intimidation on the picket line and in the villages. Yet Labour supported that strike to the bitter end. Indeed, three months into the strike Mr. Kinnock told Mr. Scargill publicly that there was \u2018no alternative but to fight - all other roads are shut off.\u2019What do you think would have happened if Mr. Scargill had won? I think the whole country knows the answer - Neil would have knelt. Courage is not making a speech in Bournemouth long after the event. Courage is what you show in the heat of the battle, not at the post-mortem.Real courage was the courage shown by the working mines, by the working lorry drivers, by the working railwaymen, by the working steelmen, by the working dockers - the very people the Labour Party disowned. But we Conservatives stood with them, the nation stood with us, and a major strike called without a ballot of its members failed. It was a notable victory for a free law-abiding people and their freely elected democratic government.In the six and a half years we have served the nation, much has been achieved. It has been said at this Conference many times but let me repeat it. The nation\u2019s output, the nation\u2019s investment, the nation\u2019s standard of living are at an all time high. Inflation is down, and this morning we heard that it had gone down further. Personal ownership is growing. Our overseas assets have multiplied more than six-fold in six years. They now bring us an annual income of some £3,000 million a year. There are 700 additional new businesses starting up every week. Indeed, for the first time in our history the number of companies in Britain has topped one million.Rates of income tax are down. Three major taxes have been abolished, and on Wednesday you heard my next door neighbour, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in confident mood. On the social services, you have heard me say that the Health Service was safe with us. So it was, so it is, and so it will be. But our opponents have conducted a relentless campaign to convey the opposite. The only way to nail a lie constantly repeated is to repeat the truth even more frequently.We have more doctors and nurses and they are treating more patients than ever. And it took a Conservative Government to give the nurses the independent Pay Review Body for which they were asked. The Royal College of Nursing had said consistently over the years: \u2018Our nurses never strike. The patient comes first.\u2019Pensioners too have been the object of a sustained and particularly cruel campaign of false propaganda. Let me say this to every pensioner. The basic pension goes on. That was never in doubt. And if anyone tells you otherwise, don\u2019t believe them. Under this Conservative Government the pension has been increased by more than prices. And when it goes up again next month it will be worth more than ever before. All this is a remarkable record of which every Conservative can be proud. But there is much more to do.I am only too painfully aware of the problem of unemployment. It affects not only Britain but the whole of Europe. But that does nothing to relieve the anxiety and frustration of someone who can\u2019t find a job. People say: \u2018You do understand?\u2019 Of course, I do. There is no problem which occupies more of my thinking and that of my colleagues. Scarcely a day passes without the Government looking at new ways of speeding job creation. People say: \u2018make it easier for firms to take on more employees.\u2019 We have done. We\u2019ve abolished Labour\u2019s tax on jobs and this week we cut National Insurance contributions for the lower paid. They say: \u2018Help people to start up in business on their own.\u2019 We\u2019re doing that by the highly successful enterprise allowance, and by cutting red tape. Though heaven knows there\u2019s plenty still to be cut.They say: \u2018Train more young people.\u2019 We are, with the largest youth training programme this country has ever seen. The millionth young person will join before Christmas. That is a great achievement. I have seen it at work myself - in Glasgow and Chester, in Wrexham and Surrey, in Cornwall and all over the country. Young people working hard and well, many of them taken on later by the employer who has trained them.And we are expanding this programme so that everyone under the age of 18 can have either job or education or training, and unemployment will not be an option. People say, too - we heard it again at the conference; so many of these things we have heard here \u2013 \u2018Give the unemployed the chance to work for the community.\u2019 Right. We have expanded the community programme to 230,000 people next year. Then they say: \u2018Let more people retire early.\u2019 Many companies are doing just that, and the Government have special schemes which enable some to retire to make way for others looking for work.We are doing all these things, and a lot more beside, but I will not list them all. But there is one thing we will not do. We will not reflate. We are sometimes told by politicians and pollsters that people would prefer more inflation and less unemployment. You cannot choose to have either inflation or unemployment. They are not alternatives.Past Governments have tried that. They have deliberately created inflation in the hope of reducing unemployment. It always finished up with worse inflation and worse unemployment. You cannot build a secure future on dishonest money.There is a fundamental truth from truth from which no Government can escape. It is customers who create business, and it is business which creates jobs. And it is happening. In the last two years, some 650,000 additional jobs have been created, more than in the rest of the European Community put together. The jobs are coming and enterprise is returning to Britain. That is where the new jobs will come from.I share the deep concern of parents about the education of our children. The basic teaching you receive in school can influence the rest of your life and shape your whole future. Today, more money is being spent per pupil than ever before. There are more teachers proportionately to pupils than ever before. Their training is better than ever before. But, alas, that has not solved all the difficulties.We are all worried about the teachers\u2019 strike and its effect on the children. The burden on heads and deputy heads is enormous, and we are very much aware of the strains on them and on many teachers, So, some £1,250 million of your money has therefore been pledged in pay for teachers over and above the annual increases. That would mean pay scales in November next year running from £7,500 a year for a new graduate to more than £24,000 for the head of a big secondary school with much better promotion opportunities in between. By the way, I notice that the Labour Opposition regard £20,000 a year as their definition of the rich to be soaked up by higher taxes. I do not agree, and I do not suppose that those head teachers do either.We believe that this offer would not only be a fair deal for teachers but it would enable us, first, to have a salary system which would reward the better teachers, and, second, to spell out teachers duties clearly so that we can get rid of all the arguments. I most earnestly hope that this strike will soon be settled. Teachers should lead by example, and this is a bad one.While many parents are well content with the education their children are receiving, the story for some, especially in the inner city areas, is very different: poor examination results; lack of good discipline; the unhappiness which some quiet and sensitive children sometimes suffer; political indoctrination in our schools; and the attempts by some local education authorities to control the curriculum and use it for political ends. No wonder parents are worried, and so are a lot of the teachers, especially those who have to deal with disruptive pupils who make their tack difficult and exhausting. What is more, when teachers take disciplinary measures they do not always receive the backing from the local education authority which they are entitled to expect. Some teachers and parents are speaking out. Those who believe, as we do, that the schools of this country are for teaching and learning and not for political indoctrination. In the debate we had you pulled no punches. I prefer it that way. I believe that you performed a public service by bringing this matter into the open, and Sir Keith and his colleagues will do everything in their power to root out this pernicious influence and to see that our children have the education to which they are entitled.Last week at his party conference, the Labour leader gave what we were told was a clarion call to moderation in the Labour party. It was, announced Labour\u2019s deputy leader - now there is an unbiased observer - a turning point in history. But \u2018by their fruits ye shall know them.\u2019 So never mind the PR, let us have a look at the policies.Last week at Bournemouth the Labour party voted to scrap the laws which give union members a secret ballot and to hand back to the leaders, those barons of the block vote, their former feudal powers. They voted to give up the British independent nuclear deterrent for nothing in return. They voted to take political control over the operations of the police. They voted to indemnify councils and trade unions who choose to break the law for political ends. Anything else? I have hardly started.Here are some Labour policies for the next general election in two or three years\u2019 time. They would nationalise and renationalise our industry with scant regard for the newly accrued shares of employees. There would be no automatic right to buy your own council house. Decisions would be left to Labour councils such as Sheffield, Hackney and Camden, and you can imagine what sort of a deal you would get from them.And Labour would hijack and direct the pension and insurance fund money of some 12 million people. Independent schools would go, and quickly. There would be the usual mishmash of higher taxes and, I need hardly say, higher borrowing. \u2018To borrow and. to borrow and to borrow\u2019 is not Macbeth with a heavy cold. It is Labour party policy. But most people do not want to mortgage the future and leave their children to pick up the bill.Labour\u2019s banner reads \u2018Back!\u2019 Back to a high tax society. Back to the old days of inflation by social contract. Back to rule by Congress House, when the Labour party was a wholly owned subsidiary of the unions.The Labour party, Mr President, is two different factions in a state of civil war, with the Left steadily gaining ground. As the oldstagers retire or are forced out, they are replaced by the new militant Left. You can see socialism in action today in the council chambers of local government - in Liverpool, Lambeth, Haringey - and many others, so vividly described at this conference. That is what it would be like if Labour ever got power at Westminster.The militant Left will not be beaten by brave words and ritual disclaimers. If the Labour leadership is genuinely against these people why do they not expel them? Is not the real reason that they are a bigger and bigger part of the Labour party and that the present leadership cannot do without them?And where do the so-called Alliance stand? Take defence. Did we see them reaffirm one-sided disarmament or did they decide this year to keep a few missiles? Or is it only the ones that are out of date they would keep? Or is it a case of defending all of the people some of the time or some of the people all of the time? It is all very confusing. Those who want the country to have a strong and sure defence can\u2019t rely on the Labour Party, the SDP or the Liberals. They can rely on us.By the end of this century, it is predicted that several more countries will have acquired nuclear weapons. Labour wants Britain to give them up. At the very time when any sensible person would be renewing his insurance cover, Labour wants to cancel Britain\u2019s policy altogether. Moreover, they want to get rid of American bases from Britain and all nuclear weapons from British soil.Does anyone who has witnessed Mr. Gorbachev\u2019s performance think that he respects weakness? No, it is recognition of the West\u2019s strength and cohesion that has brought the Soviet Union back to the negotiating table. Our wish is to see substantial reductions in nuclear weapons, provided they are balanced and verifiable. I know that will be President Reagan\u2019s objective at his meeting with Mr. Gorbachev, and he has our full support and good wishes as he goes to Geneva. The West could have no better or braver champion.The whole country is rightly concerned about security at home, about violence in the streets. We utterly condemn anyone and everyone who takes part in riots in Britain. Whoever these people are who riot, burn and murder; whoever they are organised by, there is no excuse, no justification whatsoever, for such crime and vandalism. Those who take to the streets on the first available pretext, to fire, loot and plunder, will be subject to the full rigours of the criminal law.In Tottenham and Handsworth the police suffered a hail of bricks and petrol bombs, apparently ready to hand. Yet one of the delegates to the Labour Party Conference was loudly applauded when he called the police \u2018The Enemy.\u2019 \u2018Enemy\u2019? The overwhelming majority of the British people regard the police as friends: they admire and are deeply thankful for the courage of the police and the courage of their families.It isn\u2019t the police who create threats to public order. All too often they are the victims, as we saw only too tragically at Tottenham. Nor is it social conditions that generate violence. Yes, unemployment breeds frustration. But it\u2019s an insult to the unemployed to suggest that a man who doesn\u2019t have a job is likely to break the law.In the 1930s, when unemployment was proportionately higher, and virtually unrelieved by benefits, crime levels were not higher, they were lower. In parts of the world where the standard of living is high, the environment attractive, and jobs are relatively plentiful - parts of America for example - crime is worse than in Britain.In a free country everyone has to choose. And the overwhelming majority of our fellow citizens - black or white, in or out of work, living in the suburbs or city centres - freely make their choice. They respect the law; and they will have no truck with crime masquerading as social protest. The government will continue steadfastly to back the police.If they need more men, more equipment, different equipment, they shall have them. We don\u2019t economise on protecting life and property.And we shall oppose politicians, national or local, who want to interfere in the operational independence of the police. There is no place for politics in policing. But our concern about violence goes far beyond the riots.A child abused, perhaps destroyed, within her own home can\u2019t begin to know where, if anywhere, to look for safety. An elderly couple, nervous to step outside their home shouldn\u2019t have to look about them in fear. A teenager who\u2019s slid towards drugs may no longer he able to help himself. Who is to answer the child crying for help? Who is to protect the elderly couple? Who can win back the youngster hooked on drugs? Police, social workers, the voluntary organisations all must, and do, respond, but that\u2019s not enough. We are the neighbours of that child, of that elderly couple, of that youngster. Upholding the law can\u2019t he left to the police and the courts alone. We are all involved. We cannot pass by on the other side. Government apart, the strengths of a civilised nation depend on the natural authority of the family, the school, the church and our great institutions. It is when that authority weakens and it has weakened that nations turn to the power of the State. When the power of the state increases, the dignity of the individual declines. Our national character and greatness was not founded on the all-embracing power of government. It was not founded on material worth. It was founded on freedom, orderly freedom, within the law. For without law, there can he no freedom.In Britain today we have seen the hard left operating within our political system, conspiring through union power or local government to break, defy and subvert the law. Because the Labour Party will not expel these people, a unique responsibility is placed on today\u2019s Conservative Party and Government. We have to conserve the rule of law itself, conserve it for people of all parties and of none.That is our overriding duty. Success will require the cooperation of every law-abiding citizen. No one can opt out.Come with us, then, towards the next decade. Let us together set our sights on a Britain where three out of four families own their home, where owning shares is as common as having a car, where families have a degree of independence their forefathers could only dream about; a Britain where there is a resurgence of enterprise with more people self-employed, more businesses and therefore more jobs; a Britain where there is a standard of healthcare far better than anything we have ever known, where savings keep their value and where people can look forward to their retirement, certain of their pension and confident of its buying power; a Britain where standards in our schools are a source of pride and where law-abiding men and women go their way in tranquillity with their children, knowing that their neighbourhood is safe and their country secure.Step by step we are rolling back the frontiers of socialism and returning power to the people. Yes, we have set our sights high. But these goals are within our reach. Let us ensure that we bring them within our grasp.

aVMr. President, this week at Bournemouth, we\u2019ve had a most responsible conference: the conference of a party which was the last government, is the present government, and will be the next government. We have heard from ministers a series of forward-looking policies which are shaping the future of our country and not only from ministers, but from the body of the hall has come speech after speech of advice, encouragement and commitment. We are a party which knows what it stands for and what it seeks to achieves. We are a party which honours the past that we may build for the future.Last week, at Blackpool, the Labour party made the bogus claim that it was \u2018putting people first.\u2019 Putting people first? Last week, Labour voted to remove the right to a secret ballot before a strike. Voted to remove the precious right we gave to trade union members to take their union to a court of law.Putting people first? Last week Labour voted for the state to renationalise British Telecom and British Gas, regardless of the millions of people who have been able to own shares for the first time in their lives. Putting people first? They voted to stop the existing right to buy council houses, a policy which would kill the hopes and dreams of so many families. Labour may say they put people first: but their conference voted to put government first and that means putting people last.What the Labour party of today wants is: housing municipalised, industry nationalised, the police service politicised, the judiciary radicalised, union membership tyrannised, and above all - and most serious of all - our defences neutralised. Never. Not in Britain.We have two other oppositions who have recently held their conferences, the Liberals and the SDP. Where they\u2019re not divided they\u2019re vague, and where they\u2019re not vague they\u2019re divided. At the moment they appear to be engaged in a confused squabble about whether or not Polaris should be abandoned or replaced or renewed or re-examined and if so, when; and how; and possibly why? if they can\u2019t agree on the defence of our country, they can\u2019t agree on anything. Where Labour has its Militant Tendency, they have their muddled tendency. I\u2018ll have rather more to say about defence later.Conservative moralityBut just now I want to speak about Conservative policies, policies which spring from deeply held beliefs. The charge is sometimes made that our policies are only concerned with money and efficiency. I am the first to acknowledge that morality is not and never was been the monopoly of any one party, nor do we claim that it is. But we do claim that it is the foundation of our policiesWhy are we Conservatives so opposed to inflation? Only because it puts up prices? No, because it destroys the value of people\u2019s savings, because it destroys jobs. And with it people\u2019s hopes. That\u2019s what the fight against inflation is all about. Why have we limited the power of trade unions? Only to improve productivity? No, because trade union members, want to be protected from intimidation and to go about their daily lives in peace like everyone else in the land.Why have we allowed people to buy shares in nationalised industries? Only to improve efficiency? No. To spread the nation\u2019s wealth among as many people as possible. Why are we setting up new kinds of schools in our towns and cities? To create privilege? To give families in some of our inner cities greater choice in the education of their children, a choice denied them by their Labour councils. Enlarging choice is rooted in our Conservative tradition, without choices talk of morality is an idle and an empty thing.Britain\u2019s industrial futureMr. President, the theme of our conference this week is the next move forward. We have achieved a lot in seven short years. But there is still a great deal to be done for our country.  The whole industrial world, not just Britain, is seeing change at a speed that our forebears never contemplated, much of it due to new technology. Old industries are declining, new ones are taking their place, traditional jobs are being taken over by computers, people are choosing to spend their money in new ways. Leisure, pleasure, sport and travel, all these are big business today. We would be foolish to pretend that this transition can be accomplished without problems, but it would be equally foolish to pretend that a country like Britain, which is so heavily dependent on trade with others, can somehow ignore what is happening in the rest of the world, can behave as if these great events have nothing to do with us, can resist change. Yet that is exactly what Labour proposes to do: they want to put back the clock and set back the country.Back to state direction and controls, back to the old levels of over-manning, back to the old inefficiency, back to making life difficult for the very people on who the future of Britain depends.  The wealth creators, the scientists, the engineers, the designers, the managers, the inventors all those on who we rely to create the industries and jobs of the future. What supreme folly. It defies all common sense.JobsAs do those Labour policies which, far from putting people first, would put them out of jobs. The prospects of young people would be blighted by Labour\u2019s minimum wage policy because people could not then afford to employ them and give them a start in life. A quarter of a million jobs could be at risk. many thousands of jobs would go from closing down American nuclear bases.Labour want sanctions against South Africa. Tens of thousands of people could lose their jobs in Britain, quite apart from the devastating consequences for black South Africans. Out would go jobs at existing nuclear power stations. Whatever happened to Harold Wilson\u2019s \u2018white heat of technological revolution\u2019?On top of all this, jobs would also suffer as would-be investors in Britain took one look at Labour and decided to set up elsewhere. Labour say they would create jobs. But those policies would destroy jobs. This government has created the climate that\u2019s produced a million extra jobs over the past three years. Here in Britain, it is encouraging that more of the population are in work than in Italy, or France, or Germany.Nevertheless, as you heard yesterday, more has to be done, and is being done. Meanwhile no other country in Europe can rival our present range of help for people to train, retrain and find jobs.And would like just to say, Mr. President: training is not a palliative for unemployment. It will play an ever-larger part in our whole industrial life. For only modern, efficient industry and commerce will produce the jobs our people need.Popular capitalismOur opponents would have us believe that all problems can be solved by state intervention. But governments should not run business. Indeed, the weakness of the case for state ownership has become all too apparent. For state planners do not have to suffer the consequences of their mistakes. It\u2019s the taxpayers who have to pick up the bill. This government has rolled back the frontiers of the state and will roll them back still further.  So popular is our policy that it\u2019s being taken up all round the world. From France to the Philippines, from Jamaica to Japan, from Malaysia to Mexico, from Sri Lanka to Singapore, privatisation is on the move. There\u2019s even a special Oriental version in China. The policies we have pioneered are catching on in country after country. We Conservatives believe in popular capitalism, believe in a property owning democracy - and it works!Power to the peopleIn Scotland recently, I was present at the sale of the millionth council house: to a lovely family with two children who can at last call their home their own. Now let\u2019s go for the second million! And what\u2019s more, millions have already become shareholders, and soon there will be opportunities for millions more, in British Gas, British Airways, British airports and Rolls Royce. Who says we\u2019ve run out of steam, we\u2019re in our prime! The great political reform of the last century was to enable more and more people to have a vote. Now the great Tory reform of this century is to enable more and more people to own property.Popular capitalism is nothing less than a crusade to enfranchise the many in the economic life of the nation. We Conservatives are returning power to the people. That is the way to one nation, one people.Return of national prideYou may have noticed there are many people who just can\u2019t bear good news. It\u2019s a sort of infection of the spirit and there\u2019s a lot of it about, in the eyes of these hand-wringing merchants of gloom and despondency. Everything that Britain does is wrong. Any setback. However small. Any little difficulty, however local, is seen as incontrovertible proof that the situation is hopeless. Their favourite word is crisis: it\u2019s a crisis when the price of oil goes up and a crisis when the price of oil comes down. It\u2019s a crisis if you don\u2019t build new roads. it\u2019s a crisis when you do. It\u2019s a crisis if Nissan does not come here. And it\u2019s a crisis when it does.What a rotten time these people must have, running round running everything down. Especially when there\u2019s so much to be proud of. Inflation at its lowest level for twenty years. The basic rate of tax at its lowest level for forty years. the number of strikes at their lowest level for fifty years. The great advances in science and industry. The achievement of millions of our people in creating new enterprises and new jobs. The outstanding performance of the arts and music and entertainment worlds. And the triumphs of our sportsmen and women. They all do Britain proud. And we are mighty proud of them.Conservatives careOur opponents, having lost the political argument, try another tack! They try to convey the impression that we don\u2019t care. So let\u2019s take a close look at those who make this charge, they\u2019re the ones who supported and maintained Mr. Scargill\u2019s coal strike for a whole year, hoping to deprive industry, homes and pensioners of power to heat and light. They\u2019re the ones who supported the strike in the health service which lengthened the waiting time for operations just when we were getting it down; they\u2019re the ones who supported the teachers\u2019 dispute which disrupted our children\u2019s education. They are those Labour councillors who constantly accuse the police of provocation when they deal with violent crime and drugs in the worst areas of our inner cities. We\u2019re not going to take any lessons in caring from people with that sort of record. We care profoundly about the right of people to be protected against crime, hooliganism and the evil of drugs. The mugger, the rapist, the drug trafficker, the terrorist. All must suffer the full rigour of the law. And that\u2019s why this party and this government consistently back the police and the courts of law, in Britain and Northern Ireland. For without the rule of law there can be no liberty.It\u2019s because we care deeply about the health service that we\u2019ve launched the biggest hospital building programme in this country\u2019s history. Statistics tell only part of the story.  But this government is devoting more resources of all kinds to the health service than any previous government. Over the past year or so, I\u2019ve visited five hospitals. In the North West, at Barrow in Furness I visited the first new hospital in that district since the creation of the health service forty years ago. In the North East another splendid new hospital. At North Tyneside, with the most wonderful maternity unit and children\u2019s wards. Just north of London I went round St Alban\u2019s hospital where new wards have been opened and new buildings are underway. I visited the famous Elizabeth Garrett Anderson hospital for women, which this government saved. The service it provides is very special and greatly appreciated. And then last week I went back to the royal Sussex Country hospital in Brighton, to open the new renal unit. Many of us have cause to be very thankful for that Brighton hospital, everywhere patients were loud in their praise of the treatment they received from doctors and nurses whose devotion and skill we all admire. This government\u2019s record on the health service is a fine one. We\u2019re proud of it and we must see to it that people know how much we\u2019ve done. Of course there are problems still to be solved. The fact that there\u2019s no waiting list in one area does not help you if you have to wait for an operation in your area. It doesn\u2019t help if there\u2019s a new hospital going up somewhere else. But not where you\u2019d really like it.We are tackling these problems, and we shall go on doing so. Because our commitment to the National Health Service is second to none.  We\u2019ve made great progress already. The debate we had on Wednesday, with its telling contributions from nurses and doctors in the health service, was enormously helpful to us. It\u2019s our purpose to work together and to continue steadily to improve the services that are provided in hospital and community alike.This is Conservatives putting care into action and we care deeply that retired people should never again see their hard-earned savings decimated by runaway inflation. For example, take the pensioner who retired in 1963 with a thousand pounds of savings. Twenty years later, in 1983, it was only worth one hundred and sixty pounds. That is why we will never relent in the battle against inflation. It has to be fought and won every year. We care passionately about the education of our children. Time and again we hear three basic messages: bring back the three Rs into our schools; bring back relevance into the curriculum; and bring back discipline into our classrooms.  The fact is that education at all levels - teachers, training colleges, administrators - has been infiltrated by a permissive philosophy of self-expression. And we are now reaping the consequences which, for some children have been disastrous. Money by itself will not solve this problem, money will not raise standards, but by giving parents greater freedom to choose; by allowing head teachers greater control in their school; by laying down national standards of syllabus and attainment; I am confident that we can really improve the quality of education. Improve it not just in the twenty new schools, but in every school in the land. And we\u2019ll back every teacher, head teacher and administrator who shares these ideals. We care most of all about our country\u2019s security. The defence of the realm transcends all other issues. It is the foremost responsibility of any government and any Prime Minister. For forty years, every government of this country of every political persuasion has understood the need for strong defences: by maintaining and modernising Britain\u2019s independent nuclear deterrents; by membership of the NATO alliance, an alliance based on nuclear deterrence; and by accepting, and bearing in full, the obligations which membership brings. All this was common ground.Last week, the Labour party abandoned that ground. In a decision of the utmost gravity, Labour voted to give up Britain\u2019s independent nuclear deterrent unilaterally. Labour would also require the United States to remove its nuclear weapons from our soil and to close down its nuclear bases: weapons and bases which are vital not only for Britain\u2019s defence but for the defence of the entire Atlantic Alliance.Furthermore, Labour would remove Britain altogether from the protection of America\u2019s nuclear umbrella, leaving us totally unable to deter a nuclear attack, for you cannot deter with conventional weapons an enemy which has, and could threaten to use, nuclear weapons. Exposed to the threat of nuclear blackmail, there would be no option but surrender.  Labour\u2019s defence policy - though defence is scarcely the word - is an absolute break with the defence policy of every British government since the Second World War. Let there be no doubt about the gravity of that decision - you cannot be a loyal member of NATO while disavowing its fundamental strategy. A Labour Britain would be a neutralist Britain. It would be the greatest gain for the Soviet Union in forty years, and they would have got it without firing a shot. I believe this total reversal of Labour\u2019s policy for the defence of our country will have come as a shock to many of Labour\u2019s traditional supporters.It was Labour\u2019s Nye Bevan who warned his party against going naked into the conference chamber; it was Labour\u2019s Hugh Gaitskell who promised the country to fight, fight and fight again against the unilateral disarmers in his own party. That fight was continued by his successors. Today the fight is over; the present leadership are the unilateral disarmers. The Labour party of Attlee, of Gaitskell, of Wilson is dead, and no one has more surely killed it than the present leader of the Labour party. There are some policies which can be reversed, but weapon development and production takes years and years. Moreover, by repudiating NATO\u2019s nuclear strategy, Labour would fatally weaken the Atlantic Alliance and the United States\u2019 commitment to Europe\u2019s defence. The danger caused by Labour\u2019s policies would be irrevocable - not only present but future generations would be at risk.Of course there are fears about the terrible destructive power of nuclear weapons. But it is the balance of nuclear forces which has preserved peace for forty years in a Europe which twice in the previous thirty years tore itself to pieces. Preserved peace not only from nuclear war, but from conventional war in Europe as well. And it has saved the young people of two generations from being called up to fight as their parents and grandparents were. As Prime Minister, I could not remove that protection from the lives of present and future generations. Let every nation know that Conservative governments, now and in the future, will keep Britain\u2019s obligations to its allies. The freedom of all its citizens and the good name of our country depend upon it. This weekend, President Reagan and Mr. Gorbachev are meeting in Reykjavik. Does anyone imagine that Mr. Gorbachev would be prepared to talk at all if the West had already disarmed? It is the strength and unity of the West, which has brought the Russians to the negotiating table. The policy of Her Majesty\u2019s opposition is a policy that would help our enemies and harm our friends. it totally misjudges the character of the British people. After the Liberal Party conference, after the SDP conference, after the Labour party conference, there is now only one party in this country with an effective policy for the defence of the realm. That party is the Conservative party.Throughout this conference, we have heard of the great achievements of the last seven years. Their very success now makes possible the next moves forward, which you have seen set out this week, and we shall complete the manifesto for the next election within the next eighteen months. That manifesto will be a programme for further bold and radical steps in keeping with our most deeply held beliefs. We do our best for our country when we are true to our convictions. As we look forward to the next century, we have a vision of the society we wish to see. The vision we all serve.We want to see a Britain where there is an ever-widening spread of ownership, with the independence and dignity it brings, a Britain which takes care of the weak in their time of need. We want to see a Britain where the spirit of enterprise is strong enough to conquer unemployment north and south. A Britain in which the attitude of \u2018them and us\u2019 has disappeared from our lives. We want to see a Britain whose schools are a source of pride and where education brings out the best in every child. A Britain where excellence and effort are valued and honoured. we want to see a Britain where our streets are free from fear, day and night. And above all, he wants to see a Britain which is respected and trusted in the world which values the great benefits of living in a free society and is determined to defend them. Our duty is to safeguard our country\u2019s interests and to be reliable friends and allies. The failure of the other parties to measure up to what is needed places an awesome responsibility upon us.I believe that we have an historic duty to discharge that responsibility and to carry into the future all that is best and unique in Britain. I believe that our party is uniquely equipped to do it. I believe the interests of Britain can now only be served by a third Conservative victory.

aVComrades, it is at this point in conference, immediately following the merit awards, that I feel that my journey is in vain. When Catherine Griffiths was talking to me there, a South Walean woman, a former district nurse exactly like my mother, she said as she stepped back: \u2018I would have made a speech if I could have remembered.\u2019 (Laughter) And I thought, well, Cath, I have the next few minutes and if I do what you have done in the time allotted to you then it will be quite remarkable. (Applause)Comrades, this conference is dominated by the fact that we meet in the shadow of defeat. Indeed it is that fact which, to all intents and purposes, dominates our agenda, sets our agenda. For we know that out of that defeat we must build victory. We do not therefore go into a period of mourning, for that would be sheer self-indulgence. Instead, we use defeat for its only useful purpose: instruction. We learn from our defeat, and we learn hard enough and deep enough to ensure that it is the last defeat that will be inflicted upon our movement. (Applause)That need for learning, that need for instruction, is well understood by this party, as you demonstrated in those overwhelming votes on the review yesterday. There are many lessons to learn and we shall learn them. And as we set about the task I think it is helpful in preparing ourselves for that task of review, of assessment, of analysis, of learning, to remind ourselves without any complacency that there were features of that election which we lost that provide us with foundations of confidence. I say again, without complacency, there were features of that election which meant that, yes, we were defeated, but we certainly were not beaten - certainly not like so many of the commentators and anticipators and watchers of the runes and readers of the tea leaves would have had us believe just weeks before that election started.Amongst those foundations of confidence is the fact, first, that we significantly increased the number of women Labour MPs - not enough, but a firm step in the right direction.Second, our party achieved the election of our black Members of Parliament, and by that means saw to it that we began to have a multi­racial parliament to reflect our multi-racial society. (Applause)Third, among these foundations of confidence is the fact that we made very substantial gains in Scotland, Wales and the North of England, and the people who supported us there and everywhere else deserve our thanks and have our thanks. And they have this tribute too: all over this country, all over England, Wales and Scotland, we shall not be taking their support for granted. We regard their support as a spur to greater and more successful efforts, not as any excuse for relaxation.Fourth, in the foundations of confidence, it is also the case that we did have a very good campaign - not just at the levels that received the most attention and publicity, but, in many ways even more impor­tantly, right through the whole of this party. I want to use this conference to thank people throughout the movement for the unprecedented efforts made everywhere - politically and organisationally - to try to ensure that Labour would win and therefore that Britain would win. That campaign gave people throughout this party energy, pride and confi­dence. And those feelings stay with us even in defeat. That is important: for it is those qualities of energy, of pride, and of confidence that give this party the courage to be candid, the boldness to be honest, with everyone else and with ourselves.That is the spirit in which we shall undertake this review; and that was the spirit, I believe, in which the conference took its decision yesterday. That review will be thorough. It will spread across the whole field of policy, leaving nothing out. It will ensure that the programme that we develop in this party is directly related to the conditions that we shall encounter before and during and after the next occasion on which we get the chance to bid for power in a general election. For the task of the review is not to adjust our focus on the past: the task of that review is to give us a clear and accurate perception of the future. The question of whether the policies were right or wrong in June 1987 is of course a matter of some interest - indeed, it is a starting point. But the question of whether the policies will be right or wrong for 1991 must be the matter of the most profound and supreme importance. That is the dominant consideration of that review. That is the frame of mind in which we proceed.It appears, however, that there are still some who are timid about the idea of \u2018review.\u2019 They seem to have \u2018do not disturb\u2019 notices hung on their minds. The very activity of examination is described by some as a \u2018betrayal of fundamental principles.\u2019 I must say I have a very different opinion of \u2018review.\u2019 I believe that after losing three general elections any serious political party that did not undertake the assessment, the review, the examination - and do it honestly - that party would be betraying its principles and its policies and its people. (Applause)Indeed I have to say that it is from those people who want us to win that the demand for such a review comes. It has not been dreamt up by Tom Sawyer or by Walworth Road or by the party leadership. Everywhere I have been in the last four months in England, Scotland and Wales I have talked to our party members, talked to trade unionists, talked to supporters. And anyone who has done the same in our movement will know that it is they who are asking for the review. That demand does not come from people who are defeatist, panic stricken or suffering apolitical identity crisis. On the contrary, the demand for the review comes from people who are very sure of their political identity, of their ideals, of their principles. So sure, indeed, that they do not think that their convictions will expire like some fragile plant if they are exposed to the light of reality.These are people who are not afraid to examine, not afraid to think, not afraid to test their beliefs against the realities: because those beliefs were occasioned in the first instance, were rooted, in the realities that they encountered. Indeed, that is the elementary appeal of socialism, that it is related to the realities in which people live their lives. Those people are not the kind of people who would accept, let alone suggest, the discarding of democratic socialist values.And they are not the kind of people who will accept the advice (widely tendered: some of it malicious, some of it merely hysterical) that we should jettison everything we stood for on 11 June, 1987. Nothing would more deserve the charge of cynicism and nothing would more surely sabotage our credibility than to try to make a bonfire of everything that we asked people to vote for in June of this year. So we won\u2019t be doing that.And there are two other things that we will not be doing either: we won\u2019t be pursuing the pipe dreams of electoral pacts; and we won\u2019t be chasing the non-existent pots of political gold at the end of rainbow coalitions. We stand for ourselves, with ourselves and our ideals. (Applause)What we will be doing in that process of review, and the activities related to that and many other campaigns, is to develop the means to further the ends of democratic socialism. We shall further the commitments to community, democracy and justice. And to real individual liberty that does not depend for its exercise on the ability of the individual to pay. We shall further the commitments to individual security and freedom from fear, and the commitment to the spread of opportunity to ensure that all people can achieve whatever ability and effort makes possible for them. They are all living purposes.So, too, is the commitment to the civil liberties of every citizen: every man, woman and child, regardless of sex or colour or race or creed. For ours is a socialism that does not just recoil from the ugliness of racism or the insult of sexism; it actively engages itself in combating both on all possible occasions. (Applause)It is a socialism that knows that the natural environment of this world is fragile; that it is perishable; and that it must be safeguarded against the exploitation and carelessness that constantly menaces the very existence of a habitable environment.And ours is a socialism, too, that knows that whilst the market is an adequate system for deciding the price and availability of many goods and services, the market has not been, is not, and will never be an adequate mechanism for deciding upon the supply or the quality of health care and education and so much else that is fundamental to a decent life.  (Applause) The market alone will never be adequate for determining the quantity and quality of investment in science or in the arts. And the market alone will never ensure that flow of investment in machines, people, skills and ideas which is necessary to gain and to sustain long-term economic strength and the employment that comes with it.Ours is the kind of socialism which believes that the future will not take care of itself... the socialism that holds that preparation for the future cannot be left to the crude short-term calculation of profit and loss, any more than the opportunities and life chances of people can be left just to luck.They are the values basic to our socialism, basic to the nature of our party. They are the purposes that we want to put into practice. Because these are not declarations, icons or holy relics, these values: they are there as living proposals for the elevation of human kind, the advancement of our whole society. They are there to be put into practice, not into storage. They are the purposes that brought us into this movement and the purposes best able to take us forward in this move­ment.And we know that, if we are to get the chance to do that (to go forward, to put the purposes into practice), those purposes will have to be matched to the realities that exist and will exist in the corning years. That is common sense. Anyone that does not think it is should heed the advice of Aneurin Bevan who warned that the socialist must be:On guard against the old words, for the words persist when the reality that lay behind them has changed. It is inherent in our intellectual activity, that we seek to imprison reality in our description of it. Soon, long before we are aware of it, it is we who become the prisoners of the description. From that point on, our ideas degenerate into a kind of folklore which we as around to each other, fondly thinking we are still talking of the reality around us. We become symbol worshippers. The categories which we once evolved and which once were the tools which we used in our intercourse with reality become hopelessly blunted. In those circumstances the social and political realities we are supposed to be grappling with change and reshape themselves independently of the collective impact of our ideas. We become the creature and no longer the partner of social realities.That is why I recommend the common sense of realising that we direct and we relate our values, principles and purposes to the realities of our condition, and not to where we would like to be - or to some imagined environment that has yet to be created, indeed yet to be perceptible in the longest possible term. We, in our time, face the challenge of the social realities spoken of by Bevan. We are not daunted by them - such a mood would ill befit any socialist.The social realities that we face are the realities of increasing home ownership: the realities, too, of less housebuilding and of growing homelessness. We face the fortunate reality of earlier retirement and of longer life for an ever larger proportion of the population; and we also face the grim reality of poverty and isolation that so frequently still accompany old age. We face the reality of many more people owning a few shares; and the reality alongside it of increasing poverty, of low pay and growing inequality and division. We face the reality of the change in the pattern of work from mass production manufacturing to high-tech custom production; and, alongside that, too, the reality of under-investment in science and in skills. They are just some of the mixed realities already here or in very firm prospect for the early 1990s \u2013 a time in which our economy can no longer rely on the bounty of oil, and there is nothing else left to privatise.These are just some of the realities we face. They are the realities of a changing economy, a changing society, and they are the realities of a changing electorate too. They present their own fresh challenges, they make their own demands on our candour. If this movement pretends, for instance, that a few million more people owning a few shares each will not make any difference to their perception of their economic welfare then this movement will be fooling itself. Of course, we know that those scattered shares do not make any real difference at all to the structure of economic ownership in our country. They do not make any difference at all to the structure of economic power in our country.  But, equally, we know that they do make a difference to their owners\u2019 personal economic perceptions. That is a matter of fact. And the result of it is that our policies are going to have to take account of that reality, and of a number of others.Of course, again, not everyone appears to be willing to listen to that, to understand that. In the past few days I have heard such a recognition of the changing realities described as \u2018retreat,\u2019 \u2018defeatism,\u2019 \u2018pandering to yuppies.\u2019It is not a retreat from anything, and it is not pandering to anybody. It is simply understanding the hopes and the doubts, expecta­tions and reservations of people who are not necessarily young, not particularly mobile and who, in any event, did not vote Labour. They are frequently people - not yuppies - who live in the kind of places and work in the kind of jobs that would qualify them for any certificate of working class authenticity that any comrade wanted to award. And they did not vote Labour last time or the time before.Many throughout this movement know them. They know them from their own work, their own families, their own neighbourhood, their canvassing and their campaigning. And those people pose direct questions to us as a socialist movement: they pose questions to us a socialist movement with its direct relationships with trade unions, as a socialist movement that made its appeal across the broad spread of society, that never had any inclination to try and pick and choose who it would like to vote for it. Those people face us with challenges; and we have to recognise those challenges.Ron Todd made the point with deadly accuracy just a couple of months ago when he asked: \u2018what do you say to a docker who earns 243400 a week, owns his house, a new car, a microwave and a video, as well as a small place near Marbella?\u2019 \u2018You do not say,\u2019 said Ron, \u2018let me take you out of your misery, brother.\u2019 (Laughter and applause) When he asked that question, Ron Todd was not suggesting that we trail along in the wake of something called popular capitalism - he was facing a fundamental question for our party with admirable candour that I would recommend universally. It is a question which we must all face if we are going to have an effective response to the changes taking place in our society.Of course, it is not really a very new question. I remember when I first faced it. It was not last June. It was not in 1983. It was after the 1959 election. I was 17 and had worked very hard during that election down in the Monmouth constituency. I was devastated, as was the whole movement, not just by defeat but by the scale of our defeat. And I, like just about everyone else in the movement, was asking for explanations of the defeat because it had not felt as though it was going to happen.Amongst the most prominent of those explanations, both in the movement generally and indeed in the annual conference that reviewed the election in that year of 1959, was the assertion that a major reason for our failure in that year, the failure against Macmillan, was something called the Affluent Society. You could hear that everywhere. It was made to sound like a curse. Part of me actually wanted to believe that explanation - it was an easy explanation that had a certain appeal to someone who was convinced that socialism was fundamentally, primarily, a cause that existed to help the underdogs, the downtrodden.But the other part of me could not really believe that as an explanation. The idea that the Affluent Society, or at least that part of it which I knew, was a bad thing, was contradicted by the evidence of my own eyes \u2013 indeed all the experiences of my own living. I could not see for the life of me how it could be that the neighbours\u2019 cars that were starting to appear in the street, the wall-to-wall carpeting, the washing machines, the televisions and the first foreign holidays to which the working class were getting access, could somehow be a disadvantage - how could it be anything but a very good thing for the people like my family who had never known anything like that before? And so I could not bring myself to believe that this affluent society had thrown such a shadow as to obscure socialism.I knew that that improvement did not have much to do with Harold Macmillan. I knew where it had come from: people doing lots of very hard work, working overtime, so that they were able to get these things. I could not see either, how those advances were contradictory to the socialism which I believed, and still believe, is about ordinary people getting on: ordinary people having a better life, ordinary people being able to consume more and choose more, and gain greater comfort and opportunity and security. I could not see how socialism was in collision with that. But I was perplexed.I did what I always did on such occasions when I had these fundamental questions (and you are entitled to do it at any age, but most particularly at that age), I went to see an old socialist in Tredegar, Oliver Jones, and asked him whether there was a collision between affluence and socialism. He told me: \u2018there is no collision between affluence and socialism \u2013 I have been striving for both all my life.\u2019 (Laughter and applause) And then he went on to say in words that were unforgettable: \u2018the point is, you see, that if socialism has got to wait for want, then socialism will wait for a very long time. And it will be right for socialism to wait for a very long time: because if it needs misery to give it majority, God forbid we have the misery.\u2019 (Applause)He was absolutely right, wasn\u2019t he? And it meant then and it means now that democratic socialism has to be as attractive, as beckoning and as useful to the relatively affluent and the relatively secure as it is to the less fortunate in our society who are frequently referred to (in a phrase which I have always thought of as patronising and complacent) as our \u2018natural vote.\u2019 I do not know what that is \u2013 I have never known what that is. Any citizen in this democracy who has the right to exercise the franchise is a citizen to whom we should and could be able to make an appeal. (Applause) That attractiveness and usefulness of democratic socialism should not be difficult for anyone confident about their socialism to be able to demonstrate. It is not a great challenge.Take the docker of whom Ron spoke, or many others like him earning a little more or a little less. Those kind of people are comfortable, secure, satisfied with decent conditions, and the best of British luck to them. But even with those wages, even with that security, even with that comfort, he is still not able to give the comprehensive care, the special housing, the sheltered accommodation, the support with transport, that his ageing mother and father might need. Even with those wages he is still not getting enough to enable him to meet the price of the schooling for his children, even more so if they wanted to continue into further education or go on to university. And still with those wages, he is not able to ensure that he and his family could meet their full medical needs without worry, especially if there happens to be in that family (as so frequently and tragically is the case) someone with a chronic or crippling illness or disease.Those are the factors. The way in which the old and the sick are looked after; the kind of serenity people have when they are absolutely sure that they have access to high-quality medical facilities; the un­bounded opportunity that we want for our children to ensure that their education should not be cramped by having a price tag attached o it They are the real assets, and they are the things which condition the quality of life throughout the whole of society. They are the factors which determine the full abundance of life and the real extent of security. And they have something else in common. They are all assets which must be collectively supplied if they are to be there without fail, regardless of the changes of economic fortunes of an individual or the ability to pay.That commitment, systematic and ready to make that collective provision, cannot come from the current government - or anyone like it - that is guided by hostility to that collective provision. As a matter of doctrine, as a matter of dogma, in the place of that collective provision they want to install a system that makes access to all those assets of care and opportunity increasingly dependent upon the ability to pay. It is a very cheap and a very nasty view, with very expensive and very nasty results. And yet it is presented as a ideological new broom, a compelling doctrine, a grand and radical scheme. A Big Idea taking its place alongside all the great political philosophies. It is called Thatcherism, the Big Idea.But what is this Big Idea? How is it attuned to the realities, how does it stand up to the examination of real circumstances? How, for instance, does the Big Idea address the real problems of a generation of children who will meet greater challenges in their future as citizens and  workers than any generation has ever known before? Well, the Big Idea responds to that reality and the responsibilities for that generation by making such cuts in education investment as to put education spending as a proportion of our GNP lower than that of any comparable economy.What has the Big Idea got for the inner cities? It has a galaxy of initiatives, programmes, task forces and schemes \u2013 in fact it has everything except money. The Big Idea, applied to the inner city, is that you put one pound of programme money in for every nine pounds that you take out in rate support grant from the inner cities. That is the Big Idea. (Applause)The Big Idea cuts investment in house building by three quarters in eight years. And the Big Idea now requires the imposition of a poll tax - a tax which has no connection with ability to pay, which punishes families which have dependent sick or aged relatives or dependent grown up children at home, which costs a fortune to administer and which tears up the roots of local democracy. That is the Big Idea.And then there is the jewel in the crown of this great new intellectual and ideological force. The jewel in the crown of the Big Idea: privatisation. The sell-off system which is supposed to be the engine of popular capitalism, but which turns out to be a scheme for changing great public monopolies into great private monopolies by means which ensure that some small investors get a little slice of gain and a few very big investors get great slabs of additional wealth and the power that goes with it.Private monopolies cannot deliver an efficient telephone system, but are excellent, brilliant, magnificent as a means of handing over major British assets to foreign asset holders. A scheme of privatisation which turned Jaguar Cars into an American-owned company, a scheme of privatisation which is turning Rolls Royce into a Japanese concern, a scheme of privatisation which is just about to turn British Petroleum into anything but British.Now of course we have another of the ideologues, John Moore. He has the big idea: \u2018to move people away from dependency,\u2019 as he put it, \u2018and towards opportunity.\u2019 It sounds very attractive, does it not, opportunity? My father used to say that he was brought up in an opportunity society \u2013 boundless opportunities, opportunities everywhere you looked. And he said that the only thing that made him as one of seven children go down the pit at 14 was sheer bloody-mindedness! (Applause) Move away from dependency towards opportunity \u2013 it does sound like a good idea. Nobody likes the status of dependence. The human taste is always for self reliance: indeed, that is a major, basic reason for our advocacy of socialism, to be able to extend that self reliance so that people do not have to be dependent.But our way of doing it of course, is to end dependence by trying to end need. Mr Moore works from the other direction. He intends to end dependence by ending provision: teaching people to fly by pushing them off the roof \u2013 that is how he wants to end dependence! (Applause) And that is his Big Idea: you are on your own. What a brilliant new idea! What a forceful and compelling way to have our society ruled.Can the Big Idea attend to the real basics? That should be very easy for such a great scheme. Can it, for instance, attend to the very rudimentary requirements of old and poor people to keep warm in the winter? No, it can\u2019t. Not because of any malevolence or meanness, you understand, but because these saintly enemies of dependence would simply not want to demean frightened and freezing old people with the status of being \u2018dependants.\u2019 They are kindness themselves, you know, these ideologues of the Big Idea.And the Big Idea is not just applied at home. The same small mindedness applies abroad too. For when asked to tackle any of the great issues of menace to the environment, of racial oppression, of want in the world - that Big Idea turns in upon itself and shrinks into selfishness.It is a Big Idea that will not join in any of the international initiatives to combat the poisoning of the land, the sea or the air.It is a Big Idea that will accommodate and appease apartheid and refuse to tighten sanctions to squeeze down on that regime on the grounds, as the prime minister puts it, of morality. Morality, when the object of those sanctions should be a government of apartheid that is allowing the imprisonment, torture, beating and killing of children who are said to threaten their apartheid state in their protests against it. (Applause)It is a Big Idea that cuts the aid budget in half and turns its back on the people of the world who need some extra help to enable them to make their way out of the misery of poverty, insecurity and starvation. How can anything so empty of responsibility, so empty of generosity, of decency, be thought to be a big idea?But there are big ideas around. I'll tell you who has got a really big idea. Gorbachev and Reagan, Shevardnadze and Shultz, they have a Big Idea. They have a really big idea. Their Big Idea is to secure the withdrawal of intermediate nuclear forces and then to embark upon significant reductions in strategic nuclear weapons. Now that is what I call a really big idea. (Applause)That is a major purpose: but too major, it would appear, for this government in Britain; and that is why they have tried to block every stride in all the progress made since Reykjavik, laying across the path of progress all the time. Friendly visits to Washington, little nips into Europe, speeches from the Berlin wall, speeches that collide with those who have the Big Idea. George Shultz, the American Secretary of State, when challenged that the removal of intermediate weapons would not bring about a vast reduction in the nuclear stockpiles on each side, said that that was true. But, he said: \u2018We have to start somewhere.\u2019 (Applause) Within days, the response of the mistress of the Big Idea is not to say, \u2018yes, let us make a start, let us see what we can get and how far we can mutually go.\u2019 It is to say, in her words: \u2018It has gone far enough.\u2019 What a Big Idea.But of course she is wrong. Because the patent fact about the attitude of the superpowers is that they consider that the progress has not gone far enough. And we, like the huge majority of humanity, agree with them entirely in that view, that the progress has not gone far enough. There is a long course yet to run. We welcome the fact that the process will continue, and, as it continues, will change and improve the condition of common security in this world. Not only in the nuclear sphere, but in securing the ending of chemical weapons and the reduction and balance of non-nuclear conventional forces. We welcome that process.And because of the continued assertions on both sides of a real will to proceed, we can look forward to that improvement in common security. That is why we will work to ensure that we have policies that are capable of dealing with the changed conditions of the 1990s in a way that will enhance the prospect of removing reliance on nuclear weapons of any description.In that, and in many other ways, we shall review our policies. Those reviews will take their direction and their inspiration from the values of compassion and concern. They will show our commitment to Britain and the British people. They will be sharpened on the realities: including the salient fact of life that - if we are to achieve our ambitions of proper care, of full opportunity, of defeating poverty and disadvantage - we must implement policies to make our economy more competitive, more efficient, more productive. That is essential, for without it we could not fulfil our contract to generate jobs, or to meet social needs, or to modernise and multiply the essential services of health and education.Of course, all of our enemies and, yes, some of our friends give the impression that we are hostile to those ideas of efficiency and competitiveness \u2013 just as we are said to be antagonistic to personal good fortune, to private industry and to a lot of other things. But if any of that were the case, why is it that so many of our members and supporters are buying their houses, so many of our members and supporters are making personal pension arrangements, and undertaking many other activities to secure proper protection for themselves and their families? If we really had those hostilities, why would so many Labour councils (to their eternal credit) show such initiative and expend such energy on attracting and retaining and working in partnership with so much private industry? If we really had that opposition to efficiency and competition, why would so many of our trade union colleagues scourge management for under-investment, for inadequate provision for training, for poor sales promo­tion and marketing activities?The truth is, is it not, that so frequently and so rightly, when we get the chance to improve the material well-being of our families, our communities, our colleagues in this movement, we take that chance. And we are right to do so. When local councillors of this party can win industrial development for their areas, they do it. When trade unionists can secure the advantage of the members of their union by more efficient performance, they do it. There is no concession of ideals in that. Certainly there is no corruption of the values of socialism or its purposes. There is nothing to apologise for: indeed, they are personal and collective achievements, by socialists, for socialist purposes.So - instead of tolerating the insults of our enemies, or accommodating the indulgence of a few of our friends, that we are, or somehow should be, antagonistic to material advance - we would really be better employed telling the truth about ourselves, employed best of all in ensuring that we preach what, in reality, we are practising. And then perhaps we would get some credit for it where credit is due.That is the spirit in which we will review and renew our economic policies to ensure that we develop the strategy necessary to meet our economic and social goals. That is our purpose; and we shall accomplish it. And then we shall promote it. And we shall promote it in \u2018years not weeks.\u2019 That, of course, must be our well-developed habit in every area.In the last few months I have heard the phrase \u2018years not weeks\u2019 very frequently. I needed no persuasion. For, as it happens, I had the chance - indeed the duty - to say it first: elections are won in years, not weeks. I did not just have the chance and the duty to say it on the night of our election defeat in June of this year, but I actually said it in the plainest possible terms, as some of you may recall, from this very platform when you elected me leader four years ago: \u2018elections are won in years, not weeks.\u2019 (Applause) Many listened, many understood, many applied it; and they have worked to win for \u2018years, not weeks\u2019 right throughout this movement.That is why, in the last four years, we have been engaged in continual campaigning: the NHS campaign; the Freedom and Fairness campaign; the Investing in People campaign; the Jobs and Industry campaign; the Modern Britain in a Modern World campaign; and a host of other campaigns at national and local level. All for the purpose of trying to secure an advance in years and not in weeks.And there were many who understood that the need to work \u2018for years not weeks\u2019 applied not only to the obligation of campaigning in this party, but to conduct in this party as well. They understood that we would be judged not only by the substance of policies or the quality of campaigns, but also by the way in which we acted as people and as a party. Now, in the wake of our third election defeat, there can be very few, if there be any at all, who do not comprehend the need to be convincing in all three of those areas: policy; campaigning and conduct. All three, and we forget them at our peril. (Applause)And to maintain all three will require self-discipline. The self-discipline of not promising so much that the promise is destroyed by incredibility. The self-discipline of understanding the implications of action. Not just for the term, not just in the immediate situation, but for the standing of the whole movement, wherever that action is taken. The self-discipline of ensuring that every word, every deed, every statement, every action, is related completely to the task of achieving victory. The self-discipline of accepting that in everything that each of us, individually and collectively, says and does, we work in the clear and certain knowledge that we address many people who still need to be convinced if they are to make the shift to supporting us - people who need to be certain that their trust in our common purpose and in our common sense is fully justified.None of that means speaking of our socialism behind cupped hands. None of that self-discipline and sacrifice means bowing down to prejudice or injustice. It does not mean putting away our initiatives and it does not mean forgetting our inspirations. Recognising those require­ments of a serious, sensible, socialist movement is not defeatism, nor is it a retreat from convictions. On the contrary, recognising it and applying it is the precondition of the victory which we need to get the power to put those convictions into effect. (Applause)That is not a plea for self-discipline. I am not pleading at all. Because the people who need us are not pleading. The people who need us are demanding - demanding that we conduct our affairs, run our movement, meet our responsibilities to each other and to the community. And meet those responsibilities in such a way as to continually demon­strate those qualities of vitality, purpose and unity which brought us such credit during the election campaign.When that demand for unity is made, I anticipate the question: \u2018unity on whose terms?\u2019 And the answer is, on the terms of the people who support us and would like to support us. For serious socialists, for serious democrats, that is not much to ask. And if anyone doubts the need for that self-discipline, for that unity, then they had better just remind themselves of the price that is paid for indiscipline and disunity. It is not paid by those who are locked in combat, it is not paid by those who have an interesting exchange, it is not paid by those who thrive on division. The price is paid by the people of Britain. And it is paid most by those who need most: those who need the schools and the homes, those who need the hospitals, those who need chances for themselves that can only be built on the foundations of a just society and a, strong economy. The price for division and disunity is paid most of all by those who attract our greatest concern, those who most need our help, those who most depend upon our success. We cannot let them down, we must not let them pay that price again.And that is why we review. That is why we reassess. That is why we regroup. They are acts of rededication to our principles and our purposes, and to policies that are attuned to the realities in which people live. They are the acts of a party that is not satisfied with the luxury of opposition nor attracted by the purity of powerlessness. They are the acts of a party that cannot live on constant diets of resolutions condemning and motions deploring and statements opposing, when it wants the power to do things. (Applause)It is the act of rededication, the act of a party that knows that it will offer nothing to the British people if it contents itself with gestures that will be ignored, bluffs that will be called and illegality that will be ruthlessly punished. (Applause)Review, reassessment, regrouping are the acts of a party that wants power to decide, power to influence, power to govern in a way that can advance the condition of our fellow human beings. We seek the opportunities of that power and accept the obligations of that power. Of course they will impose pressures and impose burdens. But ask anyone in this movement: who is not prepared to accept such responsibilities? Whether they want this party to achieve victory, or whether they will settle for being members of a party that can offer the British people nothing but sympathy? A party that will do little more than attend the funerals of hopes and of communities and of industries, a party of permanent condolence senders. I do not think that that is what this party and its members want for themselves or accept for themselves. (Applause)Comrades, four years ago when you elected me leader I told you that there must be no activity in this labour movement superior to that of defeating Toryism. I meant every word. I meant no activity superior to that task of defeating Toryism. I say it again. I know that there are now many more people in this movement who not only understand that to be desirable but regard it as essential and act upon it all the time.That is now the spirit in the labour movement in its overwhelm­ing majority. And because that is the spirit, it makes us fit to fight. It makes us fit to win. And it will make us fit to govern. (Prolonged applause)

aVBenjamin Disraeli was once asked to define the difference between a misfortune and a calamity. He said: \u2018If Gladstone fell into the Thames, that would be a misfortune, but if anybody pulled him out, that would be a calamity.\u2019I can well understand that there might have been Liberals last week who wished to update the political reference. All I want to say about that is that some political leaders - I mention no names - believe they are infallible. She of course never makes mistakes. I do not subscribe to the doctrine of the infallibility of party leaders, and perhaps that\u2019s just as well in the circumstances.In 1906, our party leader Campbell-Bannerman offered the public a succinct and hugely successful manifesto, namely: \u2018to undo the mischief wrought in recent years.\u2019 I think we can agree on such a commonsense approach. I want this Assembly to look forward not backward. Yes, the last six months have been arduous. But what did we expect? Yes, the birth-pangs of our new party have been painful. I frankly cannot imagine that anybody but Liberals would have had the generosity of spirit to undertake this difficult process. We have not sat at home jeering from the sidelines like some. It has been hard, but now we have come through. We should look forward to the new life we are about to create. During the twelve years that I have been leader, I have been sustained by a vision of a centre-left party, free of the dogma, the class hatred, the arrogance, and the extremism which have haunted British political life since the War. We have never lost sight of the great principles on which this party was founded, which are no less needed in the Thatcher age than they were over a hundred years ago.I have had a vision of a Britain which is very different. Not the tawdry Britain of today, motivated by greed and stifled by autocracy.If a radical government had wasted public money on a case such as Spycatcher, manipulated the truth over an affair such as Westland, produced as cock-eyed, unpopular and indefensible a measure as the poll tax, and steadily accrued power to itself away from local government, imagine what the public outcry would have been.As it is, much of Fleet Street is servile, corrupted by the combination of honours and monopolistic ownership, reserving its scorn only for critics of the government, whether in the other political parties, the churches or the universities. The slide to autocracy over this last decade is alarming more and more sections of the population. It is our prime duty to organise effectively to prevent it.And during these twelve years, I have been sustained by the knowledge that many, possibly even the majority of our fellow citizens, were willing us to succeed. When the Alliance was formed I saw, and many of us saw, that this great longing for a new and fundamentally better society based on partnership, cooperation and consensus, was now a possibility. The Alliance was not formed simply as a marriage of convenience. I repudiate this view utterly.It was my belief, and that of Roy Jenkins, that the Alliance was the thin end of the wedge in achieving our shared aim of a fairer, and in a true sense a more successful, Britain. Today I must tell you that experience has reinforced that view.The Liberal Party founded in its present organisation 110 years ago has so much to its credit. It was we who laid the foundations of the welfare state introducing old-age pensions, sickness insurance and unemployment benefit. It was our Keynesian policies which first showed how to manage an economy so that we could maintain our basic freedoms while effectively tackling unemployment; between the wars we backed the doctrine of collective security and supported rearmament in the face of a supine government; yet we retained the valued Quaker tradition in our midst; we have advocated genuine industrial democracy as opposed to trade union oligarchy; and consistently through our history the need for constitutional reform and devolution within a federal framework.We are all proud to be Liberals. Duty to our neighbours and good citizenship are for us the mainsprings of social reform.No government of which we were a part would tolerate a Chancellor of the Exchequer grasping buoyant revenues and failing to provide increased resources for our hard-pressed National Health Services, especially for our underpaid and overworked nurses.No one understands better than I the deep feelings throughout the party about the decision we have to take. I will be a Liberal to the day I die. I feel myself clothed in the aura of the word Liberal and all the associations which that has. Liberalism is not a creed, a dogma or a fixed ideology. It does not prescribe how people should live or limit what they can become. Liberalism is about developing people\u2019s potential and enlarging their freedom. It is the spirit which sustains the adventure of progress.Last year I spoke to the students at Cape Town University, urging them, in the face of increasing intolerance of left and right, to hold fast to their liberal traditions. I did it because being a Liberal is not simply a title, it is a way of life. Liberalism is an attitude of mind. It has a noble past, and, I believe, a noble future.During that visit I met the writer Alan Paton, who was President of the Liberal Party of South Africa when it was closed down because it was multi-racial. He wrote this:'If Liberalism died, if those sentiments that we call liberal were no longer cherished by men and women then the countries of the world would soon become tyrannies, whether of the left or right. The joy of being human would disappear from the earth.'For twenty-three years I have been in the House of Commons fighting for this great party of ours, not to further a career in politics, but because I believe in those Liberal principles. My fellow Liberals, the people of Britain need them now more than ever. Perhaps not the complacent rich, or the arrogant powerful, but the weak, the needy, the sick, the struggling minorities, the young, the unemployed.The Liberal Party more than any other party is like a great family. Sure, we have our occasional rows and our upsets, but we are held together by a great sense of belonging, of tolerance, and dare I say of warmth.As a family in recent years we have enjoyed moments of great success, triumph and elation. As a family we have suffered times of setback, despair, and even, at Christmas a year ago, tragedy. We have laughed together at times and we have cried together at times.Many of the commentators find us difficult to understand, so easy to poke fun at. It\u2019s a lot easier to base a political party simply on the haves, the get-rich-quicks, the self-appointed establishment on the one hand or the organised trade union votes and funds on the other.The great strength of our party is that it has never been exclusive, but always comprehensive. The Liberal Party has throughout its history included those who believe fervently in one or two particular aspects of Liberalism, and this party has never sought to crush colleagues who happen to think differently from ourselves. The new party of Social and Liberal Democrats must sustain that tradition.There is another tradition which it must sustain - our more recent but impressive dedication to practical Liberalism. So many have pounded the dark, wet streets. Others have been up to their elbows in printer\u2019s ink - working week in week out to help people improve the communities where they live. The very fact that Liberals and Social Democrats are already united in groups in so many local authorities is itself a powerful argument against now attempting to put them asunder.But we must not wallow in our own longevity, history and traditions to the extent that we ignore the qualities of the SDP. The freshness of their approach and the strength of their ideals brought many into politics whom we had failed to attract and enabled a large slice of talent to abandon the fruitless struggle to reform the Labour Party. They have taught us the modern techniques of direct communication with their membership. They care about the same things we care about. They have become our brothers and sisters in an enlarged family. The assets of the two parties taken together will provide the basis for a formidable force. Our new party will have to be realistic. Of course it will. We shall need sound policies, based on sober deliberation. But we shall need something else even more important if we are to succeed. We shall need commitment. The soul of Liberalism must shine through.The commitment to restore Britain to self-government; to insist on freedom of information and a bill of rights; to let people make their own decisions locally. It is Liberalism which gives people a voice.The commitment to tackle poverty and squalid housing, not as an act of charity but as a recognition of the common humanity we all share. It is Liberalism which will unlock the trap of deprivation in which two million families are locked in this prosperous country.The commitment to usher in a society prudent in the use of its resources, not profligate; in harmony with the natural world, not at war with it; caring about what we hand on to future generations. The commitment to end discrimination between people based on the colour of their skin. It is Liberalism which stands against the street bullies mugging Asian Britons, it is Liberalism which reunites families divided by cruel immigration laws, and it is Liberalism which says there is no hope in South Africa until Nelson Mandela is free.The commitment to international interdependence, and the recognition that the nation-state is obsolescent. It is Liberalism which believes in one world. It is Liberalism which strives for international peace and security based on mutual respect and confidence and it is Liberalism here in Britain which helped get us into the European Community, helped keep us there, and which alone wants the Community to develop and integrate as far and as fast as possible.It is Liberalism which will awaken the conscience of the developed world to the famine, disease and hunger of the poorer countries. And it is Liberalism which knows we cannot enjoy our freedom while half the world is enslaved.I speak now, not as leader but as a member, an activist member, of the Liberal Party. And however great the majority in this hall today - and I believe it must be 2:1 or more - let us not forget that the final decision is up to each and every member of the Party throughout the country.There is no shortage of tasks for brave Liberals. There are still giants to be slain, the ogres of war and fear, intolerance and prejudice. There are still mountains to be scaled, the grim peaks of poverty and privilege. There are great prizes to be won as well: peace and prosperity, freedom and justice, opportunities for each and dignity for all.At the end of my very first speech as your leader in Llandudno in 1976 I described the kind of country I wished to see. I have returned to many of these themes today. In some ways we are actually further removed from a Liberal society now than we were then. I have spoken this morning as a Liberal about liberalism. That is as it should be. Opponents of merger sometimes talk as if the Liberal Party is going to be abolished, that the new party will not be Liberal. If that were so, I should be voting against merger. I don\u2019t consider every aspect of the constitution to be perfect, but like everybody else I know we can amend it in the light of experience.But it is precisely because we shall carry our Liberalism proud and intact into the new party, because our chance to achieve Liberal aims will be increased and because the SDP are our natural partners that I do support merger now.The choice is a simple one. Yes, for the chance to put Liberalism into practice, or No, for decades of division and a diminution of Liberalism. I say YES, for the next step in the adventure of Liberalism and to provide a new hope for Britain.Our Assembly has been required over these years to make many vital decisions, but none so crucial as the one we are called upon to make today. Yes, it is going to affect us in our constituencies, in our councils, in parliament.But today\u2019s decision affects more than us. It will affect the millions beyond this hall who have been yearning for us to get together and provide a truly effective party able to challenge the Tories at the next election. Let Labour remain the official opposition. Our people want us to become the electable opposition. The country demands it. We cannot fail them now.

aVDavid, comrades, as a concession to the Chair I have actually taken my watch off, put it in front of me and now I can cheerfully forget it, (Laughter)We meet in this conference in a spirit of progress; we meet in a spirit of confidence. The people of Britain know that we have worked for and earned the support that they are now giving to us. They respect us for the changes that we have made and the changes that we are making. Increasingly, they know that we are attuned to the realities of the present and increasingly they are prepared to trust us with the future. People tell me that, when I meet them. The polls say that when we read them. But most important of all, we know that we are winning support and understanding and trust because the people tell us when they vote.They told us that in Pontypridd and the Vale of Glamorgan; they told us that in Vauxhall and in Glasgow Central. They told us that in the county council elections, and all over Britain, in that magnificent victory on 15 June they told us that in the elections for the European Parliament. (Applause) They keep on telling us and telling the Labour Party \u2013 \u2018You\u2019re doing the right thing. Keep on doing it.\u2019 We will keep on doing it.We will keep on because it is the winning way. It is the best way to serve the people we want to stand up for. We will keep on winning. And we will do it with no wheeling, no dealing, no horse trading and no electoral pacts. (Applause)We will put ourselves to the people and we will go on getting their support. We will get it by continuing to construct strong unity of purpose. We will get it by our conduct as a serious, socialist, self-disciplined party. We will go on earning support by having the same candour and confidence that we showed in facing up to ourselves and our times in the policy review. We will get the support by continuing to produce answers that are relevant and practical for the present and for the future, answers that offer the kind of socialism that the people of Britain want. The kind of socialism that insists that the National Health Service shall not be split up, sold off, privatised, sent to the market, but shall be kept and improved and modernised as a service free of charge at time of need for all the people of this country. (Applause)The kind of socialism that the British people understand and support is the kind of socialism that resents the injustice, the cost and the divisiveness of the Poll Tax, that demands a local tax that is fair between people and regions, related to the ability to pay and, for those on low incomes, includes a fair system of rebates to insure against the injustice of tax.The kind of socialism that the British people are attracted by and understand and support is the socialism that takes its inspiration from individual freedom and the right to organise and bargain in freedom collectively. They support that kind of socialism and, they resent the centralisation, censorship and control that in the past ten years has given the state more power over the life of the individual in Britain than at any time in modern peacetime history. They do not want that. (Applause)The kind of socialism that the people of Britain understand and support is as Tawney described: in the 1930s, in the wake of defeat and division in the Labour Party, he said: \u2018Socialism is no longer bad politics in Britain unless socialists choose to make it so, which some do with a surprising ingenuity. \u2018Nevertheless,\u2019 he went on with the right combination of \u2018a realism that is not torpor and an idealism that is not foolishness,\u2019 the Labour Party, a socialist party, is unstoppable because its natural constituency is the majority of the British people. That was true then and it is true now. That is why we are getting the support for the kind of socialism that we are offering to the British people.Of course the Tories will try to hit back. They will do it in a variety of ways. First of all, there will be the personal attacks on the Labour leaders. It will not be anything serious \u2013 nothing like as serious, for instance, as the personal attacks they make every week of every year on the pensioners, the poor, the homeless and families with children. They are real personal attacks. They really hurt.The next part of the counter-attack will be to order civil servants to waste thousands of hours of time trying to \u2018cost\u2019 our programme. They will push those figures, collected at the taxpayers\u2019 expense - such is the nature of the modern Tory state - through the counterfeit machine in Tory Central Office. You are very familiar with the procedure: it is the one that they have perfected for the purpose of calculating the employment figures, the unemployment figures and Lawson\u2019s Budget estimates. (Applause)Then there is their secret weapon, the Team. They have got themselves a Team. It was announced last week. Next week, if you should be over 18 and very stable of mind, put the television on and watch them up at Blackpool. On the back of the stage there will be the slogan \u2018The Right Team for the Future\u2019 - Margaret Thatcher\u2019s Team. That is a bit of a confusion in terms, is it not? (Laughter) It is like Dennis Skinner\u2019s shyness or David Owen\u2019s legions, a real confusion in terms.They have that Team. It is difficult to envisage it really, but since dray horses come in teams, and donkeys and sled dogs come in teams, I suppose the Tories can have a team as well. You can see it now can you not? The huskies dashing across the icy wastes, eagerly and unquestioningly, with the driver holding a whip over them, saying \u2018Mush, mush.\u2019 (Applause) And you know what huskies do, if one of them drops dead don\u2019t you? The rest of them eat him. (Laughter) That is the Tory team spirit.Of course there is a lead dog. The top dog in the team is the Chairman of the Conservative Party, Kenneth Baker. Theirs must be the only political organisation in any democracy in which a move from being in charge of education to being in charge of propaganda is regarded as a promotion. (Laughter and applause)It would not happen anywhere else. He has got that job because he is supposed to be a master strategist. At least that is right. What else could you call a man who presides over education for three years and then, just eight weeks before the country finds out that we are 3,600 teachers short, gets another job? That is a master strategist. He really is a quite brilliant mover. He is the man who invented the Poll Tax and then moved on before it caught up with him.He was appointed, of course, by the Prime Minister. She is a very considerate person really. There are people who say she is very remote and detached. I will not have that said about Mrs Thatcher. I have seen her rubbing shoulders with crowds, talking to children, travelling on a train. Pity it was in Japan. (Laughter and applause)They gave her a lovely reception. They had all the bands out, red carpets. But let\u2019s face it: if we had a relationship with a country and they had had a £1 billion trade deficit with us in 1979 and now they had a 5 billion trade deficit with us, I would give them the red carpet treatment. They could have my ticket for the Arms Park. There would be nothing too big.Japan is a fairly good place to go to to listen and to learn. That did not happen when Mrs Thatcher went there. As usual, Mrs Thatcher went there to lecture. She went to instruct the Japanese that if only they would de-regulate, implement free trade policies and remove exchange controls, they too could enjoy the same level of unbounded success as Britain has under Mrs Thatcher. That is what she was telling them. (Applause) She told them - and she tells us - that we have been enjoying an economic \u2018miracle.\u2019 Nigel Lawson says the same, that we are enjoying a \u2018miracle.\u2019 The Sun, the Daily Mail and even some of the newspapers say the same thing. (Laughter) I suppose it is a miracle of a sort, because if you think about it, when Moses parted the Red Sea and took the children of Israel across, that was a miracle. The trouble was that in the middle of the same miracle along came Pharoah\u2019s army. They got onto the bottom of the Red Sea and it all closed in on them: We have been going through this miracle from the Pharoah\u2019s army eye-view.But it has been a miracle, truly. We have had oil wealth that none of our major competitor countries has had. At the end of that ten years, Britain has got two million unemployed still - recorded unemployed - the highest inflation rate of any industrialised country, the highest interest rates of any industrialised country, the biggest balance of payments deficit by far of any industrialised country and, to go with it, something that is not too frequently disclosed, a huge net outflow of long term capital. We get lots of money in, because we are offering 14 per cent. It stays for a short time and then moves around, but there is lots going out - incredible for an oil-rich country, but happening under our \u2018brilliant Chancellor\u2019 and our genius business managers. Even with that litany, that is not the worst news. The worst news is that underlying those figures of failure - indeed causing those conditions - is the Tories\u2019 refusal, year after year, to make the essential commitment to the productive base of the economy: education and training, research and development, science and the transport and communications system are all objects of gross neglect. We are the only major industrialised country that in the last ten years has continually spent a lower and lower proportion of our gross national product on education; everybody, else has been increasing it. Where could be the sense in that?The result of all that was always certain to be an unbalanced economy, under-equipped, under-skilled, inflating and increasingly importing. Britain was bound to become a place of paralysing congestion in some areas, of miserable underdevelopment in others. A place of inefficiency and - yes - because of the neglect of public investment, a place of considerable danger too for the travelling public and for people who work in those industries, as we have seen so tragically demonstrated. That is where they have got us to now.They have not finished yet. They have still got two years or so to run, which will get us nearly all the way through the time left before the completion of the Single Market of the European Community at the end of 1992.That is going to be a delight, is it not? We shall be part of an open economic zone, operating in a currency exchange rate mechanism in which the pound will be included and subject to even more intensive and direct competition from the other European Community countries than at the present time. And they are countries that all have made and do make a much stronger commitment to skills, research, transport and science than we have under a Tory government. The British government has done absolutely nothing to prepare our country or our people for the challenges or the opportunities of that new Europe. That is the mess they are going to leave to us, because sometime before the completion of the Single Market we shall have a Labour government.The fact that we shall inherit a mess is nothing really new for us; indeed, every incoming Labour government has inherited a mess from every outgoing Tory government. The only difference is that next time the mess will be even bigger - I say to you soberly, even bigger than the mess has ever been before.No one here or anywhere else should have any doubt about that or the scale of what we shall inherit. No one here or anywhere else should fail to understand that those conditions that we inherit will have the most direct implications for what we do. We are therefore going to have to be very deliberate in our choice of priorities and, having chosen them, we are going to have to stick to those priorities. And we will.Everyone should understand too that if we do anything other than to choose priorities, no matter how tough they are and stick to them, the result will be that we shall set ourselves the task of doing everything that is desirable and end up doing nothing that is significant. (Applause)I do not say that because I am daunted. I do not feel in the least bit defeatist about what I know we shall face, neither do the rest of the people who will form that government, nor indeed the other people in the Parliamentary Labour Party. Nor should you feel daunted; on the contrary.Without any vainglory say that there have been times before when our party has been called in similar circumstances to work for our country in government, generally in dreadful circumstances, circumstances that would have torn a Tory government apart and retarded Britain even further. There are various versions of the history of the Labour Party in government. None of them records any Labour government or any Labour minister as being perfect. But what I would say is that they were patriotic and did their damnedest for their country in a way that no single Tory Cabinet Minister in the bunch that we have got now would think of doing. (Applause) I do not say any of that about what we shall inherit because I am intimidated by the prospect. I tell you and the British people that because it is the truth.There is another truth too. There is no easy mechanism, no single, solve-all strategy that can catapult Britain to economic strength. That has been Nigel Lawson\u2019s fad over the years, even though he has changed his single instrument once or twice.Success has got to be worked for and it has to be built. That is why we are going to start to do what the Tories should have been doing in these oil-rich years.We are going to start to combat the transport congestion and make the investment in communications, without which Britain will judder to an expensive and dangerous halt in a very few years. We will get on with that job.We are going to build up the commitment to science, because if we carry on like we are under the Tories, Britain will be pushed down into the second or third division of the industrial nations.We are going to develop inducements and encouragements for a major expansion of research and development in both the public and private sector, because if we are going to rival our major competitors, we have got a long way to go in catching up with them.Most important of all, we have got to increase the quality and quantity of skills training and make a new commitment to education in this country.The reason for that is very simple. Now and for all time in the future, human skills and human talents will be the major determinants of success or failure, not just for individuals, but for the whole society in all its social, cultural and commercial life. Education and training are now the commanding, heights of every modern economy. We must mobilise all of the available abilities \u2013 and I mean all.In the future which we envisage, therefore, there can be no question of allowing disadvantages in opportunity and access to be suffered by women. (Applause) We need an economy of all the talents. To get that, we are going to have to make provision to ensure that, for the very best reasons of social justice and economic efficiency, equal rights of education and training are guaranteed and the opportunities are made genuinely accessible by providing support, especially for mothers with children, so that they can enjoy those equal rights in reality. (Applause)Comrades, research and development, transport and communications, science, education and training are our priorities. They are the productive base of our economy; they are fundamental to success in the future. If we are to combat inflation, if we are to turn that balance of payments deficit into surplus, if we are to bring down unemployment, if we are to generate the wealth properly to fund and pay for the bills of social justice in a modern society, we are going to have to succeed in building up that base. It means giving that task an unparalleled priority. We will do that. That is the attitude that we will take. It is the practical way.We know it is the practical way, because it is the way that all of our successful competitors have done it. We know that it is the practical way too, because for the last ten years the other way has been tried, the Lawson way. Is that practical? Is it practical to have neglected and under-funded and run down the foundations of modern industrial strength in order to make tax cuts for the top paid in our country? When that culminates in a prodigious balance of payments deficit, is that practical? Is it practical to use the highest interest rates in the industrialised world to try to squeeze consumer demand when at the very same time those very same interest rates are hammering the very productive industries that we are depending upon to try to pay our way in the world? Is that practical?Everybody knows that as soon as the supports are shifted in any way, the pound will bounce around all over the place, making it virtually impossible for any company, any concern to plan production or to calculate prices with any certainty. What is all that supposed to achieve? Is the interest rate strategy there to buy us some time so that we can restructure British industry? Is it to buy us some time so that we can get some decent training for the youngsters? Is it to buy us some time so that we can negotiate a new deal in Europe? No, it is not for any of those reasons. The only reason we have got the interest rate strategy is because the Tories do not know what else to do. It is as basic as that.What they are hoping for of course, is that they can get to a few months before the next general election and then take the brakes off, make some tax cuts and try to deceive the people of Britain yet again that things are back on course. It will not work. It will not work for political reasons; it is one con-trick too far. It will not work for economic reasons either. You do not need to be an economist to know why. All you have to do to know why it will not work economically is to have to pay a mortgage. Those monthly bills are certificates of the failure of Lawsonism.Nigel Lawson does not see it that way. He says people with mortgages may be finding \u2018a little difficulty,\u2019 but that little difficulty, he says, will be \u2018self-correcting\u2019 and we can all look forward to \u2018a soft landing.\u2019 At least he is equipped for that. (Laughter) But if he is in orbit, anticipating a soft landing, nobody else is. If he does not understand the reality of what he has done to people\u2019s mortgage payments, he should ask his erstwhile chum, the man who was Chief of Staff at the Tory Central Office in the 1987 election. He was writing in the I last week. \u2018Home owners feel cheated,\u2019 he said. \u2018Today, they are paying more and more in mortgage repayments for houses that are worth less and less in the market. And those needing to move home too often have to make a marriage-wrenching gamble as the housing market becomes as slippery and dangerous as Brands Hatch on a wet Saturday afternoon.\u2019 That is Tory property-owning democracy 1989.These home-buyers are not the only victims of course. Thousands of elderly people were pleased when this government said they wanted them to make extra provision for their retirement. They liked that idea. But the government did not tell them they were going to slash Housing Benefit, and they did not tell them that in order to make provision for their retirement many of them were going to have either to mortgage or sell the houses that they had spent a lifetime paying for The greatest victims of the Tories\u2019 big cheat in housing of course are those who are suffering because of the gigantic cuts made in house building and who are now in overcrowded accommodation or, in increasing numbers, homeless.The reason for all that, obviously, is that the Tories never really had a policy for homes; they only ever had a policy for property. It is not the same thing. The Tories never really had a policy for building and renovating or for providing people with real choice between buying or renting. They only ever had a policy really for selling. In this party, we want people to be able to buy houses. That is very important. We want them to be able to buy the houses they previously rented, either in the public sector or the private sector, if that is what they want to do. But what is essential is that they should be able to afford the homes that they buy or rent, and it is essential that if they do not want to buy a house or cannot buy a house, they should still have a residence that they are proud to call home. (Applause)There are very few things quite as reassuring and quite as secure as a home, bought or rented, that you know is safe and you know you can afford. There are very few things more intimidating and frightening than having the responsibility of a home that is not safe and that you cannot afford. People are going through agony in Britain now, people who 18 months or two years ago thought that they were secure and making their way, but have been hit, almost as if they were being assassinated, by the Tory interest rate strategy. That is Tory property-owning democracy 1989.In this party we have got a housing policy, a real housing policy. One that provides for buying and for renting, building and renovating. One that insists not only on quantity but on quality. One that protects consumers whether they are buyers or tenants, in the private or the public sector. And it is a housing policy that is capable of meeting the needs of the future. That is the policy that we offer to the British people, and we offer it in place of the deceit and double dealing that made so many people feel that they had been cheated by the Tories.Of course, double-dealing is their stock-in-trade on any number of subjects. I saw a fellow in Risca in my constituency a fortnight ago. He was very, exercised about something I will not go into at the present time. \u2018Tories?\u2019 he said \u2018Tories are the kind of people who start off promising you the earth and end up selling you water.\u2019 That is not a bad definition. (Applause) They are not only trying to sell it; they are advertising it to you at your own expense. I think that is pretty rich. Do you know why they are having to advertise it and push it so hard? It is because nobody can understand why anybody should want to sell it, so they are having to flog and push and advertise. Water adverts and electricity adverts - I ask you. \u2018Electricity is a good thing for you.\u2019 I did not know that before. (Laughter) How did I miss out and not realise that water was good for me? A fellow in my office had his prospectus a fortnight ago from the Anglia Water Board. They said \u2018As a water user, we are giving you priority.\u2019 (Laughter and applause) When I see those adverts on the hoardings and the television, do you know what I am reminded of? Have you ever been in a town in the Soviet Union, especially a big town with those great boulevards? They have those huge, heroic hoardings with preposterous slogans and paintings of people with muscles on their muscles. You know the ones I mean. They have taken those down in Russia. They are putting them up in Britain. (Laughter and applause) They are putting them up for water and electricity, and I guess we shall go on seeing water ads. It has nothing to do with privatisation, you understand. It is just a coincidence, because a couple of months before water privatisation the regional boards decided that they needed to engage in some public relations. It was a total coincidence; they did not even know there was going to be water privatisation. So we\u2019ll continue to see these water ads. But I do not know how much we shall see of the electricity ads, for a few months in any case, because they have got into a total shambles with the effort to sell off electricity. A bigger shambles would only come if they actually managed to sell it off. Comrades, there, is a race against time. It is a race between the sale of electricity and the next Labour government.Indeed, if is a race between not only the privatisation of electricity, but the privatisation of the coal industry as well. Perhaps if they ever really do get around to putting together a Bill, the Privatisation of the Coal Industry Bill, they will at least have the honesty to put an accurate title on it, \u2018The Termination of the Coal Industry Bill,\u2019 for that is certainly what it would be. (Applause)Shambles or not, they are desperate to sell both water and electricity, not because they want to serve any sensible purpose of the economy or energy, the environment or any strategic purpose. On the contrary, selling either or both of those utilities contradicts every strategic, environmental, logical, industrial and reasonable purpose. The reason that the government is so anxiously obsessed with selling off these two industries is that they want the receipts so that they can bankroll themselves for the next general election. That is the real reason why they want to sell off electricity and water.They might succeed in getting under the wire before the election. They might succeed in doing that, but, frankly, it is not going to, help them very much at the ballot box, because there are huge majorities in every opinion poll against the sell-off of water and electricity. The reasons are simple. The British people are opposed to the sell-offs because they are more socially responsible, more community minded, more realistic, more far-sighted and more patriotic than the government that governs them. That is why they are against the sell-off of water and electricity. (Applause)The people know, as we know, that it is simply wrong to put vital: utilities of this kind into the hands of private monopolies, not least because we know - and the British people know - that the whole thrust of privatisation, collides head on with environmental concern.Privatisation of water and electricity also puts a great big gaping hole straight through the government\u2019s claim to be guardians of the environment. This government cannot prove green credentials simply by moving Nick Ridley - I am not saying anything about the disposal of toxic waste - and replacing him with a much better public relations merchant, Chris Patten, the slick following the Nick. (Laughter and applause) That does not prove green credentials. They do not prove green credentials even by introducing a Green Bill over a year after we offered to draft one for them.For the Tories to have any credibility at all as trustees of the environment, they are going to have to take a much bigger and more serious step. For them to have that credibility, they are going to have to change the whole basis of their philosophy.The central canon of Thatcherism is that the market is sovereign and that the earth and all that therein is should be governed by the magical movement of demand and supply. Whatever else you can look after with that system, you cannot look after the environment with such a system. (Applause) This essence of Thatcherism is dressed up as the Big Idea. The reality is that it is a very small, very cheap, very nasty idea. It is an old idea as well. Municipal Tories like Joe Chamberlain rejected it 100 years ago. They rejected it because they said that private monopoly ownership of utilities like water and gas were incompatible with the public good. They knew that 100 years ago, when enterprise capitalism in Britain was red in tooth and claw, a period when Margaret Thatcher would have regarded it as bliss to be alive. But she would not have got a Tory mandate then for water privatisation.Market sovereignty of the kind that Margaret Thatcher preaches is most certainly incompatible with the investment in research, the effective regulation, inspection, supervision, prevention, co-­operation and decentralisation of powers that are among the essential ingredients of a competent policy for the conservation and improvement of the local, national and global environment We understand the need to implement such comprehensive policies, and there are working examples to instruct us on many of the most salient objectives.In Denmark and Sweden two weeks ago I saw how the problem of refuse and the problem of heating homes were brought together to make a solution. Two problems making one solution. In Copenhagen, for instance, the city\u2019s refuse is incinerated in conditions which are subject to the most rigorously enforced and constantly improving environmental standards. The resulting heat combines with surplus heat from the city\u2019s other power-stations to warm 250,000 homes very cheaply and dependably. They have reduced by 30 per cent the energy needed to heat Copenhagen\u2019s homes over the past 10 years. The residue of the waste is 6 per cent of its original volume. That is a good deal. In a country like ours, where we have a huge amount of waste, some of it lethal and all of it ugly, we know we just cannot keep on piling it up. To serve the future properly we have got to adopt policies that are socially and economically functional and environmentally progressive. The innovations of the Swedes, the Danes and the Norwegians instruct us, and we shall be emulating and improving upon the developments that they have made.Those innovations go much wider than waste incineration. In the same visit I saw Volvo and SKF, the biggest ball-bearing manufacturer in the world - two companies as hard-nosed and competitive as any companies anywhere - implementing the environment policies worked out in conjunction with the government, local authorities, environmental groups and trade unions. Those companies are prospering, not in spite of the environmental conditions which they satisfy, but because of those conditions. That was the testimony of the companies. They acknowledge that the stimulus comes from the government that sets environmental targets and timetables to achieve them. The same companies told me that they bettered the targets and the timetables; they had reduced their waste and attained greater efficiency in the process, reducing marginal costs. They do not regard such government involvement as \u2018interfering.\u2019 In this and many other ways they consider government involvement to be normal and necessary.I am not describing perfection. I do not have the awe of a return visitor from an environmental Shangri La. I am not saying that what they have got is perfect; they would not accept that it was and certainly it is not. I am saying that in this country we could - and we must - make such progress in exactly the same way. In government we are determined to achieve that, and even in the couple of years before we are elected, we are going to use the evidence of those working models to campaign for the speediest possible change in our country, which is getting dirtier and more dangerous by the minute.There are some of course who believe that concern for the environment is largely a passing anxiety of the affluent who have nothing else to worry about. That is wrong on all counts. The concern is not passing. The concern is here to stay, and the only change will be that it will get bigger. Anybody who believes that the concern stops with the well-heeled has only to go to some of Britain\u2019s cities, where in the Thatcher years the rat population has grown substantially, not out of sympathy with the Conservative party, but because of changed eating habits and because of sewers that are in increasing disrepair, through no fault of the local authorities. In those and other areas, damp and disrepair are the greatest environmental concerns. A fellow said to me not very long ago, at the beginning of the summer before it really started to get warm, that he had terrible damp problems. It was just at the time that they started advertising water. He said, \u2018Be an H2Owner? I thought I had a monopoly \u2013 it\u2019s coining out of my walls.\u2019 The environmental concern runs right through all levels of society.It goes a great deal further than the people who are far from affluent in our towns and cities. The poorest people in the world are the most environmentally concerned. For them the problems of the environment are not questions relating to the welfare of the ozone layer in ten or 20 years\u2019 time. The problems of the environment for them relate to the immediate and fragile conditions. For them, the condition of the environment is a matter of eating or not eating, living or not living. They are the wretched of the earth. They are the most environmentally concerned.But as they try to care - and very often succeed for the land that they farm and graze, the pressures of poverty are such that very often they are fighting a losing battle. That will go on unless we in this far and prosperous North of the world do much more to help them beat their poverty. But instead of giving help on the scale that is needed, the industrialised nations, the IMF and the World Bank operate finance and debt strategies which have done the opposite of giving help. They have ensured a huge flow of wealth from the poor countries to the rich countries; and the banks have been the major beneficiaries. Between 1983 and 1987, aid payments to countries in Sub-Saharan Africa totalled $58 billion. In the same period $45 billion came out in debt payments. The situation in Latin America is even more stark. Between 1983 and 1987, countries of Latin America received about $28 billion in aid and paid out $226 billion in bank loan repayments. That cannot be right.Far from easing the pressure on the people and on the land, the industrialised countries are intensifying the pressure. It is a terrible global injustice, but it is shocking global stupidity too. In the very act of burdening the people and land of the developing countries with huge payments, the financiers and governments are burdening their own people and their own lands too.Environmental degradation is a communicable disease. Even the most short-sighted in the Northern hemisphere must realise that if we do not help the poor countries to be green and pleasant, we will not have green and pleasant lands ourselves anywhere in the world. (Applause)As part of the strategy for trying to safeguard the future therefore those debts must be radically and rapidly reduced and, as frequently as is possible, cancelled. Development aid must go directly to the poor who know best how to use it. They are the most skilled guardians of the earth, if they are ever given a chance. Developed countries, and the people in developed countries, must adopt fair price regimes so that the people of the poor countries have the breathing space and the income to enable them to protect and improve their environment, both for their own sakes and, yes, for our sakes too.That is what we put in the policy review. It is an argument for global citizenship, a recognition of the fact that in the world now and for all the future, passive co-existence is not enough; active co-operation to defeat common problems is essential to environmental security for every country. It is essential for every other form of security too.It is certainly vital in the changing relationship between East and West. We are now at the beginning of the time when we can, in George Bush\u2019s words when he visited Germany earlier this year, \u2018open up the possibilities\u2019 for Europe to forgo the peace of tension for the peace of trust. Even in the few months since he said that, Poland and Hungary have had their first free elections in many decades. The televised proceedings of the People\u2019s Congress of Deputies in Moscow has shown us the extraordinary and encouraging sight of democratic arguments in that body.This very day in East Germany, on the anniversary of the establishment of the German Democratic Republic, people are demonstrating in their thousands on the streets for freedom. When all that is happening, we know that Europe - the whole of this continent - is never going to be the same again. As Mikhail Gorbachev said in the United Nations last December, \u2018there\u2019s no going back for anyone.\u2019 That is now a central truth of the age; indeed it is a central hope of the age. A momentum is well under way, and whilst there can be no accurate estimate of its speed, the direction is certain.In this party we want to be part of that progress, part of that momentum, making the changes, taking the opportunities. We seek the power to do that. To stop being spectators and start being negotiators. To take our country off the sidelines and put it in the mainstream of advance, where it should rightly be, exercising its influence for understanding improved world relationships. That is what we will do.In the still deep divisions of ideology between East and West there are of course suspicions and rivalries built up over more than 70 years, which are not going to vanish in a year, or in five years or maybe even in ten years. Because of that security will continue to mean armed security. But it must also increasingly mean - and it does increasingly mean - the security of negotiated disarmament and the security of developing social and economic relationships. In other countries of    NATO alliance that is not only understood, it is being pursued with a vigour which is absent from the British Government. There are other members of NATO - notably West Germany - who are already operating agreements to train thousands of young Russians to broaden the business relationships, to offer new technologies. A new dual-track towards security is being built, not a bit like the old one. On it, the efforts for negotiated disarmament are running alongside increasing economic engagement.We want to travel that track. We want to do it for our own interests of security and stability and economic prosperity. We also want to do it because we know that the pressure for freedom that is exercising its irresistible force among the people of the Eastern Bloc needs to be reinforced by economic support from democracies. For the danger will be that if the new liberty being experienced in the trail-blazing countries like Poland and Hungary is surrounded by poverty and under-development in the early years, then that liberty will be fragile. Even the sweet taste of the freedom that these people have yearned for can turn sour if it does not bring with it the beginning of material advancement. Those countries therefore have to make the leap from the command economy to the market economy, from the single party state to pluralism.The problem is that it is physically impossible for them - and physically impossible for anybody - to leap slowly. It is essential therefore that the West - and especially the European Community countries - give support to try to ensure that the take-off of those emerging democracies is firm and their landing is certain and stable.I have talked to democratic socialists from Poland. They explained to me that it is totally understandable that people in large numbers want to make the lurch directly from what they have known, with its shortages and its queues and its inadequacies, to what they believe to be the free market society, as advertised in the glossy magazines. Those who have been exiles in the West, good comrades in the democratic socialist exiled parties, some of whom have gone back to their own countries for the first time in 30 or 40 years and others much younger, tell us that their main task is to counsel people that the best path in those countries is not at either end of the pendulum, but actually in employing the mixture of necessary regulation and the dynamic of the market. The only political philosophy that really offers the opportunity to do that is the democratic socialism that they have been seeking to uphold in those countries all those years. I think that is a tribute to the scope and energy of democratic socialism. And as people think about it the logic is bound to appeal.In the meantime, before people come to final decisions, when this maelstrom of new liberty is swirling in those countries what we have got to do is to provide the maximum opportunity and the best support that we can offer to ensure that people do not just get their freedom, but get the chance to build their standard of living as wellOur country should already be properly involved in that support, certainly in the form of technical and training aid. But once again we see the ambivalent Prime Minister making gestures of encouragement and simultaneously using the language of tension. A couple of weeks ago, when she was in Japan, she described these changes in the Eastern Bloc with their great and inspiring possibilities for the advance of liberty as \u2018a period of uncertainty and danger.\u2019 It need be neither. Of course, no one is asking that defences be utterly dismantled in celebration of the election of Solidarnosc to government. I have not heard anybody advocating that. On the contrary, there could be a period of greater certainty and greater safety if people like Mrs Thatcher really wanted the advance of those conditions and were prepared not just to talk about it but to do something about it But yet again, even at this time of great opportunity to use democracy, to help democracy, we see Mrs Thatcher holding back.It is always the same. From East-West disarmament negotiations to the attitude they adopt in the Commonwealth towards South Africa, to international environmental co-operation, relationships with the Third World and their posture within the European Community, Margaret Thatcher shows that she is from the Greta Garbo school of diplomacy, \u2018I want to be alone.\u2019 (Applause) That is the constant theme. It is not splendid isolation or cunning or sagacity or diplomatic skin. It is a fundamental failure to perceive and to try to secure Britain\u2019s role in a rapidly changing Europe and a rapidly changing world. She is out of touch, out of date and out of step with the British people.We are in step. We share the British people\u2019s recognition of the reality that we have got a positive part to play in the development of the new relationship between East and West. We share their recognition, as they demonstrated it on 15 June, of the reality that we have got an essential part to play in a European Community that belongs at least as much to us as it belongs to anybody else. We are going to make it work in a way that can simultaneously develop it as a community and not just as a market. We are going to see that our country is safeguarded and stimulated and not emptied by that pull to the centre - a movement from Britain and other countries in the Community that would be devastating for so much of the European Community.We will do that job properly, because you see, comrades, what these issues and many like them demonstrate is one of the biggest differences between the Tories and ourselves. In every sphere of policy, international and domestic, the big difference is that we are going forward to face the future to meet it, to try to shape it in the best interests of the British people. The Tories are just waiting for the future to hit them. That is all that can explain the way in which they are so confused over these great changes going on in the world. The way indeed in which, even knowing the fixed date of the arrival of the completion of the Single Market, they made no preparation for it; they just waited for it to come and wash over them. They made no preparation for the Channel Tunnel. They are supposed to be the great sponsors of that idea. They consulted no one, neither locally nor nationally. They did not plan, they did not invest. They will not finance the railways; they do not even know the regions exist. Now they do not even know if they can finance the finishing of the Tunnel.When people are so purblind, when people are so incapable even of working towards fixed targets of the future, when they do not have to guess, look into crystal balls or make estimates, but have got a precise date and still mess it up, there is no part of the future that they are fit to rule.That attitude towards tomorrow that they have is not good enough to serve the future. They are not good enough for the British people. We are now. I know that, you know that. You feel, you rejoice in and you work to increase the support that we have got. It is not an empty claim to say that this Conference is one of progress, is one indeed of celebration, not one of relaxation or of complacency. In Robert Frost\u2019s words, we have \u2018miles to go\u2019 and \u2018promises to keep.\u2019 That should always be a guide for socialism. There is no time in socialism anywhere at all where we can take it easy, lean back, say the job is done. Nobody here will say that. But it is an encouragement, an inspiration to see this party working together, coming to a joint position on objectives, and not only telling itself, but exuding to the British public the feeling that we are fit to serve our country. As I think of those things, I would like to put my feelings into words greater than anything I could ever produce, the words of Percy Bysshe Shelley:A brighter dawn awaits the human day.When poverty and privilege,The fear of infamyDisease and woe,War with its million horrors and fierce hell shall live,But only in the memory of time.Let us seek power. Let us earn power. Let us be elected to power. Let us use power to ensure that all of those evils are put into the memory of time and we shall greet the brighter dawn of that day. (Prolonged applause)

aVDavid, comrades, we meet in this conference in strength and in the confidence that progress and advance bring to us. When we met last year we had over 8,600 Labour councillors in. Britain and had control in 164 councils. That was a record. Now, this year, we have well over 8,900 councillors in Britain and control of a higher record of 175 councils. (Applause) When we met last year, Mid Staffordshire was a Conservative parliamentary seat with a Tory majority of 14,000. Now it is a Labour seat with a majority of 9,000. (Applause)         When we met last year, you will remember that the Tory Party was loudly proclaiming that they had what they called \u2018the right team for the future.\u2019 You will remember Kenneth - not Kenneth Branagh, but Kenneth Baker \u2013 playing Prince Hal: \u2018He which hath no stomach to this fight, let him depart.\u2019 Three weeks later Nigel Lawson went. (Applause) Two months later Norman Fowler went. Three months later Peter Walker went, and then two months after that off went Nicholas Ridley, kaput, as they say. (Applause) They were billed as \u2018the right team for the future.\u2019 Comrades, I have seen the future and it is nearly all resigned. (Laughter)Much else of course has changed in this last year, not all for the better. A year ago at their annual conference the Tories were promising that they would make the economy stronger. It is now in recession. They promised to get inflation down. Then it was 7.4 per cent, now it is 10.6 per cent. They promised to get interest rates down, and on the Thursday of their conference interest rates went up from 14 per cent to 15 per cent. It has been a further year of Tory failure.But the real problem is not just that things are worse now than they were last year. The real problem is that in so many vital respects things are worse now than they were 11 long years ago. (Applause) When Mrs Thatcher became Prime Minister in 1979, Britain, like every other country, was suffering the effects of major increases in oil prices. Britain\u2019s inflation was too high: it was at the European Community average. Now, after 11 years, it is nearly double the European Community average. In 1979, unemployment was 1.25 million and falling; now it is 1.6 million, even by the new accounting system, and rising. Then - 11 years ago - the balance of payments was roughly in balance; now we are heading for a £17 billion deficit this year, following a £20 billion deficit last year, following a £15 billion deficit the year before. They are definitely going for the Triple Crown this year: three deficits above £10 billion. (Applause) In terms of inflation, unemployment, balance of payments, economic growth, interest rates, manufacturing investment, housing starts, tax burden, world trade share, domestic trade share and so many other measures of performance, the Tories are not even back at square one after 11 years.Confronted by all of that, Mrs Thatcher could only say, with a sob in her voice, when she was interviewed last week by a newspaper, that it was likely that no income tax cuts could be made next year \u2018because of the Gulf crisis.\u2019 Even by her standards that was a pretty lame excuse. No one believes that the current economic nose-dive began with the invasion of Kuwait.Everyone knows that it is the direct result of Tory policies that long pre-date the aggression of Saddam Hussein. But in any case, whatever desperate excuse the Prime Minister thinks up for not cutting income tax, I have to say that I do not think that income taxes should be cut next year. (Applause) I think that the children and the pensioners and the sick people of Britain come a long way before income tax cuts next year or for many years to come. (Applause)Of course, tax bands can be changed to increase fairness, savings and investment can be encouraged through the tax system to increase efficiency, and there is one tax that can be cut - the poll tax. We are going to cut it out of existence altogether. (Applause)The Tory idea that general cuts in income can be justified in a country where the schools are under-funded, the wards are being closed, the land, the water and the air are dirty and the streets are not safe is rejected not only by me, but by the great majority of the British people. Such ideas deserve to be rejected, not because no one likes to pay tax, but because anyone with any sense at all knows that further general reductions in income taxation mean further general decline in the standards of provision that are essential to life in a civilised, secure community.If the Tories cannot cut income tax, what are they going to do? They have only ever got one answer to that. \u2018Keep interest rates up, keep on squeezing the economy, keep on the pressures of recession and eventually,\u2019 they say, \u2018inflation will come down and all will be well.\u2019 That is their plan. It will not work; it never works. Kenneth Baker said as much last week. \u2018We\u2019ve dealt with inflation twice before,\u2019 he said. That rather begs the question, doesn\u2019t it? If you have dealt with inflation twice, why have you got to do it three times? (Applause) If they dealt with inflation in 1980, why did it come back in 1985? If they dealt with it in 1985, why is it back now? The answer is that they did not \u2018deal with\u2019 inflation. Their single response of very high interest rates can of course bring the inflationary temperature down. It can cool the fever. But high interest rates cannot by themselves combat the virus of inflation. On the contrary, high interest rates inflict such wounds on the economy that the higher investment costs, the higher production and living costs that they leave behind, even after the rates have been temporarily cut, make the economy yet more prone to weakness and the return of inflation. That has happened twice in the last Tory decade. That is what will happen again unless they radically change their policies. Sadly, there is not too much of a chance of that.So what should they be doing now in the circumstances that they have created by their own incompetence and irresponsibility? I will tell them, not from some academic sideline or as the leader of a minority party with no prospect of power or even years away from a general election where events may intervene. I. will tell them what they should do to help our country now, and do it from the standpoint of someone who knows that within the next 12 or 18 months, whenever the Tories choose to call a general, election, we shall win that election and face the problems, the legacy and the mess that they leave. (Applause)What should they do? First, they should cut the very high interest rates and so reduce industrial and housing costs. That is what we would do. That is what we will do if interest rates are at their current level. Secondly and simultaneously, in. order not to release a consumer credit spree that would suck in imports, they should introduce controls on the supply of credit, restraints in what the banking system is allowed to lend. Several other mixed economies do it successfully. That is what we would do. That is what we will do.Thirdly, they should be negotiating entry into the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System, not as a short term anti-inflationary measure, a wing and a prayer, not as an electoral expedient, which is how they now see it, but as a strategic means of providing stability to the British economy and to British producers. That is what we would do. That is what we will do: interest rate cuts, credit controls, negotiated entry to the exchange rate mechanism. They are not what the Prime Minister calls \u2018soft options.\u2019 There are no soft options anywhere at any time for anybody. But there are sensible options. They are the changes necessary to bring the beginnings of cost reductions and stability that are vital to the productive economy. They are not easy, but they are certainly better than continuing to squash whole areas of the industrial economy with insupportable interest rates. They are the sensible options. Crushing industry is the suicide option. That is what they are doing. (Applause)Of course, when people speak in such terms, the Prime Minister describes them as the voices of gloom. She does not like that. So, ever the gentleman, permit me to be the voice of optimism. Let me set aside the gloom and say that in this country of ours there is enterprise and innovation; there is initiative. There are many managements and workforces with shared objectives. There are great skills of design and adaptation. There is a widespread desire to compete effectively, because everybody knows that ultimately their prosperity and security depend upon it, and when companies and workforces call for change in the government\u2019s economic policies, they are not engaging in special pleading, they do not want featherbedding; all they want is a context in which they can properly prove themselves. That context, that environment for success, is simply not being provided by a government that hits them with very high interest rates 60 to 70 per cent above those that have to be paid by their competitors in the same trade. It is not being provided by a government that refuses to make the commitment to research and training that is common amongst our competitors.Even as I describe the conditions that disadvantage our producers, as they are very frequently put to me by people on both sides of industry, I can already hear the Tories saying \u2018These aren\u2019t the responsibilities of government. Industries should stand on their own feet. All these matters should be left to the market.\u2019 That is the constant mantra of the last 11 years.Other governments do not think like that. Even if in public they say they think like that, in private they certainly do not act like that. When governments in Japan, France, Germany and other countries provide the long term support to industry and ours does not, it really is no good for the Prime Minister, the Chancellor of the Exchequer or Nicholas Ridley to cry \u2018Foul.\u2019 They have to understand that we are not involved in cricket but in ruthless competition, and they have to give our people a fair chance, as other countries give their people a fair chance. (Applause)That competition is hotting up. Just 27 months from now the European Community will be a completed single market. If the government here does not do what must be done to help to strengthen the performance of British industry, inflation will remain a recurrent plague and the slide into deficit and debt, unemployment and insecurity will continue. It is to stop that slide, to provide the realistic alternative, that our Labour policies give the highest possible priority to the long term measures that will increase productive and competitive strength in Britain. Nothing supersedes that.We have got to employ science. We have got to mobilise the skills of women and men on equal terms. We have got to modernise our transport system and diffuse new technologies throughout industry. Above all, we have got to raise the standards of training and education to levels that at least compare with those of our main competitors. So much is obvious; yet ours is the only major industrial country which is spending less on research and development as a share of national wealth than it did 10 years ago. The under-funding of research and development, the shortage of qualified science teachers in our schools, the brain-drain of scientists and technologists to other countries, the crisis of morale that is reported from so many parts of the science community, are not isolated features. They are the results of a bias against science, the disregard of the importance of research and development, the refusal to invest in ideas in an age when that investment is critical to any possibility of success. That attitude must be reversed. We will do that.We will shift spending from military to civil research and development in order to get better economic value for public investment. We will increase basic research, bring it together with industrial needs and achieve the successful technology transfer that is increasingly common in the economies of our competitors. Like those competitors, we will provide security and continuity in research and development by using takeover regulations and tax policies to see that firms that are making the research and development commitment are not targeted by takeover predators, which too often is the case. With those and other changes we will be developing a long term infrastructure for science in Britain.We need to do the same with transport. Amongst the most vital components of the modern, integrated transport system that Britain needs to succeed there must be modern, high speed rail links running from Scotland and Wales through the length and breadth of England to the Channel tunnel and on to the European mainland beyond. (Applause) We will build those rail links. We will do it through a financial partnership between public and private sectors. That is how the TGV has been financed in France, and now, 10 years after it was embarked upon, the TGV network is not only spreading prosperity to the regions of France, stimulating investment and creating jobs, but repaying its capital costs and earning a healthy return for public and private investors alike. That would never have happened without the French socialist government making exactly the long term commitment that the British Tory government over the same period has categorically refused to make. Nothing could more clearly express the great gap in the attitudes, between a government that has an active partnership with the private sector in strengthening the economy and a government whose perverse ideology will not allow such a productive relationship.Every commuter, every driver, every business - and therefore every citizen in Britain - is paying dearly for that dogma. It is inefficient, it is anti-social, it neglects the environment, it disables the economy. That dogma is a barrier across the road to national progress. Everyone now knows that the only way to clear away that block is to get rid of the government that forms the block across the road to progress. (Applause) We will use the combination of public ­and private funding to the benefit of the public and the private interest in Britain.A strategic policy for science and technology and a modern transport system are essential components of a long term economic strategy. But without doubt the most fundamental requirement of future success is improvement in the British education system. Parents know it. Employers, teachers and students themselves know it. The general public knows it. They also know that there is a crisis in British education. Everybody realises that with the exception of the government. Only the government denies it. They deny it not only because they are completely out of touch with the realities of the state schooling system in our country, but because they are also out of sympathy with the state schooling system that provides for a huge majority of the parents and children of this country. (Applause)They have got to be replaced by a government that is in touch, a government committed to improvement, a government of people who do not favour the maintained schools in any abstract sense, but who support them because those schools educate their own children. The only government of that character, as Jack Straw brilliantly demonstrated yesterday; will be the Labour government. (Applause)The Conservative government\u2019s practice of treating schools as if they are laboratories to test out the latest Tory social engineering theories has got to stop. They disrupt, divide and demoralise children, parents, teachers and communities. They do nothing for general standards in results or in conduct. They have little to do with learning and everything to do with political meddling.In this party and, I believe, in this country people want improved education, not perpetual experimentation with the lives and futures of their children. (Applause) We regard it, first, to be essential to improve the provision of the equipment of education: the supply of qualified teachers, the essential, books and learning materials, the buildings and facilities which are vital ingredients of an up-to-date education system. Teachers, books, materials, buildings - it is called getting back to basics, the basics that will ensure that teachers are able to give more attention to individual children, the basics that foster achievement in reading, writing, number - yes, and in cultural and sporting activities, because they too are essential to the rounding and good grounding of every youngster. No youngster should be denied the chance of access to music, literature and sport. None should be denied that; too many are now. (Applause)The basics include those fundamental requirements of actively encouraging parents to be involved in and informed about the education of their children, partners with the schools instead of being continually regarded as being an alternative source of funding because the government will not provide the resources. (Applause)Secondly, as a feature of our approach to education we will get rid of the concept that education for the majority is something that begins round about five and ends round about 16. That is why we aim to provide nursery education for every three and four-year-old whose parents wish to exercise that choice. (Applause) It is vital not only for the advantage of the child and its social and educational development, but for the liberty and the choice of men and women parents who want to sustain careers, who need frequently to get jobs and should not, as was said from this platform yesterday, perpetually face the dilemma of making a choice between a reasonable standard of living and caring in the way that they want to for their children.I have to say that I read in a report this morning that Mrs Thatcher, speaking in the wake of the meeting that she attended of the United Nations this weekend, spoke of the need for mothers to give attention to nurture and provide wisdom. Nobody in their right mind could disagree with that. But I wish the Prime Minister comprehended the advantage - the wonder - of being able to do that with your children and would do something to ensure that many more parents could do it with their children too, because they love their children as much as she ever loved hers. (Applause)We shall implement our policies to reform education and training after 16 and provide access to vocational and. academic courses through which people can earn qualifications appropriate to their needs and abilities.Thirdly, the cuts in central government funding for education have got to stop. Huge losses have been inflicted on education in Britain over these years. This year the Tory government will be allocating 4.8 per cent of gross national product to all forms of central expenditure on education. If they had maintained the commitment of the last Labour government \u2013 5.5 per cent of GNP \u2013 Britain\u2019s primary and secondary schools, colleges, polytechnics, and universities would this year be £3.6 billion better off than they are now. Figures and percentages of GNP are immensely boring. Figures of £3.6 billion are immensely boring. But translate that in terms of teachers, books, decent classrooms, access to university and higher education, and all of a sudden they become immensely exciting, the greatest adventure that people can have, the fulfilment of their own desire to find their education liberation. That is denied when the GNP is cut back on that scale. (Applause)     No one expects that we shall be able immediately or even in years to make up fully this huge shortfall. We will strive to do it, naturally, but such is the position from which we shall have to start after the years of Toryism that we are going to have to build up to those levels. That is what our neighbours and competitors did. They did not achieve their educational and economic success by borrowing wildly or by taxing fiercely. We shall not be doing either of those. They did it by committing the public expenditure that they could afford and, above all, by keeping on doing it year after year. We must do the same.I will give you an example of what I mean. France, like every other country, is today under economic pressure as a. result of the Gulf crisis. Unlike Britain, they have no oil of their own, and in their budget published a fortnight ago the government has tightened expenditure in many areas in order to cope with the present and projected costs arising from the emergency. But there is an exception to that budgetary restraint - indeed, there is an exemption. Their education budget has not been reduced at all. Their education budget for this financial year is increased by 9 per cent. That is what you mean when you say that socialism is the religion of priorities, a 9 per cent increase in the education budget, even in straitened circumstances.They have been following those policies for 10 years through thick and thin. They have done it because they know that if they want strength, they must have skill, and if they are to have skill, they must have more people educated to a higher level in smaller classes with sufficient teachers. That is the only way in which it adds up. They are not just talking about it or wishing for it, they are getting on with it. They are investing in it.The French education is obviously not without its blemishes, but what is not in doubt is the superiority of their levels of participation, access and opportunity. Participation, access and opportunity are the keys to unlock the door to achievement - not just economic advance, but cultural and spiritual fulfilment, for that also \u2013 indeed mainly - is what education is about too. We are not in the business of seeking to produce a computer age version of hewers of wood and drawers of water. We want capable people, confident people, demanding citizens, people who are adaptable and applicable. Education is the key to giving people all of that opportunity. It has advanced in France. We have got to catch up with that with the next Labour .government. We must provide those keys. In education, as in so many other fields, our country can only get out what it puts in. If we want to get out of education the skills of the future for the people of the future, we have to put in now and keep on putting in.Obviously, it will not be enough to do it only in education. It must be done in training too. The reason for that is obvious. Eight out of 10 people who will be in our workforce in the year 2000 are already of working age and they need training for work and in. work. Over two\u2011thirds of the working people in Italy, Germany, France and Spain are getting some skilled vocational training. But in Britain, after 11 years of Conservative government, only a little over one-third of our working people get any training at all. That is hardly surprising when the government seems to regard training not as a key to economic success, but as a branch of social security - and a pretty flimsy branch at that.Now, after a decade of de-skilling, the government is cutting more millions from the training budget. When there are no incentives to train, no advice on how to train, no targets for quantity or quality that compare with those of our competitor countries, it is not surprising that so many companies do not make the proper training commitment.As you heard from Tony Blair yesterday, the Labour government\u2019s national training strategy will be used to overcome that great strategic weakness. It will be built on a practical national and local partnership between employers, trade unions and the providers and users of education and training. We will concentrate on the quantity and quality of training and qualifications from training that will be adaptable in the service of women and men throughout their working lives in order to meet and master the changes that they will encounter with great rapidity. That is why we shall be giving strong encouragement to the industries and employers who do make a proper commitment to training. It is also the reason why we shall require employers who do not train, but who \u2018pirate\u2019 from the responsible firms, either to change their ways or to make a financial contribution so that training can be provided.At the level of the national economy, the industry, the firm and the individual, we shall be working to enable Britain to become a capable, country. We shall do it not only to ensure that individuals have greater control over their lives and their futures, but also because we know that in the 1990s the technological revolution and the advance of our country\u2019s fortunes depends upon success in the training revolution.Those policies for the strengthening of Britain\u2019s productive and competitive performance have obvious purposes. They are essential if our country is to pay its way. They are essential if our producers are to generate the wealth necessary for future investment. They are essential too if we are to generate the wealth that is necessary to provide high and rising standards of social justice, welfare support and opportunity in our country. They are policies that will mean, not simply demand, ends.That is essential if we want to pay - and keep on paying - proper pensions. It is essential if we want to fund fully - and go on funding fully - the National Health Service., That is what we will do. We will start to do it by bringing the opted-out hospitals back into the NHS. (Applause) By next April hospitals are supposed to clear their debts and their books to prepare for what the Tories call \u2018reforms.\u2019 Once again we are on the brink of a winter of cuts and closures and distress and pain, but this time it is all being made deliberately worse by a government intent on wrecking the national health service. That is the real price of Tory health care. That is why no one in this, country can afford another Tory government.Certainly, even outside the hospitals and the formal structure of the NHS, there are millions of people, who are chronically ill and being cared for in their own homes, who cannot afford another Tory government. In this country there are 6 million people looking after others, usually relatives, who are young, long-term sick, disabled, elderly or fragile - 6 million carers. The overwhelming majority of them are women. The government has praised their selflessness to the skies, dripping with braid, knobs on and bands playing. But only 110,000 out of the 6 million carers get invalid care allowance. That same praising government has cut carers\u2019 benefits. They have forced cuts in carers\u2019 services. They have taken away carers\u2019 rights to unemployment benefit. This year, to cap it all, the government postponed community care in order to save a few pennies on the poll tax. (Applause) The government that claims to have produced economic miracles and tries to tell us that the economy has underlying strength broke its pledge to provide the package of nursing and home care, daycare and respite care that should have been available through community care. Next week the Tory Party conference will meet under the slogan \u2018The Strength to Succeed.\u2019 I just wonder what sort of strength it takes to inflict blow after blow on people who are trying to care for their desperately sick loved ones in their own homes. (Applause) I would say it was brutal strength, wouldn\u2019t you?No wonder caring families feel cheated. They are not asking for much help. They are not asking to be relieved of their obligations. They would do what they do in any case in the cause of love and duty. Often they do it in circumstances of dire poverty and isolation, at risk to their own physical and mental health. If these 6 million people did not do it - or even a large proportion of them - the rest of us would have to find the funds to pay for beds in long stay residential care for elderly people at a cost of over £200 a bed per week. The costs would be vast.As well as being humane, it makes sense therefore to operate a comprehensive system of community care with earmarked, local government funds. It makes sense to develop a carers\u2019 benefit, as we are doing. It makes sense to allocate responsibility for this major part of the nation\u2019s services to the sick to a new Department of Health and Community Care. A Labour government will do all of that. We owe it to the sick, and as a society we most certainly owe it to those who care for them:The government\u2019s desertion of their promise to introduce community care is, sadly, far from unique. Indeed, it is the stock-in-trade of the government, especially when they have given undertakings to support social progress or to improve the quality of life and eventually find themselves faced with the demand to deliver. They have a Prime Minister who tried to present herself as the .guardian of the earth. They have a Secretary of State for the Environment, who I thought at one time was so green that he was inhaling carbon dioxide and inhaling oxygen. (Laughter and applause) The Tories have had 11 years in power, huge resources and inexhaustible supplies of high quality information and advice on every part of the battle to save the national and global environment. But last week they drew themselves up to their full height and produced an environment White Paper which has something to say about practically everything and something to do about practically nothing at all. (Applause)They are not a pressure group; they are not an opposition; they are not a think tank. They are a government that has been in power for 11 years and can exercise power. Even while no one with any sense - certainly none of the leading environmental groups - thinks that everything can be done at once, it is reasonable to ask that there should be some specific commitments to specific action. Why do they not at the very least go with our European neighbours and act as they have done against global warming, make the commitment to stabilise carbon dioxide emissions by the year 2000 and make substantial cuts in the early years of the next century? That is what we shall be doing.        Why, when traffic congestion and vehicle pollution are the fastest growing threat to our environment, do they not make the commitment to build a high speed rail network to link every part of Britain with the rest of Europe? That is what we shall be doing. Why don\u2019t they make the commitment to establish strong, independent agencies to set and secure environmental standards for food, air and water with the health and safety of children as the benchmark for acceptable standards? That is what we shall be doing. Why do they not in a number of other areas such as the trade in toxic waste, the cleaning up of the North Sea and targets for development aid, act as if they really meant it when they said that they were guardians of the earth? We would accept it and support them. (Applause)All of what I list are practical, achievable targets. Indeed, they might be regarded as modest for a government that says that it wants to promote the cleaning of the environment \u2018from the street corner to the stratosphere,\u2019 but then they will not commit the resources to clean the street corner. (Laughter and applause) If you do it, you get poll tax capped. So it is not really surprising that while they will sign on the dotted line of just about any international environment conventions, they will take little action to honour such conventions in practice. They will make any commitment as long as it does not commit them to anything.In many ways this last year has been the fastest year in history. A year ago when this conference met, Hungary and. Poland had just had their first free elections and still faced what they thought would be a journey of some years to full democracy and independence. Czechoslovakia was still ruled by Husak and the dictatorship re-established in 1968. Romania was still ruled by Ceausescu\u2019s barbarism. In East Germany the people were just starting to come out onto the streets, but Honecker was still in power and the Stasi in authority. The Warsaw Pact, so far as anyone knew, was still a cohesive military alliance which faced NATO. The Western Alliance was still confined to its 45-year-old military role. Now here we are in October 1990. Poland and Hungary are independent. Czechoslovakia is a free country under - glory of glory - the presidency of a playwright. Romania has freedom, but it seems it has yet to achieve the same confident liberty of Czechoslovakia. The Warsaw Pact has effectively ceased to exist. NATO has considered specific proposals for increasing its political role, and resolved upon the establishment of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe in a permanent institution. At midnight tonight there will be no more East Germany or West Germany. That country will be united as a parliamentary democracy. We send from here through the West German ambassador - from tomorrow, I hope, the German ambassador - Herr von Richthofen, who is here this afternoon, our best, wishes and solidarity to the people of Germany for a great and prosperous future in freedom. (Applause)These marvellous changes bring of course their own problems and dangers; but they are capable of being surmounted. These changes, which some of us thought to be a very desirable though very distant prospect and many more thought to be utterly inconceivable, are now a reality. The impossible has become possible. Hope has become fact.On both sides of what was the East-West divide, people who had become resigned to the idea of no change have become impatient for more change. The end of the Cold War has opened the possibility for the first time in history that by negotiation, by verification, by co-operation in a new security community, all prospect of war can be banished from Europe, the continent that has been the bloodiest battlefield of all human history. Because for decades the East-West deadlock has dominated the political shape of the world, the changes being made across this continent make wider and greater change possible across the rest of the world. The task - the hope - of building a new world order, so long the mission of idealists out of power, has now become the frankly and publicly stated objective of those who hold superpower. That is the great change of our age. That is why it is bliss to be alive now, when the possibilities of these great alterations in the fate of humankind are opening up.By great irony, the conditions which produced the declarations of purpose to work for that new world order by the Presidents of the United States of America and the USSR came as a result of military aggression by a tyrant. The invasion and occupation of .Kuwait by Saddam Hussein has nothing to commend it, obviously. But in the reaction to it, the community of nations has quickly formed bonds and taken joint action in a way that would have been unthinkable two years ago, or even a year ago. God knows what would have happened in those circumstances, without that possibility of immediate and strong international solidarity against such aggression.The action taken, firm and universal sanctions and the deployment of force in defence of Saudi Arabia and its neighbours, was absolutely correct. There is no possibility of an aggressor with the nature of Saddam Hussein being prevented from further attempts at conquest by any other means. That is why the action taken has won and kept the active consent of the world community in the United Nations. The scale and solidarity of that consent clearly means that the longest possible time must be given for sanctions to be used to secure the submission of Saddam Hussein to the will of the United Nations. (Applause)The pressure must be sustained. It must be made clear to the Iraqi dictator that not only does he not have any friends anywhere now; but he can look forward to no accommodation from any part of the world unless and until he withdraws unconditionally from Kuwait. The solidarity of nations must continue to be so implacable that even in his Iraqi fortress Saddam Hussein understands that the shutters of the world are up against him and will stay up against him for as long as he illegally occupies another country. (Applause)Saddam Hussein must be made to succumb to international law. It must be done in such a way as to deny him the fruits of aggression, the means of further aggression, any gain to reputation, any status of martyrdom. In the course of resolving this crisis, every possible effort must be made to avoid creating the conditions for further and even worse turmoil. If that is not done, then Saddam Hussein could so easily, in the eyes of so many people in the Arab countries, be turned from being an aggressor, so scornful of Arab unity that he attacked the neighbouring Arab country and slaughtered its people, into being the greatest Arab resistance leader of a generation.The world community, having imposed the rule of law, must then keep the peace. It is an unending obligation, and one that can only be discharged if, in the wake of the withdrawal from Kuwait, there is a firm and sustained embargo on the sale of all weapons and weapons manufacturing machinery to the country of Iraq. It can only be sustained if Iraq\u2019s chemical weapons and chemical weapon-making equipment is totally dismantled and if Iraq is thoroughly monitored to establish whether there is any nuclear weapon-making capacity and, if there is, that it be utterly removed and never returned. That is what must happen after Kuwait is cleared. (Applause)These purposes can, and must, be fulfilled. But let everyone heed the fact that if they are to be, then the world community must also, first, spread and exert its authority to see that similar actions are taken in the case of other nations with possible chemical and nuclear weapons capacity. Secondly, international action to control and reduce the world arms and arms manufacturing trade will have to be taken with a breadth and thoroughness never previously known in history. (Applause) We must learn the lesson of where Saddam Hussein got his weapons.The whole world now has a vested interest in trying to see that Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait is achieved, if possible by peaceful means. The reasons for that go far beyond the need to remove any threat to the security of much of the world\u2019s oil reserves, important though that is to every nation, rich and poor.           In the weeks since the United Nations first responded to the Iraqi invasion, it has become clear that there is a real ambition to forge a new and effective structure for world security. If such a structure could be given strength, it would have boundless potential for co-ordinated international action, not just to prevent or push back aggression, but even to combat poverty, to protect the environment and to become an agency, if not for democracy, then at least for recognisable freedoms.None of that is certain. None of it is guaranteed. There is no straight path leading from the Security Council and its specific resolutions towards a new, golden age of liberty, prosperity and safety for the whole of the planet. But it is important to know that the objective is now within the realms of possibility and not smothered by Cold War or excluded by hopelessness. Such a development offers a prospect of stable peace unknown in history. It is, in the words of President Bush in Congress very recently, a \u2018new world struggling to be born.\u2019No one should found all their hopes - even less all their policies - upon that effort. It could yet be a house built on sand. But what everybody should do is to open up their minds to the possibility that it can be a firmly based and enduring global security structure and that it is worth striving for. The watchword must be \u2018Don\u2019t dream of what may be; work for what can be.\u2019 The understanding must be that it is worth working for.There are countless reasons for that. This afternoon I give you one: children - the children of the earth. Of the world\u2019s children under the age of five, 40,000 die every day, mainly from hunger and preventable diseases of hunger. Of the world\u2019s children, 20 million suffer severe malnutrition, 150 million are chronically underfed and 100 million children never have any schooling. The statistics of childhood misery and early death in this world are horrifying.The cause of most of the countries\u2019 tragedies is poverty. The poverty is brought about not by natural disasters, but by exploitation, under-development and war. Those evils can be stopped. They are man-made. They can be man-prevented. It is within the power of the adults of the world to do that.That power could be multiplied beyond measure if the structures of security which are now amongst the ambitions of world leaders were established to promote aid, to protect the environment, to relieve debt burdens, to establish fair trade, to spread education, health care and. housing in place of ignorance, disease and squalor.In this party we will not be dreaming of that, we will be working for it. We are democratic socialists. Our cause is the welfare of the community. We recognise no boundaries in that cause between countries or continents. (Applause) We shall work for the new security structures. We shall work for the new world order, because it is natural to us and necessary for our country and for our world.We shall go on doing it in opposition and we shall do it with full effect in government. That day is coming. We are fit and ready not just to win, but to govern the people of this country. Let us fulfil that purpose, not for our own advantage, but out of our duty to the people of our country and of our world. (Standing ovation)

aVComrades, thank you very much. Tom, comrades. Well, somebody is blowing the whistle and I think even the Prime Minister can hear it. (Applause)Could I, before I open my speech, thank you very much Tom for quoting from Idris Davies. Idris said, \u2018He that forgets his history lives in the slough of slavery.\u2019 I think that will prove to be instructive when people recall the last 12 years because we are here today and we will fight through these coming months, as we now understand it to be, to change history and lift the burden from the people of our country. (Applause)This morning I went to see Jo Richardson. She is in good spirits and is making a good recovery and she sends her love to all of you and her thanks for the marvellous messages of support and love that have come from this conference. Jo is an inspiration and with a little bit of luck she will be back with us tomorrow in order to wind up on the debate. Let us hope that will be the case. (Applause)Conference, what a year it has been for the Conservatives. They started it by losing their leader and ended it by losing their nerve. Last night it became evident that Britain has a government that is afraid of the people. I want to tell the Conservative Party this: \u2018You can postpone people's choice but you will not change the people's verdict. You can run but you cannot hide.\u2019 (Applause)If I may coin a phrase, what we are seeing is a government, a British government, scuttling round the press handing out rumours through its own ministers. Well, I tell them this, they cannot play politics with people\u2019s jobs and with people\u2019s lives. The people will hold them to account. The Prime Minister cannot even bring himself to make a candid public statement, telling the people that he is running away from their judgement and trying to prolong his fingernail grip on power. It will do him no good; worse, it does this British democracy no good when a government manipulates in this fashion. It must be ended, and Labour will end such a system. (Applause)The people of Britain want a government that puts the country first, not the party first and they will get that with a Labour government, for that is what this party wants. It wants our country rebuilt again, our country bold, audacious and just again. We will put the country first. We are ready, fit to serve and able to lead Britain to a better future. We have the policies that the people want. We have a fine team for government, indeed we have the best team for government, of that there is no doubt and we have been building support in every contest. (Applause)In this last year we have continued our successes in local government elections. There are now more Labour councillors and more Labour councils in Britain than there ever have been in history. We have continued our successes in Parliamentary by-elections, particularly in that spectacular victory in Monmouth and in that unique contest in Walton. Militant, squeezed into the open, were soundly beaten by democratic socialists, and they always will be beaten by democratic socialists. (Applause)Comrades, we have earned our support and we shall earn our victory by addressing the real needs of the people of our country. By looking at a future instead of reaching for the past, by being positive.The Tories have done the opposite. They fought the European elections in 1989 relying entirely on negatives and name calling. They lost. In the local elections last year and this year they relied on negatives and name calling. They lost. They will be relying on negatives and name calling again in the General Election and they will lose again. As my father used to say, \u2018The best answer to dirty play, boy, is score a goal.\u2019 We are going to score a goal. (Applause)Comrades, one of the main reasons why they will lose and deserve to lose, is that they are stale and sour. They have no fresh directions, no fresh approaches to offer to the British people. After years in which the Tories have put Britain at the bottom of the league for growth, bottom of the league for investments, bottom of the league for jobs, they still have no policies for building and keeping strong economic recovery.With one million people on hospital waiting lists, 150,000 homeless families and the highest recorded crime rate in British history, they still have no policies to make our country more fair, more secure. After 12 wasted years, if you want to see their monuments, look around you. Even worse, if you want to see their future, look around you. It is clear from everything they say and everything thing that they do that a fourth term of Tory government would mean more of the same. A fourth term of Tory government would mean at least two more years of poll tax, the tax which could be, should be - and when we are elected will be - abolished immediately. (Applause)A fourth term of Tory government would mean years more of under-funding for schools and under-investment for training. It would mean years more of moving the National Health Service into the market. More years of Toryism would mean years more of falling behind our neighbours and competitors in Europe. It would mean years more on the recession roundabout.If the Tories kept power their policies would again take our country through the rise in credit finance consumption, the rise in deficits, the rise in debt, in inflation, in interest rates and then bring the return to recession and rising unemployment all over again. We know that would happen because they are doing now, in their second recession, exactly what they did in their first recession. By following the same policies they would get the same result, a third recession.The Tories are a government in blinkers, hoping that the British people are wearing blindfolds. They hope in vain. People see what is happening in their own country. They live with the realities and the people of Britain want fresh direction, they want new approaches.People look at the state of our economy, 1000 businesses a week going bankrupt, 3000 people losing their jobs every week, redundancies, closures, in the south as well as the north, the east and the west, in high tech industry, in high street shops, they see all that and they live with all that and they say, \u2018It has to change.\u2019 People look at the state of our society and they look at our neighbours in the rest of the European Community. They see the high standards of training, the quality of child care, the investment in public transport and they ask, \u2018Why not here, why not here in Britain?\u2019 The answer is, it can change, we can do it here with a Labour government and I say that with certainty because we shall be doing here in Britain what others have done and are doing in more successful economies. We shall be investing in economic strength as others do and we shall be providing a climate for investment as others do. That is the foundation of the standards of living and the continuing economic vitality in other Community countries. Their provision for pensioners, for training, for child care, for education and transport and health does not come out of huge levels of taxation. It does not come out of higher levels of public expenditure. It comes from sustained economic success. Success that has been built because year on year they have invested more in their people, invested more in their economy. They have planted wealth to grow wealth. That is what we must do. Those governments, socialist, conservative, coalition governments, whatever else separates them, share a sense of responsibility. They know it is the prime duty of any modern government, certainly any modern democratic government, to create conditions for business to succeed and for individuals and communities to thrive.Britain needs a government with a sense of purpose that will provide the country with a new sense of direction. That is the way for Britain to catch up, to compete, to give of its best and to get the best. We will form such a government and our purpose in government will be to help to create a modern industrial economy so that the whole of the country is mobilised to gain and to maintain prosperity.We will help to create a modern industrial economy, to compete and to succeed in the single market of the European Community. We will invest just as our competitors do, year on year, continually, strategically.That is the way, not just to help Britain out of recession in the short term, it is the way to enable Britain to stay out of recession in the long term.We will do that with practical policies. We will be providing tax incentives to companies so that they bring forward new investment in plant and machinery. We will begin a phased release of the £6 billion held by local authorities that they have got from the sale of council houses. The Tory government forbids them to use that money. (Applause) We will get on using it to build homes. We will use it to bring the construction industries out of recession. We will modernise our transport system by mobilising private as well as public investment.Last week the French Railways Corporation, SNCF, issued a bond in the London money market to raise money to invest in the French high speed rail network, but the Tory government will not let British Rail do the same to get investment in British railways. We will change that. If the French can do it for France, we can do it for Britain and we need it in Britain. (Applause)It is with practical policies like those that we will begin to build sustained strength in the economy, lasting prosperity for our country, and we will be doing more to foster the development of manufacturing industry - still, after all the devastation of the Tory years, responsible for more than 50% of our income from export, still the basis of strength in a service economy.Economic success in the 1990s and in the new century will be built on innovation, on new products and new processes. Economic success will be built on converting scientific inventiveness into competitive industrial production. The Tory government refuses to recognise that. In the last 10 years they have cut the share of public support for research and development. The result is that for every public £1 spent in Britain on discovering and developing new technologies for industry, £1.50 is spent in Italy, £2 is spent in France, £2.35 in Germany. There just is not any comparison even though we face the same challenges in a testing world.After 12 years of this government the Department of Education and Science estimates that by the mid-1990s Britain will be short of 3000 qualified technology teachers and 2000 chemistry teachers.Other research forecasts serious shortages of maths and physics teachers. What a way to enter a new phase of the technological age and the same goes, of course, to teachers of modern languages and indeed in many other areas, where the skills and talents and interests of children need the nourishment of qualified teaching.All of that would be shameful at any time in any advanced country but it is all the worse in Britain, where the capacity to invent has been and still is so very strong. Everyone knows that British scientists invented the first steam engine, the first electric motors, generators and transformers, radio, television, the first jet engine, the first cardiograph, penicillin, the first computer. The list goes on. It is a glorious list. A list worthy of great pride. But what is much more important to our generation than that pride in what is past, is the fact that the genius of scientific inventiveness is still strong in Britain today. The transputer, fibre optics, the catalytic converter, the body scanner, clean coal technologies, liquid crystal display, holograms, microwave technology - just a few of the epoch-making modern achievements of today\u2019s British scientists.These are the sort of discoveries that change the whole way in which things are made across the world. They change and shape our lives, but the tragedy is that so many of those modern products, developed from the brilliance of contemporary British scientists, are not made here. Not made in Britain. They are taken and developed by overseas firms, turned into manufactures made elsewhere and then sold back to us as finished or part-finished goods. Invented in Britain but made abroad. It is resigning the future.We have got to change that. We have got to do everything possible to ensure that the products invented in Britain are developed in Britain, made in Britain, sold to the markets of the world from Britain. I make that not as any nationalistic argument but I do say that, when we have these remarkable assets of genius we really should be able to convert them into production in the jobs, in the success, in our own country. That is what we should be doing. (Applause) We should be making, indeed we have to make, Britain into an innovation-driven economy and we will do it.We will do it with sustained research funding, we will do it with a Ministry of Science, we will do it by establishing technology trusts modelled on the success in Germany and Japan. We will be linking research in universities and polytechnics with business and industry. An innovation-driven economy needs a tax system and economic policies which promote sustained investment. It needs monopolies and mergers regulations that promote competition and safeguard company programmes of research and development. We shall make those changes. An innovation economy, above all, needs increases in the quality and the quantity of human skills. The most valuable resource of the country, our only truly renewable resource, is the talent and imagination of our people. Fostering those abilities is essential to personal opportunity, personal prosperity and personal liberty and it is vital to national economic, social and cultural well-being.The present government refuses to face up to that fact. Bribes are offered to opt out. Money is lavished on city technology colleges, league tables are introduced, when what is really needed is not league tables but laboratory equipment, modern classrooms and qualified teachers to work in those classrooms. (Applause)Kenneth Clarke, saying why he thought he had to have league tables last week, said that what happened inside schools was a mystery. Well, we know why it is a mystery to Kenneth Clarke, he does not use those schools. (Applause)I tell you what is the real mystery. It is how a government, in 12 years, collects unprecedented assets, revenues from North Sea oil, the sell-off of public resources, the highest tax bill in British history and still manages to cut expenditure on education by £3 billion. That is a mystery. (Applause)Why has he been doing all that? Training is cut, research is cut, capital and revenue support for schools is cut, support for colleges is cut. Clearly, our country cannot hope to succeed with such policies.That is why, as you heard from Jack Straw and Tony Blair yesterday, we have set out and we will implement new directions in education and training. We are going to make proper commitment to primary schools. We are going to improve the National Curriculum so that every student can combine academic and vocational subjects. We are going to make post-16 provision that will take us towards the standards achieved elsewhere in the European Community. We are going to develop the higher and adult education system, so that all people who can take advantage of it can do so to bring out the best in themselves, right throughout their lives. Yes, and we will be expanding and improving pre-school education too. (Applause) That should be basic to any modern society so that children can learn and parents, especially their mothers, can earn.If anyone does not understand why it is so important, perhaps I can tell you an everyday story by way of explanation. It is the story of a four year-old child, of a father with an industrial disease which meant that he had to travel long distances for specialist treatment and of a mother with training but without anyone to look after the child because the family was a lengthy bus journey away. What saves that family from living on unemployment benefit? A nursery school. A nursery school with good facilities and qualified teachers 10 minutes away from home.The nursery school that I went to 45 years ago, the nursery school that meant that my father could get his treatment and then eventually get back to work, the nursery school that meant my mother could return to nursing and serving the community, a nursery school enabling and transforming the lives of a whole family. That is the reason for pre-school education. (Applause)That was 1946. Frank was talking about \u2018old codgers.\u2019 It put me in my place, didn\u2019t it? Now, in 1991, standards of that kind really should not be too much to ask in a modern country, should they? (Applause)In the rest of the European Community, it is taken for granted. 88% of three to five year-olds in Italy get pre-school education. 95% in Belgium, 95% in France. In Britain just 40% of under-fives get pre-school education and but for the efforts of Labour councils up and down the country, the figure would be a fraction of that. (Applause)That has got to change and with a Labour government it will change, so that we can reach those European standards and give children and parents in Britain the same chances and the same security.Comrades, incentives to invest, proper commitment to education and training, modern transport, scientific and industrial innovation: these are the new directions that Britain needs to build long-term competitiveness and lasting prosperity. These are the new directions that Britain must take to succeed in the European single market and the movement towards economic and monetary union that lies beyond that. These are the changes that are coming in Europe. We must be ready for them. If we lag, we lose, yet again.That is why we are determined to put Britain into Europe\u2019s first division and we have the policies to do it. That is the basic difference between ourselves and the Tories. We will actively engage in building that productive strength, building the strength of our country and unlike any other government in the European Community, the Tories turn away from that duty.Of course, when some of the more glib commentators consider our programme - the training, the investment incentives, transport policies - they say it is not exciting, it is not adventurous. Not adventurous! If passengers could be certain to travel on fast, clean trains, have a seat - there is a revelation - and arrive on time, that would be an odyssey of delight, not just an adventure. (Applause)Not adventurous, when a British breakthrough in science can find British finance, be developed and turned into production in British factories, using British design teams, creating jobs in Britain and exports for Britain. I think that is quite enthralling. Not adventurous, when a 27 year-old miner, whose livelihood has collapsed around him because of his redundancy, gets good training, a marketable skill, a job, wages, choices, the confidence of knowing that he can care properly for his family. That is a real adventure. (Applause)At the same time, a 35 year-old housewife, who stayed at home and brought up the children, back in the labour market but very unsure of her skills, gets decent training and becomes a qualified technician, with the income, status and opportunity that goes with it. That is a real-life adventure.It transforms people\u2019s lives and the result of all of the advances of this kind, multiplied across the nation, would make a well-equipped country, a country that welcomes the adventure of the future because the people have the skills, the industries have the investment, to face the challenges with confidence.Confidence, of course, is more than a matter of job opportunities, vital though they are. It is also a matter of security, and security comes in many forms and from many sources.People need the security of knowing, for instance, that the environment in which they live, the water they drink, the food they eat and the air they breathe, are all safe. In a complex modern society, in a contaminated world, that safety can only be achieved if governments are active and vigilant, if governments give the people the power to be active and vigilant and if governments and people work together to protect and to improve the global environment. It is for that reason that our environmental policies are centred on government accepting its obligations to protect and promote sustainable development and on citizens being given the right in law to ensure that those obligations are fully met.Confidence, security, is also a matter of knowing that if things go wrong and they do go wrong for people, it does not mean they plunge into poverty. That is why we will overturn the Tory policies which have spread poverty and dependency to 10 million people in Britain, including two and a half million children, one in five of Britain's children in poverty under this government. We are going to work to end child poverty. We will begin immediately by restoring the value of child benefit and we will, of course, also be combating child and family poverty by introducing the national minimum wage. (Applause)Confidence and security come from knowing that when people retire they will get a pension that permits them to enjoy life and not just to exist and we will be starting to make that advance by raising pensions by £8 and £5 and making other improvements. (Applause)Confidence and security come from knowing that you can rely on a high quality National Health Service, free when you need it, whoever you are, wherever you live. Confidence and security. (Applause) That security is cherished by the British people. That is why they regard the National Health Service to be their most precious public asset and it is the reason why in the Labour Party we are determined to support it, strengthen it and ensure that it thrives as a people's service.In stark contrast the Tories want to take the National Health Service to pieces, to hand it over to the market, to make it a creature of contracts and commerce. The difference between us could not be greater. Labour will modernise the National Health Service. The Tories privatise the National Health Service. That is the difference. (Applause)Of course they protest that they will not, but that means that they either do not understand or they will not admit to understanding the dynamic of the process that they have already started. Their hospital opt-outs will create, and are intended to create, a health service consisting of trading units. Their GP contract system will create and is intended to create, a market place of haggling doctors, \u2018buying and selling patients,\u2019 as the Chairman of the British Medical Association put it. In each case, the ability of private purchasers to buy advantage in a market system - because that is what a market system means - will mean increasing dependence by the NHS on the sale of treatment. That will happen whether patients are buying treatment as a matter of preference or whether they are buying it in desperation as free health care shrinks and the queues get longer. That is the way that the deck is stacked. You diminish the standard by under-funding. You further isolate it by introducing a market system and eventually people who have every faith in the health service and no intention of buying, are goaded by pain and anxiety into becoming customers instead of just being patients. (Applause)The process is called privatisation. There are some areas of the health service which a privatised system would not really want, of course. Long-term care of the elderly in hospital. The care of the psychiatrically ill and community care really have not got much of what could be called profitable potential. Accidents and emergencies -well, we have expert testimony there. The managers of the Royal Liverpool University Hospital Trust \u2018marketing plan\u2019 advise that \u2018emergency admissions are relatively unattractive from a commercial viewpoint.\u2019 Yes, that is the plan they put out. Who can want a health service to be run according to judgements like that, a commercial viewpoint? (Applause)The doctors, nurses and health workers, they do not want it. The patients and the public do not want it. None of those people, the people who provide the health service, the people who use the health service, they have not demanded the Tory changes. The only demand for these changes has come from a government determined to ram the market system into every corner, every nook and cranny, of national life and of public service and the British people do not want the market system rammed into every corner of the public services. (Applause)At the next election the British people will be deciding whether they keep the National Health. Service or whether they lose the National Health Service. Those who vote Labour will be voting to build up the NHS. Those who vote otherwise will be voting to break up the National Health Service. (Applause).Many people, including Conservatives, do not want that but they must be advised that is the true choice and measure their vote accordingly. When people vote Labour, they will be voting to stop the opt-outs, they will be voting to put an end to the cuts and closures. They will be voting for the practical policies of preventative medicine.When people vote Labour they will be voting for the introduction of a comprehensive system of care in the community, with the funds ring-fenced so that they all go directly to the elderly infirm and the chronically sick and disabled, being cared for in the community. In voting Labour the British people will also be voting to ensure that the full revenues from economic growth are used year on year to meet the needs of the whole nation and not to favour the few. That is Labour's policy and is the people\u2019s priority. We know and the nation knows that providing for the treatment of the sick, caring for the old and giving full opportunities to the young must come before any tax cuts. (Applause)That is the order of priorities of the British people, the sense of purpose of the British people, but it is an order of priorities and sense of purpose that the Tories have not shown and will never follow.The reductions that they have made in top-rate taxes since 1988 alone have already cost £10 billion. Now they are planning to cut another billion off inheritance tax. A country whose health service has to have raffles and fun runs to buy basic hospital equipment cannot afford giveaways like that to the best off in our country. (Applause)Comrades, all the time it is the people in the middle and the people at the bottom, who pay for the tax cuts for the very few at the top. That is why the tax burden in Britain, the tax burden on the whole country, the tax burden on the average family, is higher than it was in 1979, higher than it has ever been in peace time.The Tories have always had an open-ended tax system and the open end is spelt VAT. Whenever they have been under pressure they have hoisted VAT. They did it when they came to power, they did it earlier this year, when they plunged into the poll tax crisis and they would do it again if they ever got the chance. That is the Tory way, everybody pays higher tax. We believe that in a civilised society the best off minority must pay their fair share to meet the needs of the majority. That is not the politics of envy, that is the ethics of immunity, the ethics of society. (Applause)It is the course that we choose and the course that the British people want. In following that course we will not be spending what the country cannot afford. We will not borrow for consumption and we will not increase the tax contributions of the huge majority of the people. We think that people pay enough tax already and we also believe that a government that has to work within the limits pledged to the electorate must be a more efficient government. We will pay for better public services by growth and by ending Tory waste. We will pay for better public services by getting better value for public money.Value for money, that is what you get when you stop wasting £18 million of tax payers\u2019 money every day propping up the poll tax. (Applause)Value for money is what you get when you stop wasting £500 million paying accountants and administrators to privatise the National Health Service and not an extra bed to show for it. Value for money, that is what you get when you stop wasting £6 billion of taxpayers\u2019 money trying to bribe people out of the State Earnings-Related Pensions Scheme. Value for money, that is what you get when you build homes instead of paying huge bills for bed and breakfast in hostels for the homeless, week in week out, month in month out, year in year out. (Applause)Value for money is what you get when you start to collect the £5 billion in taxes lost every year because of evasion. That is what a value for money government will do. It is what a Labour government will do.Discharging the duties of government obviously goes beyond managing the money of the country, vital though that is. For democratic government, it extends to strengthening the democratic powers and rights of the people. We shall do that and we shall do it by decentralising the government and by empowering the people of Britain. We will introduce a freedom of information Act. (Applause)We will increase accountability by ensuring that everyone everywhere can vote in elections for part of their council every year. We are going to reform the House of Lords, improve the legal aid system, introduce devolution, first to Scotland and then progressively and with consent to Wales and to the regions of England. (Applause)We will enact our Charter of Rights, backed up by a complementary Bill of Rights. We are going to make these and other changes because our party and our people recognise and respond to the need for stronger safeguards for personal and civil rights and responsibilities in Britain.In making changes we are dealing in a practical and progressive way with the essential questions of how our country is ruled and whether the system of rule serves the changed and changing needs of the nation. These are the actions of a confident and liberating party. A party that believes that the duty of democratic government extends to enabling the people and to giving extra vitality to democracy.You proved that again in this conference last year when you voted to establish the working party on electoral systems. The decision was taken in recognition of the fact that this is a serious issue of debate, that it must be addressed with the fullest and widest public information and that it is about the basic questions of the quality and strength of representation and government and not about the tactical jostling of parties and politicians. That is what the issue is about. It is the right way to approach democratic change and that is how we will approach it in government.Comrades, change is most certainly needed. In these last 12 years the centralisation of government power has been intensified. There has been a continual effort to politicise the Civil Service and to subordinate government employees. Local democracy, whether run by Labour, Conservative or anybody else, has been seriously eroded. Political patronage has been used on a prodigious scale. Official secrecy has been increasingly used for the protection of government interest and not for the protection of the public interest. (Applause)In these last 12 years women, the majority of our country, have lost rights under the law, not been granted in any way at all an advance to real equality under the law. All that has happened and is happening in a modern country with deep democratic roots. It has not produced efficiency and competence in government. It has produced arrogance, incompetence, shiftiness, waste in government and it has proved that many civil and individual rights which we thought to be basic and unbreakable in Britain have, in reality, been fragile. We need to safeguard against that fragility. That is why in government we will make constitutional change to give new potency to democracy and to promote good government in our democracy. We will strengthen freedom here by adding to it and as we do that we must also nurture the freedom growing elsewhere by actively supporting it.The need to do that and the opportunity to do that increased beyond measure six weeks ago when the drunken conspirators in the Kremlin were defeated. The world became a different place and it changed for the better again last Friday, when President Bush announced his fresh initiative for disarmament on an unprecedented scale. Britain must be part of that progress. (Applause)We must be part of the new negotiations on verifiable disarmament and we should be doing everything possible now, straightaway, as a Labour government will, to bring in the other nuclear powers, to halt and reverse proliferation and to secure agreements to end testing of nuclear devices. (Applause)That is the active role that we should be taking in the world and we have got to be part of the efforts to ensure that progress is sustained in the Soviet Union too.The course of action that we must take is clear. I offer you this statement as a guide, \u2018I often hear the question, how can the West help us today? My reply is as paradoxical as the whole of my life has been. You can help us most if you help the Soviet Union on its irreversible but immensely complicated road to democracy.\u2019 They are the words of President Havel of Czechoslovakia speaking to the United States Congress last year. Nothing could be more articulate, nothing could be more persuasive about the need to give active support to the development of democracy and change in the Soviet Union and those words of a former victim of Soviet oppression, a great democrat, a man of unsurpassed humanity, Vaclav Havel. We must help to make that advance to democracy and economic security and we must help to ensure that it is stable and peaceful and since disarmament is central to economic progress in the Soviet Union our aid must be linked to that. As Oleg made clear on this platform on Monday, that is what the democrats of the Soviet Union and its Republics want us to do and we must not let them down.Our help will feed the roots of freedom and just as it will contribute to the economic and political security of the people of the Soviet Union and its former satellites, so it will be an investment in our own well­being. As the massive resources that have been dedicated to the Soviet military system are diverted to civil production, we in the West can increase our peace dividend. We must use it to build economic strength. We must use it as an industrial dividend, a production dividend, a jobs dividend, an investment dividend, so that any peace dividend that we get in our generation is an enduring source of wealth and not merely a short-term bonus that has to be used for paying redundancy and unemployment benefits. We can make it that source of continual wealth for expenditure on the social priorities and the development of our country, if we use that dividend properly for the purpose of investment to advance our economy.We certainly need that economic strength in Britain. We need it for Britain and we need it in order to help to combat poverty in a world in which a silent emergency of starvation is killing countless thousands of children and women and men every week. Nothing, not even the historic changes in Eastern Europe and the potential for famine and turmoil in the Soviet Union, nothing must be allowed to obscure the suffering of the countless destitute millions in Africa, Asia and Latin America. (Applause)To those who will not concern themselves with those tragedies, I simply say, if mercy does not move you then concern yourselves with the condition of humanity for your own sake. The misery of the poor today could, in this interdependent world, become your cataclysm tomorrow. Unless the free and affluent countries play their full part in the conquest of poverty, that poverty will eat away at prosperity, security, stability, even liberty itself. We are democratic socialists. In our own society we know that the rights of the individual depend upon the actions of the community. The actions to establish and maintain the political, economic and social freedom. The same is true of the world.Just as in our own society we know that opportunity for the individual depends upon the way that the community acts together, so we know that is true for the whole world and that is why we say, act together to combat poverty, for in doing so we add to the wealth of all. Act together to defeat ignorance, for in doing so we add to the knowledge of all. Act together to cure and prevent disease, for in doing so we promote the health of all. Act together to protect the environment, for in doing so we all become safer. Act together to stop war, for in doing so we all profit from peace. Act together as a world, one humanity. (Applause)Friends, in our country and for the sake of our country, it is time for a new direction, time for a government with a sense of real national purpose. As we approach the year 2000, we the British people have to decide how we are going to mark the end of the millennium and the beginning of a new age. Is it to be with nothing much more than a New Year\u2019s Eve party? Are we going to be able to greet the year 2000 as a fair and free society, a strong and productive economy, a confident and creative people? If that is the future that we want and it is, it must be prepared for with determination, vitality, vision. Only we will do that. Conservatives never will. The democratic socialism that we believe in is, above all, about enabling people to get the best out of life by putting the best into life. Its purpose is to ensure that people are prepared for the future, able to control their own destiny. Conservatism, especially British Toryism, is above all about letting the future look after itself, about letting people fend for themselves, whether they are able to or not.Now is the time for change from their way. Time to build Britain's industrial strength, time to make our National Health Service modern and secure, time to raise the standards of our skills and schools, time to create a cleaner, safer environment. It is time to start transforming Britain from the country it has become to the country we know it can be.It is time for that change. It is time for Labour. (Prolonged applause)You really are marvellous people, honestly. I tell you, in these last couple of weeks when the odd criticisms floated past my eyes, the people who have really communicated how they feel and what they want for the country have been the kind of people who are here, only many, many more. People in the Labour Party, people outside the Labour Party, ordinary people, who have said that we cannot go on like it has been and we need a lead to take us into the future and that has been the best form of encouragement that Glenys and I could ever have sought. Thank you for all of that.Now, I will tell you, this idea of extended ovation is something of a novelty in our party but singing is not. How about if we get up and sing a song which is not only a great hymn of progress but also, in our case, is a forecast of an absolute racing certainty. \u2018We shall overcome.\u2019 (Singing) (Prolonged applause)

aVComrades and friends, it is a great honour to have been elected Leader of the Labour Party and it is a proud occasion for me to address conference for the first time as your leader.Not all of you were present at the special conference in July, so let me thank you now for placing your trust in me. It is an immense responsibility as we begin a new era for Labour.At the outset let me make one thing clear: it is not my wish or my intention to lead for long a party of opposition. I was elected to lead a party of government and, with your help, that is what I will do. (Applause) I take over this mantle of leadership from Neil Kinnock. Neil had the vision to see what needed to be done to carry Labour forward, he had the courage to take on the task and he had the determination and skill to see it through. No one else could have achieved that. (Applause) Neil, the Labour movement owes you an incalculable debt of gratitude, and all of us owe the same debt of gratitude to Glenys, because if ever there was a complete partnership, this is it. We are all enriched by the warmth, the integrity, the personal effort and the dedication you have both shown over the past eight years. Neil and Glenys, we salute you today. (Applause)I want on this occasion to pay a tribute to everyone who worked so hard during the general election campaign - my colleagues in the shadow cabinet, fellow Members of Parliament, members of the NEC, the party's staff all round the country, Labour candidates - men and women of outstanding ability and dedication - party agents, volunteers young and old, and of course our colleagues who organised so skilfully in Trade Unions for Labour. People did not just work hard; they gave all they had to give, physically, mentally, emotionally. So please accept our thanks, as well as the thanks of the entire labour movement. We were defeated, but we have nothing to be ashamed of, because you are exceptional people and the labour movement has good reason to be proud of you.We fought a hard and honourable election campaign. We had a united and professionally organised party. There was a sense of energy and excitement, a sense of purpose which many had not experienced in the whole of their political lives, and we gained seats right across the country. Indeed, we were the only party to make gains, and we made many of them in spectacular style. So I am proud of the campaign we fought and I am particularly proud because we told the British people the truth. We told the truth about our policies and we told the truth about the condition of our country. The Tories did not, and all that has happened since 9 April has confirmed our worst fears and exposed their deceit.I do not believe that the return of a government, last April was in any way a positive endorsement by the British people, nor do I accept that it was a vote of confidence. There was no enthusiasm for this government, no admiration for their performance, no sense that, after 13 years, they had delivered the goods, fulfilled their promises or proved themselves worthy of the nation's trust. That vote on 9 April was a reluctant vote, and now, six months on, how many of those reluctant voters who gave John Major the benefit of the doubt are regretting their decision? (Applause)Two weeks ago, confronted with a sterling crisis of their own creation, we saw a government gripped by indecision, paralysed by fear, and a Prime Minister plodding on to disaster. John Major had only one policy - to wait and see, what happened. The result was total humiliation, not only for himself and his government but for Britain, the opt-out Prime Minister leading a do-nothing government off the European stage. So much for being at the heart of Europe.We were promised a New Statesman and what have we got instead? The Spectator. (Applause) The man who dreamt of toppling the Deutschmark carries the responsibility for the single most disastrous day in our post-war economic history. So our people are entitled to be angry. The cynical deceit of the Tory election campaign, the easy promise that all the economy needed was the reassurance of a Tory victory - all now exposed in the harsh light of the real world.But of course this was not just the work of weeks; it was the result of years of economic error compounded by mismanagement, and it has left the pound not top of the pile but as the one currency that no one wants to hold. The dole queues, poverty, repossessions, the collapse of industrial investment - a record which has sent our manufacturing industry to the breaker's yard. There is no escape for John Major, no alibi. As Chief Secretary, as Chancellor and as Prime Minister, he has designed and delivered the disaster. It is all his own work.In the debate in the House of Commons last week a Tory Member had the gall to ask me how much Labour\u2019s programme for economic recovery would cost; this from a party which in one day, Black Wednesday, in the course of its failed attempt to prop up the pound, cost this nation £1,000 million. Just think what could be done constructively with £1,000 million. How many houses could be built, how many schools could be repaired, how many hospital wards could be opened with £1,000 million? (Applause)The events of the past weeks have proved once and for all that the Tories have failed. What we have seen is the devaluation not just of a currency but of a Prime Minister and an entire government. Yesterday their humiliation was complete. After a week of Downing Street press briefings blaming the Germans for sinking the pound and after the shameless attribution of blame to the Bundesbank by Mr Major in the House of Commons, yesterday the Chancellor, Mr Lamont, travelled to Brussels and finally apologised at a meeting of Community Finance Ministers, while still trying to give the impression that it was all the fault of the press.It is surely bad enough that yet again this government\u2019s economic strategy is in total disarray, but what is really unusual this time: is that they cannot even work out who is to blame. If ever there was a time for apologies to be made, it is certainly now, and it is not just Norman Lamont who should be apologising; it is the Prime Minister. He should apologise to the. British people for his betrayal of their trust. (Applause)What started out on Black Wednesday as a tragi-comedy has degenerated into Whitehall farce. John Major and Norman Lamont - the Laurel and Hardy of British politics. Another fine mess they got us into! (Applause) And just look at that mess. In three days last week 3,000 jobs went at British Aerospace, 1,500 were lost at Ford and nearly 1,000 went at Rolls-Royce; and today we hear that the government is sacking 2,000 workers from its Defence Research Agency, with no thought at all of how such skills might be used elsewhere to strengthen our industrial future. With these crucial sectors in such deep decline, we have good reason to fear for our ability ever to repair the damage that this government has inflicted.Have you noticed the way Tory Ministers steer well clear of the management techniques they want to apply to everyone else? They keep saying that the idle and incompetent must be weeded out and they call for performance-related pay. If the Prime Minister is so keen on these ideas, why does he not apply them to the Cabinet? I think the trouble is that he would not know where to start. Should he start on the idle or concentrate on the incompetent? Would he be able to tell which is which? (Applause) Would there be any Ministers left? But if the Cabinet faced performance-related pay, they would be in real trouble. With the present crime wave, what, I wonder, would be the proper performance-related pay for the Home Secretary? With the current trade deficit, how much would the President of the Board of Trade deserve? Perhaps it is just as well he is not short of a bob or two himself. And with unemployment rising to three million, what could the Employment Secretary hope to get?But I suppose it is no surprise that Mr Major does not introduce such a principle. After all, he would have to apply the same rule to himself and his Chancellor. The fact is that if this government were on performance-related pay, the taxpayer would not be paying them; they would be paying the taxpayer. (Applause) So no wonder they will not practise what they preach.I want to announce this afternoon a new policy. It is a citizen\u2019s charter, designed, they usually say, to hold one particular group of service providers to account, forcing them to meet new standards of efficiency and giving customers rights of redress if they do not measure up. It is a citizen\u2019s charter for the Cabinet. Perhaps we should call it \u2018Majorwatch.\u2019 From now on I and my colleagues on the front bench will be checking their every move. In the days and months ahead we will expose all their broken, promises, all their empty commitments, so that the British people can hold them to account. (Applause)I made my first contribution to Majorwatch in the debate in the House of Commons last Thursday, and it gives you some idea of what we are up against. Before, the election the Prime Minister promised that the Forestry Commission would not be privatised. After the election it was a different story. The explanation given by Downing Street for this U-turn, for breaking a pre-election pledge, was: The commitment given by the. Prime Minister on this matter was drafted incorrectly during the frenzied activity of the general election campaign. So there we have it - the frenzied activity of the general election campaign offered as a justification for any reversal of policy, any shift in the government\u2019s position. So there is clearly no more devalued political currency than a Conservative election promise. (Applause)In the bleak aftermath of the early days after the election fashionable political commentators said that Labour was dead. They said that our vision of a fairer society had been conclusively rejected by the British people, and that the only future lay in abandoning our beliefs; even jettisoning our name. But they were wrong. Why? Let me tell you why. They were wrong not merely because the Tory dream has turned into a nightmare. They were wrong because they failed to understand the enduring values of our movement; they failed to, appreciate the underlying beliefs that inspire and guide us.When the Labour Party was born at the end of the last century it was born, out of the desire of working people .to challenge the power of private capital and the tyranny of the ruling elite. It was born out of the determination of ordinary citizens to play their full part in society, to claim for themselves the opportunities enjoyed by others, opportunities of-individual advancement and fulfilment that had previously been denied to them. The Labour Party was a vehicle for their individual aspirations; it was a force for social justice and for change.Our strength today lies in these same principles, in our belief that people should enjoy as a right of citizenship and not as a privilege of wealth the opportunity of a good education, the chance to find a decent job with decent pay, the opportunity to buy or rent a decent home, to have access to child-care and health care and security in their old age, to enjoy a clean environment, to walk the streets of their neighbourhood in safety and to have a real voice in the conduct of public affairs. And our strength lies in our knowledge that we are, each of us, members of one community, and it is our responsibility as citizens to work together for the good of that community as a whole, because we believe that the power of all of us together can advance the good of each individual.These are the principles that inspire us. They are the bedrock of our movement, and we know in our heart that our values, the values of individual opportunity and social justice, are also the values of the British people.This Conservative government has an idea about people that I must say I find totally objectionable. Fundamentally, they believe people are driven, purely by greed and self-interest. They believe all of us are motivated by a desire to accumulate wealth with no regard for others. They see us exclusively as consumers in a market place. Everything is up for grabs as long as you have the money. In this blinkered view of the world there is little room for community, little room for compassion, little room for helping others to share the benefits we enjoy. Their language is the language of self, of self-interest.But I have too much faith in the British people to accept that view. I do not believe that the British people lack a sense of compassion, a sense of decency, a sense of honour. I believe they do care about others and that they are concerned about their country\u2019s future, for people live in communities, not in isolation. I believe they want to be citizens of a country which shows care and responsibility for all its people and which does not pass by on the other side. (Applause) And for those who claim that Labour lets its heart rule its head, I say they could not be more wrong. In modern civilised societies, social justice and economic strength go hand in hand.It is a simple enough point and it is plain common sense: the more people there are out of work, the more people there are without homes, the more people there are in poverty, the heavier the burden on our economy. It costs the public exchequer £8,000 a year for every person who is unemployed and it costs £14,000 a year for every homeless family. And still the Tories say \u2018We cannot afford Labour\u2019s policies to revive our businesses and put our people back to work.\u2019 Tory policies are not only heartless, they are also mindless, and it is no wonder there is a great longing for a better way forward.Later this year, the Special Commission, on Social Justice, which I have proposed, will begin its work. More than a new policy initiative, the commission will be the first serious attempt since Beveridge to assess need and find new ways of dealing with our deep social problems. Income, wealth distribution; poverty, social welfare policy and taxation are all interlinked and have to be tackled together by us in a strategic and radical way.Ina recent interview Mr Major was asked about poverty in Britain. Do you know what he said? He said \u2018What poverty?\u2019 \u2018What poverty?\u2019 said the man who, as Minister for Social Security, invented the Social Fund. \u2018What poverty?\u2019 said the man who took housing benefit away from three million people. Well, Mr Major may not know what poverty is, but he certainly knows how to create it (Applause)After 13 years of Tory government people begin to think that the condition of our country is all part of some inevitable social decline, but it is not so. It is the legacy of this government and it is not inevitable. There is a better way.What is the role of government in modern society? We know what the Tories say about that. They want to leave everything to the market. Some of them are not even sure that society exists. For them it is more important to build a free market than a free society. They do not accept that governments have a responsibility to shape society, to offer opportunities and to provide for need. They believe governments should abdicate in favour of the market. But a society run only on the lines of a market is a society in which power is in the hands of the few who have economic strength, not the many who have democratic rights, and it is shaped to answer financial demand, not social need. It is a society that respects purchasing power, not individual rights.In a revealing phrase Mr Major said he wanted to see what he called the \u2018privatisation of choice\u2019: note, not the extension of choice, not the improving of choice, but the privatisation of choice. Now what does that mean? Let me put it another way: if you want choice, you pay, or the other way round, no pay, no choice. (Applause) Not a classless society but a heartless society, ruled by a government devoid of any sense of responsibility for its people.Mr Major\u2019s first comment as he finally emerged blinking from the air-raid shelter last week was to protest that it was not his fault. It was the markets that were irrational That is a case of the pot calling the kettle grey. (Applause) And has it not occurred to him that it might just be a mistake to let these same markets, these irrational markets, determine all aspects of our national life?For the past 13 years people have been obliged to live their lives at the mercy of this irrational force called the market. But we know to our cost that this approach has failed. The market must serve our needs, not we the needs of the market; and if the market system becomes an agent of speculation and stagnation instead of an engine for prosperity, then it is time for governments to act. For governments are not impotent. They have power at their disposal to shape events, to bring about change, to improve the lives of the people whose trust, after all, they carry. That is why it is so unacceptable, so unbearable to see the injustice in our country, the waste of human talent, the lack of hope, the loss of pride, because it is not inevitable.We in Labour stand for active government - active government not absence of government; government taking responsibility, not pointing the finger at someone else; government caring about all the people, not just looking after its own; government acting to help industry, to create jobs, to boost the housing market, not sitting on its hands waiting for those green shoots to sprout. An active government is what Britain needs today, and it needs it urgently if we are ever to lift ourselves out of this downward spiral of decline.I believe our people want government to take responsibility for the things that they as individuals just cannot provide - safe streets, an efficient transport system, a high standard of education, good health care, training for jobs, a strong economy  - for without these things people are not free, nor do they have real choices.Of course government should not run people\u2019s lives for them, but it can help them live their own lives to the full; and government need not run companies or small businesses, but it must create the conditions for them to prosper. Good government, active government, lies at the very heart of a fair, prosperous and free society.It is not difficult to see where action needs to be taken in Britain in 1992. We need action to get the economy moving again, with measures to stimulate investment, create jobs and boost the housing market. We need action for, families, action to build new homes, homes for rent as well as for sale, homes that people can afford, homes built to modern standards of energy efficiency, homes that get families out of the costly misery of bed and breakfast and get our building industry working once again. (Applause)We need action for young people, to give them the skills to do the jobs to win success, both for themselves and for Britain. A government that leaves training to the vagaries of the private sector puts school-leavers and workers at the mercy of people whose priority is profit and whose interests are short term. It is the responsibility of government to invest in the future of our workforce.We need action to stop the turmoil in our schools. For far too long they have been used as an ideological battleground by the Tories. Children, teachers and parents have been pushed this way and that by one failed reform after another, and we must restore stability and confidence to our classrooms. (Applause) We need action on the environment. Active government means standing up for the quality of people\u2019s lives, and in our society that requires tougher regulations on waste disposal, making the polluters pay for the harm they inflict, and high standards of water and air quality.It is the job of active government to make sure that the strategic assets of our country are preserved. One of Britain\u2019s most important resources is our immense coal reserves. It was ready access to coal that put Britain at the front of the industrial revolution and it is the plentiful remaining reserves that give us an edge over most of our European competitors. Yet Britain\u2019s present government is proposing to abandon half of all the pits that remain. That is vandalism. (Applause) It is vandalism because it will destroy whole communities built around their role of providing the nation with coal. But it is also vandalism because it will destroy a national asset which could meet Britain\u2019s long-term energy needs.But we now have in this country a government so beholden to the vested interests it has created - the private water monopolies, the private energy monopolies, the, deregulated transport concerns - that they are too weak to set and enforce the standards that the people want. That is why we are calling for an environmental protection agency to tell the people the truth about the water they drink, the food they eat and the air they breathe.An active government means providing efficient and caring public services. That is why we are committed to a National Health Service that is free at the time you need it. (Applause) We will never abandon that principle, because it is the only way to ensure that all patients get the treatment they need, not the treatment they can afford; and it is the only way to ensure, that the people who work in the Health Service can concentrate on providing the treatment that gives the best results, not the treatment that gets the biggest commercial return.People of pension age make up almost half of all National Health Service patients. They are the generation who created the National Health Service and who paid for it all through their working lives. Surely it is the job of government to make sure that the National Health. Service can now serve them and any member of our society who needs the support of a modern health service.Active government means strengthening the rights of people at work. Labour believes we need to establish a framework of rights for employees as part of a fair system of industrial relations. We also believe that the rights pf workers are best advanced through the work of free and active trade unions, with whom we in our party are proud to be linked. (Applause)I have long been committed to a minimum wage which gives people a fair reward for their labour, for low pay leads to low aspirations, low standards and low productivity. We want Britain to be able to stand alongside her European partners and say: \u2018We are proud of our workforce and we treat them with the respect and dignity they deserve.\u2019It is the role of active government to ensure that everyone can contribute to our country\u2019s public life, not just half the population. We need women to participate fully in all fields of work if we are ever to respond successfully to our country's needs. I have to say that this is as true in politics as in any other field. But if we are to change attitudes, we must have women in place to change them; and if we are to have women in place, we must make it possible for them to be there. Child care provision, flexible working hours, job-sharing, are practical and necessary measures for women - and for men too - who should not have to choose between family life and outside employment.We believe that active government must also mean democratic government, with people having a real say in their community's affairs, having more, not less, control over the decisions that affect their lives. That is why we want to strengthen local democracy and decentralise power. That is why we need a Scottish Parliament, a Welsh Assembly and devolution of power to the regions of England. (Applause)We need a Freedom of Information Act to break down the barriers of secrecy that surround government institutions. Knowledge is power. We want to share that power with the people and we should start by sharing knowledge with them.We need to push back the barriers of prejudice that restrict the choice and waste the talents of so many in our society. It is not enough to make discrimination illegal. An active government must positively promote opportunities for all our citizens in every aspect of public life.I look around Britain today and I see millions of families who, instead of feeling that they are moving forwards, are struggling to stay in the same place, struggling to make the household budget balance, struggling to keep a job, run a business or keep a roof over their head, struggling to make sure their children get a decent education and a solid start to their working lives.The British people deserve better than this. We are a nation rich in talent and in skills, men and women who are eager to work hard and to succeed, men and women who want to play their full part in the life of our nation, and young people full of energy and aspirations. All these people ask is the opportunity to prove their worth; and it is up to government to unlock the extraordinary potential of our ordinary people. For the people of Britain deserve good government, and for that they need active government, a government that will stand up for them, a government that will meet its responsibilities so that they in turn can meet theirs.But of course the responsibility of active government extends far beyond our national boundaries. Earlier I spoke about our duty as citizens to work together for the good of the whole community, in the knowledge that the power of all can advance the good of each. That basic tenet of democratic socialism applies not just to us as individuals but equally to Britain as a country on the world stage. I have always believed that Britain's future lies in Europe and that we must take a confident and leading role in the European Community. That has been my firm conviction throughout my political life, and the events of the last few weeks have done nothing but reinforce it.But we cannot expect to influence either the major political and economic events of our own continent or the direction of global affairs if Britain is pushed to the periphery and relegated to the second division of Europe. We are not advocates of a European super state, we never have been, but we are determined to play our part, working closely with our sister socialist parties, in maintaining the momentum for closer co-operation, to build a stronger European community, to extend social justice, to preserve the environment and to deepen our democracy. That is why we are advocates for change and progress in the European Community.For Europe cannot stand still. We can either move forward or retreat into isolationism. On 1 January the single market will begin. Europe will be a community for business, but still not a community for people, and that is something we in the Labour Party cannot accept. It is why we have strongly supported the Social Chapter, which provides the framework for a social dimension in Europe. It is also why we believe the Community must take joint action on the real economy at the heart of its economic policy, making growth and jobs the benchmark of success.We demand that the Community strengthen its democracy. Too many of its institutions are too remote and not accountable enough to the people they represent. The principle of subsidiarity - making decisions at the closest practicable level to the people - must be given real force. We have argued for a more open and effective Council of Ministers, closer scrutiny of the work of the Commission and more power to the European Parliament.Mr Major, struggling to patch together his crumbling European policy and his stumbling EC Presidency, will no doubt talk a lot about subsidiarity and the democratic deficit over the next few weeks and months. I for one will only believe Mr Major\u2019s new commitment to subsidiarity when he puts it into practice at home. That which he recommends for Europe should also be applied at home in. Britain. (Applause) If it is good for Europe, why is it not good enough for Britain?But of course our commitment .to Europe should strengthen, not weaken, ours obligations to a wider world. Right at the heart of our policies should be strong and consistent support for the United Nations. I have always believed that that is the best means of principled and collective international action. I want to see the powers of the UN strengthened and I want to see it broaden its agenda to tackle the economic and social issues which call out for a global approach just as desperately as do the environment, poverty and peace­keeping.The new challenges to international stability come from poverty in the Third World, worldwide environmental decline and regional conflicts and unrest. In the former Yugoslavia we see the tragic consequences in terms of human suffering of ethnic intolerance and civil war. Labour not only supports the UN\u2019s peace-keeping role; we argue strongly for the strengthening of the mandatory sanctions and an increase in humanitarian aid.At a time when the hearts of our people have been moved by the suffering in Somalia and elsewhere in Africa, what does our government do? It threatens a massive reduction in Britain's already shamefully low budget for overseas aid. To seek to inflict the results: of their economic incompetence upon millions of people living in poverty in the developing world is not just callous, it is morally repugnant. (Applause)Labour knows that we cannot afford to allow the downward spiral of poverty, debt, protectionism and instability to continue. As a world community, we simply cannot afford it. So we must .work to make Britain a strong and confident country again, so that she can play her rightful part in shaping the world of, the future, a strong and confident country within Europe, within the United Nations, within the Commonwealth. Everywhere where Britain has influence we must strive unceasingly for co-operation and for new and imaginative solutions to our problems.We live in a time of great pessimism, not just in our own country but throughout the world. As the fear of nuclear annihilation recedes, it is not being replaced by optimism but by new fears, fears of environmental catastrophe, of economic disintegration, of racism and fascism, of new ethnic and religious tensions, and the fear that we do not have the means or the will to deal with what lies ahead. People want answers, but they feel there are none. They want action, but they see none.More than anything else today Britain needs leadership, leadership to take the long view of problems and to act to solve them, to anticipate future tensions and to act to avoid them, to restore hope; leadership to make people feel their voice is being heard, their needs no longer being ignored.Labour is going to provide that leadership. In the years that remain of this discredited government Labour will be a fighting opposition. We will relentlessly challenge every attempt by this government to inflict further damage on the fabric of our society or to limit the chances of our people. But at the same time, in every week of every month, we will be working and preparing for government. For there is a void at the heart of our public life in Britain, a vacuum left by 13 years of Conservative rule. It is up to Labour now, to all of us working together, to fill that void, to fill it with a new programme that responds to the real needs of our communities, with leadership that speaks for the real interests of our people and with a vision that will restore hope and create confidence in our country\u2019s great future. (Sustained applause)

aVMadam President, as I walked through the Winter Gardens during Conference Week, I passed the bookstalls and what do I see, I see memoirs - memoirs to the left of me, memoirs to the right of me, memoirs in front of me, volley, volley and thunder. Madam President, let me say right away I\u2019m not about to write my memoirs, not for a long time.There\u2019s a job to be done, a job of service to this nation, and I believe in service. There\u2019s a job to be done, a job I was elected to do and I propose to go on doing it. Madam President, there\u2019s one aspect of the memoirs that I may write in future that you needn\u2019t wait for. I can tell you now, straight away, precisely what I think of my Cabinet.Do you think any of them look worried? Apprehensive? Touch concerned? They needn\u2019t be, they\u2019re a first-class team, they\u2019re steady under fire, they\u2019re united and they\u2019re serving Britain superbly.  And isn\u2019t it good to see Michael back?  Did you see those exercises? I dare say they\u2019re going to enliven quite a few Cabinet meetings in the futureMadam President, I\u2019ve been coming to this conference on and off for about 30 years. It\u2019s a very great event in the political calendar, but it\u2019s something else as well. It\u2019s a family gathering and like all families, from time to time, we have our squabbles. So, today, before I turn to other matters, I want to say something to you, specifically as leader of the Conservative Party. Our party has served our country in Government more often and better than any other democratic political party in the world. We\u2019ve done so because we\u2019re the broadest based political party this country has ever seen. Our support comes from all classes, all income groups and all parts of the United Kingdom. Madam President, I know our party. It can bear many things - unpopularity, deep controversy, setbacks; we\u2019ve seen it all before, but there\u2019s one thing that demoralises our workers and that breaks apart our support in the country and that is disunity.We\u2019ve always known where it leads and so, in this private gathering we have today, we might as well state it plainly. Disunity leads to opposition. Not just opposition in Westminster, but in the European Parliament and in town halls and county halls up and down this country. Of course we won\u2019t agree on every single aspect of policy. No one expects that. We\u2019re a democratic party with a whole range of lively ideas. But I think you\u2019ll agree with me upon this - people look to us for common sense and for competence and we have a responsibility to you and to the people who put us in Parliament to show those qualities day after day. And that means we have to have our agreements in public and our disagreements in private.And if agreement is impossible, and sometimes on great issues it is difficult, if not impossible, then I believe I have the right, as leader of this party, to hear of that disagreement in private and not on television, in interviews, outside the House of Commons.Madam President, the last year has shown how hard every part of our party can fight for what it believes in. Let the next year show that we can channel all that energy together in a common effort against our opponents and for the policies we care about.This week, an unusual week, this week we had two conferences for the price of one. First, there\u2019s the one we\u2019ve been at. And then there\u2019s the one we read about.You know, I\u2019m not absolutely sure that everyone\u2019s caught up completely with the current mood of our party, so I\u2019m going to ask you three questions and I want to hear the answers loud and clear so that no one can doubt where you stand. They\u2019re very simple questions and very straightforward.Aren\u2019t you fed up with people running our country down?Aren\u2019t you fed up with people writing our party off?When people ask, Will the Conservatives win next time?\u2019 what do you say?I didn\u2019t quite catch that.Yes. Yes. And yes again. And you don\u2019t need shorthand to get that down.You see, Madam President, this is a family gathering, just as I said. But now I want to reach out a little further to speak not just to you, but to those outside this hall who may be listening. I want to share some thoughts with you and see if they strike a chord with your own experience. I think that many people, particularly those of you who are older, see things around you in the streets and on your television screens which are profoundly disturbing. We live in a world that sometimes seems to be changing too fast for comfort. Old certainties crumbling. Traditional values falling away. People are bewildered. Week after week, month after month, they see a tax on the very pillars of our society - the Church, the law, even the Monarchy, as if 41 years of dedicated service was not enough. And people ask, where\u2019s it going? Why has it happened? And above all, how can we stop it?Let me tell you what I believe. For two generations, too many people have been belittling the things that made this country. We\u2019ve allowed things to happen that we should never have tolerated. We have listened too often and too long to people whose ideas are light years away from common sense.In housing, in the \u201950s and \u201960s, we pulled down the terraces, destroyed whole communities and replaced them with tower blocks and we built walkways that have become rat runs for muggers. That was the fashionable opinion, fashionable but wrong. In our schools we did away with traditional subjects - grammar, spelling, tables and also with the old ways of teaching them. Fashionable, but wrong. Some said the family was out of date, far better rely on the council and social workers than family and friends. I passionately believe that was wrong. Others told us that every criminal needed treatment, not punishment Criminal behaviour was society\u2019s fault, not the individual\u2019s. Fashionable, but wrong, wrong, wrong.Madam President, on all these things, received opinion, with the wisdom of hindsight, received opinion was wrong. And now, we must have the courage to stand up and say so and I believe that millions and millions of people are longing to hear it.Do you know, the truth is, much as things have changed on the surface, underneath we\u2019re still the same people. The old values - neighbourliness, decency, courtesy - they\u2019re still alive, they\u2019re still the best of Britain. They haven\u2019t changed, and yet somehow people feel embarrassed by them. Madam President, we shouldn\u2019t be. It is time to return to those old core values, time to get back to basics, to self-discipline and respect for the law, to consideration for others, to accepting responsibility for yourself and your family and not shuffling off on other people and the state.Madam President, I believe that what this country needs is not less Conservatism, it\u2019s more Conservatism of the traditional kind that made us join this party.This week, this week we\u2019ve made a start. Now we must see it through. It\u2019s time for this party to return to its roots. Madam President, our economic roots are clear. We\u2019re the party of Adam Smiths, not John Smith.And Adam Smith was the apostle of free markets and that is why we regard the present world trade talks as so important. At meeting after meeting, we have battled to keep those trade talks alive against difficulty after difficulty, because nothing will do more for growth, nothing will do more for jobs, nothing will do more for confidence in our future, than agreement in those trade talks. But if other governments don\u2019t play their part, if they hold back, if they won\u2019t face up to their domestic difficulties, then those talks could collapse and the dangers of that happening are devastating. They could unlock protectionism, poverty and unemployment on a scale that we have not seen since the 1930s. A great deal is at stake. And because a great deal is at stake, I don\u2019t believe we ought to be mealy-mouthed about the dangers. Today, on this issue, is not a time for holding back. So let me say to some of our European colleagues, \u2018You\u2019re playing with fires.\u2019 Or, to put it more bluntly, \u2018Get your tractors off our lawn.\u2019People accuse us of being the business party. Well, you bet we are. We\u2019re for small business and we\u2019re for large business. We\u2019re for more business, not less business. When business booms, Britain booms, so we\u2019re for private enterprise and we\u2019re proud of it.Over the last three years, the whole country has sweated and slogged and suffered to turn this economy around. Now, steadily, it\u2019s happening. Recovery is underway. That\u2019s the message from British business. The economy\u2019s growing. You may not see it yet, but it clearly is growing and it will show. And as the economy grows, the family budget will follow, so people have every reason to begin to start feeling better again. Inflation\u2019s down. Interest rates are down. Exports are up. Productivity\u2019s up. Retail sales are up. Manufacturing output is up. And the number of people in work is up. Madam President, it\u2019s the opportunity cocktail we\u2019ve been wanting for years and it gives this country a head start on prosperity for the rest of this decade.So, let\u2019s try and build up that confidence, instead of forever seeing it knocked down. Why don\u2019t we try something different? Why don\u2019t we tell people about Britain\u2019s successes? And let me tell you about them, in the strictest confidence, so they\u2019re sure to leak out.Who says we can\u2019t make things in this country? Manufacturing industry is one of our great national assets.Three weeks ago - sometimes it seems longer - three weeks ago, I was in Japan, the industrial wonder of the world, and there with me were British manufacturers, selling solutions to problems that Japan hadn\u2019t solved. Successful British firms, international leaders in their own fields, firms at the leading edge of technology, selling successfully to the world technology leader. Two days later, I was in Malaysia and we came back with £1 billion worth of orders for British companies. They didn\u2019t buy British to do our companies a favour. They did it because we made what they wanted and we made it better in this country than anyone else in the world.Fourteen years ago, Britain was going nowhere. Now it\u2019s going everywhere and selling everywhere. We\u2019re making goods, making profits, making waves, right across the world. But despite that, despite the growth we\u2019ve had there and the growth to come there, I must warn you, it\u2019s still going to be tough, and everyone in business here today, or everyone who listens to what I say today, knows how hard they have to compete.At present, Europe, our biggest market, is stuck deep in recession. It\u2019s held back by social costs it can\u2019t afford. It\u2019s losing markets to Japan and to America and to the Pacific Basin. And that, Madam President, that, amongst other reasons, is why I refuse to accept the Social Chapter. It\u2019s not a chapter of rights, it\u2019s a charter for unemployment and we don\u2019t want it here.What we do want is more of our best brains going into manufacturing industry. Let\u2019s see them give politics, the City, journalism a miss and go into manufacturing industry where their skills can be so badly needed.And let\u2019s see our great manufacturing centres humming with activity as we move towards the millennium. Let\u2019s turn British inventions into British industries, British factories and British jobs. Let them make pounds for us, not dollars, marks, and yen for other people. Ministers are told, whenever they go abroad, part of your job these days is to open the door for British business. We\u2019re backing exports with cheaper credit, more Government muscle and a new breed of diplomat - people who know as much about exports as they do about etiquette.At home, at home we\u2019re taking the ridiculous burden of red tape off business and off citizen alike. And I can tell you, in the next session of Parliament, there will be a big deregulation bill to show how seriously we take that.Here\u2019s a good old British maxim you can all remember: if the price is right and the goods are good enough, then sell abroad and buy at home. That\u2019s the way to make sure that British industry continues to boom.But there are other things we need to do for industry. Industry isn\u2019t asking us for handouts and special help. It\u2019s asking us, as the Government, to play our part in creating the right economic environment for industry, to let loose its own energies and compete on a level basis with the rest of the world. So here, Madam President, is another ambitious target for our country: not months but years and years and years of sustained growth without the curse of inflation. That is at the heart of our economic policy for the \u201990s. It\u2019s a prize for which British Governments have struggled for 30 odd years, and yet now it\u2019s within reach and we are not going to throw it away.Just remember, only three years ago, inflation was over 10%. Now it\u2019s under 2% and it must be kept low. Inflation is in check but it\u2019s never in checkmate. Back in the \u201970s, soaring prices destroyed savings. We all remember that. We all want to make sure it never happens again. But to do that, to make sure it never happens again and destroys businesses and livelihoods and savings, sometimes we may have to hold back our ambitions for tax and spending.Madam President, let me get one thing entirely clear. Our views on tax are different from those of the other parties. What the Conservative Party is aiming for is a Government that lives within its income and without your income. Other parties tax because they want to. We tax only because we have to. So, come rain or shine, taxes will always be lower under us than any other kind of government.But success has another vital ingredient: getting public finances back under control. At the moment, largely because of the recession with the great collapse in income that that created, we have a huge gap between what Britain spends and the tax we take in. We have to narrow that gap. It is true Government has spent more over the last two years. We had to; to help the weak and protect the vulnerable through the recession. And that, Madam President, is an important part of Conservatism as well.But now Britain\u2019s recovering, so we have to cut the deficit. We all agree on that, but it\u2019s no good agreeing on the principle unless you take the action, and it\u2019s no use people urging us to take the action unless they are prepared to back us when we have taken it, for it may often be difficult.There are tough choices ahead and we must make them, and we will make them because it is in the interest of our country to make them and we have that responsibility.Of course, people\u2019s opinions will differ. Some say tax more, some say tax less, some say spend more, some say spend less but stay out of my backyard. All that\u2019s perfectly okay for the Opposition, but it won\u2019t do for the Government party. We can\u2019t have a lobby against every difficult decision. Decisions are what government is for and we have to take them.So, once the debate is over, once Ken Clarke has announced our budget proposals, we Conservatives must work together and take that message to every single part of the country. But there is one thing I can tell you that you can take with it: high income tax is no part of this party\u2019s programme.It never has been and, as far as I\u2019m concerned, it never will be.Madam President, high on every Conservative list is raising standards in our schools. That\u2019s why John Patten\u2019s first concern is with what parents think and what our children need. There are tens of thousands of excellent teachers up and down the country and I\u2019m proud to pay tribute to all they do on behalf of our children. But there is bad teaching as well and many parents and many pupils know that only too well. Our children must be taught what they need to know. That\u2019s why we need a national curriculum. It\u2019s why we need national testing. Not just for the sake of it, but to find out what our children have learnt and what they have failed to learn. And when we know what they\u2019ve failed to learn, we can put it right. But without this testing, we fail those children because we never learn what they haven\u2019t understood at an early stage in their school career.The principle of tests is not negotiable. We don\u2019t need reams and reams of complex papers that take hours for teachers to handle. What we do need is those simple pencil and paper tests that this party has always asked for, and that is what John Patten is going to deliver for us. Because unless we teach a child to read, to write and to add up, then we hobble that child for the rest of his life.Take John Prescott. For the audience at Brighton last week, his speech was a religious experience, mainly because it passes all understanding.But push him to one side. I saw a letter recently from over 500 university teachers of English. And they say in their letter that it\u2019s disastrous and harmful to teach standard English, great literature and Shakespeare in our schools. Apparently, teaching Shakespeare threatens to reduce a living language to a dead one. They say, and believe it or not this is a quote, they say, \u2018It would do serious damage to the moral and social development of our children and to the cultural life of society as a whole, and all who are concerned with such matters should oppose in the strongest possible terms.\u2019What claptrap.Well, I\u2019ll answer them in words perhaps they might approve of. Me and my party ain\u2019t gonna take what them on the Left says is okay, right.Madam President, over the past few months, in meetings with party workers, many of them I think will be here today. I\u2019ve made it clear in private that the attack on crime would be the centrepiece of next year\u2019s legislation. On Wednesday, after one of the best conference debates I have ever heard, Michael Howard delivered the first instalment. Lord Archer, if I may call him that, made it clear how much we\u2019ll have the support of the whole country in that programme. But don\u2019t let\u2019s pretend that we\u2019ve been idle over the last 14 years; we haven\u2019t. We\u2019ve increased sentences, built more prisons, spent more, recruited more police, and those police have served us magnificently. And no other party would have done as much.But we know now, it was not enough. In many parts of the country, crime figures have risen remorselessly. Crimes once confined to the cities have spread out into the rural areas, bringing alarm where alarm was never before. And that is the reason for our new approach. We have tried being understanding. We have tried persuasion. Madam President, it hasn\u2019t worked.I know criminals are a problem in a cell but they\u2019re much more of a problem on the street. And policy must be dictated by the needs of justice, not by the number of prison places we happen to have available on any given day. If someone belongs in prison, then that is where they should be and that\u2019s why we\u2019re building more prisons. Better the guilty behind bars than the innocent penned in at home.Let me tell you how I see things. We need tougher rules on bail, and no bail for the worst offenders. An end to the right to silence, as Michael Howard announced earlier this week. And more information for the police from DNA testing. We\u2019re going to use science to help catch the criminal and not let silence protect the criminal. Here, too, it\u2019s back to basics. For some, punishment seems to be a dirty word. Well, you\u2019ll find it in my dictionary and I strongly suspect that it\u2019s in yours.Some time ago, I said we should condemn a little more and understand a little less. And I meant that for this reason: if we let young people at an early age think crime is a normal part of growing up, if we let them off with a caution, a caution and a caution, it is small wonder if they feel there is no peer pressure turning them to law and order, and they turn to bigger crime later. And if we extend those parameters of leniency so far, we betray our children, for we do not give them the values that we expect them to live up to when they become an adult part of our society.There\u2019s one other issue in the range of measures that Michael announced in his remarkable speech the other day that didn\u2019t find room for it, for there was, even for the Home Secretary, a limited amount of time at this conference. But it\u2019s an issue upon which I feel very strongly, and I can tell you today that we plan a big crackdown on the loathsome trade in pornography that offends so many people in this country.There will be new powers of arrest and search, new powers to seize videos and other material, and something I personally particularly support - a new offence to make the possession of child pornography a crime that can lead to imprisonment. Yes, Madam President, it\u2019s tough. And so it should be. There\u2019s no place in a civilised society for that sort of exploitation of our children.But don\u2019t let us delude ourselves. Fighting crime is not just a matter for the police or for the Government. We can legislate, we can provide the resources. We can do all that and the police can perform miracles on the resources they have. But Governments can\u2019t make people good. That is for parents, for churches, for schools, for every single citizen.Like many people in this hall today, as a boy I knew people who had nothing, who expected nothing. They didn\u2019t commit crime because they did have something. They had values, dignity, pride, respect for their neighbours and, above all, respect of the old. And in the long-term battle against crime, that respect needs building every bit as much as Michael Howard\u2019s new prisons.Madam President, let me make it clear beyond a doubt. I simply do not accept that crime can be excused, and under this Government, I give you my word, it never will be.Madam President, from the serious to the less serious: our opponents. Our opponents can\u2019t string two policies together, but they can cook up a scare. And of course there\u2019s always a ready market for scares. Every day I\u2019m told what I think that I don\u2019t think, what I\u2019ve done that I haven\u2019t done, what I\u2019m planning that I\u2019m not planning. Hearing the news day after day is a voyage of discovery for me.Voyage of discovery for me, but very unsettling for many others, many of them elderly, more of them not very rich, and most of them very worried., So, let me offer some reassurance - not rumour, fact. Next time Labour and the Liberals say we\u2019re going to charge for visits to the doctor, you can tell them confidently, No, we\u2019re not. Next time they say we\u2019re going to charge for stays in hospital, tell them, No, we\u2019re not. And when they say we\u2019re going to introduce prescription charges for pensioners, you get right out on the doorsteps and tell them, No, we\u2019re not.They say we\u2019re going to force older people to go to the bank, not the post office, to collect their pensions. Well, really. I have 500 square miles of Huntingdonshire in my constituency and heaven knows how many rural post offices. I know their value to local village life, I know their value to the community. I know how much pensioners rely on them and that\u2019s why I promise you they\u2019ll be able to go on picking up their pensions at the post office.So go out and knock all that nonsense on the head. And yes, I know the concerns - nobody could possibly have missed them - the concerns that people have about their fuel bills. They believe they\u2019re going to face massive rises. They aren\u2019t. And the most vulnerable fear they\u2019re going to be left without compensation. They aren\u2019t. Kenneth Clarke made that clear yesterday and I\u2019m happy to repeat it today.This nation owes a huge debt to its pensioners. It\u2019s something this Conservative Party will never forget. So, it\u2019s our duty to keep our country a place in which they feel both safe and secure. So when you hear people saying this, that or the other, don\u2019t always swallow it wholesale. Remember, in the immortal words of Sporting Life in Porgy & Bess, \u2018It ain\u2019t necessarily so.\u2019Madam President, scares take me naturally to the Labour Party. I\u2019m not going to be savage about Labour. I think the people of this country would welcome an end to badmouthing between politicians. So, as a man damned every Sunday for his moderation, I think I shall stick to my own civil instincts. But that doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t have a bit of fun.Did you hear John Smith\u2019s speech last week? He\u2019s a good man, is John, but Lord doesn\u2019t he go on about it? He rather reminds me of a Scottish Buddha, the very essence of immobility with a faint smile of perfect self-contentment upon his face. And the Buddha has watched his Shadow Chancellor, Gordon Brown, Labour\u2019s gift to melancholia, he\u2019s watched him run from not sure about taxes, to no more taxes, to lots and lots more taxes in just six weeks, and there\u2019s a long time before the next election. And the Buddha said nothing. The Buddha has let his Northern Ireland spokesman plan a united Ireland and the Buddha said nothing. The Buddha has let his education spokesman say, Stop tests, cover up school results and scrap A Levels, and what did he say? The Buddha said nothing. One hears that the only sign the Buddha ever gives is a slight shake of the head, if anyone proposes a new idea.Madam President, we saw something rather remarkable in Brighton last week. They called it a famous victory. Famous victory? I would call it John Smith\u2019s political Munich. Here it is, composite - I beg his pardon - composite 55 and 56. Let me read you the victory roll: the trade unions will now only make 70% of policy and choose one third of the leader. Which one third is unclear? Perhaps they don\u2019t think it matters. After all, they\u2019ve long had the bit above the neck. What we have out of last week is a minor reduction in union influence in the Labour Party and the promise of a huge increase in union power in Britain, if there were a Labour Government.One small step for the Buddha, one giant step leap for the brudders.Whatever the trade unions ask for, they got. And what they asked for was unconditional surrender. Remember what Mr Smith said: The country needs strong unions today, as never before. Madam President, after all we fought for over the last 14 years, I think this conference would beg to differ with that judgment.Madam President, there\u2019s another strange party in British politics. It gives a different answer to the same question in Cornwall or London, in Ryedale or Eastbourne, on Monday or Tuesday. They\u2019re against VAT on fuel in the morning, and for a carbon tax in the afternoon. But they are consistent about two things: the first of them is tax. They are the other high tax party - income tax, local income tax, carbon tax, regional tax, Scottish tax, Welsh tax and, given half a chance, Euro tax as well. If they thought it would raise money, they\u2019d produce revenue from syntax and tin tacks.And the second thing they\u2019re consistent about is federalism. Centralism in Europe. The Liberal Party is a federal party. Don\u2019t take my word for it, this is their conference agenda. The autumn, it says, the autumn conference of the federal party - that is the Liberals in their own words. And look what they called for in this conference for a federal Europe - turn to page 99, though I would not recommend to you pages 1 to 98... This is what they called for on page 99. They called for sensible application of the social protocol and they had an amendment: \u2018delete sensible\u2019 was the amendment.I agree. Sensible stands out like a sore thumb in every Liberal conference. But their leaders are fanatics for federalism. They have been out of government for so long, they have forgotten how to take decisions. The only decision they can take is that they want someone else to take the decisions for us in this country. Next June, we will have European elections in Britain. Let me say to all our candidates who are present, and everyone here who will work in that campaign, that will be a national campaign. We are going to fight those elections on a clear and distinct British Conservative manifesto for the future of Europe.Madam President, I have risked and sacrificed more than most for what I passionately believe in: a strong Britain playing a leading role in a strong and growing Europe, a wider Europe, a free trade Europe, a less intrusive Europe, our vision of an independent, confident Britain, giving leadership with our partners in the European Community. And in our elections, in this country next year, we will be the only mainstream party that is not prepared to move towards a centralised Europe and take that message to every doorstep in the country.And tell them this too, tell them that any vote against us, for whatever party - Labour, Liberal, makes no difference - any vote against us for whatever party would be seen in every capital in the Community as a signal that the British people want a centralised Europe. We know they don\u2019t. You know they don\u2019t. They know they don\u2019t. We must make sure the people of Britain vote to show the rest of Europe that we don\u2019t.The Liberal leader says, rather nervously I thought, that the guns are turning on him. Too right they are, and not before time. Let the Liberals loose and the prospect of a federal Europe could be a reality again. In this country, they are federalism\u2019s fifth column. Away with them next June in the elections. Madam President, before I leave the Liberal leader, I want to say a word about his posturing on Bosnia. I find it distasteful. No, no words suffice for the sheer dreadfulness of Bosnia.The violence that has torn apart what used to be Yugoslavia has deep and bloody roots. They go back to the Middle Ages and beyond. People there have suffered great wrongs and unimaginable cruelties. We have given, as we always will, help, food, medicine, technical aid. We have sent British troops with humanitarian aid; the first country to do so. And those troops have saved literally hundreds of thousands of lives, men, women, children, who would now be dead from cold and starvation, are still alive, thanks to the activities, the skill and the bravery of those troops we sent to Bosnia.Madam President, right at the start of this war, I said that I was not prepared to put British troops into combat to hold the various sides apart. It\u2019s my responsibility, my responsibility as the Queen\u2019s first minister, to advise when soldiers should be sent to fight and to risk being killed. It\u2019s all very well to call from the sidelines for a huge military commitment to Bosnia, but I listen with respect to the views of the senior professional soldiers and airmen. They know the depth of the problem. They know what we would be asking their men to do. They know that while the threat of air strikes is a good deterrent, you cannot finally settle a guerrilla war by bombing. They know that. We saw it in Iraq after the biggest Armada of bombing for week after week after week. It was not until we sent in ground troops that Saddam Hussein finally lost. And those senior servicemen warn me against trying to separate three sides, three sides that hate each other, in a cruel civil war, in some of the wildest hill and forest country in Europe.There is another form of intervention which we may have to contemplate. Intervention not to impose a settlement on parties at war, but to implement a negotiated peace. Right now, alas, the peace prospects are thin and speculative. Too speculative to risk the life of a private in the Cheshire\u2019s or the Prince of Wales\u2019 Own. The negotiators will go on trying. I earnestly hope they will succeed but I shall not ask a British private to risk leaving his mother without a son and his wife without a husband unless there is a real settlement. Unless there is a real will by the people of Bosnia to stop fighting, not some ploy to suck outsiders in and then start the war again. I have never been in doubt about Bosnia. Though one cannot always speak one\u2019s mind plainly, I have understood that to intervene is to risk an intolerable number of British dead. A war is easily started. The boys are always going to be back for Christmas, but wars, particularly wars in the Balkans, have other ideas.So, let me make it clear. I leave the talk of a quick away-day outing for the commandoes with everything sorted out in a couple of weeks to the commentators and to the royal corps of columnists. Yugoslavia is tragic. I consider all the options but I must think first of the lives of British soldiers. And I will not put them at risk for the sake of talking big and striking attitudes. I will not rush into war. Emotion says yes, logic says no. I say no.Madam President, an unstable Yugoslavia is one thing. An unstable Russia would be quite another. So, let me say a few words about the events of the past week. We should be under no illusions about the real motives of the rebels in the Russian parliament. They were out for blood, the blood of democrats and reformers and, had they won, the consequences for Russia and for the rest of the world would not have borne thinking about. Yesterday morning, Boris Yeltsin told me that the courts would now deal with his opponents. Madam President, that is not how they wanted to deal with him.The Russian people have twice voted for President Yeltsin and for reform. Now he plans further elections, free elections, not rigged Communist elections. He invited me, yesterday, to send British observers to ensure those elections were fair. I agreed and promised that we would certainly do so. Those elections in December will be the surest test that democratic reform remains on track. We backed Boris Yeltsin against the 1991 coup. We were the first to do so. We backed him last weekend and I promise you this: we shall go on backing reform in Russia in the months ahead.When we speak of the threat of violence, there is one other place that is never far from our minds. Each day, each day this week, while we\u2019ve been gathered here in Blackpool, thousands of young men and women risk their lives in the Army and in the security services in Northern Ireland. They stand in the defence of democracy and of the rule of law. Under a Conservative Government, they will continue to have all the support that they need.Northern Ireland is part of our democracy. We are not going to bargain away the people\u2019s democratic rights, or any part of them, in order to appease those who seek to rule by bullet or by bomb. To do so, to do so would betray the people and, in particular, those of every party, many of them brave, who take a part in constitutional politics in Northern Ireland. So, no Government that I lead will negotiate with those who perpetrate or those who support the use of violence. There is only one message for them to send. We have finished with violence for good. Madam President, we are and we will remain the Conservative and Unionist Party.At the heart of our philosophy is an abiding belief in the right of the people of Northern Ireland to determine their own future. Unlike the Labour Party, we are not in the business of securing the break-up of the United Kingdom. For us, the union and all it means it immensely important. In all parts of the United Kingdom, including Northern Ireland, the union has the decisive support of those who live there. So I give this assurance to the brave and resilient people of Northern Ireland: for our part, we will always back your democratic wishes.Madam President, before I sit down, I want to congratulate all of you in the hall, all of you who are the backbone and the strength of our party, for your cool, your warmth and, yes, your resilience during a remarkable and, how shall I put it, most diverting week in Blackpool.Throughout the 1980s, the political energy of this country came from the Conservatives. That energy must go on through the \u201990s and not only go on, but grow and develop, driven not just by those in Government but by you who work on our behalf for our philosophy, for our party, in each and every part of the United Kingdom. And if you feel, as I do, refreshed and recharged by our work in Blackpool this week, then go home and help us restore the fortunes of our party, through hard work and a passionate belief that what we Conservatives stand for is more true, more deep, more enduring, more in touch with the basic instincts of the nation we love, than all the words of all the other political parties rolled together. We stand for self-reliance, for decency and for respect for others, for wages that stay in the pay packet and don\u2019t drain away in tax. We stand for money that keeps it value, for a country united around those old, commonsense British values that should never have been pushed aside.The message from this conference is clear and simple: we must go back to basics. We want our children to be taught the best, our public services to give the best, our British industry to be the best, and the Conservative Party will lead the country back to those basics right across the board. Sound money, free trade, traditional teaching, respect for the family and respect for the law. And, above all, we will lead a new campaign to defeat the cancer that is crime.Carry out that message. Reach out, not only to those who already think as we do, but to all those with no special party allegiance who care for what we care for and who love this country as we do, for the same reasons we do. Do that. The fight goes on, the waverers will return, and yes, a fifth victory will be ours.And one final word. Thank you, thank you for something that has been quite fantastic: your loyalty to this party and your loyalty to me.

aVBefore I start, there is one thing I want to say to the Conference.The papers tell me that the Party leadership has been embarrassed once or twice this week by the antics of the activists. Well thank goodness we\u2019re not the Tory Party, where the activists are constantly embarrassed by the antics of the leadership!You know, Jeremy Hanley says you\u2019re the \u2018loony left\u2019... Oh, it could have been much, much worse. He could have accused you of youthful exuberance! I want this speech to go down really well. So I have asked all my Parliamentary colleagues to read it first. And I want to make it absolutely clear to the Conference that they disagree with every single word of it! But seriously, thinking back over the last six years since this Party was formed - and we\u2019ve come a long, long way together in those six years - I cannot think of a better year of electoral success... though I have to say I can think of one or two Conferences that have gone better. OK, so I may not have got my way once or twice. And as you all know, I like to get my way. But I am certain of this. The quality of our democracy in this Party is more important than the occasional discomfort of the Party leadership. But this Conference has TWO responsibilities. One IS to send messages to the leadership. And you do THAT very well. The other is to send messages to the voters. And I believe that we all need to think very hard about how we could do THAT better. What concerns me is that every time we are seen to take our mind off the big picture, we risk missing a great - perhaps unique - opportunity which we have created for ourselves.This is the time when our ideas are becoming the currency of debate. We must not allow ourselves to risk becoming distracted. A Peaceful RevolutionIn this speech I want to tell you why this moment must not be wasted. Why we must create a new kind of politics. And what I believe are the issues which the politics of progress must address. Note. I am not going to waste much time telling you how awful this Government is. Everyone in Britain knows that. Their view could be summed up quite simply in the words of a man I met when I was campaigning in Eastleigh.He said: \u2018Paddy, what\u2019s the difference between this government and a Lada?\u2019 And I said, \u2018I don\u2019t know, what is the difference between this government and a Lada?\u2019 \u2018Well,\u2019 he said: \u2018One\u2019s a clapped-out embarrassment from the 1980s, and the other\u2019s a car from Russia!\u2019 Well that says it all. So instead, I want to concentrate not on how bad the Conservatives have made things in the past, but on how much better we can make them in the future. People don\u2019t always realise how deep is the change which we Liberal Democrats seek. What we are fighting for is nothing less than a peaceful revolution - the most fundamental turn-round in our politics since the Great Reform Act of 1832. Our aim is nothing less than to overthrow the paternalism which has ruled the destinies of the British people, under BOTH Conservative and Labour.To shatter a system which presumes that governments know best - and replace it with the dangerous and dynamic doctrine that it is PEOPLE who know best. It is time for Britain\u2019s democratic revolution. It is time to dismantle much of the central state. It is time to put power back where it belongs, in the towns, in the cities, in the regions and in the nations of our United Kingdom. It is TIME to overturn the barriers that still stand in the way of 52% of our population - to liberate the potential of the women of this country.It is time to release the energy of the tens of millions who are shut out from the decisions which affect their lives. To root out the cosy corruption and bureaucratic waste of these last days of Conservatism.Let me say why. I believe there can be no regeneration of Britain - neither economic, nor social, nor political - unless people take back from the system the power that is rightfully theirs.The historic role of this Party - of we Liberal Democrats - is to make that possible. To rediscover the latent energy in Britain. To give everybody a chance to be a somebody.To see our people flourish with a government that is their servant, not their master.To let us - each of us - become a responsible citizen, not a resentful subject.Education That is why Liberal Democrats put education first. Of course, putting education first is easy to say, but it\u2019s tough to do. And the way you prove you put education first is by making education the FIRST call on the nation\u2019s investment resources. Putting education first means having the courage to give people the tools to think for themselves, to do things for themselves. Putting education first means fostering self-reliance, responsibility, tolerance and respect.And it\u2019s about giving people the skills for Britain\u2019s future economic success. Because Liberal Democrats understand that the only source of future prosperity for Britain lies in the minds and brains of our people - each and every one of them. Unleashing those skills is what the Japanese call \u2018mining the gold in people\u2019s heads\u2019 -and that\u2019s what we have to do. THAT is why every single British child must have the best possible start with guaranteed pre-school education. And I say to the Conservative and Labour parties, when it comes to nursery education, \u2018this year, next year, sometime, never\u2019 will not do.We need that investment now. WE prove it by saying how much it will cost, where the money will come from. And we challenge you to do the same.Second, putting education first means raising standards in schools. Yes, we need education strategies set by the LEAs. But individual schools should have the freedom to develop in their own distinctive ways.Yes, we need to improve the way we assess pupil achievement. But parents do have a right to meaningful information about their child\u2019s performance and this Party should see that that happens.Yes, teachers must be valued. Fifty, a hundred years ago, this country was a lot poorer than today. But one group that was respected was teachers. We want teachers to have that respect again.That\u2019s why the Liberal Democrats say YES to a General Teaching Council. YES to sabbaticals. YES to extra back-up for teachers and decent, well-equipped classrooms in which to work. But NO to poor teaching standards. That is the deal we offer teachers.And putting education first means more choice and opportunities for everyone after fourteen.It means two days a week quality learning and training for everyone between sixteen and nineteen.And it means an education \u2018entitlement\u2019 for every adult, which they can claim when they choose, at any time of their life. The Economy You see, what we should be preparing for is the sort of Britain we want in twenty, thirty, forty years\u2019 time. Look at successful modern economies. They all have one thing in common. They invest for the long-term.But Britain is locked into a short-term culture. Held back by a government that sells off our national assets to pay today\u2019s bills. Why? Because what interests this Conservative Government is not Britain\u2019s long-term future, but the Conservatives\u2019 short-term survival.And so the price we pay in Conservative taxes today is not the price of investment for the next century, it\u2019s the price of Conservative incompetence in the last decade.The taxes we pay are not to create better jobs in the next few years. They are to pay for the jobs which have been destroyed by the Tories over the last few years.You know, if unemployment had been reduced by just half between 1984 and 1993, we\u2019d have had enough money to build the Channel Tunnel rail link, to modernise London Underground, and to set up an information superhighway, all at the same time.And here is a WARNING. They\u2019re at it again. The sole aim of government policy now is not to fund investment in Britain for the next century, but to fund tax cuts, to save Conservative jobs at the next election. Well, Liberal Democrats say that money should be used, not to bribe the voters, but to build the future.And as the Conservatives once again prepare to dangle pre-election tax bribes before us, Britain might remember the old Russian proverb \u2013 \u2018free cheese only comes in mousetraps\u2019!We Liberal Democrats want to see a strong, highly competitive, flexible, enterprise economy.An economy founded on skills and innovation, sustained by long-term investment. An economy driven forward by vibrant small businesses.An economy supported by a government which acts to create stability - not just through the independence for the Bank of England, but also through savings and investment targets for steady long-term growth.An economy which is sustainable and clean, because that means efficiency and a better quality of life - and that means shifting tax away from the things we want, like jobs and wealth, and onto the things we don\u2019t want, like dirty air, congested roads, pollution.Tax and BenefitsNow tax has been a big issue this week. And in a moment, I want to say a word or two about it. But first I want to talk about promises.The country\u2019s become very wary about politicians\u2019 promises. After this Government\u2019s betrayal, that\u2019s hardly surprising.I don\u2019t believe people will be ready to believe promises unless we are prepared to be honest about the costs. THAT is why the Liberal Democrats will go into the next General Election with a clear, costed, \u2018menu with prices.\u2019And that is why we are going to have to decide what are priorities and what are long term goals. And it isn\u2019t going to be easy. But only if we can make those decisions can we become the fulcrum of trust that can make this Party the turning point of change. And only if we are clear about what we will spend will the voters accept what we will tax. This week we have established some of the principles of our tax policies.The Liberal Democrats will not be a high tax party, but we are determined to be a FAIR tax party. We will not penalise enterprise or self-reliance - we will encourage it. And we understand the special role in our economy of those on middle incomes. But we are determined to start making the investments all our children need for tomorrow, and creating the opportunities to get people into work.Opportunities cost. Of course they do. But so does ill-health, crime and poverty. And the Liberal Democrats will not take your money without telling you where it is going. We\u2019ll give tax payers more control over how their money is spent. So, here are Ashdown\u2019s four laws of taxation: One. Not high tax, but fair tax.Two. No taxation without explanation.Three. No promises, unless the bill is attached.And four. No way will the government ask YOU to do with less, until the government has first shown that IT can do with less. There are millions of pounds thrown away on ministers\u2019 pet schemes and the feather bedding which surrounds our bloated system of government. Last year I said our Party should become the public\u2019s watchdog against government waste. Since then, at Westminster we Liberal Democrats have exposed the scandalous waste of government advertising; the 60 million pounds wasted on unoccupied government offices; the severance payments to failed Tory ministers. What a scam! When people like Norman Lamont and John Patten get eight thousand pounds just for being sacked.I guess that\u2019s what the Tory party would call Performance Related Pay-Offs! And on the subject of scams, I want to turn to the Tory Party\u2019s very own soap opera - an everyday story of country folk - the Archers. Yesterday the world\u2019s most respected financial paper devoted a whole page to the unanswered questions of the Archer affair. Those questions require an answer. Doesn\u2019t the Conservative Party understand that simply asking Lord Archer to stay away from their Conference isn\u2019t a sufficient response?This matter will not go away until Michael Heseltine publishes the full facts. And he must do so now. The SystemBut we\u2019re talking about something much bigger than the failure of the Conservative Government. We\u2019re talking about the wider failure of our political system itself.That is why we have to turn the whole system on its head, to say to people - this is your country, your future, you take responsibility for it.Politicians must stop encouraging people to believe that government can do everything - or even should do everything.Let\u2019s just for a moment consider the Health Service.The most difficult question in the Health Service today is the question of health care priorities. \u2018Rationing\u2019 has always gone on, and it probably always willBut the people who are doing it are bureaucrats meeting in secret. And the people who are suffering are the patients who pay for the Health Service through their taxes.So why not let those who pay for the Health Service, and who depend on the Health Service, have a say on the priorities for the Health Service?These are serious issues and they need to be considered seriously.Why not set up a cross-Party Commission, involving health service professionals and outside experts, to lead this debate, and see if we can build a new cross-party consensus on the Health Service? - So that it really can become again the National Health Service, and NOT the National Political Football. You see, the Liberal Democrat task is to open up the system, help people to take and use power for themselves, empower people with information, access, involvement.That\u2019s why we need a new Great Reform Act in Britain.Why we need Freedom of Information.Why it\u2019s right to experiment with direct democracy.Why we need to break up the power of central government, give local communities more control over their own affairs, so the English regions have more power, so the people of Wales have their own Senedd, and so the people of Scotland can have their own Parliament. What we have been watching in Britain is the long slow death of pluralism under one-party rule.I am delighted that the Labour Party seems at last to be recognising the IMPORTANCE of pluralism. I just wish they practised it in some of their rotten inner city boroughs.TALKING about pluralism is fine. But there is only one GUARANTEE of pluralism.Fine words are meaningless unless they are backed by fair votes.But no programme of reform could possibly be complete without the reform of the most antiquated institution of them all - the House of Commons itself.Isn\u2019t it extraordinary that the House of Commons has imposed reform on almost every other institution in Britain while resisting any possible reform of itself? Isn\u2019t it extraordinary that the House of Commons is STILL dominated by white men in grey suits, when everyone agrees it should be properly representative? Isn\u2019t it extraordinary that, to conduct the nation\u2019s business, we have to behave in a way which would not be tolerated in any classroom in this country? Success in a modern society is based on partnership and teamwork - look at successful businesses. But the House of Commons is based on institutionalised confrontation and would rather die than share a decision with someone else. The long string of catastrophes, from the Poll Tax, to the arms-to-Iraq scandal, to the Criminal Justice Bill, proves only too clearly that the House of Commons comprehensively fails to hold the government to account.The House of Commons is out of date, out of tune with the country and out of touch with the people it is supposed to serve. But watch Labour in the House of Commons and you will see that they love it just as much as the Conservatives. The Labour Party want to inherit the House of Commons, not change it.So, let it be the Liberal Democrats who make it clear in our next manifesto that we are determined to drag the House of Commons, kicking and screaming if necessary, out of the last century and into the next. EuropeAnd if you want an example of just how the House of Commons has failed, just look at how the Maastricht Treaty was handled. One of the most important issues of our day - reduced down to arcane arguments, shambolic procedures and silly hats.We have to treat Europe more seriously in this country.The European Union is one of the success stories of this century. But as we approach the NEXT century, the challenge is to revitalise Europe by making the idea of Europe live for people.We must never forget the importance of Europe to us in Britain. Europe offers British people and British businesses great new opportunities, and great long-term benefits -prosperity, peace and progress. That\u2019s why this Government\u2019s behaviour over Europe is so incredible. I mean, what is Mr Major on about - a \u2018multi-speed Europe.\u2019 This is a community of nations we\u2019re talking about, not a Kenwood mixer. Instead of talking about \u2018variable geometry\u2019 - whatever that is - we should be putting down concrete proposals that reconnect Europe with its people - opening Europe up to public scrutiny; strengthening the European Parliament; and yes, responding to peoples\u2019 concerns about the power of Brussels by making sure that the Commission keeps out of areas where it has no business.But there is still more work to be done. What is being created in Europe is a unique federal structure. That does not mean a monstrous super-state - Liberal Democrats are not interested in that. But the essence of any federal structure is a clear definition of who does what at which level. Vague notions of \u2018subsidiarity\u2019 will no longer do. The central task of the Inter-Governmental Conference of 1996 must be to define the settlement and scope of powers which should be exercised by local councils, regional assemblies, national governments and the European Union institutions.I want the Liberal Democrats to prepare and publish our own proposals for the IGC - spelling out what powers should be exercised at which level; setting out reforms to the structure and functions of the Union. And when we have published our proposals, we shall discuss them with the voters of this country. Our future in Europe is far too important to be treated as a private quarrel within the Conservative party. So I ask John Major to do the same. Will he publish his own ideas for the IGC well in advance of 1996, and will he consult the British people on them? Foreign AffairsAnd nowhere is leadership in Europe more important than in striving for a safe, secure future in the world.We all hoped that the collapse of communism would usher in a new era of peace, stability and declining military budgets. I fear we could not have been further from the truth. In fact, I think there are now all the signs that the next decade in Europe could be as turbulent and dangerous as any we have seen in this most turbulent of centuries. The last three centuries of conflict in Europe have been between nations and about borders. Future ones will be between ethnic, tribal and religious groups and across borders. Bosnia writ large in the chaos of the collapsed Soviet Empire. Only the difference will be that this time, the war lords will have access to nuclear weapons. I am glad that, at this Conference, we faced up to that possibility and the impact it could have on military spending and European integration. That was not an easy thing for a Party like ours to do - but it was the right thing. And incidentally, if the events I fear come in the East, then all the petty fears of Maastricht will vanish overnight. Western Europe will lock itself together to create a tight island of security and stability at the Western end of a sea of chaos and war.And even if this does not happen, it still remains the case that every penny we spend on defence will be better spent in co-ordination with our European allies and to support a strong framework of international law.The only way to tackle these great issues is through a new style of politics. I want to see more consensus and co-operation on some of these great issues which cut across party barriers. That will continue to be our approach to Northern Ireland for just so long as the Prime Minister sticks to the national interest. This is one of those moments, like the Maastricht Treaty, when both government and opposition parties must rise above party politics.The Shape of the New PoliticsYou see, working together lies at the heart of the new style of politics we must create in Britain.And there are other issues that must also be faced by those who claim to stand for progress and a modem Britain. In the economy - to recognise that a market-based economy, built on enterprise, investment and skill, is the only way to meet the global challenge.In public services - not to reverse, but to build on reforms where they have devolved power, and concentrate on increasing accountability.In politics - to open up our democracy, to put people in control and to give people fair votes so that everyone has a say.On the environment - to put the green imperative at the very centre of all our policies, especially the economy. On Europe - to recognise that we can only safeguard Britain\u2019s future by working with our European partners - and be clear on the opportunity of a single currency.And underpinning all of this - to put education first.After the Next ElectionSo, the key question is, what sort of Britain, and what sort of government, should we be striving for after the next election?What a moment of new hope, of new opportunity that could be. And yet, if we Liberal Democrats are not strong and resolute, what a let-down it could become.Just think how damaging it would be for democracy if the disaster of this long period of one-party rule was followed by disillusionment with what follows.How damaging it would be if, instead of hard analysis, concrete solutions and honest costs, one-party rule was overthrown by candy-floss visions and candy-stick promises that turn sour in the tough reality of office. How damaging it would be if, instead of a sure step forward, our country continued to slither down in the long decline from world-class status to marginalised failure.Let me tell you first what I fear after the next election. I fear a government empty of ideas and devoid of reforming radicalism.I fear a government which does favours for its friends, because they pay the Party\u2019s bills - rather than being responsive to the voters who pay the country\u2019s bills.I fear a government which continues to avoid whole-hearted commitment to our European future.I fear a government which still tries to do things FOR people, rather than helping them to do things for themselves. What I hope for is a confident, reforming government - capable of creating a thriving Britain, a proud Britain.Where government works with people for their individual achievement and the common good. Where excellent education makes everyone employable. Where the environment is cared for like the nation\u2019s garden.Where at last we become citizens in our own land, not subjects of the State. Where we have strong communities - thriving on ethnic and cultural diversity. And do you know what will make the difference between these two contrasting futures for Britain? Of course you do. It is the Liberal Democrats. We will make the difference. Liberal Democrats have a proud heritage. Deep roots. A powerful vision. The Liberal Democrats\u2019 APPROACH is different from Socialists and Conservatives.And we DO things differently from Socialists and Conservatives. But we also have enough confidence in our own strength to make common cause with others to achieve the best for the future. So our task in the next two years is to build on our record of success. Our mission is to show people, when and where we have power, what the Liberal Democrats can do. And our purpose is to take our message of hope - our hard-headed plans for action - to every town, to every street and to every home in Britain.That is the only way we can build a better future for all of us. That is the task ahead.

aVGordon, Conference, before I begin my speech I would just like to introduce you to someone sitting on the platform - it is Mary Wilson, the widow of Harold Wilson. (Applause) Mary, we thank you and we thank Harold for all the work and dedication for our party and for our country.Can I welcome too today the many ambassadors from all round the world and, in particular, if I may, the ambassador from Israel and from those of the Arab countries involved in the peace process. We wish you well. We hope that your process succeeds. The whole courage and eyes of the world are behind you.Today I place before you my vision of a new Britain - a nation reborn, prosperous, secure, united - one Britain. I say how this vision is to be achieved: by a new, confident Labour Party that, with the support of the British people, will sweep away forever the most discredited, dishonourable government in living memory.New Labour, new Britain. I know that for some of you, new Labour has been painful and there is no greater pain to be endured in politics than the birth of a new idea, but I believe in it and I want to tell you why. Socialism for me was never about nationalisation or the power of the state, not just about economics or even politics. It is a moral purpose to life, a set of values, a belief in society, in co-operation, in achieving together what we cannot achieve alone. It is how I try to live my life, how you try to live yours - the simple truths - I am worth no more than anyone else, I am my brother\u2019s keeper, I will not walk by on the other side. We are not simply people set in isolation from one another, face to face with eternity, but members of the same family, same community, same human race. This is my socialism and the irony of all our long years in opposition is that those values are shared by the vast majority of the British people.I joined this party because it represented those values, but I felt something else and I think in your heart of hearts you felt it too: that however great and timeless our values, at that time our party\u2019s politics, structure and even its ideology no longer reflected those values in a way that brought them alive for the British people. We had become separated from the very people we said we represented. We called them \u2018our people,\u2019 while forgetting who they were.1983 for me was a watershed. New Labour was born then of the courage of one man. We would not be here, proud and confident today, but for that man - Neil Kinnock. (Applause) And then it grew under the wisdom of John Smith, who guided us through the revolution in our party democracy and whose memory we honour, and in this last year we have transformed our party - our constitution rewritten, our relations with the trade unions changed and better defined for today's world, our party organisation improved, political education on an unprecedented scale, new policy breaking new ground.I did not come into politics to change the Labour Party. I came into politics to change my country and I honestly believe that if we had not changed, if we had not returned our party to its essential values, free from the weight of outdated ideology, we could not change the country. We could not win and even if we did, we would not have governed in the way Britain needs. For I do not want a one term Labour government that dazzles for a moment, then ends in disillusion. I want a Labour government that governs for a generation and changes Britain for good.It has been hard, I know - hard for me sometimes. Last year, I was Bambi. This year, I'm Stalin! From Disneyland to dictatorship in 12 short months. I\u2019m not sure which one I prefer. OK - I prefer Bambi, honestly.There have been good moments, however, like yesterday when for the first time since I became Leader, my children were impressed by something I did. \u2018Did you really meet Kevin Keegan, Dad?\u2019 \u2018Did you really do 27 consecutive headers?\u2019 And wasn\u2019t it good to see Eric Cantona back in action? Let us hope this time he remembers that kicking people in the teeth is the job of the Tory government.So, it has been tough. No one ever thought it would be done, and it has been, but what I want to say to you is this: I did not do it alone. We did it together. Thank you. Our success is record by-election results, record local election results and - I am as proud of this as anything - the new Labour women candidates we have chosen. There has been some pain there too, yes, but look at the results. We could have 80 or 90 Labour women MPs after the next election and that would transform politics in this country.I read the other day that not one winnable Tory seat has picked a woman candidate. What a disgrace. But, then again, what is a winnable Tory seat? Peter Lilley, MP for St Albans - majority 16,000 - unsafe; Lilley on the chicken run to Hitchen and Harpenden. Tory Chairman, Brian Mawhinney, a man whose job it is to say that the Tories will sweep the country once more - majority 5,000 - unsafe; on the chicken run from Peterborough to Cambridgeshire. And what about Basildon man himself? Terrified of the nation watching on election night as that smug grin is finally removed. Why did the chicken cross the road? To get to a safer seat, but never have so many chickens died in vain. Ask the man who said: \u2018They can run, but they can\u2019t hide.\u2019There is great success to celebrate and much of the work in gearing up our party has been done by the Deputy Leader, John Prescott, and I pay tribute to him. He is a good friend and a great support; blunt, honest, outspoken - and that's just with me.I see, incidentally, that Mr Major is now planning to challenge me to a TV debate during the general election. Fine. His record against our policies, any place, any time, but I have a better idea. Instead of just challenging us to a television debate, challenge us to a general election and do it now. (Applause)We now have 100,000 new members. Next year for the first time we will have more members than the Conservative Party, and a huge increase in Young Labour - five times as many in Young Labour as in the Young Conservatives. We value our members, new and old, and let us never fall for this nonsense, that by seeking new support, we turn our back on the poor, the homeless and unemployed.I have spent 16 years being angry, passionate and indignant about young people huddled in doorways, families made wretched by unemployment, the poor unable to make ends meet. I am fed up with anger. They do not need our anger, they need action and they will not get it from the rage of opposition, but through a Labour Party that has had the courage to take hard choices, get into government and do something for them.We know that the hard choices get harder in government: when we refuse to take risks with inflation because this country cannot be rebuilt on boom and bust, even to boost short-term employment; when we want more children at university and do not want the government student loan scheme and face choices about how it will be replaced; on public sector pay when, let us be honest, a Labour government, like any other, will have to say \u2018no\u2019 as well as \u2018yes,\u2019 even to people in this hall. Hard choices are what good government is about, but remember this, I love my party, I just hate it being in opposition and I love my country and hate what the Tories have done to it. Every promise ever made has been broken - taxes, unemployment, crime, the health service, education. It is a record of incompetence and dishonesty on an epic scale. Now they plead with the British people, \u2018Trust us this one more time.\u2019 I say to the British people, there are two sides to a deal. They gave their word, you gave your vote. They broke their word, do not ever give them your vote again.I will tell you about the Tories and tax. They cut your taxes before the election and they raise them afterwards and only ever give one side of the equation. They will cut your income tax, but raise your VAT. They make you pay charges, such as in the NHS, extra costs like taxes on insuring your home. It is all a con. We all want ordinary, hard working families to pay less tax, but the way to cut tax and make it last is to cut unemployment, crime, welfare spending - all the reasons why taxes have gone up.Imagine for one moment a Tory fifth term Britain. Would there be a National Health Service? (\u2018No!\u2019) Would there be a free state education system for all? (\u2018No!\u2019) Would there be a welfare state? (\u2018No!\u2019) Would Mr Redwood be in charge of deciding which single parents get to keep their children? (\u2018No!\u2019) Well, let\u2019s make sure it doesn\u2019t happen. Re-elect them and be in no doubt. Back they come with VAT on fuel, all schools to opt-out, your post office sold off, more health privatisation, giant privatised monopolies controlling your services, the price decided by a gaggle of former ministers on the board, for they too are a party changed. Half the Conservative back benchers voted for Mr Redwood to be prime minister. All aboard Starship Redwood, bound for Planet Portillo! Do you remember Planet Portillo? Last year it was a joke. Next year it could be Britain. Don\u2019t let them capture this country\u2019s future, for they offer it nothing.This is a new age, to be led by a new generation. Let me talk to you about my generation. We grew up after the Second World War. We read about fascism and saw the Soviet Union and we learned to fear extremes of right and left. We were born into the welfare state and the National Health Service, into the market economy of bank accounts, supermarkets, jeans and cars. We had money in our pockets our parents never dreamt of, we travelled abroad, we have been through the sexual revolution of the 60s. Half the workforce now are women and the world of work revolutionised by science. We built a new popular culture, transformed by colour TV, Coronation Street and the Beatles.My generation enjoys a thousand material advantages over any previous generation and yet we suffer a depth of insecurity and spiritual doubt they never knew. The family weakened, society divided, we see elderly people in fear of crime, children abused. We live today with the knowledge that the world through nuclear weapons, chemical weapons and contempt for the environment can end a billion years of evolution.Mine is the generation with more freedom than any other, but less certainty in how to exercise it responsibly. It is the generation that knocks on the door of a new millennium frightened for our future and unsure of our soul because we live in a new age, but in an old country. Britain won two world wars. We had an Empire and formed a Commonwealth. We invented the sports the rest of the world plays, we gave the world some of its finest literature, art and poetry. We are proud of our history, but its weight hangs heavy upon us. Why? Because for far too long it has left us defining ourselves as a nation, not by what unites us, but by what divides us: a class system, unequal and antiquated; a social fabric, tattered and torn; a politics where dogma so often drives out common sense; even an education system where one part of the nation is taught apart from the other; and where, if we do not change course now, we will have two classes of health service, two classes of state school, two Britains, one on welfare, the other paying for it.I want us to be a young country again with a common purpose, ideals we cherish and live up to, not resting on past glories, fighting old battles and sitting back, hand on mouth, concealing a yawn of cynicism, but ready for the day\u2019s challenge, ambitious, idealistic, united, where people succeed on the basis of what they did to their country, rather than what they take from their country, not saying, \u2018This was a great country,\u2019 but \u2018Britain can and will be a great country again.\u2019 A young country: no more bosses versus workers - partnership at the workplace; no more public versus private - cooperation to rebuild our nation\u2019s road, rail, inner cities and regions; no more boom and bust economics, but stability which businesses need to plan for the future; help for small businesses; a new relationship between public and private sector, measures to encourage long term investment.  But above all, I present to you today our proposals to equip our people and businesses for new technological and economic challenge, to change the basis of this country's thinking of the past 100 years. Education is the best economic policy there is for a modern country and it is in the marriage of education and technology that the future lies. The arms race may be over; the knowledge race has begun and we will never compete on the basis of a low-wage, sweat shop economy. It cannot be done that way. We have one asset - our people, their intelligence, their potential. Develop it, we succeed, neglect it, we fail. It is as simple as that and the pace of technological change means that this task is urgent.           Education does not stop when you walk out of the school gates for the last time. Education must be for life. This is hard economics. The more you learn, the more you earn. It is your way to do well out of life - your route to jobs, to growth, to the combination of technology and know-how that will transform our lives. Look at the potential of it. Look at industry and business: an oil rig out in the Gulf of Mexico has metal fatigue, it can be diagnosed from an office in Aberdeen. European businesses will finalise a deal with the Japanese with simultaneous translation down the phone line. The calls in the future could even be free. Leisure too: virtual reality tourism that allows you to go anywhere in the world, computers that learn about a child as they teach them, shaping courses to their personal need. Knowledge in this new world is power, information is opportunity and technology can make it happen if we use it properly and if we plan and think ahead for the future.Just think: direct access to the best teaching skills from the workplace or the home - class size of one; the engineer who needs to keep pace with technical change; the self-employed architect who wants to do his own accountancy; the computer operator who needs to adapt to new systems; the mother on maternity leave learning a new skill or language to equip her for her return to work. It can be done, but will it happen? Only if we make it happen. It means bringing together the private sector, government, universities, research centres, science laboratories, to put together an advanced system of further education for the electronic age for people at work and for people who lose their job. It requires a supreme national effort. The market will not do it.A Labour government will and can and we have started work on it already. It will be called the University for Industry and it will transform education and skills in Britain and make lifelong learning a reality. But we must be even bolder. We have huge advantages - some of the finest telecommunications companies in the world, world leaders in broadcasting, the world\u2019s first language - English. Together they could put us years ahead in education, technology and business, but in Tory Britain we waste our assets. We are not using them, organising, making the most of them and time is running out because other countries are doing it.I put before you today this proposal, that we should open up the markets in communications and technology - yes, a market solution. The cable companies are playing their part, using the new technology to good effect, but we should aim for free and fair competition and end the restrictions that have prevented British Telecom, Mercury and others from playing their part in wiring up Britain until there is full and open competition everywhere from the year 2002. This is a market with huge potential, but in return these companies owe some responsibility to the nation. That is the essence of partnership.In these past weeks we have been in discussion with British Telecom. In return for access to the market, I can announce that they have agreed, as they build their network, to connect every school, college, hospital and library in Britain, for free. They get the chance to win new markets, the nation gets the chance to succeed. That is what I mean by new Labour, that type of co-operation with our people; public and private working together, building a dynamic economy that addresses the nation\u2019s needs and serves the nation's interests. Eventually we want every home to be wired up in new Britain - a goal worth striving for, no haves and have nots in the computer age.We can make it happen: business enhanced, life more entertaining, public services improved, People better off and Britain better off. I can announce a third public-private initiative. David Blunkett will be opening discussions with both the education authorities and the computer companies which supply them about how we meet the goal of ensuring that every child has access to a proper laptop computer. It is a big challenge; it would need new forms of teacher training and a whole network of delivery, but it is possible. Just think: 50 years ago, their grandparents came into state schools for the first time and sat at a proper wooden desk and a Labour government provided them. Half a century later, a new way for a new age. That is also what I mean by new Labour.Thirty-fifth in the education league may be good enough for the Tories but I didn\u2019t come into politics satisfied for Britain to be 35th best at anything. What an appalling record to have. We are going to put our education system right - no more dogma, no more arguments about structures, for every school, fair and equal funding, no return to selection, academic or social, but a new deal in our classrooms.We will be the champions of standards for the 21st century: more support and in return, more demand for achievement; the aim of a nursery place for every three and four year old; a voluntary network of associate teachers - adults with expertise in a foreign language or business - to assist the classroom teacher; a new adult-pupil ratio in class, pioneered by Labour authorities, extended to the whole of Britain; proper assessment for all five year olds; schools playing to their strengths, not just technology, which should be part of every school's curriculum, but schools with a specialism that can bring out the best in their pupils - science, music, design or maths - developing areas of expertise, subjects in which they can offer that extra depth that helps the child, centres of excellence for the benefit of the whole community. And one more thing: the Tories say that class size does not matter; if that is true, I just wonder why so many of them spend so much money buying small classes in the private sector.The Tories spend over £100 million a year on the Assisted Places Scheme. Under Labour, the scheme will be phased out. £60 million - just over half the cost of the Assisted Places Scheme - would pay for every five, six and seven year old to be educated in classes of less than 30 children. That is how they will be educated in Labour Britain.The price of more support will be higher expectations of success and more action to combat failure. Teachers should be rewarded, but if they cannot do the job, they should not be teaching at all. Headteachers should prove their leadership skills before they are considered for a head\u2019s post. Parents have duties too. Children do homework, they should not be playing truant and where they are, it is not just the school\u2019s job to do something about it, it is the parents\u2019 job too. We support the development of home-school contracts where schools and parents jointly take responsibility for children (again pioneered by Labour in local government), tougher inspection, higher targets and more prompt action when things are going wrong. I know some of that may sound harsh, but actually it is fair. If we tolerate failure in our schools, it is ordinary children who suffer and we cannot betray their future.Our challenge to be a young country is not just economic, it is social and moral. Look at the wreckage of our broken society, see Britain through the eyes of our children. Are we really proud of our society today - drugs, violence, youngsters hanging around street corners with nothing to do? We have to have the courage to build a new civil society, a new social order, where everyone has a stake and everyone plays a part - justice for all, responsibility from all. It is a bargain between us and the people.No one pretends that we can solve unemployment overnight, but no decent society can tolerate these levels of long-term unemployment, with all the misery and social breakdown they bring. We will take the excess profits of the new robber barons of Tory Britain, the privatised utilities, and use them for the most radical programme of work and education for the unemployed ever put forward in Britain. We will use that money too - and end up saving money - by giving single parents the chance not to live on benefit, but to plan their future, organise childcare and training so that they can support themselves and their children, not be the butt of Tory propaganda, but citizens of a new Britain who can earn a wage and look after the children they love.With this opportunity comes the responsibility because both come together. It has always been absurd that the debate about crime in this country has some talking of its causes and others of the need to punish criminals. Sweep away the dogma - tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime: reform of the criminal justice system; a comprehensive programme to deal with juvenile offending; tackling drug abuse; proper treatment of victims and witnesses; tougher penalties on violence or guns; a crackdown on those who make life hell in their local neighbourhoods through noise or disturbance and, for the first time, a nationwide crime prevention policy in which in each community, police, schools, businesses and local government plan together how to beat crime. Law and order is a Labour issue today. We all suffer crime and the poorest and vulnerable most of all. It is the duty of government to protect them, but we can make choices in spending too and instead of wasting hundreds of millions of pounds on compulsory identity cards as the Tory Right demand, let that money provide thousands of extra police officers on the beat where they can actually protect people. This is what a young country can do.The truth is, and we know it, that the best two crime prevention policies are a job and a stable family. A young country that wants to be a strong country cannot be morally neutral about the family. It is the foundation of any decent society. Behind strong communities, lie strong families. Go to any juvenile court and you will see, because in the family people learn to respect and care for one another. Destroy that in a family and you cannot rebuild it in a country. In every area of policy, we should examine its effect on the family, seeing how we can strengthen it and keep it together - in benefits, employment, education, and there is something very tangible we could do in housing. Let local authorities use the money from the sale of council houses to end the most telling obscenity of Tory Britain, that we spend millions of pounds on slum bed and breakfast accommodation for families when we could use that money to build homes for people.In this young country, we can then reform and modernise our welfare state, and the party that founded it and believes in it is the party to reform it. There are hard choices and we will face up to them, but they should be made with justice and equity. This party introduced universal pensions. We believe they must remain the foundation of pension provision, but we cannot cure pensioner poverty simply through the state pension. Some 600,000 of our elderly people are left behind because they do not claim means-tested income support. Increasing numbers of pensioners have second and third pensions. That is why we are looking at ways for people to put together income from public and private sources to guarantee a minimum standard of living for our pensioners. The aim of this policy should be to remove the stigma of means testing for ever and guarantee a minimum income that provides dignity in old age. That is new Labour too, and we are also thinking through new ways of planning for long-term care. You will all know elderly people who saved all their lives and now see their savings eaten away by nursing home costs. It is one of the great modern tragedies of our country and we will examine that and bring forward sensible proposals there to help those people.But I do not want an old social order. I want a new one with rules for today. I believe in the family and in being tough on crime. Some would say that those are the moral values of the old-fashioned or the right, but don\u2019t let the Tories claim these values as their own. They are our values and you can be tough on crime and tough on prejudice too. In any young country, the talents of all are allowed to flourish. There should be no discrimination in our young country on grounds of disability, gender, age, sexuality or race. I say this to the Conservatives, those who play politics with race or immigration, betray the values of a decent, civilised society.Justice, in society and at work: people at work should have a stake in the companies for which they work. A young country gives rights, but it demands responsibilities. Leave the battles of the past. Ballots, peaceful picketing, proper conduct of disputes - these laws are staying we know. But there will be new rights for all individuals at work.A Labour government will be part of the European Social Chapter. Part-time employees will no longer be treated as second class citizens. There will be an end to zero-hours contracts. Young people will be properly protected against under age working and joining a trade union will be a matter of free choice, but where that choice is exercised, there will be a right to representation and, where the majority want it, a right to union recognition.There is one other piece of unfinished business. For 10 years, good and patriotic workers at GCHQ have been denied the right to join a free trade union. Under Labour, they will get it back. One other thing: Keir Hardie did not manage to achieve a minimum wage and nor did Attlee, Wilson, Callaghan or anyone else, but this next Labour government will introduce a statutory minimum wage for Britain. That is our pledge, and it will be done. Not building a workforce where fear is the spur or insecurity the incentive, but a workforce of partners committed to a new and dynamic Britain at work.A young country will sweep away the dogma from our public services. We need to make them public services again - modernised, but serving the public, not vested interests of any kind.  This party created the National Health Service and we will save it. Let that £1 billion in extra administration that the Tories have spent on bureaucracy, accountants and company cars be spent on beds, nurses and patients.     Let the internal market that pits hospital against hospital cease. Let our system of GP commissioning replace GP fund-holding that has created this two-tier system and let the National Health Service work as a service again. Let doctors do what the doctors should do - care for the sick not be forced to make a business out of them We will improve it and today we can announce a new proposal from Professor Robert Winston in the audience today, one of the world\u2019s leading consultants. It is about how we can   use technology to create regional centres of excellence in specialist care, directly linked up through our superhighway proposals to local hospitals and surgeries. That is his proposal. He is passionate not just about defending the National Health Service, but about improving it and he is also a passionate supporter of this party, working for Labour, working for Britain.We will sweep away the dogma of the market in transport and the environment. Our cities are congested, our roads a driver\u2019s nightmare, our railways reduced to such a state that their latest timetable has as many false promises as a Tory Party manifesto. This nation needs a proper national, integrated transport system that serves the people and safeguards the environment. We should sit down and plan it, not wait for the free market to build it - but plan it together - the market where it works, where it does not, we do it. Let me make one thing clear: I do not give blank cheques in any area of policy, including this, no matter what the pressures, but to anyone thinking of grabbing our railways, built up over the years, so they can make a quick profit as our network is broken up and sold off, I say this there will be a publicly owned, publicly accountable railway system under a Labour government. We can then save the hundreds of millions of pounds being wasted on selling our railways to upgrade the service and modernise our lines. That is new Labour too.The privatised utilities will be properly regulated. We even have plans for the lottery too. The lottery profits could be going to good causes. Camelot have six years of their contract to run. A Labour government will then be seeking an efficient, non-profit making promoter so that we can release more money for the benefit of Britain. We will be seeking ways of ensuring that the views of the lottery players themselves are taken into account when lottery panels decide how the takings are spent. It is the people\u2019s lottery - they should get more out of it.But nowhere is a young country more needed than in politics itself. We will change the old and dead political culture of Tory Britain. Where it is right, we will co-operate as well as oppose - on constitutional change and on Northern Ireland. I will not play political games with the peace process in Northern Ireland, it is too important for that. But it is time to end the Tory sleaze, to sweep away the quango state, to take power back from big government and share it with the people. Scotland shall have its Parliament; Wales will have its Assembly. They will be legislated for in the first year of a Labour government and people will then have a say over how their health, education and law and order services are run. A young country should not be frightened of such change. It will strengthen Britain. The only thing that threatens the United Kingdom is a government that refuses to listen to the desire of people to take more power to themselves. That is the threat to Britain.London, our great capital city, will be run by a directly elected authority like any other capital and if, in time, the regions of England want a greater say in their health, education, police and transport, then that can come too. We will rebuild local government in this country and end the muddled hopeless system of rate-capping. We will do it in a way that changes the whole relationship between citizen and state - a Freedom of Information Act for central and local government, an end to hereditary peers sitting in the House of Lords as the first step to a proper directly elected second chamber, and the chance for people to decide after the election the system by which they elect the government of the future.The Tories set up the Nolan Committee on Standards in Public Life. Now they are refusing to implement it because it forces Tory MPs to say what they earn from outside consultancies. Labour will implement it in full.This young country will be proud of its identity and its place in the world, not living in its history, but grasping the opportunities of its future. It is a disgrace that the Conservative Party have reduced British foreign policy in Europe to the level of a joke. Of course, Europe needs reform. We have led the calls to reform the Common Agricultural Policy and the institutions of Europe. Of course, if there are further steps to integration, then we have been the first to say the people should give their consent at a general election or in a referendum, but Europe is a vital part of our national interest. To be sidelined without influence is not a betrayal of Europe, it is a betrayal of Britain. I warn this country, there is now a growing part of the Conservative Party that would take Britain out of Europe altogether and that would be a disaster for jobs and business. I say this to my country in all honesty, we cannot be half in and half out for ever. This country should be leading in Europe and under Labour it will lead in Europe.We will be a nation that stands up for the rights of other nations, as we have done in Bosnia; a nation that will stand up for our allies when right and make a stand when they are wrong, as we do when we condemn without reservation the decision by France to carry out nuclear testing in the South Pacific.We will be a nation proud to welcome our friends from abroad, as we do on Thursday with the visit of Thabo Mbeki and we are doubly proud that we were prepared to support them in prison and not just in government. We will be a nation that will never, for the sake of short-term electoral advantage, sacrifice our overseas aid budget for the poorest people in the world, and shame on those Tories who suggest it.We will be a young country, equipped for the future with a just society, a new politics and a clear understanding of its role in the world. I want to make this pledge today to the whole country and especially to those despairing, who have almost given up hope of change under politicians, that the party I lead will carry out in government, the programme we provide in our manifesto - nothing more, nothing less. That is my word. We deliver what we promise; we do not promise what we cannot deliver.Is this not a vision worth fighting for? Can you not already see the foundations of new Britain being laid just in what we have said today? Ahead in technology, schools transformed, the National Health Service restored and saved, police patrolling the streets, a new battle against crime, democracy and politics renewed, the homeless in houses not on the street, an integrated transport system, partnership between government and business, public and private sector to create the dynamic and modern economy that we need, a direct attack on unemployment, real help that will get single parents off welfare and into work. Feel new Britain come alive. Feel the vitality that can course through this country\u2019s veins and make it young again.Rise together to the challenge because new Labour cannot create new Britain alone. I challenge this country, my country. Let us rouse ourselves to a new moral purpose for our nation to build a new and young country that can lay aside all the prejudices that have dominated our land for generations, a nation for all the people, built by all the people, old divisions cast out, a new spirit in the nation, working together in unity, solidarity, partnership - one Britain. That is the patriotism for the future where never again do we fight our politics by appealing to one section of our nation at the expense of another, where your child in distress is my child, your parent ill and in pain is my parent, your friend unemployed and helpless is my friend, your neighbour, my neighbour. That is the true patriotism of a nation so that together we do make this the young country of my generation's dreams, 50 years from the war, five years from a new millennium, at a turning point in our history. I say to Britain, be strong and of good courage. The Tories will tell you that it cannot be done. They will lie about you, they will lie about me, they will lie about themselves, but do not let fear drive out hope.The coming election is not a struggle for political power. It is a battle for the soul of a nation and I say to you, my party, be strong and of good courage. The Labour Party that first won support from the British people was new Labour then. 1945 was new Labour, 1964 was new Labour - both new Labour because both had the courage to take the values of the Labour Party and use them, not for the world as it was, but for the world as they wanted it to be. New Labour now is ready in 1995 to build new Britain.During the VJ Day celebrations, I was on the platform with Tory ministers and as we walked down the Mall, there were thousands of people, holding their Union Jacks and it became clear, to the horror of the Tories, that most of them were Labour and they were waving and shouting and urging me to \u2018get the Tories out.\u2019 These are our people. They love this country just as we do and it is because they love this country that they look to us to change it. Let us say with pride, we are patriots. This is the patriotic party because it is the party of the people. As the Tories wave their Union Jacks next week, I know what so many people will be thinking. I know what the people want to say to those Tories: it is no good waving the fabric of our flag when you have spent 16 years tearing apart the fabric of the nation; tearing apart the bonds that tie communities together and make us a United Kingdom; tearing apart the security of those people, clutching their Union Jacks, swelling with pride at their victory over tyranny, yelling at me to \u2018get the Tories out\u2019 because they want security, because they want to leave a better world for their children and their grandchildren than they created for themselves and they know the Tories cannot do it; decent people, good people, patriotic people. When I hear people urging us to fight for \u2018our people,\u2019 I tell you, these are our people. They are the majority and we will serve them and build that new Britain, that young country, for their children and their families.I make them this promise now: that I will do all that I can to get these Tories out and devote every breath that I breathe, every sinew of my body to ensuring that your grandchildren do get to live in that new Britain in a new and better world. Discipline, courage, determination, honesty: this victory can be won. The prize is immense. It is new Britain, one Britain - the people united by shared values, shared aims, a government governing for all the people and the party, this party, the Labour Party, new Labour, founded by the people, back truly as the people\u2019s party.New Labour, new Britain, the party renewed, the country reborn. New Labour. New Britain. (Prolonged applause)

aVDiana, friends, colleagues, this year we meet as the opposition. Next year, the British people willing, an end to 18 years of the Tories and we will meet as the new Labour government of Britain. (Applause) It is exciting!But it is also a great responsibility. \u2018A chance to serve - that is all we ask.\u2019 John Smith\u2019s final words from his final speech the night before he died. We owe a debt of inspiration to John Smith, and a debt of honour to Neil Kinnock. (Applause) I did not begin new Labour; Neil did. I intend to repay them both in full. All I ask is the chance to serve. And at the time of the next election there will be just one thousand days until the new millennium, a thousand days to prepare for a thousand years.As a father, as a leader, as a member of the human family, I ask this question of Britain\u2019s future. We live in an era of extraordinary, revolutionary change at work, at home, through technology, through the million marvels of modern science. The possibilities are exciting. But its challenge is clear. How do we create in Britain a new age of achievement in which all of the people - not just a few but all of the people - can share?For all the people or for a few? That is the difference between us and the Conservative Party that governs Britain today. That is the choice before us. That is the challenge of the 21st century. I want to lead Britain into this age of achievement, and today I want to set before you how.But first we should welcome all the representatives, the ambassadors from round the world. I would want to welcome in particular at this time the Israeli Ambassador and the representative of the Palestinian people. (Applause) You are here together and you have our prayers that the tears and the bloodshed of the past few days can once again be ended and peace restored.Here, too, are those from all the communities in Northern Ireland. I would like to say this personally to the people there. No leader with this nation\u2019s interests at heart could do anything other than see this peace process through. With the Irish government, with the parties in Northern Ireland, I can assure you it will be every much a priority for me as for John Major. All the force and energy I have will be bent towards it. We have been responsible in our actions over the peace process from the outset; we will continue to be so now. (Applause)I say this to Sinn Fein and, after events of the last 24 hours, to Loyalist groups as well. You have your chance to take the path of peace. It is your duty to take it as members of the human race. Honour it and you shall play your part. Fail in that duty and I swear to you, the search for justice and reconciliation will carry on without you. The choice is yours. (Applause)My friends, I would like, too, to give apologies for one absentee today. The National Executive invited Aung San Suu Kyi of Burma to be our guest here this week. For reasons everyone will understand she cannot be with us. Let us hope to invite her here next year, a free citizen and an example to democrats everywhere. (Applause)You must be careful with the flashlights, it is making my eyes red! (Laughter and applause) It has been a funny year for me. First, it was Stalin. Then it was Kim Il Sung. And now it is the devil with the demon eyes. Can\u2019t we just go back to Bambi? (Laughter and applause) Or I have a better idea - maybe Kim Il Sung\u2019s official title - the Great Wise Leader, President for Life, Dearly Beloved and Sagacious Leader. Laughter) Why not? It is what John Prescott calls me! (Applause) Sometimes.I will tell you something. In John Prescott I have the best deputy any leader could have. (Applause) If I am fighting in the jungle there is nobody I would rather have with me than John Prescott, and if John Major is fighting in the jungle there is nobody I would rather have him with than Michael Heseltine!I ask you, this Tory government - has there ever been a government in this country\u2019s history that has put itself before the British people with less to merit its re-election than this one? Just mouth the words \u2018five more Tory years\u2019 and you feel your senses and reason repulsed by what they have done to our country. (Applause) Look at them - the tax-cutting party that gave us the biggest tax rises in peacetime history; the law-and-order party that doubled crime and gave us a Home Secretary in court more often than the people he is supposed to be locking up; the farmer\u2019s party that gave us BSE; the party that set up the Scott Report, then, when it found ministerial deceit, tried to ignore it and would have got away with it but for the brilliance of that man Robin Cook. (Applause)And then Nolan - cash for questions, and this morning more revelations. Do you know, the Tories changed the law to let Mr Hamilton put his case? Well, we will change the law to make the Tories clean up their act. (Applause)To coin a phrase, we will be tough on sleaze and tough on the causes of sleaze. We will ask that Nolan Committee to investigate political funding, and we will legislate so as to make the Tories tell us where the money comes from for these negative and deceitful advertising campaigns. (Applause)I say this, too, to John Major. If he wants to be seen as an honest man, fight an honest campaign. (Applause) By the way, Matthew Harding sends his regards. Here he is, this Prime Minister, so weak, so utterly incapable of stamping his authority on the government he nominally leads, that he has given birth to the first \u2018ism\u2019 in politics to denote not the existence of a political philosophy but the absence of one. \u2018Majorism\u2019 - holding your party together while your country falls apart. (Applause)Still, he has his secret weapon. And I have mine. Kenneth Clarke! Mr Feelgood Factor! Let us tell Kenneth Clarke and John Major, the real feelgood factor will arrive when the people of this country say goodbye to this government for good. (Applause)Time to change. The Tories never did have the best vision for Britain. They just took the best words - freedom, choice, opportunity, aspiration, ambition. I can vividly recall the exact moment that I knew the last election was lost. I was canvassing in the Midlands on an ordinary suburban estate. I met a man polishing his Ford Sierra, self-employed electrician, Dad always voted Labour. He used to vote Labour, he said, but he bought his own home, he had set up his own business, he was doing quite nicely, so he said I\u2019ve become a Tory. He was not rich but he was doing better than he did, and as far as he was concerned, being better off meant being Tory too.In that moment the basis of our failure - the reason why a whole generation has grown up under the Tories - became plain to me. You see, people judge us on their instincts about what they believe our instincts to be. And that man polishing his car was clear: his instincts were to get on in life, and he thought our instincts were to stop him. But that was never our history or our purpose.I know in my own constituency, the miners in 1945 who voted Labour did so so that their sons would not have to go down the pit and work in the conditions that they had. (Applause) And in 1964 their children voted Labour because they saw the next generation\u2019s chance to go to university and do better than their parents had done. The true radical mission of the Labour Party, new and old, is this: not to hold people back but to help them get on - all the people. (Applause)Is that not the essence of what we believe? Each generation doing better than the last, the heritage of hope passed from parents to their children - now, for the first time in this generation, at risk under this Conservative government. Our task is to restore that hope, to build a new age of achievement in a new and different world.Today we compete in the era of global markets, and I say this to our Conservative opponents. There is no future for Britain as a low-wage, low-skill, low-technology economy. (Applause) We will compete on the basis of quality or not at all. This means a stable economy, long-term investment, the enterprise of our people set free.First, let us get the fundamentals right. Look at the Tories - two recessions, one of which wiped out a third of our manufacturing base; borrowed their way into the record books; the pound devalued; North Sea oil money gone; all the money from asset sales gone. It is sometimes said, you know, that the Tories are cruel but they are efficient. In fact, they are the most feckless, irresponsible, incompetent managers of the British economy in this country\u2019s history. (Applause)Labour will be the party of sound finance and good housekeeping. World interest rates and inflation rates are low; in Britain we will keep them this way. There will be defined targets set and kept to. Losing control of public finance is not radical, it is just reckless, and we will not do it. Gordon Brown, the Iron Chancellor (Applause) - it can be a tough job and he does it brilliantly. They say it is easier to get past security at our Conference without a pass than to get a spending commitment past Gordon! And in case anyone is in any doubt, that is how it is going to stay.We need a tax regime, too, though, that is fair and encourages work and business. Sure, the few at the top have become wealthy under the Tories. But they have put up the taxes of ordinary families in Britain by the largest amount in peacetime history. We are not going to add to their burden. Those families have suffered enough. Instead, a new Labour government should be trying to get tax down for the lowest income earners, some of them paying 80-90 per cent marginal tax rates. If incentives through lower tax rates is the key for the director on £200,000 a year, then why should it not work for people on £5,000 or £10,000 a year? (Applause)Next, in this new world many more people will be self employed or in small businesses, and we are going to help them. The Federation of Small Businesses has just welcomed our programme as the basis of a real partnership between a Labour government and small businesses. So move over again the Tories; Labour is the party of small businesses in Britain today. (Applause)We will give Britain the modern, integrated transport network, built in partnership between public and private finance, and restoring a unified system of railways with a publicly-owned, publicly-accountable British Rail at its core. (Applause) Good for Britain and good for business.Leading Britain into an age of achievement means Britain leading in Europe, and for business and for Britain we will build that new, constructive relationship with our European partners. Let me make one thing plain. I will not scrap Britain\u2019s veto in Europe. Our options on a single currency should remain open, to be determined according to our national interest. Any change will only come with the full consent of the people. But make no mistake: leave Europe, or retreat to its sidelines, as these Tories want to do, and this country will lose its influence and its inward investment. It would be a disaster for jobs and for industry. The Tories may glory in perpetual isolation but I say that is not standing up for Britain; that is a betrayal of British interests. (Applause)With a good relationship in Europe we can get more out of it. Britain has the Presidency of the European Union in the first half of 1998. One of our key priorities in that Presidency will be the completion of the single market. Today, even in opposition, I set a deadline - June 1998, the end of the British Presidency, for the completion of the single market in Europe. And I will begin discussions with other European leaders now so that we can get ready to meet that deadline. New opportunities for our firms and new jobs for our people. Our aim is that by the end of the first term of a new Labour government in gas and electricity, in telecommunications, in public procurement, in financial services, we will have a genuine single market in Europe open to British goods and services. That is the way to get the best out of Europe for Britain. (Applause)And a new age of achievement in our industry, too. Support for manufacturing as well as for services; support for research and development, for science and engineering; and a new era of industrial relations in Britain. There will be fairness, not favours, for employers and employees alike. The Labour government today is not the political arm of anyone other than the British people. But let us settle these arguments about industrial laws once and for good. There will be no return to the 70s, but there should and there will be basic civil rights for all at work legislated on early in a Labour government. (Applause)What are they? They are merely the due claim of civilisation - a statutory minimum wage. Like every other industrial country the world over, we will have one under a Labour government in Britain. (Applause) We will be part of the European social chapter, as every other government, Tory or Labour, is in the rest of Europe. There will be a right for any individual to join a trade union (Applause) and if a majority of the workforce wanted, for the union to represent those people. (Applause) Basic human rights.On GCHQ I hear people say we have changed our mind. I have not. I have made a personal commitment to those people to restore their trade union rights in full and I will keep it. (Applause)You applaud, and rightly. But let me tell you something that I believe in the end is even more important. I make a plea to both sides of industry. A couple of weeks ago I visited the JCB plant in Staffordshire. The man who runs it, in the past at least, donated to the Tory party. I don\u2019t give a damn. He has got good union relations there, the work force is valued and invested in, stakeholders in the enterprise, the product is the best. That is the future. We are on the same side, we are in the same team.I visited Raytheon Jets in North Wales, too, not so far from here. A plant which the unions helped, with management, to save from relocation to the United States. I ask in the name of this country\u2019s future - forget the past, no more bosses versus workers - we are on the same side, the same team, and Britain united will win! (Applause)These are the foundations of this new age of achievement. And for all our people it can be made a reality. There is only one lasting route to higher living standards, better wages, more secure jobs in today's world. We will win by our brains and our skills or not at all. In Britain we are still in the 30-30-40 economy: 30 per cent do very well, 30 per cent just getting by, 40 per cent struggling or worse.When the Tories talk about the spirit of enterprise they mean a few self-made millionaires. Well, best of luck to them. But there should be a spirit of enterprise and achievement on the shop floor, in the office as well: in the 16 year-old who starts as an office girl with the realistic chance of ending up as the office manager; in the young graduate with the confidence to take initiatives; in the secretary who takes time out to learn a new language and comes back to search for a new and better job. These people have enterprise within them. They have talent and potential within them. Ask me my three main priorities for government and I tell you: education, education and education. (Applause)The first wonder of the world is the mind of a child. I sometimes sit reading a newspaper, watching TV, and you look up and you see your children at a computer, and you marvel at what they can do, using that computer as easily as we would read a book. Yet we are 35th in the world league of education standards today - 35th. They say give me the boy at seven, I\u2019ll show you the man at 70. Well give me the education system that is 35th in the world today and I will give you the economy that is 35th in the world tomorrow. (Applause)So let us set about this task at every level - radical improvement and reform for our children; a teaching profession trained, able to stand alongside the best in the world and valued as such. No to Tory nursery vouchers, yes to proper nursery places for all our children. (Applause) Tomorrow David Blunkett will set out how to ensure that every primary school child leaves school able to read to the adequate standard. (Applause) A literacy guaranteed by establishing three-week intensive literacy summer schools for all those falling behind, with the aim of ensuring that every 11 year-old is up to the standard in reading and adding up that they need.It is a choice of priorities, isn\u2019t it? The Tories choose to spend those millions of pounds on the assisted places scheme to subsidise a small number of children at private school. Under Labour that scheme will be phased out, that money will be used to make sure that every five, six and seven-year-old is in a class of a size of 30 or under. Those are the priorities for us. (Applause)There will be no return to the 11-plus. The comprehensive system will stay, modernised for today\u2019s world. (Applause) Modernised, taking account of children\u2019s different abilities but not setting them apart. Continual assessment, targets set, instant action where they are not met. There should be zero tolerance of failure in Britain\u2019s schools. That is if we want to be serious about our task. I will tell you my vision of the future. I would like a state education system in Britain so good, so attractive, that the parents choose to put behind us the educational apartheid of the past, private and state, and I do not believe anything would do more to break down the class divides that have no place in a modern country in the 21st century. (Applause)Education should not be about wealth. And the age of achievement will be built on the new technology. Last year I announced an agreement with British Telecom to cable up schools, colleges, universities, libraries to the information superhighway for free. To their credit, the cable companies have followed suit. That was an historic beginning. But it was only a beginning. Today we go further. The cable industry and British Telecom have now given us a commitment to keep costs to our schools for access to the Internet and superhighway as low and as predictable as possible, and they have given a commitment to achieve real reductions in prices for those schools.We have agreed with them to put this into practice. So we have got the wires, we have got the low-cost connections. But now we need more - the hardware, the computers themselves. In January, again even in opposition, we appointed Dennis Stevenson, a leading businessman in the country, to chair a commission of independent experts to examine how we get that computer hardware and the training for teachers to use it. His final report, to be published later this year, will lay down the third building block to show how in time no child will be without access to a computer and no school unable to use them properly.The cables for free, the connections at low cost, plans for computers, and then the final piece. What matters in the end is the educational material that comes down from those cables into those computers and into the mind of the child. Just as schools have to buy books, they will pay for the various courses and services on offer. But we are going to make sure the quality is high. Competition will ensure that prices are low. In government we will be inviting bids for a franchise to provide the specialised education network that the superhighway needs. Our aim is for every school to have access to the information superhighway, the computers to deliver it, the education programmes to go on it. With the university for industry, for adult skills, this adds up to a national grid for learning for Britain. That is the age of achievement come alive. (Applause)Just think of it - Britain, the skills superpower of the world. Why not? Why can\u2019t we do it? Achievement, aspiration fulfilled for all our people. Because a great people equals a Great Britain. Run a country where a few winners take all rather than all of us as winners, and see what happens. It is not right, it is not in people\u2019s interests. Huge costs of unemployment, crime, social decay, higher taxes to pay for it. Welfare bills doubled under the Tories, even as poverty rises. And the type of society we have - what kind of world is it where fathers who do not work have sons who do not work, where the young take to drugs and the debased culture of despair because no job beckons on leaving school? What kind of world is it where there are more second homes but more homeless and the streets paved with fear? (Applause) What kind of world is it where the best education, jobs and skills are available only to the few? It is a world in which some can succeed. But I ask you, is it a world of which anyone can be proud? That, Mr Major, is the moral question of our times. (Applause)When I was growing up the family was strong, the sense of social responsibility was strong, crime was low. There was a national ethos and spirit that had won us the war and stayed with us in peace. What was strong then is fragile now. National purpose faltering, our feeling of collective responsibility starved of expression, the family unsupported. It is right to want to get on. It is right to want to do well. But if all we have is what we own, not what we share, we are all the losers for it. (Applause)Today I offer you, and we offer the country, a new vision. If we are to build this new age of achievement, you and I and all of us together must build first the decent society to deliver it. A society in which every individual is valued, every person given the chance to fulfil their potential; a society to which we contribute and which then contributes to us; a society based not on outdated prejudices but on the common duty of humanity, our belief that we owe an obligation to each other to improve the lives of us all; a society of opportunity; a society of responsibility; a society which gives to us because we give to that society. History will call it the decent society, the new age of achievement in Britain.These will be its principles. We will respect family life. We will develop it and encourage it in any way that we can, for strong families are the foundation of strong communities. We will provide opportunities for those without. As a first step, we will implement a Programme to take 250,000 young people off benefit and into work, funded by a one-off windfall levy on the excess profits of the privatised monopoly utilities. (Applause)  We will put a roof over the heads of the homeless by releasing those capital receipts from the sale of council houses and let homes be built for our people. (Applause) We will cherish and enhance the environment, ease congestion, reduce pollution, develop our quality of life, and in the countryside as much as cities and towns.In return for those opportunities, responsibility. I am proud that new Labour has taken the mantle of the party of law and order in Britain today. (Applause) I began that process, Jack Straw has carried it on. I simply say to people who tell us it is wrong to want to crack down on violent crime, drug pushers, anti-social neighbours, hooligans - try living next door to them. (Applause)It is the weak and the vulnerable who suffer most from crime. So we will be tough on the causes of crime, but tough on crime too. You saw in that film review of the year the day when John Major and I visited Dunblane together. It was a searing, chilling and dreadful day. Conservative MPs complain that our response has been emotional. If they had been in that gym, if they had talked to those parents, sitting on those tiny chairs where once their children had sat, they would have been emotional, too. I believe that we should ban the private ownership and possession of handguns. (Applause)We will do more. We will give the disabled the civil rights that the Tories have denied them. Nobody should be excluded from this age of achievement. We will work with the voluntary sector, and tomorrow David Blunkett will announce our plans for a national network of millennium volunteers.We will provide security in old age. Let me say this to you: previous Labour governments did their duty by British pensioners, and so will the next Labour government. (Applause) The review that we have announced will be set up under a Labour government on the terms we have announced to see how we fulfil that duty for modern times. It will review also the whole issue of community care where those elderly people have to sell their homes to pay the cost of nursing care. (Applause) That I can say. But I will not make promises on money until I know they can be kept. That is our guiding rule; there can be no exceptions to it, and I ask you to understand that. Making promises we do not keep does not help anybody. (Applause)One thing I can promise to pensioners and to everyone else gladly - gladly. The next Labour government will scrap the Tory internal market of the National Health Service and will improve and renew the health service as a decent public service for the people. (Applause) Now you can see why it is worth winning, why it is worth making a difference. No more hospitals fighting hospitals. No more doctor competing with doctor. No more bogus red tape and expensive bureaucracy, and, in place of a Tory who does not care about the health service, Chris Smith, who does. (Applause) And we will improve it, not just keep it as it is. Of course things will be done in a different way. It is a new world. There is no switching the clock back on anything. New challenges, new ideas. But ours can be, and will be, a great radical, reforming government, giving Britain the welfare state it needs in the 21st century.The great reforms should not stop with the welfare state. Let us modernise government itself so that it serves the interests of the people. (Applause) Not bigger government; better government. So local people decide how to run local services. A parliament for Scotland, an assembly for Wales, legislated for in the first year of a Labour government. And let me say this to you - achievable precisely because we will have the clear consent of the Scottish and Welsh people before doing it. (Applause) A directly elected authority for London, our capital city. (Applause) Local democracy reborn, the quango state in the dustbin of history where it belongs. (Applause)More than that. Today I can make another announcement on our plans for the National Lottery. It has been a great success, but has all the money gone to good causes? No. We want to fund specific environment, education and public health projects through the proceeds of the National Lottery. I want the people\u2019s money to go on the people's priorities. (Applause) Equipping all our teachers to use the new technology that will improve children\u2019s education; working with the voluntary sector; insulating homes; supporting national talent and potential; reclaiming public space for pedestrians. The millennium stream of lottery money, one-fifth of the total, should be focused on giving Britain a head start in the 21st century, and under us it will be.There is more that we can do with government. If Clem Attlee came back today he would think pretty much everything was changed, including a few things about this, I suppose. But not the way that we run government or Parliament. We spend £300 billion a year in the public sector. But a lot of what government does is not about helping us achieve; it is actually stopping us achieving. If you are a young person, for example, leaving school, leaving home, looking for a job, you have to contact 11 government offices, not one. Finding care for an elderly relative can take four stops, not one. It can take you two weeks to get your first Income Support payment, and then one in seven will be wrong. It takes a month to get your first Child Benefit cheque. A small engineering firm in Blackpool spends as much on dealing with inspectors as it would hiring an extra member of staff. And it is getting worse.The fraud in the system? Probably as much as £8 billion a year or more. We will therefore make it a priority to introduce a programme to reform this system of government. Our aim is to co-ordinate services across government departments, using the advantages of the technology now available to provide a modern and up-to-date service for the customers of the state. Government for the people, not government for government. (Applause)But we should reform Parliament too. One reform we have already achieved - more women Members of Parliament than ever before. (Applause) Another we can - reforming Prime Minister\u2019s Question Time so that it actually does Parliament credit; ending the greatest symbol of privilege of any democracy in the world by ensuring that hereditary peers are not voting in the House of Lords. (Applause)We will clean up the political funding in Britain. It is surely right we know where these types of money come from. I simply say that it is important that we ensure that everyone recognises their responsibility to make our politics better.The age of achievement, at home and abroad. We will be strong in defence, in NATO, with our allies the United States; we will be the bridge across the Atlantic between them and Europe. But we will also fight for democracy and civil rights the world over. (Applause) There is no greater pride to me than our total unequivocal, unrelenting battle to end apartheid and see Nelson Mandela freed from his chains. So we salute the Bob Hugheses, the Joan Lestors, the Neil and Glenys Kinnocks who played their part in that, and we put to one side the nausea we felt at those Tories who had propped up apartheid and worn shirts calling for Nelson Mandela to be hanged - yes, hanged - then flocked to be seen with him. (Applause)Imagine Britain a leading player in Europe once more, a force for good promoting democracy and civil rights and free trade between nations, dealing with the debt burden at the heart of any strategy for overseas development, helping fashion the United Nations and the institutions of international co-operation for a new world.It can happen. It can happen. The British people want change; I am sure of that. But they need to trust us. I want them to trust us.Recently, the boss of one of Britain\u2019s biggest and most successful companies said to me that companies do not just have prospectuses, they have performance contracts too: a contract that sets out targets and priorities and allows public and company to measure success or failure. And he dared me to publish a performance contract for a new Labour government. Today I do that. These are the vows that I make to my country.By the end of the term of a five-year Labour government:This is my covenant with the British people. Judge me upon it. The buck stops here. For the future, not the past, for the many, not the few, for trust, not betrayal, for the age of achievement, not the age of decline - that is my covenant with the British people.I can make this promise - I can make it because you have helped me transform our party into a great party of reform for the modern age. Four hundred thousand members, and growing! A new constitution that we can actually, leader included, quote in our speeches. A party open and in touch. New Labour, new members. And I am proud of them. But let me say this to you. I don\u2019t forget that this party only survived for new members to join because the old members stuck with it through thick and thin. (Applause)Let me try to explain this to you. I was not born Labour, I became Labour. When you look back on your past you try to think of the things that shaped you. My father was a very ambitious man. He was ambition personified, successful, he was a go-getter. One morning I woke to be told that he had had a stroke in the middle of the night and might not live through the day. My whole world then fell apart. And it taught me something. It taught me the value of the family, because my mother worked for three years to help him talk and walk again. But it taught me something else too. When that happened the fair-weather friends went; that is not unusual. But the real friends, the true friends, stayed with us; they helped us and they stuck with us for no other reason than that it was the right thing to do.I do not pretend to you that I had a deprived childhood; I did not. But I learned a sense of values in my childhood. A year ago or more, John Prescott and I went up to Sam McCluskie\u2019s funeral. A lot of you will remember Sam McCluskie, he was a great guy, great stalwart of the Labour movement. I think it would be fair to say that we did not always absolutely agree on everything! And as I left the church service, one of the sisters came up to me and pressed a little strip of red ribbon into my hand - it is something I keep with me still - and said this is a keepsake that Sam used to have and I want you to have it. I was embarrassed and I turned round to her and said look, I didn\u2019t know Sam that well and, quite honestly, a lot of the time we didn\u2019t see eye to eye. And she said to me I know that, but in your souls you want the same thing, a better world.That is it. That is what we believe in. Yes, we are a democratic socialist party. Indeed, it says so in the words of Clause IV, the new Clause IV, the one I drafted and the party overwhelmingly supported. (Applause) But it stands in a tradition bigger than that - bigger than European social democracy, bigger than any \u2018ism,\u2019 bigger than any of us. It stands in a tradition whose flame was alive in human hearts long before the Labour Party was ever thought of; a tradition far above ideology but not beyond ideals.We are not a sect or a cult. We are part of the broad movement of human progress, the marriage of ambition with justice, the constant striving of the human spirit to do better, to be better. It is that which separates us from the Conservatives. And it was there long ago, there even when the ancient prophets of the Old Testament first pleaded the cause of the marginal, the powerless, the disenfranchised. It was there when Wilberforce fought the slave trade against the vested interests of Tory money. It was there when the trade union movement began as an instrument against abuse in the work place. It was there when the young Jack Jones went to fight in the Spanish civil war for another people\u2019s freedom out of nothing more than the goodness of his heart. (Applause)It was there when we said, having conquered the evil of Hitler, that the welfare state must be built so that the destitution of the 30s never returned to our country. And it is here now, in this room, as we build around the Labour Party the new force for progress in British politics to bring in the new age of achievement for all our people. A thousand days - yes - to prepare for that thousand years.Consider a thousand years of British history and what it tells us. The first parliament of the world, the industrial revolution ahead of its time, an empire, the largest the world has ever known, relinquished in peace, the invention of virtually every scientific device of the modern world, two World Wars in which our country was bled dry, in which two generations perished but which in the defeat of the most evil force ever let loose by man showed the most sustained example of bravery in human history.This is our nation, our characteristics - common sense, standing up for the underdog, fiercely independent. But the outstanding British quality is courage - not just physical bravery but the courage to think anew, to break convention when convention is holding us back, to innovate while others conform; to do it our way. I say to the British people: have the courage to change now. We are coming home to you. We are back as the party of the people, and that is why the people are coming back to us. When Alan Howarth has the courage to tear up the ties of a lifetime because he can no longer stomach today\u2019s Tory party and he sees his home as new Labour, I say welcome to him, and welcome to those others. (Applause)When businessmen say to me, \u2018Tony, I never thought I\u2019d be doing this but here\u2019s a big cheque to help you beat the most dishonest, negative campaign in history,\u2019 I say thank you to them. We need that. (Applause) And when former Tory voters write and tell me they never thought in a million years that they would vote Labour but they hate the Tories and they think we are worth more than a shot, I write back and say welcome, thank you. Thank you for giving us that chance. Thank you for seeing the changes we have made are real. Thank you for having the courage to change your vote. And when a 76 year-old widow from Liverpool, a party member since before I was born, sends me a Christmas card that says \u2018Tony, please, for me, win,\u2019 then I tell you we have a duty to win, a duty for her and millions like her. (Applause)I don\u2019t care where you are coming from; it is where your country is going that matters. If you believe in what I believe, then join our team. Labour has come home to you, so come home to us. Labour\u2019s coming home! (Applause) Seventeen years of hurt never stopped us dreaming. Labour\u2019s coming home! (Applause) As we did in 1945 and 1964, I know that was then, but it could be again \u2013 Labour\u2019s coming home. (Applause) Labour\u2019s coming home.The people are coming home. Because Britain is their team and they are part of it, and they know that if we unleash the potential of our people Britain comes alive with the new energy, the new ideas, the new leadership, and Britain can take on the world and win. We will be envied throughout the world, not just because of our castles and our palaces and our glorious history, but because we gave back that heritage of hope to the generations, we turned round this country by the will of the people in unity with the party of the people, and we built this age of achievement in our lifetime.This is our mission for Britain today. We knew we could do better. And we did. We knew we could be better, we the Labour Party. And we are. Britain, too, can do better. Britain can be better than this. A thousand days to prepare for a thousand years - not just turning a page in history but writing a new book, building the greatness of our nation through the greatness of its people. Think of the possibility of change. No more squandering the nation\u2019s assets. No more sleaze. No more cash for questions. No more lies. No more broken promises. I say to the Tories: enough is enough! Be done, be gone! (Applause) The glory days of Britain are not over, but the Tory days of government are. (Applause)We have the programme. We have the people to make decent change in our country. Let us call our nation now to its destiny. Let us lead it to our new age of achievement and build for us, for our children, their children, a Britain - a Britain united to win in the 21st century. (Prolonged applause)

aVAfter 18 long years of Opposition, of frustration and despair, I am proud, privileged, to stand before you as the new Labour Prime Minister of our country. I believe in Britain. I believe in the British people. One cross on the ballot paper. One nation was reborn.Today I want to set an ambitious course for this country. To be nothing less than the model 21st century nation, a beacon to the world. It means drawing deep into the richness of the British character. Creative. Compassionate. Outward-looking. Old British values, but a new British confidence. We can never be the biggest. We may never again be the mightiest. But we can be the best. The best place to live. The best place to bring up children, the best place to lead a fulfilled life, the best place to grow old.14 years ago our Party was written off as history. This year we made it. Let our first thanks be to the British people. You kept faith with us. And we will keep faith with you. Thank you to the Party organisation, the volunteers, the professionals who fashioned the finest political fighting machine anywhere in the world. And thanks to those that led before me. To Neil Kinnock: the mantle of Prime Minister was never his. But I know that without him, it would never have been mine. To John Smith: who left us a fine legacy, and to whom we can now leave a fitting monument - a Scottish Parliament in the city where he lived, serving the country he loved and the people who loved him. To Jim Callaghan: who was attending Labour Party Conferences before I was born; and by the look of him, will be attending long after I\u2019ve gone. My own debt of honour to Michael Foot: you led this Party when, frankly, it was incapable of being led and without ever losing a shred of your decency or your integrity. Thank you.I should also say a final word of thanks to the Tory Party. Let\u2019s be honest, we\u2019d never have done so well without them. So thanks to Michael Howard, to John Redwood, to Peter Lilley, to Brian Mawhinney. Of course, it\u2019s a fresh start now - with Michael Howard, John Redwood, Peter Lilley, Brian Mawhinney. Sorry \u2013 \u2018Sir\u2019 Brian Mawhinney - knighted for services to the Conservative Party. John Prescott wanted to give him a peerage - for services to the Labour Party.As for Government, well, it beats the hell out of Opposition. They really do say \u2018Yes, Prime Minister.\u2019 You have to learn a whole new language. They\u2019re not in the habit of calling anything a good idea, which given the last 18 years is hardly surprising. When they describe a proposal as \u2018ambitious,\u2019 or, even worse, \u2018interesting,\u2019 what they really mean is they think it was a stupid idea, dreamed up at the last minute for the manifesto. When they describe it as \u2018challenging,\u2019 they mean there's not a hope in hell of making it work. And when they say of a policy \u2018that it really is quite a brave proposal Prime Minister,\u2019 it means they\u2019ve got the doctor outside waiting to sign the certificates and they\u2019ve just applied for a transfer to a senior job administering one of our few remaining dependent territories.It\u2019s not the titles and the cars and the trappings that make government worthwhile. It\u2019s letters like this from 11 year old Emma O\u2019Brien from Ellesmere Port. \u2018Summer School was a good idea. I have started to read more books. I have learned more spellings. We\u2019ve had fun. All of us have made new friends. I think you and parliament have done the right thing. I have got a better education.\u2019 Or this one from Mrs Patricia Lewis, of South London. \u2018Each afternoon I collected him from school. By the fourth day the change was showing in Stephen. His enthusiasm grew, confidence gained, his ability to read, write, spell, speak, and question politely, was amazing.\u2019 That is why we are here. That is what made winning worth the fight.Ours was not a victory of politicians but of people. The people took their trust, and gave it to us. I want them to say, this week as they watch us here in Brighton: we did the right thing. I want the British people to be as proud of having elected us as we are to serve them. We won because we are New Labour, because we had the courage to change ourselves, and the discipline to take hard decisions, whilst remaining united. The lessons we learned in Opposition we carry on applying in Government. The moment we stop that is the moment we will stop being in government. Even now, especially now, no complacency.I know I\u2019m obsessive about this. But I will admit now that I perhaps went over the top when I phoned Millbank Tower on election night to say people were behaving as though it was in the bag. \u2018Look,\u2019 I was told, \u2018We\u2019ve got 150 seats. The Tories have got 6. It\u2019s hard to persuade the media this thing\u2019s on a knife edge.\u2019 But still, no complacency.May 1st was the beginning, not the end. We have never won two full consecutive terms of office. Never. That is one more record I want to break. No cockiness about the Tories even now. They\u2019re not dead. Just sleeping.Let their fate serve as a warning to us. What the people give, the people can take away. We are the servants. They are the masters now. To govern Britain is a privilege not a right. Never forget it.Last year we were talking about what we would do. This year we\u2019re doing it. That ten point contract with the British people - we are honouring.We said we would get more money into schools and hospitals. We have - 2.2 billion more than Tories planned to spend next year.We said we\u2019d sign the Social Chapter. We did.We said we\u2019d restore trade unions at GCHQ. On May 19, free and independent trade unions came back to GCHQ.We said we\u2019d set up a Low Pay Commission. We have, and the national minimum wage is on its way.We said we\u2019d legislate to release the money from selling council homes in order to house the homeless. We\u2019ve done it.We said we\u2019d cut class sizes, by scrapping the Assisted Places Scheme. The law to do it has been passed.We\u2019ve given the people of Scotland and Wales the devolution referendums we promised, and they have voted: yes, yes, and yes again.We said we\u2019d reform the Lottery to address the people\u2019s priorities. We have, and today more proposals on how we'll reform it further and get more money to more local projects, the length and breadth of Britain, preparing for the millennium.We said we\u2019d cut VAT on fuel. We have.We never said we\u2019d cut corporation tax. But we did anyway, to the lowest level it\u2019s ever been. And we have brought Britain's top business brains right into the heart of Government.And we said we\u2019d force the water companies to give a better deal to their customers. A few hours of quiet diplomacy by Mr John Prescott did the necessary, and the companies did the business.We owed a debt to the people of Dunblane. We said MPs would vote to ban handguns. MPs have had that vote. The people have spoken. Parliament has spoken. Handguns are banned. We have honoured our debt.We said we\u2019d ban landmines. They\u2019re banned in Britain and we\u2019ll keep working until they are banned the world over.Of all we have done, ask me what has taken the most time, the most effort, it\u2019s probably Northern Ireland. There is no tougher job in Government than Northern Ireland Secretary, and there is no better person to do it than Mo Mowlam. The effort has been worth it. The cease-fire has been renewed. Republicans and Unionists are talking for the first time since 1921. There is a long, long way to go. Every step is fragile. But in the name of humanity, I ask that ancient enmities be put aside. Talking is no treachery. Agreeing is no betrayal. The real betrayal would be to let violence take the place of democracy in Northern Ireland again.But I want to do more than keep our promises. I sense the British people demand more of us, too. People ask me the highlight of the election. Mine was driving from home to Buckingham Palace, along streets we had driven hundreds of times, past soulless buildings and sullen faces on their way to work. This drive was so different. As we turned into Gower Street, people watching our journey on TV came pouring out of the doorways, waving and shouting and clapping, with an energy and excitement that went beyond anything I imagined would happen. They were liberated. Theirs were the smiles of tolerant, broad-minded, outward-looking, compassionate people and suddenly they learned that they were in the majority after all. As one woman put it to me: \u2018We\u2019ve got our Government back.\u2019 And with them I could sense confidence returning to the British people, compassion to the British soul, unity to the British nation, and that all three would give us new-found strength. The people were yearning for change in their country, at a time when they could see we had had the guts to modernise our party. The two came together. The result is a quiet revolution now taking place. Led by the real modernisers - the British people.The size of our victory imposes a very special responsibility on us. To be a government of high ideals and hard choices. Not popular for one time but remembered for all time. Not just a better government than the Tories but one of the great, radical, reforming Governments of our history. To modernise Britain as we modernised the Labour Party. To build a Britain, not for a few, but for all the people. And it will require change. Hard choices. I know this country can make them if we show how and why.The British don\u2019t fear change. We are one of the great innovative peoples. From the Magna Carta to the first Parliament to the industrial revolution to an empire that covered the world; most of the great inventions of modern times with Britain stamped on them: the telephone; the television; the computer; penicillin; the hovercraft; radar. Change is in the blood and bones of the British we are by our nature and tradition innovators, adventurers, pioneers. As our great poet of renewal and recovery, John Milton, put it, we are \u2018A nation not slow or dull, but of quick, ingenious and piercing spirit, acute to invent, subtle and sinewy to discourse, not beneath the reach of any point that human capacity can soar to.\u2019Even today, we lead the world, in design, pharmaceuticals, financial services, telecommunications. We have the world\u2019s first language. Britain today is an exciting, inspiring place to be. And it can be much more. If we face the challenge of a world with its finger on the fast forward button; where every part of the picture of our life is changing. Today I say to the British people: the chains of mediocrity have broken, the tired days are behind us, we are free to excel once more. We are free to build that model 21st Century nation, to become that beacon to the world.Creative. Compassionate. Confident of our place in the world.And when people say sorry, that\u2019s too ambitious, it can\u2019t be done, I say: this is not a sorry country, we are not a sorry people. It can be done. We know what makes a successful creative economy. Educate the people. Manage the country\u2019s finances well. Encourage business and enterprise. But each bit requires us to modernise and take the hard choices to do it. We have been a mercantile power. An industrial power. Now we must be the new power of the information age. Our goal: to make Britain the best educated and skilled country in the world; a nation, not of a few talents, but of all the talents. And every single part of our schools system must be modernised to achieve it.Nearly 40 per cent of 11 year olds can\u2019t read, write or add up properly. 42nd in the world education league. This is the scandalous legacy not just of 18 years of Tory Government but of a country too often content to educate the elite and ignore education for all. Education, education, education. Remember? In just 5 months, we made a remarkable beginning, under the brilliant leadership of David Blunkett. But we will do more.Equipping our schoolsWe are publishing today details of agreements involving Government and the private sector, for the biggest public/private partnership in any education system, anywhere in the world, which will mean:By 2002 every one of the 32,000 schools in Britain will have modern computers, the educational programmes to go on them, the teachers skilled to teach on them, the pupils skilled to use them, connected to the superhighway for free and with phone bills slashed to as low as £1 per pupil per year.We are setting a new target of £2 billion for this parliament for our school repairs and equipment programme. A list of the first 2,300 schools to benefit is being published today. The money is being allocated today. One of the head-teachers is here with us. By 2002 up to 10,000 schools will have benefited.Getting the basics rightWe are launching the biggest assault on poor literacy and numeracy standards this country has seen. We are setting a target of 80% up to the standard in literacy, 75% for numeracy by the year 2002, and we\u2019ll keep on until every 11 year old in every school in every part of Britain gets the start in life that they deserve. And I repeat the promise I made at the election, that over the lifetime of this parliament, we will reverse the Tory policy of cutting spending on education as a proportion of our national income and raise it once again, beginning with £1billion extra next year.Nursery vouchers have gone and instead we\u2019ll get nursery places for all four year olds and we\u2019re on the way to places for all three year olds too. The money will be there, but in return hard choices and modernisation. No failure. No muddling through. No second best. High standards. The pursuit of excellence. Discipline and leadership. Support from home. Not for some children in some schools. But for all children in all schools. Each school that needs it, and every LEA, will be set targets for improvement. Failing schools and LEAs will be taken over. Teacher training will be reformed. Head teachers will have a proper qualification. Poor teachers will go.People say my job\u2019s pressurised. So is teaching. And don\u2019t let anybody think that we are tough on bad teaching because we don\u2019t value teachers. We are tough on bad teachers precisely because we DO value good teachers who need high quality teachers working alongside them. And parents have to play their part. There will be home school contracts for all pupils. Sign them. There will be new measures to tackle truancy and disruptive children, new homework requirements. Support them. When a school disciplines a child, back the teacher. The high ideal of the best schools in the world. Reached through hard choices.Universities in Britain had their funding cut by 40% per student under the Tories. The science and research base - once the envy of the world - under threat. The Tories put a cap on student numbers. Only 30% of youngsters in Britain admitted to go to university. Fewer not just than France or the USA, but fewer than South Korea. The hard choice: stay as we are and decline. Or modernise and win. Under our proposals, no parent will have to pay more. Low income families will be entirely exempt from tuition fees. All students will repay only as they can afford to.And if we reform, I am going to pledge to you, that by the end of this parliament, we will put resources saved through reform into frontline provision in universities and further education; and the first 165 million pounds is already in next year\u2019s budgets. We will lift the cap on student numbers and set a target for an extra 500,000 people into higher and further education by 2002. Our education system - a beacon to the world.Within days of taking office, we took one of the hardest choices of all: we gave the Bank of England the right to decide interest rates and take the politics out of mortgages. And in the short term it\u2019s tough. Interest rates have gone up. But I say to people, better to go up now, still only by 1%, than to go back to the days of the last Tory government when mortgages were at 15% for a year, 1 million homes in negative equity, a whole swathe of industry wiped out. We are cutting the Tory deficit too. We are sorting out the public finances. Borrow only for investment. Hold debt down. Earn before you spend. Don\u2019t live on tick. I want this to be the New Labour Government that ended Tory boom and bust for ever.Twenty years ago, the IMF came to bury us. Now they come to praise us. Yes, new Labour\u2019s got new friends everywhere. I want Britain to be a country of enterprise and ambition where small businesses grow, manufacturing and engineering revive, where we learn the lessons of British industrial relations over the past 100 years. Fairness at work yes. But flexibility will remain. For business, this will be a Government on your side not in your way. And I say to both sides of industry, there is no place for militant trade unionism or uncaring management today. Partnership is the key. That is the only language this New Labour Government will respect.It\u2019s pretty simple the type of country I want. It\u2019s a country where our children are proud and happy to grow up in, feeling good not just about themselves, but about the community around them. I don\u2019t want them living in a country where some of them go to school, hungry, unable to learn because their parents can\u2019t afford to feed them; where they can see drugs being traded at school gates; where gangs of teenagers hang around street corners, nothing to do, but spit and swear and abuse passers-by; I don\u2019t want them brought up in a country where the only way pensioners can get long-term care is by selling their home, where people who fought to keep that country free are now faced every winter with the struggle for survival, skimping and saving, cold and alone, waiting for death to take them. And I will not rest until that country is gone and all our children live in a Britain where no child goes hungry, the young are employed, and the old are cherished and valued to the end of their days.But let me spell out some facts. After eighteen years of Tory Government, of cuts and closures, of declining public services, the country was taxed more than under the last Labour Government. This country, any country, will not just carry on paying out more in taxes and getting less. Our new society will have the same values as it ever did. Fighting poverty and unemployment. Securing justice and opportunity. It should be a compassionate society. But it is compassion with a hard edge. A strong society cannot be built on soft choices. It means fundamental reform of our welfare state, of the deal between citizen and society. It means getting money out of social breakdown and into schools and hospitals where we want to see it.The new welfare state must encourage work, not dependency. We are giving young people and the long-term unemployed the opportunity. A £3.5 billion investment. We are adding today the option of self employment as part of the new deal. But they have to take one of the options on offer. We want single mothers with school age children at least to visit a job centre, not just stay at home waiting for the benefit cheque every week until the children are sixteen. Modern welfare means a better balance between public and private money. We need to invest more as a country in savings and pensions. But government\u2019s role is going to be to organise provision - like new stakeholder pensions not fund it all through ever-higher taxes. And our number one duty is to get help to the poorest pensioners first.Housing benefit, in some areas, is virtually designed for fraud. It has to change. We will not be that beacon to the world in the year 2005 with a welfare state built for the very different world of 1945. Our tax system should reward hard work. In the 80s the Tories took down high marginal tax rates for high earners. It is time we did the same for Britain\u2019s working poor.And the same drive for reform applies to the NHS. I\u2019m tired of hearing the NHS described as if it were a relic. It isn\u2019t. It was the greatest act of modernisation any Labour Government ever did. My vision is not just to save the NHS but make it better. The money will be there. I promise you that. This year. Every year. Millions saved from red tape, millions more into breast cancer treatment already. The values will remain. From next April, the two-tier NHS of the Tories will go. And I tell you. I will never countenance an NHS that departs from its fundamental principle of health care based on need not wealth. The hospitals will be built. 14 of them, the biggest hospital building programme in the history of the NHS. It will mean an extra £1.3 billion in 14 towns and cities serving 5 million people. And as of today, it is 15.But money is not the only problem with healthcare in Britain. The NHS itself needs modernisation and hard choices.We appointed the first Minister for Public Health because the NHS should not lose millions every year because of avoidable illnesses like those from smoking. Barriers between GPs, social services and hospitals must be broken down. Hospitals cannot stand still. Increasingly, general hospitals will provide routine care, supported by specialist centres of excellence in treatment, research and education. GPs and nurses will do more of what hospitals used to do, often working on the same site in partnership with chemists, dentists, opticians and physiotherapists.New technology offers huge opportunities in healthcare but we haven\u2019t yet begun to seize them properly. We will get the money in. But in return, I want reform. From next April, there will be up to ten specially-funded Health Action Zones set up in Britain. Their remit: to experiment with new ideas in the way healthcare is delivered, so that patients get a better deal from their health service for the 21st century. The NHS was a beacon to the world in 1948. I want it to be so again. It will always be safe with us. But I want it to be better with us.I say to the country in all honesty. You can have the education revolution, the health revolution, the welfare revolution. But it means hard choices. It means us all getting involved. And it means modernisation. And we need to bring a change to the way we treat each other. I tell you: a decent society is not based on rights. It is based on duty. Our duty to each other. To all should be given opportunity, from all responsibility demanded. The duty to show respect and tolerance to others. I make no apology. I back zero tolerance on crime. I back powers to tackle anti-social neighbours; to make parents responsible for their children; to overhaul the youth justice system so that youngsters stop thinking they can commit a crime, get a caution and carry on being a criminal. At every level of the fight against crime - today acting on serious organised crime - this New Labour Government is taking it on. It will take time. And it will be tough. But to those who say it\u2019s all a threat to our civil liberties, I say the threat to civil liberties is of women afraid to go out, and pensioners afraid to stay at home, because of crime and the fear of crime, and we\u2019re going to help them.And we cannot say we want a strong and secure society when we ignore its very foundation: family life. This is not about preaching to individuals about their private lives. It is addressing a huge social problem. Attitudes have changed. The world has changed. But I am a modern man leading a modern country and this is a modern crisis. Nearly 100,000 teenage pregnancies every year. Elderly parents with whom families cannot cope. Children growing up without role models they can respect and learn from. More and deeper poverty. More crime. More truancy. More neglect of educational opportunities. And above all more unhappiness. I give you this pledge. Every area of this Government\u2019s policy will be scrutinised to see how it affects family life. Every policy examined, every initiative tested, every avenue explored to see how we strengthen our families and there will be a Ministerial group to drive it through.Don\u2019t think we\u2019re asking everyone to change but not Government itself. We will publish a White Paper in the new year for what we call Simple Government, to cut the bureaucracy of Government and improve its service. We are setting a target that within five years, one quarter of dealings with Government can be done by a member of the public electronically through their television, telephone or computer. Our politics are being reformed. We will deliver the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly after one hundred years of trying, and I say to the House of Lords, before it is reformed, don\u2019t try to wreck this legislation: we have the votes of the people, you\u2019ve got the votes of nobody.We will have a strategic authority and elected Mayor for London if the people vote for it. I can announce to you we are going to bring forward a Bill to ban foreign donations to political parties and to compel all parties to make contributions above £5,000 public. And we will ask the Nolan Committee to look at the wider question of Party funding. At the next election all political parties will at last compete on a level playing field. And I know some of you are a bit nervous about what I am doing with the Liberal Democrats. Though not half as nervous as they are. Since this is a day for honesty, I\u2019ll tell you: my heroes aren\u2019t just Ernie Bevin, Nye Bevan and Attlee. They are also Keynes, Beveridge, Lloyd George. Division among radicals almost one hundred years ago resulted in a 20th century dominated by Conservatives. I want the 21st century to be the century of the radicals.We cannot be a beacon to the world unless the talents of all the people shine through. Not one black High Court Judge; not one black Chief Constable or Permanent Secretary. Not one black Army officer above the rank of Colonel. Not one Asian either. Not a record of pride for the British establishment. And not a record of pride for the British Parliament that there are so few black and Asian MPs. I am against positive discrimination. But there is no harm in reminding ourselves just how much negative discrimination there is.On taking office, we discovered that the last Government planned to cut from £83m to £43m the Home Office section 11 budget and make redundant 7,000 teachers and classroom assistants who help children for whom English is a second language. Today I announce; that Tory cut will not stand. I\u2019ll tell you why. That money is not a cost, it is an investment. And it\u2019s one a civilised nation should make. A nation tolerant and open. Free from prejudice but not from rules. A beacon for good at home and abroad. There is huge interest in Britain now. Because people know that this is a country changing for the better. A go-ahead place. The gates of xenophobia falling down. This Government can be the Government of enlightened patriotism.Again my vision for post-Empire Britain is clear. It is to make this country pivotal, a leader in the world. To use the strengths of our history to build our future. With the US our friend and ally. Within the Commonwealth. In the United Nations. In NATO. To use the superb reputation of our Armed Forces, not just for defence, but as an instrument of influence in a world of collective security and cooperation. And to lead in Europe again. Not so that we \u2018don't get left behind.\u2019 That is a weak reason. It is because for four centuries or more, we have been a leading power in Europe. And we have at times been absolutely critical to the survival of not just Europe but the world. It is our destiny.And Europe needs us. For we have a vision of Europe. We want a people\u2019s Europe: free trade, industrial strength, high levels of employment and social justice, democratic. Against that vision is the bureaucrat\u2019s Europe: the Europe of thwarting open trade, unnecessary rules and regulations, the Europe of the C.A.P. and the endless committees leading nowhere. But we cannot shape Europe unless we matter in Europe. I know there will be a hard choice to come over a single currency. And our policy, based on the British national interest, remains unchanged. But in or out, we will be affected by it and must remain able to influence the way it works. Next year Britain now takes on the Presidency of the EU and it will do so as, once again, a respected leading European nation. That is an achievement of the new Labour government of which I am proud.And elsewhere too, new respect and influence. In tackling Third World debt. On the environment. Today in London the Government\u2019s Chief Scientific Adviser is issuing a report on global warming which I commissioned on coming into government. Read it and you will see why I am so passionate in my commitment to action not just in Britain but throughout the world, which is why we will take that action and get the rest of the world to take that action too. So much to do. So much to change. So hard to do it. But the vision is as old as humanity.Modernisation is not an end in itself. It is for a purpose.Modernisation is not the enemy of justice, but its ally.Progress and justice are the two rocks upon which the New Britain is raised to the heights. Lose either one and we come crashing down until we are just another average nation, scrabbling around for salvation in the ebbing tide of the 20th Century.That is why we changed the Labour Party. To make New Britain. It is why we will carry on changing. It is why it was right yesterday to take another historic step on the road to reform of our Party so that never again will a Labour government be torn about by divisions between leadership in Parliament and Party in the country. Yes, we are New Labour. Yes, our policies and attitudes have changed. But there are no Old Labour or New Labour values. There are Labour values. They are what make us the Party of compassion; of social justice; of the struggle against poverty and inequality; of liberty; of basic human solidarity; and the day we cease to be those things is the day we keep the name of the Labour Party but lose the reason for its existence. And these are indeed the best of British values too. The point of modern Britain is not to dishonour the past. But to honour it by improving it, by taking the best of it and adding to it. Ours is a simple enough vision. But it will require a supreme national effort. It is a task for a whole people, not just a government.Great challengesBut great rewards for all of us if we rise to them as we can. As one nation. Held together by our values and by the strength of our character. We are a giving people. In the face of crisis or challenge we pull together, strengthened by unity. It says nothing about our politics. It speaks volumes about our character. You remember how your parents, like mine, used to say to you: Just do your best. Well let\u2019s do our best.On May 1, the people entrusted me with the task of leading their country into a new century. That was your challenge to me. Proudly, humbly, I accepted it. Today, I issue a challenge to you. Help us make Britain that beacon shining throughout the world. Unite behind our mission to modernise our country. There is a place for all the people in New Britain, and there is a role for all the people in its creation. Believe in us as much as we believe in you. Give just as much to our country as we intend to give. Give your all. Make this the giving age. \u2018By the strength of our common endeavour we achieve more together than we can alone.\u2019On 1st May 1997, it wasn\u2019t just the Tories who were defeated. Cynicism was defeated. Fear of change was defeated. Fear itself was defeated. Did I not say it would be a battle of hope against fear? On 1st May 1997, fear lost. Hope won. The Giving Age began.Now make the good that is in the heart of each of us, serve the good of all of us. Give to our country the gift of our energy, our ideas, our hopes, our talents. Use them to build a country each of whose people will say that \u2018I care about Britain because I know that Britain cares about me.\u2019 Britain, head and heart, can be unbeatable. That is the Britain I offer you. That is the Britain that together can be ours.

aVIn our debate yesterday, we fixed our strategy for this Parliament. And now we move to the next phase. Developing our policies and sharpening our messages for the elections ahead.And an awful lot depends on getting this right. When others are trying to move onto our ground it is essential that we maintain our independence and our distinctiveness.And if we win fair votes, that distinctiveness will matter more than ever before. The clarity of what we stand for will be crucial to the number of votes we win.So our success in the years ahead will depend on our ability to think afresh - and to be radical and adventurous.And the opportunity for that has never, ever been greater.The Tory Party is still too shell shocked by defeat to think of the future. They are incapable of providing the lead that Britain needs as we make the transition from the old century to the new.And Labour, who are ditching so much they used to believe in, have yet to find any new compass to set their course by as they wrestle with the storms of government.This leaves a huge opportunity - no, a duty - for us Liberal Democrats.Many, perhaps most, of the proposals on which we have fought elections for 50 years have now become the commonplace policies of our time. Constitutional reform; positive Europeanism; an independent central bank; the importance of education; the need for new thinking on the environment. These are now established in the lexicon of modern politics and many are in the legislative programme of this Government.Even what is still called the Official Opposition is not immune from borrowing our phrases.Mr Hague now tells us he is the constructive opposition and he has even taken to talking to himself about constitutional reform.And, you know, Sir Norman Fowler has got so desperate that I thought I heard him on the Today Programme the other day trying to persuade us that the Tories are now the party of community politics!Well if you believe that you\u2019ll believe anything.Somehow, Sir Norman Fowler has never quite struck me as one of life\u2019s pavement pounders!So, it\u2019s time for us to get ahead again.To do some new thinking.To reclaim our historic role as the leaders of ideas in Britain.Some tell me this is the age of politics without ideology.They say the great \u201cisms\u201d are dead.Communism? Dead!Rampant free-market Thatcherism? The country tasted that in the 1980s. We know its price. And we have rejected it!Socialism? Mention the word in the Labour Party and Peter Mandelson will confiscate your bleeper and have you locked up in the dungeons of Millbank Tower!But there is one creed whose time, I am passionately convinced, has come again.This is again the liberal age.You will even hear Government Ministers using the word in polite company. Our wallpaper loving Lord Chancellor was heard to say not long ago: \u201cWe are all liberals now, you know.\u201d Well, not quite Derry, not quite.But seriously.There is a reason why everyone is scrambling to get onto our ground.It is because our ideas, liberal democrat ideas, are the ones that can make the best sense of the great questions that face us.There are now two great challenges which confront conventional thinking. And between them they are, quite literally, tearing apart the old politics and the old structures of the nation state.They are the globalisation of power on the one hand.And the search for individual freedom and individual choice on the other.The old creeds have nothing to say about this.Conservatism has become little more than a celebration of the nation state. Their response to the rise of global power is to return to the sad refuge of 18th century sovereignty, mixed in with some ugly modern xenophobia.And socialism is a creed of the masses. It is bewildered by the idea of personal choice. It feels threatened by the rise of individual power.But for us liberals, internationalism is our meat and drink - and individual liberty, and power and choice and freedom - these are our very purpose. They are the values from which we draw even our name itself.So, this is our ground. We own it. We have tilled this soil all down the long years of this century to produce the policies which now, I believe, underpin one of the great reforming decades of our history.So it\u2019s time to get ahead again.To take our values, now more relevant than ever, and set the new agenda for progress as we cross the threshold into the next century.There is a great project now before us.It is, quite simply, to prepare Britain for the 21st century.To forge a new settlement between the citizen and the state.To create a welfare system that combines social justice with individual responsibility.To renew our public services and restore people\u2019s faith in them.To transform our relationship with the natural environment.To strip away our class system and build a more open, tolerant and liberal society.And to build a new role for Britain, especially with our sister nations in Europe.This is the agenda on which I want to lead you through the years of this Parliament and beyond.Last month, in my Liberal Democrat News lecture, I mapped out one area where we might start this new thinking.I suggested a new relationship between tax payers and tax spenders to rebuild trust in the way we fund our public services. With more consultation, openness, decentralisation, and earmarked taxes - like a penny on income tax for education.That is one way we can move forward.Now I want to use this speech to map out another.I want to talk about unemployment.You know, for too long too many politicians across the developed world have become fatalistic about unemployment. In public they\u2019ve traded empty rhetoric about the need for jobs. In private they\u2019ve reassured each other that long dole queues are inevitable.\u201cNot much we can do really ... factor of the global economy ... jolly bad luck on those who are unemployed, of course ... but we can\u2019t go round promising people jobs you know!\u201dBut the fact is that this does not have to be like this. It is not written in stone.In the 1970s politicians thought inflation was unavoidable. They said it was necessary to oil the wheels of the economy - a kind of economic Act of God.But they were wrong. When we had to, we tamed inflation. Because we found the will.And it\u2019s the same today with jobs. We can have low inflation and low unemployment. It\u2019s not a see-saw. It\u2019s not a zero sum game. It can be done.If you\u2019re puzzled why I\u2019m raising this now, when unemployment is apparently falling, you shouldn\u2019t be.Nearly one and a half million people are on the dole in Britain today - even at the top of an economic boom. Twice as many as 20 years ago when we were at the same point in the economic cycle.And that\u2019s without counting the extra 300,000 we must add to the figures who would be considered unemployed in any other country. And the two million more who long for jobs if only they were available.And even these figures don\u2019t tell the whole story. Although the total number of unemployed has fallen in the last year, there are still 400,000 people who have been out of a job for more than a year - again, at the peak of the economic cycle. In some of the estates that I have visited over the last few months male unemployment stands at 60 per cent and well over a third of households have no-one working at all.A society which says that work is the source of dignity and self respect, threatens itself if it then consigns such a high proportion of its citizens, and especially its young, to rot in unemployment.I know. I remember. Because it\u2019s happened to me. Twice.Once when I first arrived in Yeovil in 1976. I was unemployed for six months. Then five years later, in the first Thatcher recession, when, as a manager, I had, on one terrible and unforgettable day, to shut down my division of the firm I worked for. And make all those I worked with, and myself, redundant.It was the most soul-destroying experience of my life.It is only when you don\u2019t have a job that you realise what a job can give you. Direction, focus, motivation, companionship, self-esteem. The chance to travel, to meet people, to work with others as part of a team.Unemployment excludes people. Not just from work, but from society. It takes away their stake. It robs them of their dignity.But surely, the Government's welfare to work plans will solve all this?I hope so. But I doubt it.The Government's New Deal will do a lot to give young people experience and training for work. Good! But I fear that it is not going to do much to create long-term jobs. Indeed it may actually displace some real jobs, with purely temporary ones.I do not underestimate the importance of work experience and training. Unlike most politicians, I was actually on one of these schemes, the Community Programme, when I was elected. And I remember how welcome it was.But I also remember how terrible it was to come to the end of the year and face unemployment again.So I welcome the Government's welfare to work programme. It is good - as far as it goes. It may even be a better programme of its sort than those that preceded it.But it remains an unemployment initiative. Not an employment strategy.It may help people to get into work, but I doubt it will create many new jobs for them to get into.I want us, Liberal Democrats, to start thinking much more radically about unemployment. Not just how we can fit people out for the work that is there, but also how we can create more jobs.I believe it can be done.And in this speech I will sketch out for you how I think it should be done.I want to outline an approach that builds on the real needs of the communities that make up Britain. That widens the scope of action for government, and especially local government, to meet those needs. That accepts how technology and globalisation have transformed work, but does not accept that this has to mean insecurity and hopelessness for many.But first, we must be clear what a long-term strategy to tackle unemployment does not mean.It does not mean a return to the past - to the rigidities of the regulated market, or the old nostrums of demand management.On the contrary it means dealing with the labour market as it is, not as we might like it to be.There is a revolution going on in every corner of the jobs market.The make up of the workforce is changing. More women are now in work than ever before. The number of working men is in long-term decline.The nature of work is changing too. It\u2019s becoming more skill-based, and much more knowledge-based. Intellectual capital is the new wealth, not commodities or heavy engineering or large scale manual labour. There are now more telephone sales people than there are coal miners, steel workers and car makers put together.And the way we work is changing out of all recognition too. Fewer than a third of people now work a standard \u20189 to 5\u2019 week. The number of part-time workers has doubled since 1971.These changes have brought insecurity to many. But they have brought more independence to many too - with self-employment, small business and \u2018portfolio-based\u2019 work all growing.The old divide between employee and employer is breaking down.And a new divide is appearing - between the \u2018job rich\u2019 and the \u2018job poor\u2019.On the one hand, high wage, high pressure households. Dual incomes. Longer working hours in Britain than in any other EU country.On the other, low wage or no wage households. No chance of a job with the wage or the hours to lift them out of poverty. And a benefits system that traps them there.Now, what can we do to begin really to tackle unemployment in Britain?Gordon Brown tells us that the Budget on Tuesday will be a Budget for Jobs. If it is, we shall welcome it. But we shall judge it against these key tests.Does it raise skills? Does it promote flexibility? Does it reward work? Does it create stability? Does it encourage enterprise? Does it generate jobs in the community?In the rest of this speech I shall sketch out for you a strategy for jobs based on these six key elements.A strategy that combines flexibility with fulfilment, prosperity with participation, competition with community.And which blends social cohesion with market efficiency.First, simple, and, for us, very familiar - but vitally important: skills - and education.One in eight of Britain\u2019s young adults lacks basic literacy skills. Skills they\u2019ll need for any job now.And one in ten employers can\u2019t fill a job vacancy because they can\u2019t find people with the skills they need.There can be no greater indictment of our failure to invest in education and training than that firms are held back because they can\u2019t find the skills they need, while so many are left, unskilled, condemned to unemployment.Just this week Steve Norris, a Minister in the last Tory Government, said this was something the Tories should be ashamed of. And he was absolutely right.So what do Labour ministers do about it? Well, they talk. They hold reviews. They appoint watchdogs. They set up task forces - twelve, so far, on training and education alone - each with a Government appointee to head them.Let me list just some of them.There\u2019s the Chairman of the Further Education Student Support Advisory Group. The Head of the Advisory Group for Continuing Education and Lifelong Learning. The Secretary of the Review of the Bureaucratic Burden on Teachers.But you know, it\u2019s not just in education. There are others too.Chairman of the Strategic Review of the Welsh Trunk Road Programme. The Head of the Review of the Revenue Effect of the Reduced Rate of VAT for Energy Efficient Materials and Alternative Options for Targeted Relief to Help those on Low Incomes to Save Energy.And finally, the most important job of all of the 161 reviews, task forces and quangos. Yes, you guessed it. The Chairman of the Review of Quangos!Come to think of it I suppose that is a job creation scheme all of its own.But the really important thing is, if you\u2019re going to create jobs you have to start in the classroom.So what\u2019s happening in the classroom?The fact is class sizes are at their highest for 20 years and rising.Three times as much is now spent on tests for seven year olds as on books to boost their basic skills.Fewer trainee teachers now than even 10 years ago - when Labour called it a crisis.So, teachers - sacked.School budgets - cut.Employment and training budgets - even with Labour\u2019s New Deal - cut.Further and higher education - cut.You know, it will not do to promise education, education, education - but then start with cuts, cuts and cuts.Of course, much of this is the Tory legacy. And of course, money isn\u2019t everything. But if we\u2019re going to equip our children with the skills they need to succeed then we must make the investment that our schools, our colleges and our students need, and we must make it now.As Lord Dearing said recently, if you think education is expensive, just try the alternative.That\u2019s why we have insisted, we are insisting, and we will continue to insist - this is the investment Britain has to make. It\u2019s the investment Ministers are still refusing to make, despite all their promises. And if they don\u2019t make that investment in the Budget on Tuesday, we will harry them every day of this Parliament until they do.That\u2019s why we say again this year that, since there is no other way to find that money than to put a penny extra on income tax for education, that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019d do.So that\u2019s point one of our strategy - investing in education and in skills.And here\u2019s point two. To create jobs, we need a stable economic environment which enables business to think long-term, and to plan, and to grow.And that means a much more rule based approach to economic management, to stop politicians fiddling with the economy for short term political ends.That stable economic environment means three things. Stable interest rates. Stable tax rates. Stable exchange rates.To stabilise interest rates we now at last have an Independent Central Bank - proposed by us at the election, adopted by Labour three days after it.To stabilise tax rates we must now adopt a Fiscal Responsibility Act which prevents pre-election tax bribes. And we should build on the sort of public service reforms being pioneered in New Zealand. Reforms which have made government departments more accountable to tax payers for what they do. And more focused on what they deliver.And the route to stable exchange rates, and a more competitive pound, and lower interest rates, and higher investment, is staring the Government in the face, if only they would have the courage to take it.Come off the fence on the Single Currency.Set a target date for Britain\u2019s entry into EMU. Show we\u2019re serious about it by following the policies to make that happen. And hold a referendum on the principle of the Single Currency before the next election.I despair at the Government's timidity on this. \u2018Wait and see\u2019 under the last government has been replaced by \u2018waiting for Rupert Murdoch\u2019 under this one.This is costing Britain dear in an uncompetitive pound, higher interest rates, lost inward investment and diminished influence in Europe.And I make this prediction. This Government will be forced by events to make its decision on the single currency before the next election.So I say to the Prime Minister: don\u2019t worry about Mr Murdoch. Put Britain first. The last Prime Minister was a prisoner on Europe. You should be leading on it.Now, creating stability in our economy leads to the next strand of our strategy - encouraging enterprise.Time and time again it has been in the small business and self-employment sector, that most new jobs are created.In the fragmented labour market of the future, working for yourself will be the way that more and more people take control of their economic lives, earning a living for their family and making a contribution to the well being of their community and our country.And that is a good thing. The idea of the self-reliant individual - empowered by their own abilities, beholden to no-one - is at the heart of Liberal Democrat belief. The freedom to make your own choices in life - enslaved neither by poverty, nor by ignorance, nor by pressure to conform, is a fundamental Liberal Democrat value.So that\u2019s why I want to see the Liberal Democrats become the party of small business, of self-employment and of enterprise over the years of this Parliament.And it\u2019s why promoting flexibility is a key element of our strategy for employment.The economies that will prosper in the future will be those which are flexible and light on their feet.Adaptable government, adaptable companies, adaptable workers. The biggest prizes will go to those who respond quickest to rapidly shifting demands.I want our British economy to be one in which people are able to work in flexible ways which suit their life styles in every corner, crack and crevice of our economic system.And that means a flexible labour market.But - and here\u2019s the point too many business people refuse to understand - flexibility is a two way street.It\u2019s not simply the power to hire and fire.That does not produce a flexible workforce; it produces a frightened workforce - a workforce resistant to change and fearful of risk.A truly flexible workforce is one equipped with the skills to move confidently around the marketplace, protected by a framework of basic rights against exploitation and unfair practice.This is the importance of the Social Chapter and of safeguards against low pay.But flexibility means a lot more. It also means making pensions safer and more portable, encouraging participation and profit sharing. And making sure part-time workers have the same pro rata rights as full-timers.It means making it easier for people to work in different ways to meet the changing patterns of their lives - a flexible age of retirement, portfolio working, variable hours when they\u2019re bringing up the kids.It means making it easier for people to work from where they choose - making homeworking and teleworking real options for more people.It means making it easier for people to take a break from work, and easier for them to come back too - so better use of career breaks, access to training to uprate skills in mid-career, and proper maternity and paternity leave.And, of course, it means what we should have had long, long ago in Britain. And what we must see in Tuesday\u2019s Budget. A decent, affordable, high quality, national network of childcare for all who need it.What I\u2019m talking about is a framework which gives us the choices, the freedoms and the security to make flexible work an opportunity not a threat.And if we\u2019re to achieve that we need a benefit system that rewards work rather than penalises it.It is simply ludicrous that someone on the dole actually loses out when they take a job.We\u2019ve got to cut through the tangle of overlapping thresholds, tapers, rebates and credits that leave most people as lost as the Lord Chancellor buying wallpaper at his local B&Q.Now that we are going to have a minimum wage there is, frankly, no reason why we should not give people a simple guarantee - that whatever benefits they are on, they will never be worse off in a job than out of a job.And we could go further. Why not guarantee that whatever benefit people are on they can keep at least a quarter of the extra money they earn if they go back to work.Now that would be real welfare to work.And, if Gordon Brown chooses, he could make a start on Tuesday.He could merge out-of-work benefits, like income support, with in-work benefits, like Family Credit.He could raise the tax threshold, as Liberal Democrats are committed to do, to take a million people out of income tax altogether.That is a far better way of helping the poor and encouraging work than the gimmick of a 10p tax rate.So when the Government finally produces its proposals for welfare reform, we will judge them by these yardsticks. Do they tackle poverty? Do they encourage self-reliance? And do they reward work?These then are five strands of our strategy for jobs.Investing in skills. Creating stability. Encouraging enterprise. Promoting flexibility. Rewarding work.And the sixth, is the most radical of all.Stop, for a moment. Let\u2019s come at this from an entirely different direction.Consider these facts.There are not far short of four million people who would like work.But there is no shortage of work waiting to be done.Look around you.Homeless people on our streets - but derelict and empty buildings with no-one to do them up.Elderly and disabled people desperately in need of care - but no-one to care for them.Rural villages without shops, post offices, public transport - and people lost without them.Pot holes, and broken street lamps - and no-one to repair them.Railway stations, unacceptably frightening after dark - because there\u2019s no-one to man them.Parks, unkempt and uncared for.Public spaces, dirty and dangerous.Then pay a visit to your Benefits Office, and look at the queue of people who are unemployed. And remember that each costs us £10,000 a year in benefits and lost taxes. And that\u2019s before you count the cost of the wasted lives and the economic contribution they could have been making.This is simple madness.Surely it cannot be beyond us to connect up the people who desperately need work with the work that desperately needs to be done?I spoke earlier about changes in the job market.But those changes are not uniform. Different parts of the economy are developing in quite different ways.At one end there is the \u2018competitive economy\u2019. Trading goods and services in the global market, earning Britain\u2019s prosperity. High wage, high tech, high risk, low security.At the other end there is what I shall call the \u2018community economy\u2019. Wages generally lower. Work usually more secure, and sometimes more rewarding too.Now note, this is not about the difference between the public and the private sectors. It is about two different kinds of economy - that need to be treated differently.And the biggest difference between the two is the way they deal with labour.In the competitive economy labour is a cost that has to be carefully controlled like any other.But in the community economy, labour is an asset, both to the person who has it, and for the things it can do that bring benefits to us all.You see, the community economy is a different kind of economy. Its success is measured, not in the creation of financial capital, but in the growth of social capital.But it\u2019s no less real - no less valuable for that.This is the neighbourhood and family economy which brings up children, nurtures relatives and friends, looks after older people, watches out for neighbours, and does so through hundreds of thousands of small local organisations and millions of individuals who keep the wheels of our communities turning. Everything we do, everything we care about, every business success, depends upon this economy.In the competitive economy, it is profitability which comes first - as it should. And Britain must be good at that. And, by and large, we are. This is where we earn our living in the world.But in the community economy it\u2019s people who come first. Now why can\u2019t our communities be just as successful as our companies? Because they aren\u2019t. In too many areas of Britain our communities are simply failing.So, that question again. Is it really beyond our ability to connect the millions of tasks that need to be done in our communities, with the millions of people who are desperate to do them?I believe it is not. If we can only start thinking more radically.First we have to realise that everyone who is sidelined by the market - young people, older people, disabled people - these should not be viewed merely as a cost to the state, but as underused assets with time and energy and something to offer, which we badly need if we are going to revitalise the places where we all live.Then we have to realise that those millions of things which need doing - the caring, the educating, the helping, the rebuilding - are work too, even though Labour\u2019s New Deal might define them otherwise.So here are some practical ideas. None of them just theoretical - all of them already successfully working somewhere else in the world.Why not cajole our financial institutions, and big business too, into investing in those run down neighbourhoods so many of them fail to help? That\u2019s what they\u2019ve done in the United States, with the Community Reinvestment Act. Couldn\u2019t we do it here?Why not do what they are already doing in Sweden, the Netherlands, Australia, South Africa and thirty American cities? Set up \u2018Business Improvement Districts\u2019 in which businesses vote to pay for agreed regeneration projects which they subcontract to their local council to run, improving communities and creating jobs at the same time.Why not encourage - not discourage - ideas like skill exchanges, \u2018Time Dollars\u2019 and local trading schemes - LETS - which help people without money use those assets they do have - goods, services and time - to rebuild their communities?Why not actively encourage credit unions to give people access to funds and credit - drive out the loan sharks who prey on deprived areas? That\u2019s what President Clinton is doing in the United States.All these practical ideas foster self-reliance, and support people trying to escape from poverty. And in my journeys outside Westminster these last three months I have seen how initiatives like these - and the people who make them work - are making a real difference to people\u2019s lives.I want the Liberal Democrats to become the champions of this ignored third sector, which is already doing so much but which could do much, much more.And, incidentally, I do not believe that these jobs should always, or even mainly, be done by Government - whether local or national. Far from it.I see Government in the new century, doing less and commissioning more. Setting the contracts, assuring the quality, overseeing the delivery. Government which steers more - and rows less.Indeed, I don\u2019t object at all, even to delivering core public services in this way. If we followed an entitlements approach to public services, then the job of Government would be to frame the entitlement, to fund it, to ensure equality of access for all and to assure the quality of delivery - not necessarily to deliver itself.For instance, should we really be concerned about who provides a school? So long as Government ensures that it is accessible to all and delivers education which is regularly monitored and whose standards are scrupulously maintained.This is a new approach. One in which the scope of government, especially local government, is far greater, but the range of the things they do themselves is far smaller. One which combines social action with market efficiency. One which puts the interests of the consumer before those of the producer. And which, in doing so, can increase our social capital and create jobs at the same time.And we could start right now.Here\u2019s a challenge to the Government.Why not turn your New Deal into something much more?Make it a \u2018New Deal Plus\u2019. Set up projects, initially in areas of the highest unemployment, which allow local councils, and other bodies like health trusts and voluntary groups to offer new services they\u2019d like to provide beyond their current budgets. Contractors could tender to provide these services on condition they give the jobs to one of the New Deal target groups - the young or the long-term unemployed. And the service they deliver would be closely monitored by the body that commissioned them.It won\u2019t necessarily be the cheapest option. But it could be the best value one - the most effective one. And it will create real jobs - without displacing existing ones, because these will be new jobs - outside existing budgets.This speech has been about unemployment.But it\u2019s been about much more than that as well.It has been about an end to navel gazing about strategy - and moving on to a period of new thinking and intellectual adventure.It has been about reclaiming our position as the leaders of ideas in Britain.And it has put in place some of the signposts that I hope we shall follow in that new thinking.A more rule-based approach to economic policy.A commitment to self-employment, small business and enterprise.An approach to welfare reform which rewards work and which combines social justice with self-reliance.A clear stance to provide leadership on the Single Currency.An enduring determination to invest in education and training as the corner stone of a tolerant, liberal and prosperous society.An employment market which promotes job flexibility by giving people greater personal skills and security.A new approach to government, especially local government which combines wider scope for action with the efficiency of market mechanisms.And a radically different approach to creating jobs, so that we can begin to connect the people who need the work, with the work that needs to be done.We have come a long, long way together, these last 10 years.Now we enter the most exciting phase of all.The phase which will determine Britain\u2019s politics in the next century.And our place as the gathering point for a new liberal and progressive majority which can form the dominant governing force to carry Britain into the next century.We must seize the chance now to give our country, at last, the politics it deserves.More hopeful. Less cynical.More ambitious. Less negative.More imaginative. Less traditional.More based on partnership. Less on confrontation.There is nothing we cannot achieve. Everything is possible.We must seize the chance now. To change. To experiment. To work together, instead of against each other. Everything is possible.We must seize the chance now. To achieve all we Liberal Democrats have dreamt of for so long.Strong, independent, clear in what we stand for, courageous in what we do.Everything is possible.I give you a motto for the years ahead. It is taken from the words of Theodore Roosevelt, but after 10 years of success, we are entitled to call it ours.\u201cThe greatest deeds are yet to be done and the greatest victories are yet to be won.\u201d

aVIn March, our Spring Party Conference met in Reading. Today, the unclaimed cars in Reading Station car park are painful testimony to the loss and distress we all feel in the wake of the awful Paddington tragedy. None of us can fully understand the grief and pain of the families of the victims; but as we watch the terrible scenes from the crash site, each one of us remembers the last journey we made by train, for many of us only days ago, and we shudder at how fragile life can be. We need to find out what went so disastrously wrong. And we need to find out fast. We welcome the swift decision to hold an inquiry. But the inquiry itself must be swift too. It must not drag on for years and years, or lose its way in bureaucratic procedure. We need clear answers and long-term solutions. On this we will give the Government every support as it carries out its work. And we salute, as we have done so often in similar circumstances, the courage and professionalism of our police and emergency services, and we praise the staff of the hospitals who continue to care for the injured. The national grief following this disaster will be intense and lasting.In every family, we know that even in the midst of tragedy we have to look to the future. This week we have looked to the future with new confidence. For here in Blackpool we have had the best Conservative Conference for years. The best Conference because we\u2019ve heard brilliant speeches from the new fresh talent of an outstanding Shadow Cabinet and frontbench. The best Conference because I think we\u2019ve all been struck by how many younger members have sparkled here this week. The best Conference because everyone who saw our parade of new councillors and MPs knows that this Party is back winning elections again.We\u2019ve launched our Common Sense Revolution. We\u2019ve set out our five Common Sense Guarantees. I can announce today that we are adding a sixth guarantee The Blackpool Guarantee. We\u2019re coming back to Blackpool every other year. Long after the Labour Party has become too snobbish to go almost anywhere in the country, we\u2019re coming back to Blackpool. I\u2019ve enjoyed this Conference tremendously because of your enthusiasm and because, as ever, I\u2019ve had the terrific support and companionship of my wife, Ffion.The whole Conference has been a great contrast to what we saw last week. I sympathise with the Prescotts. Last week they took the car because of what the seaside air did to their hair. I don\u2019t blame them. Look what it did to mine. I don\u2019t mind. As someone said to me last month in Wigan: \u2018Don\u2019t worry Mr Hague. It\u2019s not what\u2019s on your head that counts. It\u2019s what in your head.\u2019The Labour Party Conference in Bournemouth was all about staying in power however they can and distorting the past. Our Conference has been about serving the people and preparing for the future. What annoys me most about today\u2019s Labour politicians is not their beliefs - they\u2019re entitled to those - but their sheer, unadulterated hypocrisy. They say one thing and they do another. They send their children to schools they want to abolish for others. They are driven in cars 250 yards to give speeches telling other people not to drive their own. They tell other people not to have second homes when they\u2019ve got three themselves. They make their lip-trembling proclamation that the class war is over while the very same day they boo 14-year-old girls because they come from a private school.We\u2019re having a Common Sense Revolution, so let\u2019s have some common sense language about Labour: it\u2019s high time this bunch of hypocrites stopped preaching to others what they don\u2019t practice themselves. Last year Tony Blair promised a Year of Delivery. If only he\u2019d told us to expect a year of hollow rhetoric, empty gestures and meaningless slogans, for once he\u2019d have told the truth. Now we must offer the people of this country not just an alternative to the arrogance and complacency and hypocrisy of New Labour, but our own fresh ideas.Conservative Governments achieved so much. But there\u2019s so much more to be done. For as a country we\u2019re spending millions more on our schools and hospitals, and they don\u2019t seem to be getting any better. We\u2019re paying more and more tax, but no one can understand where the money\u2019s all going to. We hear endless stories of new anti-crime initiatives, yet crime is going up. We have more and more politicians, and they are trusted less and less. Let\u2019s get it clear: Vast regional bureaucracies and European political superstructures are not the solution. They are the problem. As I travel around our country to schools and factories and high streets, I listen to a common sense so far removed from how people think in Whitehall that it\u2019s no wonder people have lost faith in politics.But this common sense has for too long been ignored. People don\u2019t want to be told that what they know to be right, can\u2019t work. The people of this country want and deserve straight talk. The people of this country want a government that turns their common sense solutions into government policy. When I sit in the House of Commons and hear Labour Ministers talking about this or that new piece of regulation, I think to myself: it\u2019s time they listened to the small businessman I met in Nottingham last month, who said to me: \u2018At this rate, we are going to have one man working in this country and 55 million checking up on him.\u2019 Britain needs a Common Sense Revolution.When minor operations are carried out to meet political targets while people die waiting for their heart bypass, Britain needs a Common Sense Revolution. When local councils spend more money looking after bogus asylum seekers than after old people in homes, Britain needs a Common Sense Revolution. When twelve-year-old girls are giving birth while the last recognition of marriage in the tax system is being abolished, Britain needs a Common Sense Revolution. When a householder who uses reasonable force against a burglar ends up in court while the burglar goes free, Britain needs a Common Sense Revolution. When terrorist murderers go free in their hundreds without surrendering one ounce of Semtex or a single gun, Britain needs a Common Sense Revolution.When the best schools in the country face abolition simply because they are the best, when 2,000 new regulations on business are passed in two years, when we import food of a quality we would not permit to be produced at home, when the Territorial Army is decimated while our Armed Forces are stretched to the limit, when more layers of government are added to an over-governed society, when we have a Prime Minster who is trying abolish our currency and end our independence as a country, we all know Britain needs a Common Sense Revolution. And when the Government of Britain is the most two-faced, interfering, over-regulating, bossy, intolerant, arrogant and crony-run in our history, there is no doubt Britain needs a Common Sense Revolution.Before the election, Tony Blair claimed to be so admiring of Conservative success. He implied he would be like Margaret Thatcher. He pledged to be against higher taxes; to be tough on crime; to think the unthinkable on welfare; to fight for Britain\u2019s interests in Europe. This was their great deception. This was the Great Labour Lie. When Tony Blair told the country he\u2019d \u2018no plans to increase tax at all,\u2019 was he telling the truth? Well, was he? Or when he wrote to anxious parents \u2018A Labour Government will not close your grammar schools. That is my personal guarantee,\u2019 was he telling the truth? When Tony Blair wrote in the Sun newspaper before the election about \u2018my love for the Pound\u2019 and how he felt so emotional about the Queen\u2019s head on a £10 note, was he telling the truth? When can you be absolutely, 100 per cent, cast-iron sure that a Labour promise is going to be broken? The moment Tony Blair puts it in his own handwriting. If he was Pinocchio, he\u2019d have a nose bigger than Concorde.Sometimes you have to laugh at it. To the Evening Standard he is the city slicker; to Country Life, he is the rural boy at heart. And my favourite. According to Labour\u2019s own magazine, \u2018Tony\u2019s favourite food is fish and chips. He gets a takeaway from his local chippie whenever he is at home in his constituency\u2019; but when The Islington Cook Book asked him the same question, he said his favourite food was \u2018fresh fettuccini garnished with an exotic sauce of olive oil, sun-dried tomatoes and capers.\u2019 I read in the papers the other day: Downing Street sources confirm Tony Blair thinks he\u2019s \u2018a Napoleon Bonaparte figure\u2019 who\u2019s taken \u2018near-total control of the levers of political power.\u2019 Well maybe it\u2019s not a bad comparison. Napoleon thought he was Emperor; he tried to submerge Britain in a single European state; and he obviously wanted to abolish the pound; he even invaded Tuscany several summers in a row. He thought he was invincible, but he was finished off by a plain-speaking Conservative who went on to become Prime Minister.How do we defeat the Great Labour Lie? By fighting a campaign based on common sense, clear convictions and a united Party. We know because we fought such a campaign in the European Elections four months ago and won the biggest swing to the Opposition in any election since 1918. The lowest Labour share of the vote since Michael Foot. And wasn\u2019t the Prime Minister\u2019s reaction to defeat so revealing? Did he listen for one single second to the message from the voters? No. Not for one second. He came out and called us extremists - as if wanting to keep control of our your own currency is extreme. He said we were fanatics, as if it\u2019s fanatical to speak up for the great majority of British people who want to be in Europe not run by Europe.The people I meet in the cities and towns and villages of our country have a straightforward desire to live in an independent country with their own currency. I\u2019ve got news for Tony Blair. These people are not extreme. They\u2019re not fanatics. They\u2019ve got more sense in their gut instincts than in all the collective wisdom of this Government and their fellow travellers. Now our task is to speak up with the same common sense and clarity and conviction on all the other great issues facing our country.Some people won\u2019t like it. Our friends in the Guardian newspaper describe the Common Sense Revolution as \u2018bristling with extreme ideas ranging through tougher welfare rules, tougher prison sentences, less state administration and lower taxes.\u2019 If newspapers regard tougher welfare rules, tougher prison sentences, less administration and lower taxes as \u2018extreme,\u2019 then it\u2019s not just the Government that needs a Common Sense Revolution.It is time to make the case for that revolution. So let us begin. Let\u2019s have a Common Sense Revolution for pensioners like Barbara Fitzjohn. 78 years old. Proud of her country. Lives alone in a one-bedroom flat in Hall Green, Birmingham. Scared to leave her home after dark. Terrified because she saw somebody get mugged and no one stopped to help. Muggings, car thefts, graffiti, drug-taking and burglary. They\u2019re so common that no one feels completely safe anymore. Labour said they\u2019d be tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime. Their first sound-bite. Now we know it was the beginning of the Great Labour Lie. Crime is up. Prisoners are released early. Police numbers go down as Labour rhetoric goes up.I say keep criminals in prison longer; make sure the sentence served in prison is the sentence given in court; lock away with life sentences drug dealers who sell to children; make every prisoner do a full working day; help our police get out from behind their desks and onto our streets; stop turning a blind eye to the graffiti and vandalism and truancy - go to war on crime like no government has ever dared before. In the next Conservative Government, when Ann Widdecombe is Home Secretary, I want every criminal in the land to look like Labour Ministers do when she gets up to speak - absolutely scared witless.These are my instincts. They are the instincts of the people of this country. They\u2019ve been ignored for too long. It\u2019s common sense. Making it happen would be a revolution. You and I are going to make it happen. Let\u2019s have a Common Sense Revolution for responsible people like Barbara Evans. 89 years old. Lives in a residential care home in Vauxhall. Through her life set aside money for her retirement. Now everything she\u2019s saved could disappear in residential care bills.Labour said they\u2019d do something and they\u2019ve done nothing. Another part of the Great Labour Lie. Labour\u2019s idea of a savings policy is to grease up to Geoffrey Robinson, get him to buy you a half-a-million pound house, sell it for three quarters of a million, keep the change. Easy. Everything Labour has done, from their pensions tax to abolishing PEPs and TESSAs to discriminating against savings in income tax, makes it harder for people to save.I say it\u2019s time the government stopped fleecing people who put aside money for the future. I say it\u2019s time to help people who help themselves by cutting the starting rate of tax on savings in half and protecting people who\u2019ve saved for their long term care, so that we don\u2019t let another generation have their home and assets eaten up. It\u2019s common sense. Making it happen would be a revolution. You and I are going to make it happen. Let\u2019s have a Common Sense Revolution for farmers like John Harrison. Works every day of the year including Christmas day. Made just £5,000 last year with a wife and family to support. Driven to despair by a Labour Britain where the thing that grows fastest is red tape. Labour claimed to be the friend of farming. But it\u2019s just another instalment of the Great Labour Lie.I say stop importing food that does not meet the animal welfare and hygiene standards which we expect here at home. Insist food on the shelves labelled British is actually grown in Britain. And make a bonfire of rules and regulations - starting with the totally pointless ban on beef-on-bone.And while we\u2019re at it, let\u2019s force every Whitehall Department to cut its red tape. And let\u2019s cut the size of Whitehall itself. Since Labour took office the cost of paying \u2018political advisers\u2019 has risen by £2 million, the cost of all elected representatives in the country by £120 million, the cost of running Government departments by one thousand million pounds. That\u2019s the cost of over 40,000 teachers\u2019 salaries or a third of a million hip operations.I make you this promise: I\u2019ll reduce the size of the Cabinet, cut the number of ministers, reduce the size of the House of Commons, campaign for a European Parliament of 100 fewer members, halve the number of political advisers to ministers and abolish all of Labour\u2019s regional agencies and assemblies. And, what\u2019s more, I\u2019m going to enjoy it. Now that would be a Common Sense Revolution.Let\u2019s have a Common Sense Revolution for people like Jim Macabe. Grandfather. Husband. NHS patient. Told to wait nearly a year just to see a consultant. So desperate he\u2019s going to spend his hard-earned savings on going private. Wouldn\u2019t it make sense if patients like Jim Macabe got treated on the basis of medical need instead of political priorities set by Government Ministers fiddling the figures?We offer a Patient\u2019s Guarantee. Every NHS patient with an urgent condition will be guaranteed a waiting time based on their need for treatment. If the NHS can\u2019t do it in time, the state will pay for a private operation. That means far shorter waiting times for life-saving operations like heart bypasses. They won\u2019t take their place at the back of the queue. It\u2019s just common sense. It\u2019s been welcomed by the medical profession. Making it happen would be a revolution. You and I are going to make it happenLet\u2019s have a Common Sense Revolution for the Begbie family. Their eleven-year-old daughter Heather was excelling at school on an Assisted Place. Before the election Tony Blair wrote promising she\u2019d \u2018continue to receive support until the end of her education.\u2019 This year he broke that promise and Heather now faces leaving her school. It\u2019s clear now that when Tony Blair wrote to people like Heather Begbie saying he was committed to excellence in education, it was all part of the Great Labour Lie. They seem to think that destroying the best schools somehow improves education for everybody.Well I say you don\u2019t improve schools with difficulties by suppressing the work of outstanding schools; you cannot raise the average by destroying the best. \u2018The class war is over,\u2019 says Tony Blair. Tell that to thousands of vindictive, mean-spirited, class-obsessed Labour Party activists who at this moment are trying to destroy the best state schools in the country and are doing so at the behest of the Labour Leadership.Each year as Secretary of State for Wales, I looked at the exam results of every school in Wales. If any school showed a dramatic improvement, I asked what had changed at that school since the year before. The answer was always the same - the head teacher. All my experience is that standards in a classroom don\u2019t go up because of Whitehall diktats; they go up because of the actions of parents and governors and head teachers.We offer parents and children a revolution in our state education. We\u2019re going to turn every state-run school in the country into a Free School. We\u2019re going to give head teachers and governors the complete freedom to run their own schools, manage their own budget, employ the best teachers and set their pay, and control their own admissions policy. And we\u2019re going to give every parent this Parent\u2019s Guarantee: if you don\u2019t think your child\u2019s free school meets minimum standards, and enough of your fellow parents agree, then you can sack the whole school management. That\u2019s real parent power; that\u2019s the way to drive up standards. We will give schools the power to discipline they need, and we\u2019re going to deal with truants with this simple rule: any school pupil on the streets during school hours without written permission will be stopped by the police and sent back to school where they belong. It\u2019s common sense.Education does not end at school or even at university. It goes on through our lives. We\u2019re going to help working women who take a career break to look after their children, by cutting away the barriers that make it difficult for them to get a job again We will set up Family Scholarships that will give these mothers the professional training and refresher courses they need to get back to work. Free Schools. Real power to teachers and head teachers. A Parent\u2019s Guarantee. Tough Discipline. Higher standards. It\u2019s common sense. Making it happen would be a revolution. You and I are going to make it happen.Let\u2019s have a Common Sense Revolution for millions of hard-working families in this country who pay too much tax. All Labour Governments raise taxes. It\u2019s just that this Labour Government is sneakier and stealthier about it. They tax your savings, your house, your petrol, your pension, your marriage and your mortgage. All those taxes followed by last week\u2019s speech. They passed round the collection plate even before the sermon. It\u2019s time we had much more open and honest and transparent tax system.So our Tax Guarantee is this: the next Conservative Government will bring down the total of all taxes taken together as a share of the nation\u2019s income. They\u2019ll be no place to hide tax increases. They\u2019ll be no stealth taxes. Guaranteed. And as we cut tax, the people we will to try to help will include the people who save and who give to charity; the people who aren\u2019t rich but who, like thousands of teachers and policemen, find themselves paying the top rate of income tax; the people who want to have the freedom to use the car which they\u2019ve earned and saved for. And we will introduce an explicit recognition of marriage back into the tax and benefit system.But we all know that the only way the nation can afford to do this, and to invest in education and healthcare, is by real reform of the welfare state. Labour promised to be truly radical on welfare. Tony Blair vowed to cut social security spending as a proportion of the nation\u2019s income. But that was the greatest part of the Great Labour Lie. Social security bills have soared. Dependency has increased. Despondency has set in. We\u2019re going to liberate people from the culture of welfare dependency with a Common Sense Revolution. It\u2019s time to insist that those who can work, must work.I guarantee taxpayers that any unemployed person who can work, and who is offered a job, either takes that job or loses their unemployment benefits. We have to create a culture in this country where if you can work, you do work. We\u2019re going to transform our Jobcentres so that they get paid by results. I say Jobcentres are not there to pay people benefits for doing nothing. They are there to get people into work. Our Common Sense Revolution is straightforward good sense.We will match our military capability and our military commitments, and we will restore the role of our Territorial Army. We will save our road hauliers by forcing foreign lorries who use our roads to pay a levy, and then use that money to cut road tax. They do it in Denmark and Holland. I shall do it in Britain too. We will require two-thirds of all new development to be built on brown-field sites so that we rejuvenate our towns and cities, not bulldoze over our countryside. We will protect our fishermen and conserve our fish stocks by returning British fishing waters to local or national control. We champion all these people and their causes because our Party has always been at its best when it champions the instincts of the British people. When, in Randolph Churchill\u2019s famous phrase, we trust the people.In Bournemouth last week Tony Blair declared war on the forces of Conservatism. I am proud of the forces of Conservatism. I am proud of what they have achieved this century. Winston Churchill and the British people, hand in hand, as we stood alone and saved the people of Europe from tyranny. Rab Butler and the British people, hand in hand, as we extended free education and brought opportunity to millions of children. Harold Macmillan and the British people, hand in hand, as we brought prosperity to the cold grey post-war era. Margaret Thatcher and John Major and the British people, hand in hand, as we fought union power, and won the cold war, and restored the dignity and freedom of this nation.It is the forces of Conservatism which, in a dangerous century beset by socialism, communism and national socialism, have left our country at the end of that century free and proud and strong. The Conservative Party and the British people, hand in hand, that\u2019s how we\u2019ll build our Common Sense Revolution. Hand in hand against the patronising elite who think its small-minded to believe in our country, and the chattering classes who think it\u2019s intolerant to be tough on law and order, and the progressive intellectuals who think that caring is spending other people\u2019s money. And in the 1980s, it was the forces of Conservatism which stood up to the unions and defended our country while Tony Blair was voting against every trade union law and campaigning for unilateral nuclear disarmament.What a speech that was last week in Bournemouth. The speech of a politician for whom the truth has ceased to matter. I do not know which is more worrying. That our Prime Minister actually believes that Conservatives caused the assassination of Martin Luther King, or that he is prepared to read out whatever offensive rubbish is put in front of him. But it wasn\u2019t the insults to past and present Conservative voters that was most extraordinary about that speech. It was what that speech revealed about who the Prime Minister really is.At times, listening to Tony Blair was like listening to a recording of Conservative slogans from the last twenty years: \u2018Set the people free\u2019 - a long-familiar Tory message. So \u2018set the people free,\u2019 says Tony Blair last week. \u2018Opportunity for all\u2019 the theme of our Conference a few years ago. So \u2018opportunity for all\u2019 cries Tony Blair a few years later. \u2018One Nation\u2019 perhaps the most famous Conservative phrase ever. Tony Blair\u2019s favourite phrase? \u2018One Nation.\u2019 You wait. Soon he\u2019ll tell us all his policies are common sense. A common sense revolution.If all we had needed to govern the country was someone who repeated everything we\u2019d said before, we could have bought a parrot. For this man\u2019s whole political approach has been to parrot the language of Conservatives; to pretend that he understood what Margaret Thatcher had achieved and why Michael Foot and Neil Kinnock were so wrong. This is the Great Labour Lie.Last week Tony Blair showed that he has never understood the real achievements of Conservative Governments. He knows the slogans, but he doesn\u2019t have a clue what they mean. A Prime Minster who has the brass neck to stand before his Party Conference vowing to set the people free while at the same time centralising power, increasing taxes and undermining personal responsibility, can only be the perpetrator of the Great Labour Lie himself. He even claimed that \u2018the establishment\u2019 was holding the country back. He\u2019s a forty-something, public school educated, barrister from Islington, with a two hundred seat majority in the House of Commons. Who does he think is the establishment? The man is a fraud.Anyone who so misunderstands or so wilfully distorts who we are as a people or where we come from as a nation cannot possibly know where we should go to next as a people and as a nation. For this was the speech of a man who is embarrassed about where he came from, and the country he lives in, and the century he was born in and the Party he leads. Most of all it was the speech of a man who is embarrassed by the opinions of the people who elected him. Embarrassed by their patriotism and their fierce independence and their pride in Britain. He thinks patriotism is uncool and independence is out of date and pride is undignified. He wants to take on the forces of Conservatism.The forces of Conservatism that trust the common sense instincts of the people of Britain rather than ignore them. The forces of Conservatism that speak for all those who believe we should build on the traditions and institutions and success of our country rather than destroy them. The forces of Conservatism that will be keeping our nation free and proud and independent long after he and his cronies are written off by history as people without principle, purpose, belief or conviction. For when I spoke to you in this hall two years ago, I said that New Labour would bring first fascination, then admiration, then disillusionment and finally contempt. At that stage the admiration was running high; now the disillusionment is beginning; and mark my words, they are not so far away from contempt.And so once again it is the Conservative Party that is hand in hand with the British people as we start a new century. For we believe in our country. We believe in a free and independent nation. We believe in the United Kingdom. We believe in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. We hope and pray for real and permanent peace in Northern Ireland. We continue to support the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. We give credit to the Government for continuing the painstaking work so bravely commenced by John Major. But I renew my warning, made many times this year, that eighteen months after that Agreement, the apparatus of terror is still intact, the violence continues, and not one gun or bomb has been dismantled or given up. I say that until that changes, no more terrorist murderers should be released from jail.The Leader of the Liberal Party, Charles Kennedy, says that I\u2019m irresponsible for saying this. He thinks opposition politicians shouldn\u2019t speak out on these vital matters. I say that when murderers are being released onto our streets in direct contravention of the assurances given to the people of Northern Ireland and the Agreement itself, it is the absolute duty of the Leader of the Opposition to raise his voice in protest. God save us from the spineless crawling to the Government of Liberal politicians. We believe in the strength of the Union and our four nations in one nation. That means making the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly work. But it also means that voters of England must be properly represented in the British constitution.I say that issues that only affect England should be voted on only by English MPs. We cannot go on for ever with a situation where the MPs for Lancashire cannot vote on anything happening in Glasgow, but the MPs for Glasgow can vote on everything happening here in Lancashire. So central to our Common Sense Revolution will be this: English votes on English laws.And we believe in the independence of Britain. For a crucial moment has arrived. A battle of ideas has commenced over the value of nation in the modem world. Tony Blair has joined this battle on the side of those who have no use for the independence of nation. But the forces of Conservatism will stand where they have always stood. We will stand for the nation. For Conservatives believe in nation. Conservatives believe in nation because nations allow democracy founded on a common political culture, and Conservatives believe in democracy. Conservatives believe in nation because nations allow justice and fairness to be defended as part of a shared moral understanding, and Conservatives believe in justice and fairness. Conservatives believe in nation because nations depend on tradition and protect tradition, and Conservatives believe in the value of tradition.When Conservatives defend nation, we are accused of defending everything that is small and narrow and petty in life. I believe that, on the contrary, when Conservatives defend nation we are defending so much that is great and large and generous in life. So Conservatives believe in nation and we will defend nation. Now we must join battle to defeat new, pervasive, foolish ideas which threaten our country. There is the foolish idea that the nation cannot survive in the modem world. I think the people who advance this idea are simply wrong about the future. I look around me and I see the coming age of the small unit and the individual on the internet, an age when young people are just as ready to jump on a plane to Thailand as to Greece, or send emails to California as quickly as they send them to Calais.To young people the idea of spending the next generation building a centralised political state in Western Europe is an idea left behind by history. This is the age of the small and flexible nation state seizing worldwide opportunities. And there is the foolish idea that a single European state is inevitable and that we will miss out on great opportunities if we don\u2019t go along with it. Above all else, Conservatives will resist this miserable defeatist creed. For if we can resist it then Britain will be ideally placed to seize the opportunities of the modern world. We are the lucky inheritors of a country with unique advantages in the world: a unique relationship with Europe, unique relationships too with America and with the Commonwealth. We have the huge advantages of our language, of our open and democratic traditions, of our political stability and our history of trade and diplomacy across the globe. We have the finest armed forces in the world, deployed all over the globe.As the world economy becomes more intensely competitive, as businesses have to adapt more quickly to shifts in trade, the growth of e-commerce and the rise of new markets, it must make sense for we, the British, to widen, extend and capitalise on our advantages rather than give them away. It must make sense not to adopt the rules and regulations of other countries, but to get rid of more of our own. It must make sense not to adopt the high-taxes of our neighbours, but to widen the gap between our taxes and theirs. It must make sense not to turn Europe into a fortress against the future, but to build a Europe that reaches out to Eastern Europe and the rest of the world. It must make sense not to turn our back on the continent, but to exploit the opportunities of Britain\u2019s membership of the European Union and the Single Market. But it must also make sense not to drive for ever closer political union, but to create a flexible and open European Union of nation states. When we\u2019re in government, the next new EU Treaty must contain a flexibility clause, or else I tell you there will be no new Treaty. It must make sense to be in Europe, not run by Europe. And it must make sense, too, not to feel guilty about having a national currency, but to use to the full the freedom that comes from having our own.That is why it is so important at the next election to elect a Government committed to keeping the pound, and that is our Sterling Guarantee. The Liberals want to scrap the pound as soon as possible. Tony Blair wants to scrap it too, if he ever has the courage to say so. I intend to go on saying the pure unadulterated truth: I say the economic case for the Euro on its performance is utterly unconvincing; I say the implications of the Euro for our right to govern ourselves could be immense; I say the advantages for us of keeping the pound could be enormous. I say we are the fifth largest economy in the world and we can make a success of our own currency if we wish to do so. And I say to the people of Britain that the only way to save the Pound is to vote Conservative at the next election.Yes, a battle of ideas has commenced over the value of nation in the modem world. This Party will not be found wanting. This country has such great strengths. Our traditions. Our institutions. Our values. The instincts of our people. The Conservative Party trusts in these things and we will protect these things. We always have and we always will. That\u2019s what our Common Sense Revolution is all about.That\u2019s why I got involved in politics in the first place. I just want people at least to be able to do the basic things in life. To keep more of what they earn and save; to be left in peace to get on with their lives; to be able to drive their car they worked so hard to get without being despised or penalised; to be protected from theft and violence; to expect decent services in return for all that money they pay in tax; to be allowed to live in a free and independent nation. These things don\u2019t seem to me to be too much to ask. Yet in every generation there come those who think they\u2019ve got a better idea, who think Government is better at spending money than those who earned it, and better at managing public services than those who work in them and use them, and better at determining the future of this country than those who live in it. That\u2019s why we need the Common Sense Revolution.This week we have only just begun. We will have to be prepared for boldness and imagination as great as anything that this Party has shown before. Don\u2019t tell me that it\u2019s difficult, because I know that; or that it has risks, because that is inevitable; or that it will be controversial, because I relish it. Let us instead hold up our heads and say: these are our beliefs. This is where we stand. This is our Common Sense Revolution.And so I say to the people of Britain: if you believe that our country is unique in the world but is in danger of losing its identity; if you believe that Britain is a place where you should be rewarded for doing the right thing, hut now you are penalised for it; if you believe in Britain as a healthy democracy, but that the standards of democracy are now being tarnished and diminished; if you believe in Britain as a country where the law is enforced and respected, but that now it is not respected enough; if you believe in Britain as a country that will work with its neighbours but never submit to being governed by anyone else; if you believe in an independent Britain, then come with me, and I will give you back your country.

aVNo prime minister, no party leader, could have a better deputy than John Prescott. You know why the Tories hate him: because he started out as a seaman, steward on a ship, rose to be deputy prime minister and has never hidden or been anything other than totally proud of where he came from. And you know why I like him: because not once in the last two weeks has he reminded me that when he was in charge in August we were 20 points ahead in the polls.I set out today the next steps of our journey to renew our country.Prosperity spreading to all parts of Britain.Secondary schools transformed.A modern NHS.A 21st century transport system.The yob culture tackled.On the way to ending child poverty.On the road to full employment.The people\u2019s priorities our priorities.That is a second term vision worth fighting for.Our destination: a Britain where, in a world of change, everyone not just a few gets the chance to succeed.For me, the large majority we won was never a reason to do the job quickly; but to do it properly. We knew: first base was getting the fundamentals in place. We said we would sort the economy out. We have. The strongest British economy for decades, delivered by this New Labour government. We said we\u2019d get people off benefit and into work. We are. 1 million more jobs. We said we\u2019d invest in schools and hospitals. It is happening. And because we chose to invest; because we have in this country tens of thousands of dedicated hard working teachers as determined as we are to give every child a chance to succeed, last week, Britain had the best primary school results it has ever seen. That is what I call: delivering on the fundamentals.And I could go on and give a list of all the other promises kept and change delivered.Over a million children out of poverty.This government leading the way on the environment at Kyoto.Devolution to the people of Scotland, Wales and London.Progress in Northern Ireland. Free eye tests for pensioners.Higher benefits for disabled children. 150,000 lone parents into work.Lowest business taxes. Record rises in child benefit.I could go on and on. Because we should be proud of our record. Not self-satisfied. Never complacent. But plain proud because the firm foundations we promised to lay are in place.But this is not a time for lists. But for setting out the big choices facing Britain and for dialogue.I\u2019m the prime minister that\u2019s supposed to be the great reader of public opinion. After the events of two weeks ago, it\u2019s no wonder the government has taken a knock. It happened on my watch and I take responsibility. So: what do we make of it?Three years ago, Britain was desperate to get the Tories out. The people liked the look of us. We were a breath of fresh air. New faces, new ideas, new policies. In some areas we\u2019ve exceeded expectations. Let us be honest, a few people doubted the economy would be stronger under Labour. But it is. They like the 1m new jobs. They believe we are trying to make progress on schools and hospitals.But for many families life\u2019s still a struggle. It\u2019s tough, balancing work and family. Jobs can be insecure. There\u2019s the mortgage to pay; the holiday to save for. Inflation may be lower but the kids\u2019 trainers don\u2019t get any cheaper. Then, people hear the 20 second clip on the news. They see the ding-dong at prime minister\u2019s questions. They try to make sense of the swirling mass of news and comment in the 24-hour media age. And they think: you\u2019re not listening. What\u2019s it got to do with me? Where is this journey\u2019s end? And a fog descends on the very dialogue between Government and people necessary to get there.And, yes, there are things we have done that have made people angry and we should be open enough to admit it.The dome. Hindsight is a wonderful thing, and if I had my time again, I would have listened to those who said governments shouldn\u2019t try to run big visitor attractions.75p. I tell you now, as Gordon made crystal clear yesterday, we get the message.But I believe that when people reflect, on the big fundamentals that determine our future - the economy, jobs, public services - we are doing the right thing, and we are on the right track for Britain; and the last thing this country needs is a return to Tory government.Let me come direct to the fuel crisis. I owe you an explanation. Yes, petrol is expensive. But of the 14p rise since the Budget last year, 12 pence has been in the world oil price. Which is why these protests have taken place all over the world.It\u2019s true that it\u2019s cheaper elsewhere in Europe. But VAT is often higher there. Income tax is higher. Business taxes are higher. There are road tolls and higher national insurance charges. All in all, Britain has the lowest overall tax burden of any large industrialised nation in the world except Japan and the USA. In the USA, you don\u2019t have the NHS. It\u2019s true that there will be extra revenues coming to government as a result of higher oil prices. But they nowhere near cover the protesters\u2019 demands.And there\u2019s something more. I am listening to people\u2019s anger over fuel duties. For hauliers and farmers to say nothing of ordinary motorists, there is real hardship.But I have also had to listen over under-funding in the NHS.Over extra investment in schools.Over more police on the beat.Over public transport.I am listening over mortgages, where low interest rates can only be maintained if disciplined public finances are kept.I am also listening to pensioners who believe the government should give them a greater share of the country\u2019s prosperity.Our first priority was to help the 2 million pensioners, many of them elderly women, who depend on income support. I make no apology for helping the poorest first and neither should this Party. Through the winter allowance, now £150, and free TV licences for over 75s, we helped people with their most pressing costs.We rejected returning to the earnings link. For the next two or three years we could afford it; but 10, 15 years down the line, it would have imposed a huge financial burden on a future generation that would have been unfair to them. We want to do more for middle and lower income pensioners. You do not meet long term need by giving the wealthiest the same help as the poorest.But I know there are pensioners not on benefit, who have saved all their lives but are not by any stretch of the imagination wealthy, and for whom the basic state pension and other government help is essential. It is right they share in the nation\u2019s wealth.I am listening. I hear. And I will act.The point I\u2019m making is this. The real world is full of competing causes. Most of them good. Most of them deserving. Many of them heart-rending. And it\u2019s not an arrogant government that chooses priorities. It\u2019s an irresponsible government that fails to choose.The test of leadership in politics is not how eloquently you say yes. It\u2019s how you explain why you\u2019re saying no.To be in touch is to be in sympathy.To be in government is to decide.And would it ever be right to choose a priority simply on the basis of a fuel blockade? What of those who can\u2019t protest; whose voice isn\u2019t supported by the media; who go neglected unless we speak for them?So I am listening.But I was also elected to lead.And if we want to reach our journey\u2019s end - that strong, fair and prosperous Britain for all - there are choices to be made. There are forks in the road, where which way we take determines the future lives of millions of people. They are decisions of destiny and I would like to explain them.The first big choice: a government with the strength to deliver stability, or a government that takes the country back to boom and bust. Without economic strength, there will never be a Britain where everyone can succeed. Remember the late 80s/early 90s, interest rates at 10% for four years, 15% for a year. One million families in negative equity. Record repossessions.Contrary to the myth, we inherited an economy trapped in a cycle of boom and bust; interest rates above those in our main competitors; and a big budget deficit. That was them after 18 years. After 3 years of us, ask yourselves this. Why has this country now got the lowest inflation rate in Europe?Employment and vacancies at record levels?The budget deficit, turned into the highest surplus in any major European country?It is not luck that we enjoy this economic strength. It is not coincidence.It is the result of choices, hard choices, taken by this government. By Gordon Brown, one of the most inspired chancellors this country has seen. Bank of England independence. Opposed by the Conservatives.Sorting out the nation\u2019s finances. Opposed by the Conservatives.The cheek of these Tories arguing about how we spend the surplus.Let us remind them.In May 1997, we didn't have a surplus. We had a national debt so large we were paying as much in interest payments on the debt as on schools and police put together.Today the Tories are back with exactly the plan of 10 years ago. You don\u2019t need me to predict it. We all experienced it. Don\u2019t ever let them con us into boom and bust again.The second big choice: a government with the strength to help people through change, or a government that leaves you to fend for yourself.Never forget: in 18 Tory years, unemployment trebled. Families of three generations with nobody bringing in a wage. Record youth unemployment. And what did they say: it was a price worth paying. Unemployment is never a price worth paying. The New Deal has helped nearly a million people with work or training, the largest ever jobs programme Britain has seen. The Working Families\u2019 Tax Credit makes work pay for over a million families. Childcare and training has helped 150,000 women find work or get a better job.A woman wrote to me recently and said that, for the first time in her life, thanks to the Working Families\u2019 Tax Credit, she could afford a holiday and thanks to the Social Chapter, she was entitled to one.And at long last a national statutory minimum wage has given 1½ million people the dignity of a decent living wage.And we have introduced the democratic right, delivered after 100 years of trying, to be represented by a trade union should you want it.That was our choice. Not to leave you at the mercy of markets. Not to walk by. Not to say: tough, sink or swim.Every single one of those measures was opposed by the Conservatives.Every single one fought against, tooth and nail.That was their choice. And though they say they support the national minimum wage now, does anyone believe them? Their policies may change every five minutes. Their prejudices will never change.And in the next stage we need to do more. Because the pace of change will quicken. It\u2019s not just poorer families that need help. To give everyone the chance to succeed, right in the heartlands of middle Britain, there are families and businesses that will need that helping hand.And because of the scale of what we are doing, and the scale of our ambition, let me set out in detail what we are doing, and what we will do in the future.Because 90% of new jobs will need skills with computers, there will be 6000 centres round Britain, giving access to the internet and help with technology. Everyone will get an 80% discount on computer courses, the unemployed will get it for free. There will be 1000 more technology centres for small businesses or the self-employed.Because we want to stay ahead in the new technologies we are investing £2¼ billion over five years in British science, the largest investment since the 1960s.Because we know small businesses are a big part of the future, we are setting up venture capital funds in every region, tax breaks for investment, cuts in small business tax and the new Small Business Service to act as their advocate and protector in government.And because we know the danger that in a changing world new forms of inequality and social exclusion are created: the Sure Start programme - £500 million - to help children in poverty; a new Careers Service for school leavers; cutting homelessness and helping the homeless get jobs; a £1 billion programme to renew deprived neighbourhoods; and extending the New Deal in the unemployment blackspots of Britain.I want to be the first prime minister in 40 years to stand up and say; Britain is back at full employment.But it all depends on having the strength to make the choice.Not by leaping aboard every passing bandwagon.There\u2019s Mr Hague. Standing around waiting for a bandwagon. Then three come along at once. There he was, week after week, glued to the box, to see who was voted out of Big Brother. And then announced it had always been Tory policy to throw them out.Opportunism always knocks for William Hague.You want tax cuts? Have them.Spending rises? Have them too.It all makes sense after 14 pints. Everything makes sense after 14 pints.John Redwood looks sane. Michael Portillo looks loyal.After 14 pints, even William Hague looks like a prime minister.The third big choice: a government with the strength to invest for the long term, or a government that cuts our public services.For 18 years, Britain suffered chronic under-investment in our public services. It held people back; it reduced opportunity. How could we reach a Britain where everyone can succeed, when, in May \u201997 half, literally half, of all 11-year-olds failed their basic tests?Or the NHS was on its knees.Or our transport system was the poor man of Europe?So to get to the next stage of our journey.Our education, health and transport plans represent the most radical reform in public services over ten years any government has produced since the War.So again, let me set out in detail the journey so far, and the plans for a second term.So far, 11,000 schools with new buildings.120,000 more free nursery places.As well as the best ever primary school tests, three hundred thousand fewer infants in classes of more than 30.300 more specialist secondary schools, improving their results at twice the average for other schools.A £200m reform programme to improve inner city comprehensives.A billion pound investment in our teachers to reward excellence in the classroom.But this is only the beginning. The next stage on the journey requires not only excellent primary schools but first-class secondary schools.By 2004, there will be one thousand specialist schools.An extra billion pound investment in ICT, to ensure one computer to every five children in our secondary schools.Catch-up tuition for all 11- and 12 year-olds who arrive without good literacy and numeracy.New targets for 14- and 16-year-olds.Better incentives for staying on at school, and an overhaul of further education to raise standards.New bursaries for student teachers of up to £10,000, with already a 50% rise in graduate applications.And all these are policies that flow from our central belief that every single child deserves an equal chance. That every child is a unique asset to be brought to their fullest potential. It is why we are in this party. It is why education is the passion of this government.In our manifesto, line one of our contract with the people promised to increase the share of our national wealth spent on education during this Parliament.A promise made. A promise kept.Today I make a further commitment.Line one of the contract in the next manifesto will be a promise to increase the share of our national wealth spent on education in the next Parliament.Education. Education. Education. Then. Now. And in the future.Again, on health, let me set out the scale of our plans, for now and for a second term.The waiting list pledge has been met.There are 10,000 more nurses in the NHS.Every A&E that needs it is being modernised.The biggest ever hospital building programme is under way.But we all know. 18 years of neglect isn\u2019t put right in three years.Earlier this year we got the money to plan for a five year record rise in NHS spending. But we are New Labour. We don\u2019t just spend. Alan Milburn and I sat down with people in the NHS and said it's a deal: we provide the cash, you rise to the challenge of modernising the NHS. They responded magnificently.Our NHS plan is something the party can be proud of. The NHS was the greatest achievement of the post-war Labour government. It was based on a single, clear, enduring value: that healthcare should be based on need not ability to pay. Some objected to that principle then. Some urge us to abandon it now. But this party, the Labour party will never abandon what was one of the greatest civilising acts of emancipation this country has ever known.Under the plan, for the first time a system of inspection and accountability for all parts of the NHS, with new money to reward good performance.For the first time, nurses and other health professionals given the bigger roles that their qualifications and expertise deserve.For the first time local health services and local social services brought closer together in one organisation.For the first time, the NHS and the private sector in a proper partnership to deliver healthcare.For the first time, money set aside specifically to get rid of the dirty corridors, the poor food, the mixed sex wards which demoralise patients and staff.For the first time, new consultants trained within the NHS, paid for by the taxpayer, will give the early years of their service exclusively to National Health Service patients.Today, as we set out the next steps, I want to focus on cancer.There will be nobody in this hall, or watching from their homes, who has not seen a friend or family member struck down by cancer.As things stand, one in every four people in this country will die of cancer.Under the plan we publish tomorrow, there will be 1000 more cancer specialists over the next six years - up nearly a third.295 new scanners and radio-therapy machines so that for the first time the NHS can meet proper equipment standards for diagnosing and treating cancer.By 2003 for the first time the government will be matching pound for pound charity funding for cancer research.Cancer patients in all parts of the country will get the right drugs at the right time, regardless of where they live. The postcode lottery ended. Waiting times will be cut. Maximum two weeks from GP appointment to first hospital appointment for suspected urgent cases. And, as we increase the number of specialists, a maximum wait of one month from diagnosis to treatment starting.And because breast cancer kills 11,000 women every year, because it causes so much pain and suffering among Britain's families, we will extend breast cancer screening to all women aged over 65, helping an extra 400,000 women by 2004.Then on transport, in July John Prescott and Gus Macdonald set out in detail Britain's first ever transport plan, a unique 10 year £180 billion partnership between public and private sector to renew our transport system.A massive programme for the second term. It will take time. Investment. And a Labour government to see it through.The Conservatives have made their choice.They are committed to £16bn of cuts in our investment.When they made this commitment, I asked for research on what sort of things you'd have to cut over a 12 month period to deliver on a £16bn cuts guarantee. Back came the answer.20,000 doctors. Cut.Plus 20,000 prison officers. Cut.Plus 40,000 nurses. Cut.Plus 40,000 teachers. Cut.Plus 40,000 police officers. Cut under the Tory cuts guarantee.And then: 20 hospitals. Shut.150 secondary schools. Shut. 500 primary schools. Shut under the Tory cuts guarantee.And we\u2019ve still got five billion pounds to go. How will they get there?The biggest ever rise in child benefit. Cut.Free TV licences for 3 million pensioners. Cut.The £150 winter fuel allowance. Cut under the Tory cuts guarantee.1200 intensive care beds. Cut.Free eye tests for pensioners. Cut. 250 cancer scanners. Cut.Half a million nursery places. Cut. 100,000 childcare places. Cut under the Tory cuts guarantee.And just to round it up to £16 billion, the country's entire arts and sports budget. Cut under the Tory cuts guarantee.And in every constituency, in every part of this country, we will force every Tory candidate to say where the cuts will fall.The fourth big choice: a government with the strength to build strong communities, or a government that believes there is no such thing in society.Crime, anti-social behaviour, racial intolerance, drug abuse, destroy families and communities. They destroy the very respect for others on which society is founded. They blight the life chances of thousands of young people and the quality of life of millions more. Fail to confront this evil and we will never build a Britain where everyone can succeed.So we invest to give opportunity. Not just in jobs and services.Today we set out plans to invest £750million of lottery money in schools and community sport as part of a £1billion investment over three years. It\u2019s a policy we have put together with Trevor Brooking, chairman of Sport England, who has flown here from Sydney and who believes passionately, as I do, that this is not just a sports policy. It\u2019s a health policy, an education policy, an anti-crime policy, an anti-drugs policy.By acknowledging the duty to care, we earn the right to be tough on crime. 4 out of 10 violent crimes are alcohol related. Half of property crime drug-related.It is time for zero tolerance of the yob culture. Time to stand up for the pensioner afraid to go out. Time to stand up for the single mothers scared to walk to the shops. Time to stand up to the thugs and the bullies. Time to tighten bail to deal with the absurdity of people released in the morning committing offences in the afternoon. Time to give the police powers to close pubs where there is fighting. Time to give them powers to ban drink in public places. Time to give them the power to impose curfews on children up to 16 and time to use them. Time to give them the power without the hassle of endless forms and court bureaucracy, to issue fixed penalty fines for loutish behaviour. Time to give offenders on drugs a choice: get treatment or lose your liberty because society needs protection from you.These measures require legislation. So will the new and sweeping powers we intend to give to the police and customs to investigate organised crime and to confiscate their assets. If they need further powers, they will get them.You don\u2019t beat today\u2019s drug gangs by applying the Queensberry rules. It is time the law enforcement agencies were able to do as much damage to organised crime as organised crime does to our communities.We have increased funding for victim support, and given special help to victims of rape and sexual offences, but we need to do more.- They should get full information about the progress of the case.- About the sentence, and about the release of the criminal.- Proper compensation, backed by a Victims\u2019 Ombudsman.And, I believe that the victim of a crime should be able to give a written assessment of the impact of the crime upon them, which should be presented in open court, and taken into account when sentencing decisions are made.Standing up to criminals. Standing up for victims. Another big project for the second term of a Labour government.The fifth choice: a government that leads in the world, or a government that retreats into isolation.This is a world moving closer together. In money and trade; the environment; defence and security; the war against drugs and crime; even today the call for lower oil prices: strength comes through partnership; influence through international engagement.Standing up for Britain means standing up for our armed services.Standing up for Britain means know we are stronger with the US if we are stronger in Europe, and stronger in Europe if we are stronger with the US.Standing up for Britain means standing up for British jobs and British industry.On the Euro, standing up for Britain means taking the decision in the interests of Britain, not the interests of the internal warfare inside the Tory party.I believe we should join if the economics are right. At present, they aren\u2019t.But the choice at the election is not whether we join: that decision is for the people in a referendum.The issue is: do we rule out joining? Do we rule out even the option?How is that standing up for Britain, Britain\u2019s jobs, Britain\u2019s industry, the living standards of Britain\u2019s people?And standing up for Britain means standing up for our values overseas, in Sierra Leone, in Kosovo. And I say to Milosevic. You lost. Go. Your country and the world has suffered enough.These are the choices we make.These are our second term plans.A ten-year plan for a modern NHS. The transformation of secondary education.A cradle to grave poverty strategy.A plan to harness new technology to spread prosperity to all. A plan to make our streets safe and our society strong. A 10 year plan for modern transport.The next steps to full employment.This is a programme worth fighting for. A second term more radical than the first. A quickening of the pace of reform. The next steps on our journey. All based on our enduring mission, to offer everyone, not just the privileged few, the chance to succeed.And lighting our path is this belief: that today a strong economy and a strong society are two sides of the same coin.To succeed as an economy we develop the talents of all.To be a fair society, we give opportunity to all.The political consequences are historic; self-interest and the common good are at long last in alliance.Look at the irony of the Tory years. The Tories who said only they could manage the economy ended up with boom and bust. The Tory party that said it would get tough on benefit claimants, ended up spending more on social security than schools and hospitals put together. The Tory party that said it would stand up for the family, presided over more instability, more single parents on benefit, more truancy, more juvenile crime than any in history.Why? Because they offered short-term tax cuts that could not be sustained rather than investing for the long-term.Because they thought there was no such thing as society.In the world of the 80s that might have been cruel; in the 21st century it simply won\u2019t work.Do you know how much we save from almost 1 million fewer welfare claimants since we took power. £4 billion per annum. Enough for 75,000 nurses and 70,000 teachers.Do you know how much it would cost to take out private medical insurance, as the Tories want? Over £1500 a year for the average family.Do you know the cost to the British economy of transport congestion a year? The equivalent of 8p on your income tax.Do you know why we say this is a learn more, earn more world? Because a graduate earns 40 % more than the average.On your side for the Tories means nodding along with your prejudices - English language lessons for foreign doctors - you know they\u2019re not talking about the Swiss.But really being on your side is to be there with you on the big questions, on the fundamentals.What began as a moral crusade is now also the path to prosperity. What started as a belief in the equal worth of all is also a programme for wealth creation.Realism and idealism at last in harmony.So when the Tories say: we\u2019ll cut Labour\u2019s investment and give you tax cuts, it\u2019s a fool\u2019s game. We will cut tax for people as we can, but will do it in a way that lasts not at the expense of the very stability and investment on which the wealth and security of millions of families depend.So that is my explanation. That\u2019s why I won\u2019t take the easy way. Because that way we cannot reach our journey\u2019s end.And all that really stands between us and our destination is confidence. And trust.The confidence that gives us strength to make the choices; the trust that there is a vision, an end to believe in.Don\u2019t tell me that a country with our history and heritage, that today boasts six of the top ten businesses in the whole of Europe, with London the top business city in Europe, that is a world leader in technology and communication and the businesses of the future, that under us has overtaken France and Italy to become the fourth largest economy in the world, that has the language of the new economy, more brilliant artists, actors and directors than any comparable country in the world, some of the best scientists and inventors in the world, the best armed forces in the world, the best teachers and doctors and nurses, the best people any nation could wish for.Don't tell me with all that going for us that we do not have the spirit to meet all the challenges before us.For that is another choice; confidence or cynicism. All we need is the confidence to make the right choice for the future.Just as we did in the party so, on a larger scale, the same is true for Britain. We are on a journey of renewal. Before us lies a path strewn with the challenges of change.But the purpose of our journey is not to lose our values as a nation: but to make them live on.And for us, this government, this party that believes passionately in a Britain where everyone not just a few get a chance to succeed, and knows the Tories will only take us backwards, we now know:We are in a fight and it\u2019s a fight I relish.For it is a fight for the future, the heart and the soul of our country.A fight for fairness. A fight for jobs. A fight for our schools. A fight for our hospitals. A fight for a new vision in which the old conflict between prosperity and social justice is finally banished to the history books in which it belongs.We do not lie down in the testing times.We hold firm. We listen and we lead.We can be confident in our policies, confident in the record we will put before the British people.Confident that we will repay the trust the British people put in us.Confident that we share their basic decent instincts and values.Confident that we are winning the big arguments on the big issues.Stability. Or boom and bust.Jobs. Or unemployment.Investment in schools and hospitals. Or cuts.Leadership and engagement in the world. Or weakness and sour isolation.Our journey\u2019s end: a Britain where any child born in this millennium, whatever their background, race or creed, wherever they live, whoever their parents, is able to make the most of the God-given ability they bring into this world.That journey is a journey worth making.A fight worth fighting.A fight we must win.

aVFour weeks ago 28 short days, men whose hearts were shrouded in hate and whose minds were in the grip of a twisted ideology, drove three aircraft into three buildings. The result: 7,000 human beings are dead - Catholics and Protestants, Hindus, Muslims and Jews - they have all found a unity in death, and their death has united us all. Families across the world now mourn. We mourn with them. What can it be like to have watched the unfolding tragedy and then go home to find your husband saying farewell on the answer-phone? What words can adequately describe the selfless determination of those who went to save lives or to comfort the victims and ended up as victims themselves? We say to the families whose tragedy we witnessed, we do not pretend to know the depths of your despair, but your nobility helps us in our determination to act.Our hearts, our thoughts and our prayers are with you wherever you are. The men responsible for the outrages in America must pay for their evil. So we stand in full support of our American friends in this war against terrorism. This is not about revenge - it is about justice, it is about doing what is right. This war against terrorism is our war. The cold, callous and merciless attacks in America were the work of terrorists who knew no moral limits. They have struck before, they will strike again - we are right to strike at them. We cannot secure peace by standing aside from war. We cannot end danger by putting safety before our friends. We cannot conquer fear, by fearing to act ourselves.ConfirmationThe terrorists who attacked America also have us in their sights. Not because of what we in Britain have done, but because of what we and America stand for. Britain and the United States have become the enemy because we are beacons of democracy and champions of freedom. We are homes to people of all faiths and none. We are countries in which every individual can find fulfilment in their own way. For bin Laden and his fanatics, the very nature of liberal democracy is an affront.NATO and AmericaWhen civilisation is attacked, civilised nations must spring to each other\u2019s defence. That is why NATO remains the cornerstone of our security. I don\u2019t know about you, but I felt reassured when NATO backed this action. Invoking collective security is the most powerful statement a friend and ally can make. But it takes more than words. It requires means and the political will to use them. NATO has both, that is what has made it so effective over more than half a century. Nothing must be done to undermine its purpose or diminish its capability. And that is what is so dangerous about the plan for a European Army.We must never allow political ambitions to stand in the way of our national defence. International coalitions have their place and international approval is useful too. But our mission should shape the coalition, not the other way around. Diplomacy must be for a purpose and our purpose is to dismantle the apparatus of terror.There are those who say we must not give America blank cheques, that we must speak to them as candid friends, that we must position ourselves to limit, to cavil and to carp. I have to ask what jaundiced view of America animates such people. The response of President Bush and the American people to a grievous assault has been dignified, restrained and measured. Who are these people to patronise a great nation in its grief?Middle EastPerhaps, some people say, a changed approach to a troubled region or a review of American foreign policy would deflect the terrorists\u2019 wrath. I have to ask them if they truly appreciate the nature of the threat we face. Two years ago, the terrorists responsible for the atrocities in America were planning their massacres. At that time, hopes for a settlement in the Middle East were high. And America was the sponsor of that process.The terrorists did not target a policy, but a people. Their quarrel is not with the course set by a democracy, but with democracy itself. They are fanatics who view compromise and negotiation as weakness. They are an enemy against whom we must deploy all our reserves of strength. They are the enemy we must defeat.Armed ForcesThat\u2019s why the moral, political and financial support we give our armed forces is so vital. Let us pause to remember that as we meet here the men and women of our armed forces, across the world, are now risking their lives. They do it, as they always do, with unparalleled professionalism, courage and distinction. We owe our armed forces a debt we can never repay. But there is one thing we can do. We can show a clarity, a direction and a singleness of purpose which will not diminish over time.My father\u2019s generation risked their lives so that we could grow up in freedom. Sixty years ago, a close friend of my fathers summed up their attitude like this: \u2018I shall go to war believing I am fighting against oppression and devilry, but I expect I shall die because we should never have tolerated the ineptitude of gutless politicians for so long.\u2019 Thirty four years later, as a nervous, worried soldier on patrol in Northern Ireland, I looked up and I saw a poster calling for an end to violence. It read \u2018Seven years is enough.\u2019Two generations, the same lesson: that the price of freedom is eternal vigilance. Successive generations of terrorists have believed that the resolve of the West to act is weak. No matter what the atrocity, the West will lose interest, its resolve will fade and they can get on with planning the next outrage. We must show the terrorists they are wrong.Cold warThe illusion that the fall of the Berlin Wall ended threats to our way of life can no longer be sustained. We must accept that we still live in a dangerous world, and wishing won\u2019t make it otherwise. On September 11th we received a wakeup call. It showed the depravity and the wicked intent of bin Laden and those who would follow in his path.There are those who say that because they struck with passenger jets loaded with fuel, it is pointless to defend ourselves against weapons yet more lethal. But who now can doubt that if these terrorists had the means they would use nuclear, biological or chemical weapons? Against such weapons we are all but defenceless. And against such people, fanatics without fear or reason, we must defend ourselves at every level. For the threat can come in many forms: the suicide bomber, the terrorist network armed with Sarin gas or anthrax, the rogue state with its ballistic missiles armed with nuclear warheads. That is why I have called for the strengthening of our home defences. That\u2019s why I have urged support for US plans to build a missile defence shield that would protect us too. New threats require new thinking. We must never again be unprepared.IslamBin Laden\u2019s terrorists sought to draw Islam into fundamental conflict with the non-Islamic world. They must not be allowed to succeed. Muslim nations Jordan, Central Asian states, Gulf states, Saudi Arabia - even Pakistan, which stands on the very edge of the conflict - have rallied round the cause of defeating terrorism. The security of their world is at stake as well as ours. These governments have shown great courage and we must stand by our proven friends. So let me say again, the enemy is not Islam. It never has been. We will defend religious freedom as vigorously as the other freedoms we hold dear. We do this because that is what we stand for as a nation. Bin Laden claims to speak for Islam, but he cannot. His is a cynical and suicidal cult dedicated to the destruction of civilisations and lives, irrespective of their faith. This is a man who sends young acolytes to die for his own pathological purpose, while he himself skulks in caves. This is a man who prefers martyrdom at a distance.Human rightsWe must hold on to our respect for civil liberties - it is, after all, what marks out our open society from the tyranny of the men of violence. But in many areas of our life, we shall also have to find a new balance between human rights and human safety. The Human Rights Act passed two years ago is proving an obstacle to protecting the lives of British citizens. When we cannot deport those who threaten the life of a British Prime Minister and promote terrorism from the safety of our own country; when we cannot refuse entry to terrorist suspects on the grounds of national security; when we cannot even extradite people accused of violence against America to the United States - then it is time to change the law.Terrorism and crimeProtecting our nation means we must understand the links between international terrorism and organised crime. Drugs such as heroin and cocaine which blight the lives of so many of the young and vulnerable in our towns and cities. They are produced, distributed and smuggled into this country by terrorist networks. The Taliban buy the weapons which kill their own people with the profits from heroin which kills our own children. The Colombian terror groups fund their murderous activities with the cocaine which destroys the lives of their citizens and ours.Criminality sustains terror networks across the globe. Its reach is felt from the World Trade Centre to the street corners of Moss Side, Brixton and Belfast. Within our own nation, the IRA and so-called loyalist paramilitaries continue to make millions through their criminal rackets - drug running, petrol smuggling, and extortion. They inflict savage beatings, shootings and mutilations on people in their own communities. We cannot be indifferent to the suffering of those, many of them our poorest, who are the victims of these criminal gangs. We cannot afford to be neutral in the war on terror - for it threatens the security and lives of our citizens daily. We shall not rest until there is an end to terror in the United Kingdom. That means tackling the mafia sub-culture that sustains it. And it means all the arms still held by Northern Ireland\u2019s paramilitaries being put permanently beyond use - once and for all. Otherwise there can be no place for the representatives of terrorists in the Government of Northern Ireland.Insecurity at homeBut it\u2019s not just these threats that disturb our peace of mind today. Different worries, growing fast in recent years, make our society more fearful of the future. That\u2019s true, of course, for some groups above all: farmers and fishermen with their livelihoods extinguished; road hauliers driven into bankruptcy by higher taxes; people looking forward to retirement who have seen the value of their savings tumble. And over the years there has been a strange paradox at work. As we have grown more prosperous as a nation, it sometimes seems that we have lost some of certainties that made us feel comfortable and safe in our own surroundings. Streets in our towns that we\u2019ve known all our lives are now places that we fear. Standards of civility that were once the norm have given way to selfishness and aggression. The sight of police officers on our streets has become so rare that on many of our estates older people are afraid to venture out. Our citizens have the right to effective protection.Quality of life and public servicesAs Conservatives we are fiercely proud of our country, but we also know that much has gone wrong. Whether it is the air we breathe, the public transport we take to work, or the countryside we live in, there is a growing sense of unease that our quality of life is diminishing. In our country, the sick cannot get the treatment they need. In many of our inner cities the young do not receive the education they deserve. I call that shaming. We are the fourth richest country on earth. We should be providing public services that match those of our European neighbours, not those of the Third World.Why are people less likely to survive cancer in this country than in France or Germany? Why are schools failing here when children across Europe achieve so much more? Why do I get cases in my surgery of parents feeling so trapped by the lack of discipline and standards in their local schools that some feel forced to teach their children at home? Why did my constituent, waiting a year for a heart bypass operation, turn round as he was leaving my surgery, shrug his shoulders and say: You know they\u2019ve promised things will get better in a couple of years - problem is, I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve got a couple of months. No wonder the French health minister describes the British Health Service as intolerable.The sad fact is this: a generation ago, Britain was the sick man of Europe. Today Britain is the last place in Europe any man or woman would want to fall sick. Our European neighbours simply enjoy better hospitals and schools, because they put the needs of their people before the demands of dogma. If we are to live up to the demands of a new century, we must do the same. This is our greatest mission at home over the coming years: to assemble the coalition of charities and churches, the public and private sectors that will deliver results. We will bring an open mind to the task of reforming public services but we will also bring the best of British innovation, enterprise and energy to our task. Not for us the ideological baggage, the special favours for those who pay the political bills. For the Conservatives it is just the determination to succeed.We know from our own experiences that people are no longer willing to put up with public services politicians are inclined to hand out. We are long past the age when everyone was willing to queue passively for treatment in a hospital corridor the way they queued at the baker\u2019s during the War. The gentleman in Whitehall no longer knows best, and yet Labour still act as though they know better than we do. It isn\u2019t managers who treat illness, but doctors and nurses taking account of patients\u2019 needs. It is not bureaucrats who will educate our children, but teachers working with parents.To improve health and education in this country, your first thought must be for patients and parents. But that\u2019s not the Labour way. Their first thought is to preserve the existing system and their first instinct is to protect vested interests. There can be no progress without innovation, and no innovation without difference. Standards will rise faster in some areas than others. If you won\u2019t allow one foot to move in front of the other, you will stay standing still. So we will examine all the models available to us from all over the world and draw on expert opinion in this country. I have instructed the Shadow Cabinet to visit other countries, to see why it is that their public services are so much better than ours. And I\u2019ve told them to consult those who run our public services as well as those who rely on them.Who could fail to have been moved by what Frances Howard said yesterday? She said that discipline in our classrooms has collapsed to the point where it is almost impossible to teach. We will find ways to achieve the high standards in our schools and in our medical care which a hard-working, self-respecting country deserves.Economic stabilityImprovements in public services depend upon the health of our economy to pay for them. And the health of our economy depends on three factors:There is an old saying that \u2018a rising tide floats all ships\u2019. During its first term of office, the Government has relied on the rising tide of the global economy. The Chancellor has increased taxes, but, for many people, increasing income has made that less noticeable. And as the Chancellor has taxed more, he has spent more, and then more still. But it would be wrong to assume the tide always rises. Our economy is set for turbulent times ahead, and is in a weaker condition to withstand them than it was five years ago. Public spending has been allowed to run ahead of growth. Regulation has eaten away at the strength of our industries. Now more risk is being added to an already uncertain economy.We have been told that the course is now set for entry into the Euro. As a Party, we will oppose that. Whenever the referendum comes, we will fight to keep the Pound. And the clarity of our position means we can concentrate on the crisis in our hospitals, the failure in our schools and the crime on our streets, while others talk about a timetable for scrapping the Pound.As a nation we should be ready to weather difficult times together. But we must remember that our future would have been safer were it not for the hubris of believing that boom and bust had been abolished. Humility becomes us all. We will renew our policies with one aim in mind: we must deliver real solutions to real problems.Once before, a generation ago, we were faced with the task of turning Britain around. Then the challenges were mainly economic and industrial. In the 1980s and 1990s, we tamed the power of the unions and unleashed the latent spirit of enterprise within our nation. Time has moved on. Now we face a different set of challenges: to tackle insecurity, improve economic stability and bring first class public services to our people.These real problems face everyone in this country, wherever they live and wherever they come from. They confront us as parents or patients, as people who live in towns or cities or the countryside, whether we are young or old. They curb our ambitions, limit our dreams and add to our anxieties. They affect our friends and our families. They make for common concerns among complete strangers.As a Conservative, I am proud of what our Party has done for this country. As a British citizen, I am still prouder of what this country has done for the world. As the years go by, the mission of a Party, just like the destiny of a nation, changes. But we face change, and we lead others through change, on the foundations of values and beliefs which do not change.Let me give you just one instance of what I mean. And, being a politician, I\u2019m afraid it\u2019s drawn from my own experience. I was brought up in a family where public service wasn\u2019t just a shorthand for the public sector: it was a way of life. Life in the Forces left an indelible imprint on my childhood, so much so that I too became a soldier. I don\u2019t want to idealise Army life. But it was a life where loyalty, duty and honour counted. Later I went into industry and later still, for a time, I was unemployed. No one who\u2019s endured that worry while bringing up a family can possibly forget it. Eventually, after several years in publishing, I became a Member of Parliament. That too, frankly, had its ups and downs! And, in a sense, I found I\u2019d come full circle. Because being an MP was just an extension of that idea of public service which is such a defining feature of our nation\u2019s life.We all have our own stories, our own experiences of service. To those who ask what kind of people we actually are, I say: Go and find out who\u2019s volunteering for the local charity. Search out the people who put their hand in their pockets for good causes, without asking for praise or courting publicity. Look out for the quiet family who are striving to make ends meet and care for a disabled or sick relative. As likely as not, you\u2019ll discover a Conservative.We know that women, ethnic minorities and people of different lifestyles must have greater opportunity within our Party. And I shall do everything I can to give this effect. Not because I am interested in ensuring that the Conservative Party is politically correct, but because I want us to be politically effective. That means drawing on the widest possible pool of talent, recruiting and promoting on the basis of merit.And that is also why I will be intolerant of anyone who is intolerant of others. For me the essence of a Conservative is something beyond such talk of quotas and categories. At the heart of my Conservatism is a desire - one which is consuming, and unending - to serve the nation as a whole. To serve by defending our institutions and upholding our traditions. To serve by extending the benefits of a free and prosperous life to every corner of the land. To serve, above all, by making Britain a place where all our citizens feel proud to belong, a place we love, and one which we want our children and our grandchildren to love, as passionately as we do.Today, this country is engaged in a ferocious conflict, a struggle for civilisation itself. We should remember why we are fighting, what we believe, and who we are. Let\u2019s keep faith with ourselves and our ideals. Let\u2019s keep faith with freedom.

aVBetween now and the next General Election, we have to persuade millions of people up and down the country that this Conservative Party is fit for Government. That this Conservative Party is fit to govern this great country of ours.People say that we as politicians do not live in the real world. We don\u2019t deal with the problems that they face on a day to day basis. That we spend more time lecturing than we do listening, but most of all that we make promises that we know we cannot keep.This is the sound of a people tired of politics and crying out for change.And that is our challenge.That is my challenge.To listen to what they are telling us and to deliver.And by deliver, I don\u2019t mean going out and saying \u2018just trust me.\u2019That\u2019s not enough\u2026 and it does not work.If we as politicians do not show the people of Britain that we trust them to lead their own lives, then they will never again trust us.Trust them to choose their schools and hospitals, trust them to look after their families and trust them to run their businesses. Trust them.That is the message I will take to the people of Britain, every minute of every hour of every day until we take on this Government head to head at the next General Election.Conservatives in a time of changeA generation ago, the Conservative Party took tough and often unpopular decisions. We laid the foundations for the prosperity that many enjoy today and now we face a new generation of challenges.Millions more people own their own homes, but they fear to walk down their own street.We have more money \u2013 but we have less time for the things in life that are most important.Almost everyone here knows someone whose child is struggling with drug addiction.Our streets \u2013 once the safest in the world \u2013 are now dirty and dangerous.Britain has a successful economy. And yet our society seems more troubled than ever.We must first understand the way life in Britain is lived today, and not the way it was lived twenty years ago.We cannot remain the only part of Britain untouched by the changes that we ourselves unleashed.Yes, it is right to be proud of the past, but it is wrong to try and live in the past.This country has moved on, and so must we.Being honest with ourselvesOur great achievement in the 1980s was to give people the power to fulfil their own economic ambitions.We made people financially better off, but money isn\u2019t everything, and in other ways, the quality of their lives declined.The challenges changed, but we did not change to meet those challenges.That is precisely what Theresa May said on Monday. What an excellent speech.All of us here want to remember the good things we did - and there were many - but beyond this hall people too often remember the hurt we caused and the anger they felt.Well I say this to you: Never again.Never again can we take the people of Britain for granted.Until people see that our Party has learned the lessons of 1997, we will go on getting the result of 1997.The Party that I lead will live in the present and prepare for the future.So to those who want to re-fight the battles of the past, and to those who want to live in the past, I simply say this: You stay in the past; we are moving on.LabourFive years ago, Tony Blair managed to catch the national mood.People felt he had changed his party.Then he promised to transform Britain.Remember what we had to endure?Cool Britannia? The Third Way? The Millennium Dome?He promised so much, to so many.How sad it has all come to so little.Last week, Tony Blair spent most of his speech asking a lot of questions.But just as he does every week at Prime Ministers Questions he then refused to answer any of them. Well I have some questions for him:Why are our hospitals so crowded?Why are our streets so dangerous?Why are our schools so troubled?Why is our countryside so neglected?And the most important question of all:Who does Tony Blair think has been running this country for the past five years?Public service failureAnd in those five years our public services have deteriorated.Today our schools, our hospitals, and our criminal justice system are barely adequate at best - and truly shocking at worst.The quality of everyone\u2019s life is suffering as a result. But it is those for whom our public services are a lifeline \u2013 the poorest and the most vulnerable in our society \u2013 who are suffering the most.We live in an era of prosperity and employment, but one fact remains as true today as it was a generation ago:Britain isn\u2019t working.It is not the fault of those employed in our public services. They are the neglected heroes of British life.Think of the exhausted nurse working long hours in unacceptable conditions dealing with angry and often confused patients.The demoralised policeman trying to catch arrogant and aggressive criminals without adequate support.And the over-worked teacher at an understaffed school comforting students who have just lost their place at university.They are not to blame.And if more money were simply the answer, Britain would have some of the best public services in the world. Sadly we do not.Today the Government is spending money more quickly than the nation can earn it.Taxes are rising for those who can least afford it: for people on fixed incomes and for small firms who are the job-creating and wealth-creating engines of our economy.The plea is always for more time and more money, but too often new money is used simply to cover up for the failure of the money this Government has already spent.And as Michael Howard made clear on Tuesday, our public services are suffering from the same problems that afflicted our economy a generation ago.Now, as then, policies are dreamt up in No. 10 and imposed across the country.Now, as then, too many decisions are taken too far away from the people who provide services and the people who use them.It is time to take that power and give back to these who run our public services and those who rely on them.It is time to start trusting people.Because it is only by trusting people that we can begin to make Britain work again.Policy RenewalIn the last twelve months, we\u2019ve travelled the world. We\u2019ve talked to patients and parents, doctors and teachers, police officers and hundreds of other professionals, both here and abroad.We\u2019ve taken the time to understand the problems, to study what works here in Britain and in other countries and to develop solutions.The result has been our policy document published today. It sets out our immediate priorities and the approach we intend to take.With important elections coming up for the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly, our parties there will decide exactly how to translate our principles into Conservative policies.But our direction is clear.There have been no short cuts.No gimmicks.No clever wheezes.Just hard work.Work that doesn\u2019t always grab the headlines.But work that has unearthed the real problems that face the people of Britain today.Real problems that start when people are too young to know anything better.Real problems that start in our schools.EducationA society unable to educate its young doesn\u2019t deserve to call itself civilised. But in many parts of Britain today, the state of education is a scandal.The \u2018learning gap\u2019 between our inner cities and the rest of the country is growing wider every day.Too many schools are suffering from a breakdown in authority, a lack of teachers and poor results and too many children are paying the price.Thousands of young lives are being written off before they\u2019ve scarcely begun.These are the children Labour has left behind.I want those children who are stuck in schools that are failing in our inner cities to have a way out. I want their parents to be able to do what others have done for their children. I want them to be able to choose excellence.The Conservatives will give them that chance.This means breaking with the dogma that says because the state pays for education, it must also run every single school in the land.In Holland, in Sweden and in Denmark they\u2019ve already broken with dogma. And that is what we must do here.So Damian Green has announced this week our plans to give parents real control over how and where their children are educated.Popular schools will be allowed to grow to take on more pupils.But far too many children are locked into failing schools.So we will help parents and other groups establish a new generation of independent schools funded by the state.We will give state scholarships to pupils starting in our inner cities. That way parents can educate their children in schools that are paid for by the state but not run by the state.And my aim is nothing less than to make sure no child is left behind.HealthAnd if we can do that for parents and pupils, why on earth can\u2019t we do it for patients? Just like the pupils in failing inner city schools, the people who suffer most from the crisis in the NHS are the people who can least afford to do so. They are the old, the chronically sick, mothers and young children.They can\u2019t do what a quarter of million people a year do now.  They can\u2019t use their life savings for treatment outside the NHS because they have no life savings.These are the patients Labour has left behind.As Liam Fox pointed out, these people have just as much right to excellence and just as much right to be treated quickly as anyone else.We need to give them a helping hand.The Conservatives will give them that chance.This means recognising that you cannot deliver twenty-first century healthcare using a 1940s system.No other country puts the demands of its health service before the needs of its patients.So we will maintain the commitment of the NHS to provide comprehensive care on the basis of need. But we will go further than that.We will help those who have already contributed to the NHS but who are unable to get their treatment in the NHS on time.And we will give all patients greater choice about how they are treated and by whom.My aim is nothing less than to make sure that no patient is left behind. CrimeBut it is not only schools and hospitals where Labour has failed the people of Britain.Today our streets and our homes feel less safe than they did even a decade ago.Parents are unable to let their children out to play, women are frightened to walk alone after dark and the elderly are frightened even to go out at all.Rising crime hits defenceless people the hardest.These are the victims that Labour has left behind.I want to reclaim the streets for the young and the old and for all the decent people of Britain.And that is what the Conservatives will do.In Mayor Giuliani\u2019s New York, crime dropped by two-thirds in ten years because police response times were forced down to two minutes and people could see officers on patrol catching criminals.In today\u2019s Britain, for every 40 crimes committed, only one results in someone receiving a criminal record. That is not good enough. We must bring Giuliani-style policing to every city in this country.As Oliver Letwin says, crime is not a single act - it is a conveyor belt stretching right back to a child\u2019s early years at home. And we need to give young people every opportunity to opt out of a life of crime and to opt back into society.So we will help parents with problem children provide the framework of discipline and affection that every child needs and deserves.And we will deal with persistent young offenders by giving more purposeful and longer sentences.We are also determined to break the link between crime and hard drugs.That\u2019s why we have pledged a ten-fold increase in the number of drug treatment places in this country.Young crack and heroin addicts will face a stark choice: accept rehabilitation and rescue your own lives, or face prison where you can no longer blight the lives of others.Rewarding responsibilityAs Conservatives, we believe in freedom, but we also believe in society. It is our sense of responsibility that makes social beings out of free individuals.But Gordon Brown is doing his best to undermine responsibility.His policies have trapped nearly half the people in this country on income-related benefits, including the pensioners he has taxed into dependency.People are penalised for working harder and saving harder.These are the families Labour has left behind.The Conservatives will give these families a chance.We will give people the flexibility to save when they can, to draw on funds when they need to and to save again later in their lives \u2013 all without losing support from the taxpayer.The lifetime savings account announced by David Willetts this week will be the biggest boost to responsibility that we can give this country.However old you are, whatever you earn, we will reward everyone in this country who works hard and who saves hard.But we will do more.A generation ago, Conservatives gave council tenants the right to buy their own homes.  Some two million people became property owners and gained control over their own lives.As David Davis made clear this week, home ownership still remains the ultimate dream of most social tenants today.Helping them realise that dream means giving them a helping hand.So the Conservatives will again make that dream a reality and extend it to a new generation.The right to buy is back.But it\u2019s no good having your own house if you lose it through ill health in old age. All over this country, people who have worked hard, saved hard and bought their own homes find that they might as well not have bothered.If they need long-term care, the state seizes their homes and their life savings without offering them any alternative.This has got to stop. We need to give people a helping hand. That\u2019s why we will find a way of enabling people to insure against the loss of their homes and savings if they have to go into care. And while we are at it, we are going to abolish that ridiculous annuity rule.We will offer security to the generation who built and defended this country we live in today.They deserve more than our gratitude - they deserve their dignity.Society and the familyAs Conservatives, we realise that care, compassion and security are central to all our lives. And the place we find them first is in our families.But today many families are increasingly fragile.This Government seems oblivious to the importance of family in supporting people, no matter who they are or what they do.They have undermined the family in our tax and benefit system.They have undermined the authority of parents in our schools.The more we can help families to flourish, the richer our society is.No one in society gets stronger by making families weaker.We are never more fulfilled than when we join together to make the community in which we live a society of which we can be proud.But the key to success in anything we do together is the energy, imagination and commitment that comes from having the freedom to set priorities within our own community.I know from my own experience that one volunteer is worth a dozen conscripts.In every charitable, voluntary and community group across the country you\u2019ll find Conservatives showing compassion \u2013 without ever feeling that their hearts have to be stitched onto their sleeves.We should be proud of that because we are playing our part in making our vision of a decent society a reality every day.A politics that is honestThe strength of the Conservative Party has always been that we bring to politics the experience of lives lived outside politics.I\u2019ve worked with British people from every part of these islands and from every kind of background, first in the Army and then in private business.I\u2019ve known danger and I\u2019ve tasted disappointment.I was made redundant in the tough times of the last recession and I had to start all over again.Try being told you\u2019ve just lost your job. Try telling people they\u2019ve just lost theirs. I\u2019ve been through both and it puts the world of politics completely into perspective.So when I was told I had no future in Parliament because of my determination to keep Britain\u2019s independence as a nation state and because of my determination to keep the Pound, I did not waver.Those who do not know me yet, will come to understand this:When I say a thing, I mean it.When I set myself a task, I do it.When I settle on a course, I stick to it.Do not underestimate the determination of a quiet man.I will continue to do what I believe to be right.I am not here to waste my time or yours going through the motions of opposition for the next three years.I am here because I believe that decent people can make a difference.IraqThere are times when the needs of our country are more important than the demands of party politics.The situation in Iraq is one such time.I have been warning of the danger of the Iraqi weapons of mass destruction for the last five years. I am glad that the Prime Minister has now come to the same conclusion.No one should ever contemplate war without thinking of the ultimate price that individual servicemen and their families might be called on to pay.But there can be only one calculation we should be making. Is it right to move against Iraq\u2019s arsenal now. The answer has to be yes.Those who genuinely seek evidence in support of potential military action in Iraq will find there is plenty of it; those who oppose intervention at all costs will never find enough.We cannot wait until we have irrefutable proof that Saddam has nuclear, biological and chemical weapons targeted on the British people.Because we already have proof that he is the kind of man who would use them.With nuclear weapons, Saddam and his terrorist cohorts would hold us and the world to ransom \u2013 ushering in a new dark age of global insecurity.We must take action now before it\u2019s too late.We must have a clear UN resolution that spells out to Iraq a clear timetable for ridding itself of its weapons, and the clear consequences if it fails to do so.Saddam must be left in no doubt: disarm or we will disarm you.This Party of all parties has never flinched in times of international crisis. The Party I lead will not do so now.Some of you may not like this, but let me be clear.I will not play political games with our national security.I will always put our country first.And that means living up to all our international responsibilities, Prime Minister, not just in Iraq but, as Michael Ancram says, in Zimbabwe and Gibraltar too.ConclusionMy friends, if a week is a long time in politics, then a year sometimes seems like a lifetime.I know you have been waiting impatiently for us to come forward with fresh ideas that would set our Party on a new course.Now we have begun to fulfil those expectations and through your enthusiasm you have shown that we are moving in the right direction.This will be remembered as the week when the Conservatives began the slow, hard road back to power.So the next time you are asked what Conservatives stand for these days, tell them this from me:We believe that when people are given the power to choose they choose to do the best for themselves and their families.We believe that just because the state funds our public services it doesn\u2019t need to run our public services.We believe that the privileges of the few must be turned into the opportunities for the many.Above all we believe that to build a better society you must trust people.Not governments.Our principles must be for a purpose.And that purpose is simple. To make Britain a better place than it is today.I love my country.For me, this is the greatest country on earth, and the tolerance, the decency and the strength of the British people are worth fighting for.That is why I am here.That is why we are all here.To build a Britain that respects decency.A Britain that values compassion.A Britain worthy of all its people.This week we have rediscovered the courage of our convictions.So go out there and tell the world \u2026 the Conservatives are back.

aVIt's my privilege to be the first Labour leader in 100 years to speak to our conference six and half years into Government.We've never been here before. We've never come this far. Never governed for so long. Now with the prospect of a full third term.But it's a testing time.I now look my age. You feel yours. I've had plenty of advice over what I should say in this speech. Some of it I have even asked for. One suggestion was leading you all in chorus of "Always look on the bright side of life."So what do we do. Give up on it. Or get on with it? That's the question.Yes the cynics say, New Labour's been a great electoral machine but you've done little with it.I could recite you the statistics: The lowest inflation, mortgage rates, and unemployment for decades. The best ever school results, with over 60,000 more 11 year olds every year now reaching required standards in English and Maths. Cardiac deaths down 19 per cent since 1997, cancer deaths 9 per cent. Burglaries down 39 per cent.But it's not statistics that tell us what has changed, it's people.The lone parent I met, for years unemployed and unemployable. Now not just in work through the New Deal but winning promotion.What mattered to her most? Not the money alone but the respect her child gained for her, seeing her work, grow in confidence, becoming a role model. One of two million people the New Deal has helped since 1997. That's what this Labour government has done for Britain.Or the children I met this month at a brand new academy in Thamesmead in one of the most deprived estates in the country.In the past, children skipped their old school as often as attending. And 2 years ago, just three pupils, yes three out of an entire year of 114, got 5 good GCSE passes.That failing school now empty. In its place a new £31m building, on time. Where teachers want to teach. Young people want to learn and parents want their children to go.In one year attendance has now reached over 90% and GCSE results have soared.The new school, its new attitude was summed up by one young student who told me she had been badgering her mum all week to buy an alarm-clock, as she was scared of sleeping in case she missed a single lesson. What better symbol of the opportunities we are giving our children.Or the young boy on Merseyside I met having treatment for cancer - every parent's nightmare - but whose parents can't praise enough the care and treatment he's received from the NHS.No complaints from them. Just astonishment and admiration at the commitment and compassion of NHS staff and pride in our health service.The money isn't wasted. It's not disappearing down some black hole. It's there in bricks and mortar, in computers and machines.In 1997, nearly half, yes half of the hospital buildings in the NHS were built before it came into existence, and now it is down to a quarter and falling fast. That's the difference we are making in this country. And most of all, we should be proud of every single teacher, doctor, nurse and police officer we have recruited. Proud we have increased public service pay. It means we will recruit the thousands of extra staff we need but it also means we are beginning to reward properly the staff we already have for the superb job they do.Add to that our constitutional change, devolution in Scotland and Wales, with nationalism now in disarray, self-government for London, the Freedom of Information Act, the Human Rights Act, the first open and transparent rules on Party funding.And there is one piece of unfinished business which we will soon be completing. The abolition of the remaining hereditary peers. Never again in Britain will someone have the right to make laws which affect the lives of ordinary families solely because their ancestor was a duke, an earl or a viscount.Add to that what we achieved for peace in Northern Ireland.And let none of us forget, it is your Government that even in harsher economic times, is growing our aid budget, leading the way on cutting Third World debt, $70 billion already committed globally, and has just helped broker the deal that will give HIVAIDS patients in Africa improved access to drugs.In a host of ways, from a strengthening of the law against racial violence, to equal rights for same sex couples, setting up the Disability Rights Commission, action on domestic violence, changes that will never be reflected in an opinion poll, rarely hit a headline, rarely be heard outside those who benefit from it, in a world where a grain of sensation gets more attention than a mountain of genuine achievements - that's the difference you have made to Britain.So why is it so tough?Government's tough. Fulfilling but tough. Opposition was easy.All our MPs had to do was to go back to their constituencies and blame it on the Government. Some of them still do.May 1997 was a unique moment. An abundance of expectation surrounded our arrival. A sense of hope beyond ordinary imagining. The people felt it. We felt it. Instead of reining in the expectation, we gave it free rein. It was natural, but born of inexperience. We thought change was a matter of will. Have the right programme, spend the right money and the job is done. But experience has taught us: the job is never done.If we expected bouquets every day, we should have stayed in Opposition. We shouldn't want thanks. It's a privilege to do the job, however tough.And in Government, you expect things to happen but the things that happen are not the things you expect, at least not on 1 May 1997.Iraq has divided the international community. It has divided the party, the country, families, friends. I know many people are disappointed, hurt, angry. I know many profoundly believe the action we took was wrong . I do not at all disrespect anyone who disagrees with me. I ask just one thing: attack my decision but at least understand why I took it and why I would take the same decision again.Imagine you are PM. And you receive this intelligence. And not just about Iraq. But about the whole murky trade in WMD. And one thing we know. Not from intelligence. But from historical fact. That Saddam's regime has not just developed but used such weapons gassing thousands of his own people. And has lied about it consistently, concealing it for years even under the noses of the UN Inspectors.And I see the terrorism and the trade in WMD growing. And I look at Saddam's country and I see its people in torment ground underfoot by his and his sons' brutality and wickedness. So what do I do? Say "I've got the intelligence but I've a hunch its wrong?" Leave Saddam in place but now with the world's democracies humiliated and him emboldened?You see, I believe the security threat of the 21st century is not countries waging conventional war. I believe that in today's interdependent world the threat is chaos. It is fanaticism defeating reason.Suppose the terrorists repeated September 11th or worse. Suppose they got hold of a chemical or biological or nuclear dirty bomb; and if they could, they would. What then?And if it is the threat of the 21st century, Britain should be in there helping confront it, not because we are America's poodle, but because dealing with it will make Britain safer.There was no easy choice. So whatever we each of us thought, let us agree on this. We who started the war must finish the peace. Those British soldiers who died are heroes. We didn't regret the fall of Milosovic, the removal of the Taliban or the liberation of Sierra Leone and whatever the disagreement Iraq is a better country without Saddam.And why do I stay fighting to keep in there with America on the one hand and Europe on the other? Because I know terrorism can't be defeated unless America and Europe work together. And it's not so much American unilateralism I fear. It's isolation. It's walking away when we need America there engaged. Fighting to get world trade opened up. Fighting to give hope to Africa. Changing its position for the future of the world, on climate change. And staying with it in the Middle East, telling Israel and the Palestinians: don't let the extremists decide the fate of the peace process, when the only hope is two states living side by side in peace.And it's not Britain being swallowed up in some European federal nightmare as if Britain wasn't strong enough to hold its own, that I fear. It's Britain leaving the centre of Europe retreating to its margin at the very moment when the fate of Europe is being decided, 10 new nations and Britain's leadership has never been more essential. That's why apart from all the good economic reasons it is madness for Britain to give up the option of joining the Euro.And I know both on terrorism and on Europe my views cause offence. But I can no more concede to parts of the left on the one than I can genuflect to the right over the other. Because I believe both positions are vital in delivering justice in a modern world.The original Conference title read "Fairness For All". We changed it to "A Future Fair For All". Let us be absolutely clear about where we are today and why. Everything we have done has led up to this moment. To bring new hope and opportunity to the lives of all our citizens we always knew we would have to do something that Labour Governments have never succeeded in before - to renew in power, as we renewed to achieve power.People ask me if I am surprised that things have got so tough. I say I am surprised it has taken so long. Why? I've been trying to say this to you for the best part of 10 years but never quite found the words.But now I've hit the rough patch, its time to try again.Up to now there has been a ritual to Labour Governments, Euphoria on victory. Hard slog in Government. Tough times. Party accuses leadership of betrayal. Leadership accuses Party of ingratitude. Disillusion. Defeat. Long period of Tory Government before next outbreak of euphoria. We've been far better at defeating ourselves than the Tories have ever been.Apart from 1974-79, which was fragile from the first, each Labour Government has been a spasmodic interval punctuating otherwise unbroken Conservative rule. For too many of our 100 years we have been a well-intentioned pressure group. We fight injustice. We argue our causes. But our psychology has been that of people who know, deep down, someone else is the governing party and we are the ones championing the grievance.So, after a time, after we have righted the most obvious wrongs of the Conservatives, we fold up. We return to our comfort zone.Then came New Labour. From the outset, our opponents hated and feared us. They believe the Tories have a divine right to rule Britain and we are usurpers. They look at their own Party and feel contempt. And they hate us even more because they think we're responsible. And in a sense we are. By occupying the centre ground, by modernising, by reaching out beyond our activists, we helped turn the Tories into a replica of what we used to be. A narrow base. Obsessed about the wrong things. Old fashioned. In retreat.When the Tories lose an election now anywhere in the country, they say it's not their natural territory. Like Scotland is not natural Tory territory. Like Wales is not natural Tory territory. Like the North of England is not natural Tory territory. Like the big cities are not natural Tory territory. Like Harwich, Hastings and Hove aren't natural Tory territory. If I was a Conservative I would be wondering where on earth is our natural territory. We always knew the Tories didn't have a heart. Their problem now is they haven't got a heartland.No wonder they keep trying to reinvent themselves. From cuddly Conservatives to compassionate Conservatives to caring Conservatives. When are they going to realise it's not the first word that's the problem, it's the second.But one thing they have succeeded in. As they always do. Right from the beginning of New Labour they set up the eternal false choice of progressive politics. That in Government we either revert to the past; or we stand for nothing. That we are either incompetent or compromised. That if policy is modernised, belief is betrayed. And it plays to our own fears. Yes, New Labour a clever piece of marketing, good at winning elections, but hollow where the heart should be.New Labour for me was never a departure from belief. It is my belief. The just society in which each person is a full and equal citizen of our land, irrespective of birth, class, wealth, race or sex. Where through solidarity we build a society in which collective strength compensates for individual weakness.Where privilege cannot just be handed down from generation to generation but success has to be earned on merit. Where self respect and respect for others is the hallmark of our communities and where the fight against poverty and oppression is Britain's mission in the wider world. These are my values and yours. They are the key. But the door they must unlock is the door to the future.Because values not put to work in the real world are mere words, lying idle, there to console us but not to change lives for the better.When almost 10 years ago we ditched the old Clause IV, we didn't do it just to ditch nationalisation. The new Clause IV was a fundamental restatement of ideology. "by the strength of our common endeavour we achieve more than we achieve alone.... a community in which power, wealth and opportunity are in the hands of the many not the few."From now on, we said: we stand for certain values. The values are unchangeable. But the policies are open to change. We made the ends sacrosanct. We put the means up for discussion so that each time could find the right expression for values that are for all time.In the first phase of our transformation, we took the millstones off our neck. We became a Party of economic competence, strong on defence, concerned on law and order. And we won power. And then in our first term we recovered the credibility to govern. We laid foundations.But now, is where we show whether we have the mettle not just to be a longer or even a better Labour Government than those that went before us, but whether we usher in a political era where progressive politics is to the 21st century what conservative politics was to the 20th. I do not just want an historic third term. Our aim must be an historic realignment of the political forces shaping our country and the wider world.Here we are poised, 6½ years in, with a fantastic opportunity, to use or to lose. Yes, this is a testing time. But it is a test not just of belief but of character. And the time is for renewal, not retreat.A delegate said to me last night. "I know what you want really to say", she said: "you want to say: I know what I'm doing. Just let me get on with it." Then she said: "You do know what you are doing don't you?" It's a fair question. I know the old top down approach won't work any more. I know I can't say "I am the leader, follow me". Not that that was your strong point anyway.Over the coming months, I want our Party to begin a new discussion with the people of Britain. Across major policy areas the Government will publish a prospectus, discussing the progress we have made and the challenges our country still faces. We should have the confidence to open up the debate, be honest about the challenges, lay out the real choices.But this must not just be a discussion between us. Because if we want a Government in touch with the Party, we must have a Party in touch with the people.And so let us make this the biggest policy consultation ever to have taken place in this country. The Ministers from me down, our MPs out in every constituency hosting discussions that engage with the whole community.So, when we begin our manifesto process, when the policy forum draws our thinking together, I want it to address the big questions, engage with ordinary people's hopes and fears. A progressive, imaginative, vibrant public debate about how we together build a future fair for all.Not the daily diet of froth; not turning serious politics into soap opera, debasing it, turning it into an endless who knew what, when, as if politicians simply competed on villainy. The British people deserve better from the politicians and with respect, from parts of the media too. But real politics about real people. And in the programme we set out, let our idealism be undimmed, but let us show what experience has taught it.What have we learnt? That from Bank of England independence, to primary school standards, from street crime to PFI hospital building, no change without controversy, no progress without change, no prospect of social justice without reform.We're proud of economic stability. 1½ million more jobs since 1997. A hundred years ago we campaigned for a minimum wage. Tomorrow our minimum wage, the one we introduced in the teeth of Tory opposition is going up again - to £4.50. That means that since its introduction this Labour government has increased the earnings of the lowest pay workers, by over £1,500 a year. Whilst the Tories said it would cost millions of jobs, we can say today that Britain's historic minimum wage is here to stay and it comes with the best record on jobs for 30 years.But we know it's not enough, not in the economy of the future. The fight for a fair future must begin with our number one priority education. At every age, at every stage, education is the surest guarantee of a fair future. At every age and every stage we are breaking down the barriers that hold people back.At birth: a year's maternity leave, paid paternity leave for the first time and now a new trust fund for every child; their own stake in the future. For toddlers, childcare places, nursery places, child tax credits, and Sure Start giving mothers the confidence and support they need. At primary school the basics, so now our children are in the top three in the world for reading. At secondary school, personalised learning for every child in new specialist schools and City Academies. For teenagers, grants to stay on at school, modern apprenticeships, not a thing of the past but a part of the future. And then throughout adult life, new opportunities through Learn Direct to learn more - a language, new skills - every individual the chance to fulfil their potential.At every age, at every stage, opening opportunity not for a privileged few but for all.And we need a modern industrial base, doubling investment in science, leading Europe in the biosciences and technology, more high tech spins off from universities than ever before - not just world beating British ideas but world beating products, British profits, British jobs. And yes new manufacturing jobs - high skills, high tech, exactly the kind of jobs we need for the future.In the economy of the 21st, knowledge, human capital, is the future and fairness demands it is open to all.But a big challenge faces us. As our children are helped at every stage to learn - we are going further than any country in Europe in turning higher education from a privilege for the few to a right for the many. But how do we finance education through life and also get more children into university education that competes with the best in the world?To pretend it will all come from the taxpayer is dishonest. It won't and it wouldn't be fair if it did.And yes the Tories have an alternative to student fees. To cut money going to universities by cutting student numbers. 100,000 fewer students. Is that fair? Who do you think will be the students cut? Their children? And when the universities need more money, do you think they'll raise taxes? No, they'll cut numbers again, when our very economic future depends on us developing people's potential not squandering it.And the Lib Dems? They say they will spend more and it will all come out of raising the top rate of tax to 50 per cent. Except that extra university funding is not all that's to come from the top rate taxpayer. They have commitments to spend more on forty different items running into billions of pounds.All this from the top rate taxpayer. We used to have that policy. Remember squeezing the rich 'til the pips squeaked? Except in the end, it wasn't only the rich that were squeezed; and it wasn't the pips that squeaked, it was us.We can be proud of the new money in our schools and health service, proud that this year, last year and next year spending on health and education is rising faster here than in any other major country. 55,000 more nurses. 25,000 more teachers. 80,000 more classroom assistants. Tremendous.But in the future how can it be fair when for all the advances we have made, a wealthy pensioner waiting on a consultant's list for her hip operation can go to the same consultant and get it done next week if she is able to pay, but a poor pensioner cannot?And how is it fair that well off parents, for all our improvements, who can't get their child into a decent secondary school, can choose to buy a good education but poor parents can't?Choice has always been there for the well off. Excellence has always been at the service of the wealthy. What is unfair is not the right to choose, not the pursuit of excellence but where that choice and that excellence depends on your wealth not your need.Take the case of an elderly woman in the north west, who looked after her dying husband despite her ill-health. After his death, she agreed to have the serious heart operation she needed. But though she was listed as urgent, she was placed on a year-long waiting list. Once she would have had no choice. Now she did. Because of our policies, she was offered the chance to travel to get her heart operation done much more quickly. She jumped at it. After the operation, she said: "I'd go to the ends of the earth to get my health back. It saved me six months of anxiety. Really I feel it saved my life". Choice for her is not a betrayal of our principles. It is our principles.And what progress it was in the 1960s when the comprehensive ended the division of children into successes and failures age 11. What a breakthrough in 1948 when the NHS gave people, who used to scrimp and save and fret to pay, care free at the point of use.But progress in the 21st century demands more, much more. Teaching tailored to each child's ability. A Health Service that brings the benefits of new genetic knowledge to everyone, not a lottery. The patient not at the convenience of the system but the system at the convenience of the patient. And because the world changes we have to change. No longer "one size fits all". Recognising that in the 21st century you can't run a personalised service by remote control.That's the reason for change. Not to level down but to level up. Not to privatise but to revitalise a public service we all depend on.I don't want the middle class fighting to get out of the state system. I want them fighting to get into it but on equal terms with working class patients and children. That's what the founders of socialism dreamt of.And when I read a resolution saying Foundation Hospitals are opposed by an alliance of the BMA and the House of Lords, and yes Tories and Lib Dems too, what are we: a progressive party? If we had listened to that alliance, we would never have had an NHS in the first place.And of course the criminal justice system with its rules and procedures was a vital step of progress when poor people were without representation unjustly convicted by corners cut. But today in Britain in the 21st century it is not the innocent being convicted. It's too many of the guilty going free. Too many victims of crime and always the poorest who are on the front line.And its great we've made a start on reform with record numbers of police officers. But I tell you. We will not hit organised crime until we treat them with the ruthlessness they treat us. We won't tackle crime if we bail drug abusers back on the streets without treatment. And we cannot say we live in a just society, if we do not put an end to the anti-social behaviour, the disrespect, the conduct which we wouldn't tolerate from our own children and shouldn't have to tolerate from someone else's.Responsibility and opportunity. That's why we are investing in our poorest communities. And it's the whole basis of tax credits. If you work, we will help you with the working tax credit. If you are bringing up kids we will support you with child benefit and child tax credit. If you save, we will help you with pension credit that will boost the incomes of half of Britain's pensioners by an average of £400 a year - the biggest advance in combating poverty in old age in a generation but in the future given to those that need it most.And fairness in a future where millions are on the move. Britain should always be open to refugees. We can be proud of the part immigration has played in this country.But economic migrants should come in through a proper immigration process.Changing the law on asylum is the only fair way of helping the genuinely persecuted - and its best defence against racism gaining ground. We have cut asylum applications by a half. But we must go further. We should cut back the ludicrously complicated appeal process, de-rail the gravy train of legal aid, fast-track those from democratic countries, and remove those who fail in their claims without further judicial interference.And in a world of mass migration, with cheaper air travel, and all the problems of fraud, it makes sense to ask whether now in the early 21st century identity cards are no longer an affront to civil liberties but may be the way of protecting them.These are some of the challenges. What's fair when we want not a basic but a good standard of life in retirement that is bound to last longer than ever before. What's fair when the users of universal services want to be treated not as grateful welfare recipients but demanding 21st century consumers. What's fair for the mother who a generation ago would have expected to stay at home but now wants the chance to work flexibly. What's fair in a world in which, in a strong economy, rail and tube are used so much more than in 1997, where we desperately need a 21st century transport system and cannot fairly fund it all from the taxpayer. What's fair in a world where the insecurities multiply so fast and the wheels of government turn so slow. Where we have to pick our way to sanity through a cacophony of pressure and hassle which are not the product of any one moment in time but of the times in which we live.Fairness remade. A Britain without poverty. First class public services. Community renewed. A progressive future within our grasp. The dreams of generations who came to conferences like this becoming real, hopes that were once utopian becoming everyday.The reason I bang the drum for change is I get so angry that it takes so long, restless at how much there is to do. I want us to go faster, further.I think of the people I meet. Holly in Southampton. Teenage mum. Now through Sure Start with childcare. Given help to study so she can become a midwife so she can work in the NHS so another mother can benefit. Why does it take so long for us to realise when we invest in people like her, it's not a cost, it's an investment in our future? Or the NHS manager in Newcastle, 30 years working in the NHS, telling me only in the last three has he done anything other than managing decline or the Chief Police Officer telling me after a lifetime in the service, that it was only with the recent legislation on crime he felt Government understood.And, I stick at it, because I know what's there if we stumble. Not the Government of some hallucination, where no tough decisions have to be taken, the money grows on trees, the Ministers all hold hands and sing Kum-bay-ah, also known as the Lib Dems - what's round the corner is the old Tory days.It's not that long ago that we've all forgotten, is it? The 3m unemployed. The two recessions. The negative equity. The double figure inflation. The 15% interest rates. The cuts in schools and hospitals. The privatising of the railways.And when we get to the next election, believe me. We won't be fighting for votes with the hard left. We'll be fighting the hard right. The Tories. And they'll fight us on immigration, on Europe and above all on tax. And they'll say: you put the money in and nothing happened. That's why they run down the NHS. Because they know if we can change our state schools and our NHS for the better, then they're back where they've never been in 100 years 'til now, a Party of opposition and not even a good one at that.When do Tories succeed? They succeed when people believe politics can't change lives. But we know it can because we see in the faces of the New Dealer and the pupils and the patients and the poorest of our world that politics can make a difference.I remember when our journey to Government began. Here in this Hall in 1985, with Neil Kinnock, here with us today. And, of course today it seems, absurd, doesn't it? Militant, Arthur, all that nonsense. But I tell you. At the time, I remember up there, where the MPs used to be penned in, getting to my feet in the middle of his speech, the Hall split asunder, my heart pounding, wondering if this was the beginning or the end.And what I learnt that day was not about the far left. It was about leadership. Get rid of the false choice: principles or no principles. Replace it with the true choice. Forward or back. I can only go one way. I've not got a reverse gear. The time to trust a politician most is not when they're taking the easy option. Any politician can do the popular things. I know, I used to do a few of them.I know it's hard for people to keep faith. Some of the people may have a different take on me. But I have the same take on them. I trust their decency. I trust their innate good sense. I know I am the same person I always was, older, tougher, more experienced, but basically the same person believing the same things. I've never led this Party by calculation. Policy you calculate. Leadership comes by instinct. I believe the British people will forgive a government mistakes; will put the media onslaught in more perspective than we think; but what they won't forgive is cowardice in the face of a challenge.The answer to any of these challenges is not easy.During the past months on Iraq, I have received letter from parents whose sons have died as soldiers. One believing their son had died in vain and hating me for my decision. Another, a beautiful letter, said they thought Iraq was the right thing to do and though their son was dead, whom they loved dearly, they still thought it was right. And don't believe anyone who tells you when they receive letters like that they don't suffer any doubt. All you can do in a modern world, so confusing with its opportunities and its hazards, is to decide what is the right way and try to walk in it.It's not being out of touch. After 6 years, more battered without but stronger within. It's the only leadership I can offer. And it's the only type of leadership worth having.The purpose: to rebuild the public realm, to discover amongst all the modern pressures, the virtues of community, of tolerance, of decency, of respect. To bring to the self interested consumer age, the value of solidarity. Not to cease to want the best for oneself but to wish it for all. To build a country not just proud of their own achievements, but proud of what we can do together. Proud not just of how they get and spend but what we in friendship with each other can do for each other.This is our challenge.To stride forward where we have always previously stumbled. To renew in government. Steadfast in our values. Radical in our methods. Open in our politics. If we faint in the day of adversity, our strength is small. And ours isn't. We have the strength, the maturity, now the experience to do it.So let it be done.

aVI was born and grew up in South Wales. As you may have heard, we\u2019ve just been left off the new EU map. I know people in Brussels feel strongly about Neil Kinnock, but I really do think that is going too far. I was lucky enough to go to a very good grammar school. The first political meeting I ever went to was during a general election campaign. It was held by the local Labour Member of Parliament - a great man of his day, the Deputy Leader of the Labour Party. I asked him why Labour wanted to abolish grammar schools. And he replied: \u2018We don\u2019t want to abolish grammar schools. We want to make all schools grammar schools.\u2019 It was my first experience of a politician\u2019s answer. I don\u2019t believe in that kind of talk. I\u2019m going to give it to you straight.Rebuilding trustPoliticians - all politicians - have made promises they have failed to keep. In 1992, we promised to cut taxes year on year. But we put them up.  In 1997, Labour said there would be no tax increases at all. They put them up. Not once, not twice but sixty-six times. Sixty-six broken promises. And people have been let down on Europe too.In the 1970s, Britain joined a common market. That\u2019s what the British people voted for. But it soon became clear our European partners wanted more. They wanted to build a country called Europe. The British people were told: \u2018Don\u2019t worry. France and Germany don\u2019t really want a country called Europe. They\u2019re coming our way.\u2019 But they haven\u2019t come our way. Power has gone from Britain to Brussels. And that\u2019s not what the British people voted for. Let\u2019s face facts. What has happened on tax and on Europe has damaged people\u2019s faith in politics. So it\u2019s hardly surprising that people don\u2019t trust politicians today.AccountabilityIn the real world, if you say you\u2019re going to do something, you do it. And if you screw up, you can lose your job. It\u2019s called accountability. Remember that word - accountability. But politicians seem to live in a different world. A world where promises are dropped just as casually as they\u2019re made. A world where the figures are fiddled. A world where there are no penalties for failure. What people want from their politicians is: Accountability. Responsibility. And a little humility. The very opposite of what we\u2019ve had from Tony Blair. Politicians don\u2019t have all the solutions. They should stop pretending they do. So I won\u2019t pretend I can solve every problem, right every wrong or cure every ill. I\u2019ll leave that to the Liberal Democrats.We will only promise what we can deliver. What we start, we will follow through. And we will give people clear measures against which we can be judged. That\u2019s why we\u2019re setting out a clear Timetable for Action. What we\u2019ll do, when we\u2019ll do it. Specific times, specific dates. It will put us on the line in a way that no government has ever been before. There will be no wiggle room. Everyone will be able to hold us to account. No dodgy facts and figures We\u2019ll have no place to hide. Accountability.I choose my cabinet because I expect them to deliver. And if they don\u2019t, I\u2019ll replace them with people who will. When you ask for peoples votes, you have a responsibility to them. Casting a vote shouldn\u2019t be a mechanical choice between the lesser of two evils. It should be an opportunity to tell the world what sort of country you want. That\u2019s why politicians have a duty to respond to people\u2019s dreams and help make them a reality. It\u2019s not a crime to want a better school for your child, better healthcare for your mother, and a better life for your family. But it is criminal when politicians hold out these promises without a detailed, deliverable plan. People are fed up with talk. They want action.Talk not actionTony Blair has been all talk. He gets swept away with his rhetoric and his dreams. He\u2019s told us about the Euro being our \u2018destiny.\u2019 Well, you know, most people don\u2019t actually want a date with destiny. They just want a date with a dentist. Tony Blair has promised so much, but he has delivered so little. That\u2019s why people have come to think the problems we face are just like the British weather - something you moan about but cannot change. But we can get a grip on these problems. Where there is cynicism, we can bring hope. I\u2019m not going to promise you a fantasy land, but I do want to take you to a foreign land. In France, they don\u2019t have waiting lists. In Sweden, parents can choose the school they want. And in New York, it\u2019s now criminals who walk in fear, not the public.I want Britain to be the country that is the envy of the world. And I know that this is the party that can make it happen. Because we instinctively trust the generosity, the initiative and the common sense of the British people.Action on crimeAnd the first problem I\u2019ll get a grip on is crime. The gloves will come off. What Giuliani did in New York, what Ray Mallon did in Middlesbrough, we\u2019ll do for the whole of Britain. A war on crime.Three weeks ago, on a Saturday night, I went out on the streets of Brixton with people from local churches. I saw the problems their community is up against. In two hours we didn\u2019t meet a single policeman. Not one. This was inner city London, just before midnight, on a Saturday night. No wonder people feel the police have become distant and remote. The problem is that the police are handcuffed by paperwork. They now have to spend almost as much time at the station as they do out on the streets. And now this Government is making it worse. The police will now have to fill in a form every time they stop someone. Not stop and search, just stop someone. It takes seven minutes to complete that form. Just think about it. If a police officer stops half a dozen unruly youngsters, he\u2019ll have to spend the best part of an hour filling in forms.I don\u2019t want police filling in forms - I want them on the streets doing their job. People are fed up that when the police do catch criminals the punishment never seems to fit the crime. Under a new Labour law, shoplifters will only get a fixed penalty fine and no criminal record. Theft is now no worse than parking on a yellow line. I promise you I\u2019m not making this up. And five years ago, Labour introduced an early release scheme. Since then 3,600 crimes - including rape - have been committed by criminals let out of prison early. Every one of those crimes could have been prevented. All this has to change.We need a government that will stand up for the silent, law abiding majority who play by the rules and pay their dues. A government that will put their rights first. This is what David Davis will do. Day One, that form police officers will have to fill in every time they stop someone that form will go into the appropriate filing tray. The bin. Week One, Labour\u2019s early release scheme that will go. Month One, we\u2019ll start to recruit 5,000 more police officers a year. And we\u2019ll do something else. Career criminals and dangerous offenders should be in prison, not roaming our streets. So we will build more prisons.Action on drugsEveryone knows that drugs are at the root of a lot of crime. There can be few families not touched by the blight or worry of drugs. It\u2019s every parent\u2019s worst nightmare. I want to give hope and practical support to those families. Many addicts fall into crime to feed their habits. If they\u2019re caught, I think they should be given a choice. Prison or treatment. So we\u2019ll increase the number of rehab places tenfold from 2,000 to 20,000. We must give families the chance to win back their children from drugs. Life is far too precious to be written off.Action on school disciplineDrugs are a symptom of a wider problem. As a society, we\u2019ve blurred the distinction between right and wrong. We\u2019ve tolerated a slow but relentless decline in personal responsibility. Too many people now believe that they are no longer responsible for their actions. It\u2019s always someone else\u2019s fault. And while we\u2019ve let responsibility decline, we\u2019ve allowed \u2018rights\u2019 to proliferate. You hear it all the time: \u2018I\u2019ve got my rights.\u2019 The verbal equivalent of two fingers to authority. The Human Rights Act has tipped the balance of justice away from the victim in favour of the troublemaker. That\u2019s why we\u2019re reviewing it. And if it can\u2019t be reformed, we\u2019ll get rid of it.We have also undermined discipline in schools. Too often teachers find their authority challenged when they discipline children. But teachers know their pupils. They know their names and they understand their character what they are good at and what they find difficult. And we should trust them to exercise their common sense and judgement. So on day one, Tim Collins will start to give head teachers control over their classrooms. They\u2019ll have the final say on expulsions. Disruptive pupils won\u2019t be able to wreck other children\u2019s education.Action on schools and hospitalsHard-working families want to restore respect and decent values. But they also want value for money for the taxes they pay. Billions of pounds of their money have been spent on education. But much of it has been wasted on bureaucracy. Twelve pages of government paperwork land on head teachers\u2019 desks every single day of the school year. And what do we have to show for it? A third of all eleven year olds still cannot write properly.Billions of pounds of taxpayers\u2019 money have been spent on the NHS. And what have we got to show for that? Bureaucrats, people waiting in pain for operations, dirty hospitals. More people die every year from hospital infections than are killed on Britain\u2019s roads. That\u2019s more than a statistic. It\u2019s a tragedy for thousands of families, including mine. Two years ago my mother-in-law died from a hospital acquired infection. Yes she was old. Yes she was frail. But she still enjoyed life. She need not have died.Britain needs a Government that will give hard-working families value for the taxes they pay. And what greater value can there be than the dedication of those who work in our schools and hospitals? Look at the astonishing devotion to duty of our doctors and nurses. Their motives are the highest, their skills immense, their energy an inspiration. Think of the commitment of our teachers. Teaching is a noble profession. Teachers simply want the satisfaction, the sheer joy of inspiring the next generation, and of passing on that most precious commodity: knowledge. Is it too much to ask that we trust their judgement, their experience and their expertise? Let\u2019s set them free to follow their vocation, and give of their best. So in week one, Andrew Lansley and Tim Collins will start to scrap Whitehall targets for hospitals and schools. Teachers will run our schools. And doctors and nurses will run our hospitals. We\u2019ll trust patients and parents too - so they can choose the hospital and school which best suits them and their family. No one should have to shut up and just take what they\u2019re given.Conservatives will give everyone the kind of choice in health and education that today only money can buy. That\u2019s what I call social justice. There are people in Britain who have to wait months for operations on the NHS. Not far from where they live, other more fortunate people only have to wait weeks. We\u2019ve all paid for the NHS. It\u2019s our NHS. So why shouldn\u2019t you be able to go to the hospitals that can treat you more quickly? With the Conservatives, you will. We\u2019ll also give more choice to parents. Parents know better than anyone what is best for their children. If we want selection, if we want school uniforms, if we want schools that excel at sport, as parents we should be able to choose them. That is the way to give parents the good local schools we all want. But giving parents and patients choice, and giving professionals more control, means cutting back on the pen pushers who run too much of our lives. On day one, Oliver Letwin will freeze civil service recruitment. And I\u2019ll do my bit too.In Downing Street there\u2019s something called the Prime Minister\u2019s Delivery Unit. Yes, the Prime Minister\u2019s Delivery Unit. Now there\u2019s a contradiction in terms. That Delivery Unit was recently advertising for jobs. Job Title: Joint Action Leaders. Joint Action Leaders. What on earth does that mean? What do these people actually do? I\u2019ve got the ad here - let me read it to you. Applicants \u2018need a track record of diagnosing, analysing and developing workable solutions to key blockages to public service delivery.\u2019 Well, that\u2019s clear then. It\u2019s DynoRod in Downing Street. And for key blockages, read Gordon Brown. These Joint Action Leaders are paid £70,000 a year each, much more than an experienced midwife gets in a real delivery unit bringing babies into the world. In week one of a Conservative Government, I will order the closure of the Downing Street Delivery Unit. It may not be the biggest waste of money in Whitehall, but it sums up what\u2019s going wrong. Tony Blair\u2019s got a Delivery Unit but there\u2019s no delivery. I won\u2019t have a Delivery Unit, but I will deliver.Action on pensionsI will deliver for pensioners. If you want to know about a family, look at how they treat their older relatives. And if you want to know about a country, look how it cares for older people. It\u2019s a scandal that this Government took the best pensions system in Europe and turned it into one of the worst. Can you imagine what it feels like to have saved for your retirement only to find that the money you\u2019ve put aside isn\u2019t there? That the value of your pension has been destroyed by Gordon Brown\u2019s stealth taxes? How are pensioners on fixed incomes meant to cope with an ever-increasing Council Tax? And what a way to treat people who have worked hard and saved all their lives to make them fill in a twelve page means test form to get what they are due. I want to live in a country where we honour our older generations, cherish their wisdom and care for their needs. A country where they can live out their days in security and with dignity. Respected. Protected.To those who have given so much, we must surely give more. That is why in our first month David Willetts will take steps to restore the link between pensions and earnings. There\u2019ll be an extra £7 a week if you live on your own, and an extra £11 a week for a couple. We need a Government which gives pensioners back their dignity. That\u2019s what most people want. But only a Conservative Government will deliver it. So my message to you is simple. If you want to give pensioners back their dignity, whatever party you are from, come and join us.Action on taxBut pensioners are not the only ones who have been let down. Everyone\u2019s been let down by Labour on tax. I want to help those who want to get on in life. The family with a new baby who need a bigger home. The couple who both work, but still don\u2019t seem able to make ends meet. Today they are all paying the price of a government that is taxing too much. Young couples, wanting to buy their first home, face hundreds of pounds of Stamp Duty. The poorest households shoulder the highest burden. And teachers, doctors and policemen now pay top rate Income Tax. People who bought their council houses in the 1980s are now being clobbered by Inheritance Tax. This is all wrong. It\u2019s unfair.And there\u2019s more trouble ahead. Whatever the uncertainty about Tony Blair\u2019s future, one thing is certain. If Labour were to win again, we\u2019d have Blair\u2019s third term tax rises. And they\u2019d be painful indeed. Council Tax for the typical family of £2,000 a year. Conservatives will stop Blair\u2019s third term tax rises dead in their tracks. We\u2019ll get a grip on public spending. We\u2019ll save billions of pounds by cutting government waste. And that will help to put us back on the path to lower taxes.People work hard for their money and they deserve to keep more of it. Families know better than any government can how best to spend their money. So be in no doubt. When I can, I will cut taxes. This week we have set out the taxes we have in our sights, the taxes I want to make fairer, simpler, lower. But I\u2019m not like Tony Blair, I\u2019m not going to make promises I can\u2019t keep. I don\u2019t want you to leave this hall today with a false prospectus. We must be honest with the British people. It\u2019s that word again - accountability.Action on EuropeI want to be accountable on Europe, too. On day one, we will set the date for the referendum on the Constitution. So if the election is next May, we will hold that referendum before we meet again next October. Europe isn\u2019t working properly today and the Constitution will only make matters worse. The European Union is spewing out too many regulations. It\u2019s holding our economy back. We cannot go on like this. It is a recipe for certain economic decline. We need a new approach to Europe. Let me explain why.The British people don\u2019t want to be part of a European super-state. But other European governments are determined to press ahead with ever closer integration. Britain has tried to stop them. So all we get are arguments and bust-ups. Everyone feels frustrated. It\u2019s not a terribly clever policy. This is what I will do. Some of our European partners want to integrate further. I\u2019ll say to them - fine. Britain will no longer try and stop you. But we must have something in return. We want to bring powers back from Brussels to Britain.It is not enough to say No to the European Constitution - though a Conservative Government will. It is not enough to say No to the Euro - though a Conservative Government will. It\u2019s time we went further. We want out of the social chapter, which is a threat to British jobs. We want out of the common fisheries policy, which is destroying communities. And we want more British aid to be distributed from London and less from Brussels. It\u2019s time to bring powers back to Britain. There\u2019s a word for it - accountability. That\u2019s what most people want. But only a Conservative Government can deliver it. So my message to you is simple. If you want to bring powers back from Brussels to Britain, whatever party you\u2019re from, come and join us.Action on immigrationThe British people are open, generous and compassionate. We have a proud tradition of giving refuge to people fleeing persecution, and welcoming families who want to settle here and work. We have a long tradition of firm but fair immigration controls. But today, immigration is chaotic and out of control. Four out of five failed asylum seekers are never removed from the country. And government officials have granted work permits which they knew to be fraudulent. All this rankles with people. They feel their tolerance and fairness are being abused. And they are increasingly concerned about the impact of immigration on our public services - our schools, hospitals and transport. But that\u2019s hardly surprising.Immigration has doubled under Labour. And we have a Home Secretary who believes that there is \u2018no obvious upper limit to legal immigration.\u2019 I think we\u2019ve reached a turning point. We cannot allow unlimited immigration to Britain to continue. We need a Government that gets a grip on this shambles. A government which helps genuine refugees. A government that gives priority to families who want to come here, work hard and make a positive contribution to our country. So in week one, Michael Ancram will signal Britain\u2019s intention to pull out of the 1951 UN Refugee Convention. We want asylum cases to be decided more quickly and more fairly. We want to allow genuine refugees to get to the front of the queue. That\u2019s what I call fair. And in month one, we\u2019ll set out plans to enable Parliament to put an annual limit on the number of people who come to Britain. No Conservative Home Secretary will ever say \u2018there is no obvious limit to legal immigration.\u2019Dangerous worldWhen the Cold War ended, we all hoped that our children and grandchildren would grow up in a safer world. That hope was shattered on September 11th 2001. Our world changed. Taking a plane, going on the Tube - all these things suddenly carried a new risk. Meanwhile, we face the spread of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. How do we confront this sense of insecurity? How do we tackle these threats? First, people need to be told the truth about the threats we face. And if we consider the threat to our freedom and our interests merit military action, we should not flinch.Every day, British servicemen and women face great danger in Iraq. The way they carry out their duties does Britain proud, and makes Britain proud. I believe it was right to go to war, that\u2019s a controversial view. Many people would prefer me to say something else. But that is how I see it. And I owe it to you to tell you how I see it. The world is a better place without Saddam Hussein. Saddam had provoked two wars in the Gulf. He had used chemical weapons against other nations and against his own people. No one knew if and when he would get his hands on more weapons of mass destruction. So I think it was right to go to war. But I also think its right to tell the truth.In the run-up to the war, Tony Blair did not tell the truth. He did not give a truthful account of the intelligence he received. He did not behave as a British Prime Minister should. Tony Blair has said that mistakes were made. He has said he accepts responsibility. But it is not a question of responsibility. It is a question of credibility. I hope that we will not face another war. But the world is a very dangerous place, and you can never be sure. What if this Prime Minister asks people to trust him again? Could the British people trust him a second time? Conservative beliefsIf you want people to trust you, you must trust them. Of course, I don\u2019t believe that we are right about everything and Labour politicians are wrong about everything. Neither party has a monopoly on virtue. But I do believe that there are times in our history when Conservative ideas are more relevant to the challenges Britain faces. And we have reached one of those times today. I am a Conservative because I believe that if people are given a choice, they will make the right decision for themselves and their families. I am a Conservative because I understand that families are better at spending their hard earned cash than governments are. I am a Conservative because I want people to be big, and the State to be small. I am a Conservative because I know that government should be accountable to the people, not people to the government. And I am a Conservative because I have an inherent belief in fair play.No one should be over-mighty - not the trade unions, not the State, not corporations, not the European Union, not even the Prime Minister. We want to live in a society where people have the freedom to get on in life and get on with their lives, safe in the knowledge that government will provide them with security. Freedom and security: two timeless Conservative ambitions. This is what makes me a Conservative. And I believe it\u2019s what makes all of you Conservatives.So when people ask you on the doorstep, \u2018I can\u2019t stand Tony Blair, but why should I vote for you lot?\u2019 Here are ten words to remember. School discipline. More police. Cleaner hospitals. Lower taxes. Controlled immigration.Ten words to address the problems that are worrying people today. Remember those words. And remember one more: accountability. Don\u2019t forget to tell them. We won\u2019t just make a difference, we\u2019ll be different. We\u2019ll be accountable to them. We\u2019ll do what we say. There\u2019ll be less talk, more action. Optimistic about our people\u2019s future? Yes. Ambitious for Britain? Certainly. But always utterly practical. Ours is a philosophy that is rooted in reality. And it delivers. Britain is the best country in the world. It delivers for our country. We all love our country. But everything I have and everything I am I owe to this country.I was born in July 1941, two weeks after Hitler invaded Russia. Those were very dark days. In the next four years, millions of people were killed. Many lost their lives on the battlefield, at sea and in the air. Many lost their lives in cities blitzed from the air. And many lost their lives in the concentration camps set up by one of the cruellest tyrannies the world has ever known. My grandmother was one of those killed in the concentration camps. If it hadn\u2019t been for Winston Churchill, and if it hadn\u2019t been for Britain, I would have been one of them too. That\u2019s why when I say I owe everything I am to this country, I really do mean it. I owe my life to it.My father told me Britain was the best country in the world. I think it was. And I think it still is. But I know we could be doing so much better. And it\u2019s because I think I can help make things better that I am standing before you today. Put simply, I\u2019m here so I can give back to Britain a tiny fraction of what Britain has given to me.
p257
aVI was always taught that it doesn\u2019t matter what you do in life, as long as you do it to the best of your ability. And that is what I have always endeavoured to do. When I became leader, I knew we had a hard slog ahead of us. But I was determined to give it my all. Not just for my Party - but for my country. Because I wanted to give back to Britain a tiny bit of what Britain has given to me. We were disciplined. We were united. And, yes, we did make progress.For the first time in twenty two years, we came out of an election with many more MPs than we had when we went into it. We won more votes than Labour in England. And we made crucial issues like school discipline, respect and immigration the most important in British politics. But at the end of the day we didn\u2019t win - and let\u2019s be honest with each other: we didn\u2019t even come close to winning. My best turned out to be not good enough.A year ago, I stood before you and stressed the importance of accountability. In the real world, I said, if you say you\u2019re going to do something, you do it. And if you screw up, you risk losing your job. But politicians, I said, seem to live in a different world: a world where promises are dropped just as casually as they\u2019re made; a world where figures are fiddled; a world where there don\u2019t seem to be any penalties for failure.I promised that Conservatives would be different; that we would be accountable; and that if people didn\u2019t deliver, they\u2019d be out. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m standing down. It\u2019s about keeping your promises, it\u2019s called accountability. And looking at the Liberal Democrats and Labour, there\u2019s something to be said for going and being asked to stay, rather than staying and being asked to go. My successor has a clear and simple task: to regain for our Party the trust and respect of the British people. After this week, I know we can do it. But it will take a lot of hard work.If anyone here today thinks that we can just sit tight and wait for the pendulum to swing back to the Conservatives - think again. Of course this is a great party: the longest-standing, most successful party in the history of democracy. Of course we should be proud of what Conservatives have achieved. It was a Conservative, Wilberforce, who led the fight against the slave trade. It was a Conservative, Shaftesbury, who led the fight against child labour. It was a Conservative, Churchill, who led the fight against fascism. It was a Conservative, Margaret Thatcher, who helped win the Cold War, brought home ownership within reach of the majority and freed Britain from socialism. We Conservatives changed Britain and we changed her for the better. But no party, however much it has achieved in the past, is entitled to power in the future. No party has a God-given right to govern. There is no \u2018natural party of government.\u2019 The right to govern is a privilege we have to earn. And we will only earn it if we are clear, confident and consistent about what it means to be a Conservative.When you are in opposition, it\u2019s hard to prove that you mean what you say - that you will deliver what you promise. You cannot change the world. You haven\u2019t the power to do so. But you can show, by how you act and by what you say, that you are competent to govern. Competence is built on discipline. Of course we need discussion and debate. But let\u2019s not be offensive about each other. Let\u2019s not run down our Party. Let\u2019s show we can elect a new leader without bitterness and backbiting. And then let\u2019s unite behind that new leader not just for a year or two, but for a whole Parliament, even when the going gets tough. Unity and discipline are essential. And I promise you this. Whoever you choose to succeed me I shall support to the utmost of my ability. And I expect each and every one of you, and each and every one of our Members of Parliament, to do the same.This week we\u2019ve heard a lot about change. And, yes, we must change. We must not be obsessed by talking about ourselves, to ourselves, at Westminster. We must engage with the vast majority of people who often - quite rightly - see Westminster as a remote and distant place, unconnected to the real world. These people don\u2019t think that our country is on its knees - far from it. They like the buzz and excitement of our culture, our diversity, our individuality. They are deeply proud of Britain. You saw that when we won the Ashes, a win that brought thousands of people out onto the streets of London, just weeks after terrorists had attacked the Capital. And they\u2019re excited about the Olympics coming to London, and what a tribute that success was to a Conservative, Seb Coe, and his team. These people have high hopes for Britain. They see a glass half full. They\u2019re looking to the future, confident that Britain\u2019s best days lie ahead, and so must we.In 1979, we won more support among young people than in the electorate overall. Not by trying to be hip and cool, but by showing that we understood young people\u2019s aspirations. They wanted a Britain where they would have more freedom, more opportunity and more power to better themselves, their families and their communities. And now think about this: at the next general election, people born in 1990 will be able to vote for the first time. They were born in the last months of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s Premiership. They were born after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Their youth has been shaped by the internet and the iPod, by cheap flights and mobile phones. It has been overshadowed by the destruction of the Twin Towers and the bombings in London, Bali and Madrid. And it\u2019s been fired up by impatience for action on climate change and desperate poverty in Africa. So we must talk about what matters to them in today\u2019s world - their world, the world as it is, not the world as it was.Of course, we must hold true to Conservative values: the timeless values, rooted in human nature, values of personal responsibility, free enterprise, fair play and a sense of nationhood. But we must apply them to the challenges that Britain faces today: challenges to our values, our security and our society. How is it that when the vast majority of people play by the rules, communities across Britain are terrorised by an unruly minority who have no respect for their neighbours? Why do we, as a society, allow that minority to flout authority and get away with it - again and again? The scales of justice have tipped too far in favour of the rights of the individual at the expense of responsibility to the community. And it\u2019s that obsession with individual rights that is at the heart of the breakdown of respect in our society. When a schoolboy arsonist has his exclusion from school overturned on the basis that it denied him a \u2018right to education\u2019 you have to wonder what kind of world it is that were living in. The truth is, that political correctness turbo - charged by the Human Rights Act - is undermining a very precious British value: the value of fair play. Fairness really matters to people. It matters to me.Anyone who\u2019s had children knows that one of the first arguments they ever make is \u2018that\u2019s not fair.\u2019 Yet for far too long those of us on the right of politics have shied away from talking about fairness. Often we\u2019ve just seemed to shrug our shoulders and say \u2018well, life isn\u2019t fair.\u2019 That\u2019s true. We are born with different abilities and aptitudes. As I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve noticed, Sandra was always more likely to succeed as a model than me. But people are entitled to expect that their Government will treat them fairly. We are one country, one nation and we should all he bound by the same rules. Special rules for special interest groups breed anger and division. They blur the distinction between right and wrong. And they give the impression that some people are above the law.No one should be over-powerful: not ministers; not trade unions; not corporations; not the European Union. Wherever we see bullying by the over-mighty, we must stand up to it. Wherever we see one group flicking two fingers to the law, we must fight back. We must never forget that our duty is to stand up for those who do the right thing. It is our responsibility to protect their freedoms - whoever they are, wherever they live, whatever their background. And today those freedoms are threatened by terrorists. We face a choice in how we address this threat. Some say that immediate withdrawal from Iraq or a fair settlement for the Palestinians would deprive the terrorists of their recruiting sergeant. Few are keener than I am to see a secure Israel living beside a genuinely viable Palestinian State - or for Iraq to be able to maintain its own security.But let\u2019s not delude ourselves. The terrorist goal is not an end to Western involvement in Iraq or the creation of a Palestinian State. It is the destruction of Western society and democracy, which they believe are fundamentally corrupt and weak. So if we respond with weakness or equivocation it will only encourage the terrorists further. Let\u2019s start by confidently speaking up for democracy and Western values: freedom of speech, the rule of law, free elections and the equality of women. And let\u2019s take the practical steps needed to defend those values.We\u2019re an island. We\u2019re the fourth richest nation in the world. So our Government has the means to secure our borders. It just lacks the competence. That\u2019s why our immigration system is in such a shambles. We need to know who is coming into and leaving our country - that means controlling immigration. To me, that is a statement of the blindingly obvious. It\u2019s not about shoring up some core vote. It\u2019s about protecting our country. And no one - not Tony Blair, not Charles Kennedy, not the media nor anyone else - should stop us from saying so.To protect our country we need laws that are robust and effective. So we\u2019ve given our support in principle to many of the Government\u2019s proposals. But we will scrutinise each and every one of them in minute detail. Some of the new powers are far-reaching. So we have a simple test. No law should undermine the basic freedoms which we are seeking to defend. And we will not be reassured by Labour promises that they will be used with common sense.Why? Because last week in Brighton, a man, an eighty two year old man, was detained using anti-terror legislation because he dared to disagree with the Foreign Secretary. Legislation that very same Foreign Secretary had promised \u2018would not threaten in any way the right to demonstrate peacefully.\u2019 That should never have happened and should never be allowed to happen again. If we are to have new laws against terrorism, we must make sure that they are used against their real targets, not against innocent people who represent no terrorist threat at all.I\u2019m sometimes asked if I had made it to Number 10, what is the one thing I would like to have achieved. Well, when I applied to university a very long time ago, I wrote an essay called \u2018Why I am an Angry Young Man.\u2019 I saw Britain then as a country too stratified, too hidebound, where people tended to be judged on their background, not on merit. I saw a country in which too few people were able to make the best of their lives. And I knew then that it was the Conservatives who were best placed to change things. And I know that\u2019s still true today.So had I become Prime Minister, my ambition would have been for everyone - whatever their background or the colour of their skin - to have the chance to make the most of their talents and abilities, to climb as high as their ambitions can take them, to live the British Dream. I hope that dream will not be forgotten. Conservatism must once again become the language of hope: hope for those who live in poverty in our inner cities, hope for the immigrants who come here and settle, hope for all those communities left behind and forgotten.We have probably four years to the next general election. And we have made progress in the last two. Just look at our fifty-four newly elected MPs and you\u2019ll see that our Party has a bright and promising future. But we still have a long way to go. It will be hard - picking yourself up after defeat always is. We\u2019ll need stamina and comradeship. We\u2019ll need to show respect for each other, as well as for our opponents. We\u2019ll not always agree, but when we differ we must do so as friends, not as foes. We must build afresh acting with humility and in the knowledge that our Party has to earn the privilege of government.This is the last time I shall address you from a Conference platform. We go back, you and I - a long way. I became an active member of our Party when I was at Cambridge nearly fifty years ago. It was here in Blackpool in 1970 that I first addressed this Conference. It took me a long time to find a seat - I was keener on the idea than some of you were. But I\u2019ve been a Member of Parliament for twenty-two years. It took me a long time to become your leader, but I am profoundly grateful for the privilege of having led you. I love this Party, a party which has given so much to our country for so long and which will do so again in the future. I am intensely and immensely proud of this Party, and proud of you.Britain deserves better than she has today and it is your duty to provide it. So as you leave this conference my message, my last message to you, is this: Hold your heads up high. Be strong and of good courage. Unite behind a new leader. And then fight to build a better Britain. Go for it.

aVIt\u2019s a huge honour to be standing before you as leader of the Conservative Party. And first of all I want to thank you for the support you\u2019ve given me in the past ten months. It\u2019s been a time of great change. I\u2019m already on my second leader of the Liberal Democrats. Before long I\u2019ll be on to my second Labour Prime Minister. Soon I\u2019ll be the longest-serving leader of a major British political party. I wanted this job for a very simple reason. I love this country. I have great ambitions for our future. And I want the Party I love\u2026 \u2026to serve the country I love\u2026 \u2026in helping Britain be the best that it can. We need to change in order to have that chance. You cannot shape the future if you\u2019re stuck in the past. You knew that. And that\u2019s why you voted for change. I believe we can all be proud of what we\u2019ve achieved these past ten months. People looking at us with new interest. 25,000 new members. And in our first electoral test, in the local elections, we won forty per cent of the vote. Let\u2019s hear it for our fantastic local councillors who worked so hard and won so well. Tony Blair says it\u2019s all style and no substance. In fact he wrote me a letter about it. Dear Kettle\u2026 You\u2019re black. Signed, Pot. What a nerve that man has got. In the whole of the last year, there is only one substantial thing that the Labour Party has achieved for our country. Their education reforms. Right now, across the country, trust schools are being prepared with greater freedoms to teach children the way teachers and parents want. The only reason \u2013 the only reason - that\u2019s happening is because the Conservative Party did the right thing and took the legislation through the House of Commons. I\u2019m proud of that \u2013 proud of us, for putting the future of our children before party politics. Another sign of our changing fortunes is the impressive array of speakers who have come to join us at our conference this year. SENATOR McCAIN And I\u2019d like to pay a special tribute to one in particular. He\u2019s a man who knows about leadership. He\u2019s endured hardship that\u2019s unimaginable to many of us here. And he\u2019s fought battles for principles that we all admire. Who knows what the future may hold? But John, I for one would be proud to see you \u2013 a great American and a great friend to Britain - as leader of the free world. COLLEAGUES I\u2019d also like to pay tribute to my colleagues who have spoken already today. A year ago, David Davis and I were rivals. Today we\u2019re partners. He has given me the most fantastic support over these past ten months. Ideas, energy, advice. He has not only helped bring this Party together\u2026 \u2026he has helped take our Party in the right direction, and I want to thank him for all he\u2019s done. And I\u2019m proud to work with another man who is a brave politician, a wise counsellor and a great Conservative. A man who would be a Foreign Secretary that this country could be truly proud of: William Hague. Then there\u2019s Francis. I know Francis likes to pretend that everything is doom and gloom. He\u2019s always talking about the mountain we have to climb. He\u2019s so gloomy, he makes Gordon Brown look like a ray of sunshine. But Francis, you\u2019re doing a great job. LABOUR SPLITS AND BACKSTABBING Of course Francis has long told us to avoid the point-scoring and name-calling that can give politics such a bad name. He\u2019s right. But we didn\u2019t bargain on the Labour Party. First Gordon said he could never trust Tony again, then Tony called Gordon a blackmailer. Charles said Gordon was stupid, then John popped up and said no, Tony was stupid. Charles called Gordon a deluded control freak. And a member of the Cabinet said \u201cit would be an absolute effing disaster\u201d if Gordon got to No.10. That was just the husbands. When I look at these Labour ministers I ask myself how much time they\u2019re worrying about their own jobs\u2026 \u2026and how much time they\u2019re worrying about NHS, about crime, about our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan. You only have to ask the question to know what the answer is. And there are months more of it still to come. Months of infighting, instability, indecision, jockeying for position\u2026 They said it would be a \u201cstable and orderly transition.\u201d Yeah, right. Like they said \u201c24 hours to save the NHS\u201d, \u201ceducation education education.\u201d These are the things they should be fighting for, but they\u2019re too busy fighting each other. OUR RESPONSIBILITY So we have a great responsibility. To set out a clear, united and credible alternative. With some elections, you just know the result before a single vote has been cast. We were never going to win in 1997. People wanted change. I remember it well. I fought Stafford. And Stafford fought back. Labour were never going to win in 1983 when they offered Michael Foot as Prime Minister. Other elections are wide open. And the next election will be one of those. But we will not win, nor deserve to win, without a clear purpose and a proper plan. We must learn from Labour\u2019s big mistake. When Tony Blair won his first election, he had only one clear purpose: to win a second term. Even now he says that the only legacy \u2013 the only legacy - that really matters to him is Labour winning a fourth term. Back in 1997, he had no proper plan. No real understanding of how to make change happen. He had good intentions. But he hadn\u2019t worked out how to deliver them. So New Labour went round and round in circles. They abolished grant maintained schools - and now they\u2019re trying to recreate them. They reversed our NHS reforms - and now they\u2019re trying to bring them back. Road building \u2013 cancelled, then reinstated. They wasted time, wasted money, wasted the country\u2019s goodwill. Only now, after nine years, does Tony Blair seem clear about his purpose. Well I\u2019m sorry Mr Blair. That\u2019s nine years too late. THIS WEEK We won\u2019t make the same mistake. On Wednesday, the last day of our conference, I want to talk in detail about the important issues we face as a nation \u2013 and what our response will be. But today, on this first day of our conference, I\u2019d like to set the scene for our discussions this week. I want to explain how we will arrive at the next election knowing exactly what we want to do, and how we\u2019re going to do it. My argument is based on a simple analogy. Getting ready for the responsibility of government is like building a house together. Think of it in three stages. First you prepare the ground. Then you lay the foundations. And then, finally, brick by brick, you build your house. PREPARING THE GROUND These last ten months, we have been preparing the ground. Our Party\u2019s history tells us the ground on which political success is built. It is the centre ground. Not the bog of political compromise. Not the ideological wilderness, out on the fringes of debate. But the solid ground where people are. The centre ground is where you find the concerns, the hopes and the dreams of most people and families in this country. In 1979, they wanted a government to tame the unions, rescue our economy and restore Britain\u2019s pride. Margaret Thatcher offered precisely that alternative. And this Party can forever take pride in her magnificent achievements. Today, people want different things. The priorities are different. Safer streets. Schools that teach. A better quality of life. Better treatment for carers. That\u2019s what people are talking about today. But for too long, we were having a different conversation. Instead of talking about the things that most people care about, we talked about what we cared about most. While parents worried about childcare, getting the kids to school, balancing work and family life - we were banging on about Europe. As they worried about standards in thousands of secondary schools, we obsessed about a handful more grammar schools. As rising expectations demanded a better NHS for everyone, we put our faith in opt-outs for a few. While people wanted, more than anything, stability and low mortgage rates, the first thing we talked about was tax cuts. For years, this country wanted \u2013 desperately needed - a sensible centre-right party to sort things out in a sensible way. Well, that\u2019s what we are today. In these past ten months we have moved back to the ground on which this Party\u2019s success has always been built. The centre ground of British politics. And that is where we will stay. LAYING THE FOUNDATIONS \u2013 SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY But preparing the ground is just the first stage. Now we must show what we will build there. A strong government needs strong foundations. And I want us to lay those foundations this week. That\u2019s not about individual policies. It is about a vision of the Britain we want to see. A Britain where we do not just ask what government can do. We ask what people can do, what society can do. A Britain where we stop thinking you can pass laws to make people good. And start realising that we are all in this together. Social responsibility \u2013 that is the essence of liberal Conservatism. That is the idea I want us to explain this week. That is what we stand for. That is what we\u2019re fighting for. That is the Britain we want to build. Take fighting crime. It is not just a state responsibility. It is a social responsibility. Let\u2019s not pretend that all we need is tough talk and tough laws to bring safety to our streets. Of course the state must play its part. That\u2019s why we\u2019re developing a programme of radical police reform. That\u2019s why we want to build more prisons and reform the ones we\u2019ve got, so they help reduce re-offending instead of encouraging it. And that\u2019s why we\u2019ll invest in drug rehabilitation, so we help addicts get clean and stay clean, instead of living a life of crime to feed their habit. But that is not the end of the story. It is just the start. We need parents to bring up their children with the right values. We need schools to be places of discipline and order. We need to stand up for civilised values in public places. We need to design crime out of the housing estates of the future. We\u2019ve got to stop selling alcohol to children. We need the music industry to understand that profiting from violent and homophobic words and images is morally wrong and socially unacceptable. But more than this, we need people, families, communities, businesses to step up to the plate and understand that it\u2019s not just about stopping the bad things\u2026 \u2026it\u2019s about actively doing the good things. Not waiting for the state to do it all, but taking responsibility, making a difference, saying loudly and proudly: this is my country, this is my community: I will play my part. That is social responsibility. That is our idea. So I want us to be the champions of a new spirit of social responsibility in this land. A new spirit of social responsibility that will succeed for Britain where Labour\u2019s outdated state responsibility has failed. LABOUR\u2019S APPROACH Think of any issue - not just crime - and then think of Labour\u2019s response. This Government\u2019s way of doing things \u2013 the old way of doing things - is so familiar, and so depressing. Ministers hold a summit. They announce an eye-catching initiative. A five-year plan. Gordon Brown generously finds the money for it. The money gets a headline, but no-one knows what to do with it. So they create a unit in the Cabinet Office. A task force is set up. Regional co-ordinators are appointed. Gordon Brown sets them targets \u2013 after all, it is his money. Pilot schemes are launched. The pilot schemes are rolled out across the country. They are evaluated. Then revised, re-organised and re-launched. And then finally, once the reality dawns that the only people to benefit are the lawyers, accountants and consultants of Labour\u2019s quango army\u2026 \u2026with a pathetic whimper \u2013 but no hint of an apology \u2013 the whole thing is just abandoned. We\u2019ve seen too much of this in the past nine years. Headline after headline but absolutely no follow-through. It is a story of ignorance, incompetence, arrogance. A story of wasted billions - and disappointed millions. Somewhere out there, there is a place where Blair and Brown will never go. It\u2019s dark. It\u2019s depressing. It\u2019s haunted by the failures of nine years of centralisation, gimmick and spin. It is the graveyard of initiatives, where you\u2019ll find the e-University that died a death, the drugs czar that came and went\u2026 \u2026the Individual Learning Accounts that collapsed in fraud and waste, the tax credits that were paid and reclaimed\u2026 \u2026the Connexions service that flopped, the Strategic Health Authorities that were dropped\u2026 \u2026the marching of yobs to the hole in the wall; the night courts that never happened at all. And still they keep coming, those hubristic monuments to big government, the living dead that walk the well-trodden path from Downing Street and the Treasury to New Labour\u2019s graveyard of initiatives. The NHS computer: delayed, disorganised, a £20 billion shambles. Forced police mergers: the direct opposite of the community policing we need. And then the perfect example. ID cards. When a half-way competent government would be protecting our security by controlling our borders\u2026 \u2026these Labour ministers are pressing ahead with their vast white elephant, their plastic poll tax, twenty Millennium Domes rolled into one giant catastrophe in the making. They\u2019ve given up trying to find a good reason for it. Last week Tony Blair said that ID cards would help control immigration, when new immigrants won\u2019t even have them. Does he even know what\u2019s going on in his Government? ID cards are wrong, they\u2019re a waste of money, and we will abolish them. These last nine years have been the story of a Government which instinctively believes, whatever it says, that everything is the state\u2019s responsibility. We believe in social responsibility. Because there is such a thing as society, it\u2019s just not the same thing as the state. THE BRITAIN WE WANT TO SEE So let us define this week the kind of Britain we want to see. And let us show how our idea \u2013 social responsibility\u2026 \u2026not Labour\u2019s idea \u2013 state responsibility\u2026 \u2026is the right response to the challenges Britain faces. GLOBALISATION, WELL-BEING, THE ENVIRONMENT We know that in the age of globalisation, in the face of fast-moving economic change, people want their government to provide security. We know that the end of the traditional 9 to 5 job can make life tough for families, and people look to their government for answers. And we know that in the race against time to tackle climate change and protect the environment, people expect their government to show leadership. On all these challenges, Labour\u2019s first response is to regulate business, hoping to offer protection. It may sound attractive. But there are unintended consequences. Well-intentioned regulation can make us less secure in the age of globalisation. Less able to provide the jobs, wealth and opportunity on which well-being depends. It can undermine the competitiveness of our companies, so it\u2019s harder for them to invest in the new, green technologies of the future. So our response, based on our philosophy of social responsibility, is to say to business: Yes you should look after your workers, yes you should look after your community, yes you should look after our environment. And we must stand up to big business when it\u2019s in the interests of Britain and the wider world. So next week our MEPs will vote to strengthen proposals to make companies replace dangerous chemicals with safe ones. But where Labour are casual about increasing regulation, we will be careful. We will ask: Are we making it easier to start a business? Easier to employ someone? Is the overall burden of regulation going down? Will the regulation that\u2019s being put forward lead to real changes in behaviour, or just time-wasting and box-ticking? If only we had a government that was asking these questions today. We want companies to create their own solutions to social and environmental challenges, because those are the solutions most likely to last. So in a Conservative Britain, corporate responsibility will provide the best long-term answer to economic insecurity, well-being in the workplace, and environmental care. It is the same approach when you look at the other great challenges we face. PUBLIC SERVICES We know that in an age of amazing technological advance, instant information exchange, and empowered consumers who don\u2019t have the deference of previous generations\u2026 \u2026people expect more from our health service and our schools. And government has to respond to that. Labour\u2019s response is the culture of targets, directives and central control, aimed at raising standards in our public services. They mean well. But the unintended consequence is to make these services less responsive to the people who use them, dashing expectations not meeting them. So our response, based on our philosophy of social responsibility, is to say to our nurses, doctors, teachers: Yes you should meet higher standards, yes you should give your patients and your pupils more. But we\u2019re not going to tell you how to do it. You are professionals. We trust in your vocation So in a Conservative Britain, professional responsibility will provide the answer to rising expectations in the NHS and schools. POVERTY AND REGENERATION And just as people will no longer accept second best in public services, we know that in their communities they are fed up with squalor and poverty and crime\u2026 \u2026and they look to their leaders to sort things out. Labour\u2019s response has been a massive expansion of central government into local communities. The centralised Neighbourhood Renewal Unit, the insensitive Pathfinder programme, prescriptive top-down schemes for regeneration. You can see why Labour have done it. But the unintended consequence is to stifle the very spirit of community self-improvement that they are responding to. Our response, based on our philosophy of social responsibility, is to trust local leaders, not undermine them. So we will hand power and control to local councils and local people who have the solutions to poverty, to crime, to urban decay in their hands. We trust in your knowledge and commitment. So in a Conservative Britain, civic responsibility will provide the answer to improving the quality of life in the communities left behind. CHILDREN And then perhaps the greatest challenge of all. The challenge of bringing up children in a world that often seems fraught with risk and danger. There is nothing that matters more to me than the safety and happiness of my family. Of course it\u2019s right that government should be on parents\u2019 side. But Labour take it way too far. A national database of every child. Making childcare a state monopoly. Slapping ASBOs on children who haven\u2019t even been born. Labour\u2019s intentions may be good. But the unintended consequence is to create a culture of irresponsibility. They may have abandoned Clause 4 and the nationalisation of industry. But they are replacing it with the nationalisation of everyday life. The state can never be everywhere, policing the interactions of our daily lives - and it shouldn\u2019t try. Real change will take years of patient hard work, and we will test every policy by asking: does it enhance parental responsibility? We need to understand that cultural change is worth any number of government initiatives. Who has done more to improve school food, Jamie Oliver, or the Department of Education? Put another way, we need more of Supernanny, less of the nanny state. So in a Conservative Britain, personal responsibility will provide the best answer to the risks and dangers of the modern world. Personal responsibility. Professional responsibility. Corporate responsibility. Civic responsibility. These are the four pillars of our social responsibility. That is the Britain we want to build. A Britain that is more green. More family-friendly. More local control over the things that matter. Less arrogant about politicians\u2019 ability to do it all on their own. But more optimistic about what we can achieve if we all work together. We want an opportunity society, not an overpowering state. BUILDING OUR HOUSE This week, in our debates, we will lay the foundations of the house we are building together. The foundations must come first. How superficial, how insubstantial it would be, for us to make up policies to meet the pressures of the moment. Policy without principle is like a house without foundations. It will not stand the test of time. That is what our Policy Review is all about: getting it right for the long term. OPTIMISM ABOUT BRITAIN\u2019S FUTURE If we do this, we can help achieve so much for this country. In a few years\u2019 time, Britain could wake up to a bright new morning. We have everything to be optimistic about. You could not design a country with better natural advantages than we have. We speak the language of the world. We have links of history and culture with every continent on earth. We have institutions \u2013 our legal system, our armed forces, the BBC, our great universities \u2013 which set the standard that all other countries measure themselves by. Our artists, writers and musicians inspire people the world over. We are inventive, creative, irreverent and daring. In this young century, these old advantages give us the edge we need. CONCLUSION What a prospect for a great Party \u2013 to guide our nation at this time of opportunity. So let us stick to the plan. Let us build - carefully, thoughtfully and patiently, a new house together. Preparing the ground as we move to the centre, meeting the priorities of the modern world. Laying the foundations with our idea - social responsibility. And building on those foundations with the right policies for our long-term future. The nation\u2019s hopes are in our hands. People\u2019s hopes. Your hopes. My hopes. In eight days\u2019 time I will be forty years old. I have so much to look forward to. My young family. They have so much to look forward to. The world I want for them is the world I want for every family and every community. If you want to know what I\u2019m all about, I can explain it one word. That word is optimism. I am optimistic about human nature. That\u2019s why I will trust people to do the right thing. Labour are pessimists. They think that without their guidance, people will do the wrong thing. That\u2019s why they want to regulate and control. So let us show clearly which side we are on. Let optimism beat pessimism. Let sunshine win the day. And let everyone know that the Conservative Party is ready. Ready to serve. Ready to fight. Ready to win.

aVIt\u2019s been a great week. This week we\u2019ve shown we are back in the centre ground of British politics. A stable economy. Fighting crime. Backing the NHS and our state schools. Childcare and flexible working. Improving our environment and quality of life. Those are people\u2019s priorities - those are our priorities today.We\u2019ve seen fantastic new candidates, one third of them women. But it\u2019s not just who we select. It\u2019s what they do. Our new candidates are changing the way we think about politics, not just campaigning and delivering leaflets but making a difference in their community.This week we\u2019ve done that in Bournemouth. Conservatives, converting a disused church into a community centre. That\u2019s our idea - social responsibility - in action. I want to thank everyone who got involved, and in particular the local MP Tobias Ellwood and all his team who worked so hard. We are united and rejuvenated. And as this conference has shown, we are the Party that is open to new ideas and fresh thinking.Real SubstanceOn Sunday, I spoke to you about the changes we\u2019re making in our Party, and why they are so important. Today, I want to talk about what I believe in, and what we need to start doing for our country. And as I do that, I want to deal directly with this issue of substance.Substance is not about producing a ten point plan. It is about deeper things than that. It is about knowing what you believe. It is about a clear idea of the Britain you want to see.For us, that Britain is based on the idea of social responsibility. That means a Britain where instead of always turning to the state for the answers, we turn to each other and ask: what more can we do together to solve this problem? So I don\u2019t think that announcing policies in a rush amounts to substance.Real substance is about taking time to think things through, not trotting out easy answers that people might want to hear. It\u2019s about sticking to your guns. It\u2019s about character, judgment, and consistency. It\u2019s about policy, yes. But it\u2019s about getting it right for the long term. That\u2019s why I asked Oliver Letwin, one of the most intelligent and thoughtful politicians in our country, to lead our Policy Review.Tax Right, let\u2019s talk about tax. Everyone in this hall, me included, knows that a low tax economy is a strong economy. But some people want me to flash up some pie in the sky tax cuts to show what we stand for.Let me tell you straight. That is not substance. And that is not what we stand for.Do you know what I think? I think that when some people talk about substance, what they mean is they want the old policies back. Well they\u2019re not coming back. We\u2019re not going back. We\u2019ve laid it out clearly at this conference. We will not take risks with the economy. We will not make promises we can\u2019t keep.As George Osborne said in that brilliant speech yesterday, we believe in sound money and stability always comes first.EconomyGeorge has also rightly said that we need a broad-based economic policy, not just a tax policy. We need to strengthen our pensions system. Deregulate our employers and wealth-creators. Invest in education, skills, the potential of our people. Build a modern transport system. And we need to do more to promote British trade and investment.In this age of globalisation and fierce international competition from India, China, Brazil, we cannot afford to sit back. We have to fly the flag for British business.NHSAs our economy grows, one of the most important calls on the proceeds of that growth is the NHS. The NHS is vitally important to every family in this country. It certainly is to my family.I believe that the creation of the NHS is one of the greatest achievements of the 20th century.  It is founded on the noble but simple ideal that no person should ever have to worry about their healthcare. But it\u2019s about more than that. The NHS is an expression of our values as a nation. It is a symbol of collective will, of social solidarity. That is why the British people, of all political parties and of none, are so proud of it, and so attached to it.I have always believed this.But when your family relies on the NHS all the time - day after day, night after night - you really know just how precious it is.I know the problems. Turning up at A&E and the children\u2019s one is closed. Waiting for the doctor when you\u2019re desperate with worry. Waiting for the scan that is so desperately needed. It can be incredibly frustrating.But more often than not, it is an inspiration - thanks to the people who work in the NHS. The nurses who do everything to make you comfortable. The doctors who desperately want to get to the truth. And the army of support staff who get forgotten so often but who make such a difference to all of us.For me, it\u2019s not a question of saying the NHS is \u2018safe in my hands.\u2019My family is so often in the hands of the NHS. And I want them to be safe there.Tony Blair once explained his priority in three words: education, education, education. I can do it in three letters. NHS.We will serve and support the National Health Service. We will always support the NHS with the funding it needs. But we will make sure that money is well spent.Health spending has doubled under Labour. But where has all the money gone? Into pointless and contradictory reorganisations. Do you remember \u201824 hours to save the NHS\u2019? It should have been \u201824 ways to reorganise the NHS.\u2019 First they abolished the independent NHS Executive and put the Department of Health in charge. Then they abolished the eight regional NHS offices and created 28 new Strategic Health Authorities. Later they abolished the 28 new Strategic Health Authorities and created ten new regional Strategic Health Authorities. Out went GP fund holding - in came Primary Care Groups. Out went Primary Care Groups - in came Primary Care Trusts. They abolished Health Authorities. Then they created them all over again. Are you still with me?Because I can tell you, the people working in the NHS are utterly bewildered. The other day I read about a public health director who has been in his job for twelve years. Because of all the reorganisations, he\u2019s had to reapply for the job seven times. What a shambolic way to treat people. What a waste of time, what a waste of money.No wonder beds and wards are closing.No wonder that doctors and nurses are so dissatisfied with what\u2019s happening.Politicians have interfered in professional judgements and diminished professional responsibility. I\u2019ve heard it described as the \u2018death of discretion.\u2019 They join the NHS in their twenties, full of idealism and vocation. By their forties, far too many are demoralised. From idealism to demoralisation in half a career. How can we do this to people?The waste of money in the NHS is nothing next to the waste of talent and energy and hope. So I make this commitment to the NHS and all who work in it. No more pointless re-organisations. Yes, change is necessary in the NHS. But the changes we want to make are based on our idea, social responsibility. We want to see far greater professional responsibility in the NHS. And we should remember that the world of healthcare extends far beyond the hospitals and the GP surgeries.As we live longer and our society grows older, these services will play an ever-more important part in our well-being. How do we help carers go on caring? Why can\u2019t we have more occupational therapy, so people can get the adjustments to their house or flat so they can go on living at home longer? Why can\u2019t we recognise that social services isn\u2019t a Cinderella service - for many people, it\u2019s the vital service that helps them enjoy some sort of quality of life.Next week, Andrew Lansley and I launch our national campaign on the NHS. I hope that you are ready. We must get out there on the streets of this country and send this Government a clear message. They have mismanaged the NHS. Stop cutting the NHS and let\u2019s back it with all our hearts and improve it for everyone.Attitude to LabourI back the NHS because I believe in it. Standing up for your beliefs is what real substance is about. But in politics, it\u2019s also about telling the truth.Not everything that Labour have done since 1997 is bad. People don\u2019t want us to turn the clock back.  They want us to improve the bad things, yes. But they also want us to keep the good things. Like Bank of England independence. Like the minimum wage. We\u2019ll keep it and, when we can, we\u2019ll increase it.Where Labour do the right thing, like those education reforms, we\u2019ll back them.That is real substance. Standing up for what you believe. Putting your country first.  That is something that this Party has always deeply understood.Trust in PoliticsAnd let me tell you why it\u2019s so important. Twelve years ago, there was an energetic young party leader. He stood before his party conference for the first time. He said he\u2019d change his party. He made promises about changing the country. Remember him?  I do.And look what happened. People voted for him, but he let them down. So let\u2019s not think that people are going to jump from Labour straight into our arms. This is going to be slow, patient, hard work. We have to show, day by day, week by week, month by month that we deserve our country\u2019s trust.And I\u2019ll tell you something important, something substantial, that we have to change. For too long, the big political decisions in this country have been made in the wrong place. Not round the Cabinet table, where they should be. But on the sofa in Tony Blair\u2019s office. No notes are taken. No one knows who\u2019s accountable. No one takes the blame when things go wrong. That arrogant style of government must come to an end.I will restore the proper processes of government. That means building a strong team, and leading them. I want to be Prime Minister of this country. Not a President. The Price of ProgressThere is another important aspect of earning people\u2019s trust. We must face up to the fact that progress towards our nation\u2019s priorities is never free. There\u2019s always a price to be paid. Pretending that everything is simple and straightforward and can be sorted out with a wave of a minister\u2019s wand\u2026 Making out that anything is possible, everything is easy, it\u2019s all painless\u2026 That is spin.We\u2019ve seen enough of that over these last nine years. We must be different.We must show that we understand the price of progress, and tell people what it is. Not after we get into government, but before. That is real substance.GreenAs you might have gathered by now, I am passionate about our environment. It\u2019s a very personal commitment. I grew up in the countryside. I\u2019ve always loved the outdoors. As you can see if you look around this conference, I\u2019m quite keen on trees.We saw in our debate on Monday the scale of the threat from climate change. I know that we have within us the creativity, the innovation, the technological potential to achieve green growth - sustainable prosperity. The Stern Report will tell us that the tools of success are in our grasp. But it will also say that the price of inaction gets higher every day. So I will not pretend to you that it will be easy. That there will be no pain or sacrifice.If you want to understand climate change, go and see Al Gore\u2019s film, An Inconvenient Truth. Today, I want to tell the British people some uncomfortable truths. There is a price for progress in tackling climate change. Yes of course low-energy light bulbs, hybrid cars - even a windmill on your roof - can make a difference and also save money.But these things are not enough.Government must show leadership by setting the right framework. Binding targets for carbon reduction, year on year. That would create a price for carbon in our economy. What does that mean? It means that things which produce more carbon will get more expensive. Going green is not some fashionable, pain-free option. It will place a responsibility on business. It will place a responsibility on all of us. That is the point. Tackling climate change is our social responsibility - to the next generation. And I\u2019ll tell you something. In politics, it\u2019s much easier to take steps that will be painful if political parties work together, instead of playing it for partisan advantage. That\u2019s what we have offered to do. We have asked Tony Blair to put a Climate Change Bill in the Queen\u2019s Speech. If he does, we\u2019ll back it.So come on Prime Minister. It\u2019s your last few months in office. It\u2019s your last Queen\u2019s Speech. Use it to do something for the environment.HousingBut the environment isn\u2019t the only priority. There are other priorities - and sometimes they compete. Sweeping contradictions under the carpet may make life easy for a while. But it\u2019s not substance. So let us confront a tension that this Party feels very deeply.We are the Party of aspiration and opportunity, always have been; always will be. A profound part of that is owning your own home. That dream is something Conservatives instinctively understand. We also understand the importance of conservation. But if we want new homes, they must be built somewhere.Yes they must be built with care for local communities. Yes they must be built in harmony with existing architecture. And yes they must be built in sympathy with the environment. But let us not pretend there is a pain-free solution to this dilemma that satisfies every vested interest, as well as providing all the new homes we need.We must be on the side of the next generation.If we are to be the Party of aspiration, we must be on the side of aspiration. And that means building more houses and flats for young people. It is our social responsibility.ResponsibilityBefore putting myself forward for this job, I thought about all the responsibility it entails. When I spend time in a school or a hospital, I now think of the ultimate responsibility a Prime Minister has to make sure our public services are properly funded. As Prime Minister, words on the environment will have to turn into action at home and abroad.But there is no greater responsibility for a Prime Minister than protecting the security of our country and sending our armed forces into actionTroopsIn July, I went to Afghanistan to meet our troops. Some of them are just 18 years old. They\u2019ve only been in the army six months. They are fighting a ferocious enemy, day in, day out. Living off ration packs. Boiling hot days. Sleeping in the open. When you think of your own comfortable life at home, it makes you feel incredibly humble.Our mission in Afghanistan is not just a moral responsibility. It is vital to keep Britain safe. A lawless, broken Afghanistan was the cradle for the terrorist attacks of September 11th. Our armed forces are doing important work in Afghanistan and Iraq.So let the message go out from this conference, to the best armed forces in the world. You are fighting in our name and we are proud of what you do.But I want us to send our forces a second message. Responding to the questions that our troops themselves are asking.They\u2019re asking for armoured vehicles that will actually defend them against roadside bombs. They need more helicopters. They\u2019re asking to be able to phone home for more than twenty minutes a week. And they\u2019re asking for decent treatment for their families at home.You know Liam Fox. I know Liam Fox. There is someone with real passion and energy, who would never stop fighting for Britain\u2019s troops to get them all that they need.There is a big RAF base in my constituency. I know it well. I know the houses the forces\u2019 families live in. Some of them aren\u2019t good enough. I know the schools their children go to. Half the school roll changes every year and they don\u2019t have the extra support they need to cope. Meanwhile our servicemen and women pay income tax while they\u2019re fighting overseas.Our forces and their families do so much for us. And we should do more - a lot more - for them.The Threat of TerrorismOur missions in Iraq and Afghanistan remind us of the great dangers of our times. I know that if we win the next election, the moment I walk through the front door of Downing Street I will have the huge responsibility of protecting the British people from terrorism.There are some who still believe that the threat we face today is no different from ones that we have faced before, such as the IRA. They are profoundly mistaken. We are dealing with people who are prepared to do anything, kill any number, and use suicide attacks to further their aims.Defeating them will be a battle of hearts and minds, as well as force.But this threat cannot be negotiated away or appeased - it has to be confronted and overcome.SecurityWhen it comes to our national security, I will always listen to the police and security services, and take their advice with the utmost seriousness.I will never play politics with this issue. What I will do, is my duty. Which is to support the Government when they do the right thing. And hold them to account when they\u2019re getting it wrong.So let me say plainly, I believe that this Government is getting some things wrong. They\u2019re pressing ahead with ID cards that won\u2019t stop dangerous people coming into our country. But they\u2019re not giving us the border controls that just might. They\u2019re bringing in new offences that aren\u2019t being used. But they haven\u2019t changed the law so that wire tap evidence can be used to prosecute terror suspects in court.People who threaten our security should be arrested, charged, put in front of a court, tried and imprisoned. That is the British way.When I ask myself why they haven\u2019t done some of the things they should have, I keep coming back to one thing. The Human Rights Act.I believe that yes, the British people need a clear definition of their rights in this complex world. But I also believe we need a legal framework for those rights that does not hamper the fight against terrorism. That is why we will abolish the Human Rights Act and put a new British Bill of Rights in its place.CrimeProtecting our security is not just about terrorism. People\u2019s daily fear is crime.Gun crime is up, knife crime is up, there is violence and disorder on too many of our streets. But all we get from Labour are endless get-tough headlines and thousands of new criminal offences.They\u2019re not building the prisons. They\u2019re not reforming the police. They\u2019re not cancelling the early release schemes. Those are the things that need to be done.And then, in the final irony, last week Tony Blair attacked me for what I said about hoodies. In that one cheap joke, he gave up on one of the best things he ever said - that we need to be tough on the causes of crime.Everyone in this hall, everyone watching at home, knows that we will only tackle crime if we tackle family breakdown\u2026 if we tackle drug addiction\u2026 if we mend broken lives.So we have a new reality in British politics today. With David Davis as Home Secretary, this Party, the Conservative Party is the only party in Britain that will be tough on crime and tough on the causes of crime.Foreign PolicyAnd we will be tough when it comes to promoting this country\u2019s interests abroad.Last week the Prime Minister criticised me for wanting a foreign policy which was more independent of the White House. I don\u2019t need lessons in the importance of Britain\u2019s relationship with America. My grandfather went ashore in Normandy in June 1944, in a combined Anglo-American operation that liberated Western Europe from the Nazis.I became involved in politics in the 1980s, when Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan defeated the Soviet Union. Unlike some, I never had any doubts about whose side I was on in the Cold War. But now Mr. Blair objects when I say our foreign policy should not simply be unquestioning in our relationship with America.William Hague and I have said we must be steadfast not slavish in how we approach the special relationship. Apparently Tony Blair disagrees. Well if he\u2019s accusing me of wanting to be a British Prime Minister pursuing a British foreign policy, then I plead guilty.Questioning the approach of the US administration, trying to learn the lessons of the past five years, does not make you \u2018anti-American.\u2019 Ask John McCain.I\u2019m not a neo-conservative. I\u2019m a liberal Conservative.Liberal - because I believe in spreading freedom and democracy, and supporting humanitarian intervention. That is why we cannot stand by and watch further genocide in Darfur. But Conservative - because I also recognise the complexities of human nature, and will always be sceptical of grand schemes to remake the world.We need more patience, more humility in the way we engage with the world.CohesionThe same values should guide our approach to building a stronger society at home.The Cantle Report into the riots in our northern cities in 2001 talked about many communities living \u2018parallel lives.\u2019 Communities where people from different ethnic origins never meet, never talk, never go into each others\u2019 homes.Ultimately, it is an emotional connection that binds a country together. Sympathy for people you don\u2019t even know, and who may be very different to you. It is by contact that we overcome our differences - and realise that though our origins and our cultures may vary, we all share common values. The most basic contact comes from talking to each other. So we must make sure that new immigrants learn to speak English. And one of the most important ways we make connections with people is at school.So let me face head-on the question of faith schools. I know that people feel strongly about this issue. So do I. I support faith schools. Many parents want to send their children to them, and trust their judgment. All faiths want them. And let us say, clearly, that Islam is one of the great religions of the world, and that British Muslims make a fantastic contribution to our country.Today, a new generation of Muslim schools is emerging. If these schools are to be British state schools, they must be part of our society, not separate from it.The Cantle Report recommended that faith schools admit a proportion of pupils from other faiths.Only this week the Church of England said it would implement this recommendation in all new church schools it creates, admitting a quarter of pupils from non-Anglican backgrounds. That is a great example of what I mean by social responsibility. The Church deciding to take responsibility for community cohesion. Society - not the state.I believe the time has come for other faith groups to show similar social responsibility. And if we are to bring our society together, then schools - all schools - must teach children that wherever they come from, if they are British citizens, they are inheritors of a British birthright.The foundations of our society: the rule of law, democracy and individual freedom. And every child in our country, wherever they come from, must know and deeply understand what it means to be British. The components of our identity - our institutions, our language and our history.The Conservative Party must address these issues.  Real substance means addressing them openly and frankly.The issues are incredibly complicated. They will need sensitive handling. And I can\u2019t think of anyone better to do it than our Shadow Education Secretary, David Willetts.EducationAlthough we agree with Labour about trust schools, there is still a profound divide between our approach to education and Labour\u2019s. They think equality means treating every child the same. Including kids with learning difficulties in the same classes as the brightest. Forcing schools to accept disruptive pupils, putting up with bad behaviour, no matter the damage it does to the others.We think equality means something else. Individual children have individual needs, individual abilities, and individual interests. Real equality means giving every child the education that is best for them. That should mean more setting and streaming within schools - so each child can develop at the speed that works for them. It should mean clear rules of behaviour - so that our children grow up knowing the difference between right and wrong. And it means saving special schools - so that parents have choice, and children with learning difficulties can receive the care, the education and the attention they need.Social ResponsibilityBuilding a strong society is not just a task for politicians. We are all in this together. We all have a responsibility to each other.Changing Britain for the better is not just about passing laws. We\u2019ve got to be less arrogant about what politicians can achieve. Because it is not the politicians who make the wealth, who build the houses, who heal the sick. It is people. It is society, not just the state. That is why social responsibility will be the foundation for all that we do.When our Party was last in power, our task was to restore economic responsibility - putting individuals and businesses in charge of their own affairs.The task for us today is different.For years, we Conservatives talked about rolling back the state. But that is not an end in itself. Our fundamental aim is to roll forward the frontiers of society.FamilyAnd there is one vital way in which we can do that.The real privilege of my childhood was that my family was loving and close.  Families, to me, are not just the basic unit of society, they\u2019re the best. They are the ultimate source of our society\u2019s strength or weakness. Families matter because almost every social problem that we face comes down to family stability. And so I will set a simple test for each and every one of our policies: does it help families?The first thing to help families with is childcare. This is particularly vital for single parents. Why are so many single parents trapped in poverty? Partly because childcare is so costly and complicated in our country. Those of us who don\u2019t live the life of a single parent - just try and imagine it for a moment. Think about what it\u2019s like when you\u2019re left on your own to look after the kids. If I\u2019m in charge on my own for just a few hours the place looks like a bomb\u2019s hit it. Imagine looking after children all on your own all the time. And trying to get a job, trying to hold down a job with an employer who isn\u2019t understanding about the fact that you might have to disappear at a moment\u2019s notice because there\u2019s no one else in your child\u2019s life, and you are responsible.Britain has got the most expensive childcare in Europe. So we support the Government\u2019s efforts to put more money into childcare. But why are they saying you should only get help if you use formal childcare? What about the grandparents, the friends, the neighbours, who for so many families provide that lifeline by looking after the kids? So let\u2019s trust the parents in the childcare choices that they make.All families do a vital job, and they all need our support. But I also believe that marriage is a great institution, and we should support it. I\u2019m not naïve in thinking that somehow the state can engineer happy families with this policy or that tax break. All I can tell you is what I think. And what I think is this. There\u2019s something special about marriage. It\u2019s not about religion. It\u2019s not about morality. It\u2019s about commitment.When you stand up there, in front of your friends and your family, in front of the world, whether it\u2019s in a church or anywhere else, what you\u2019re doing really means something. Pledging yourself to another means doing something brave and important. You are making a commitment. You are publicly saying: it\u2019s not just about me, me, me anymore. It is about we - together, the two of us - through thick and thin. That really matters.And by the way, it means something whether you\u2019re a man and a woman, a woman and a woman or a man and another man. That\u2019s why we were right to support civil partnerships, and I\u2019m proud of that.Of course not every marriage lasts, and many couples are much better off apart. Women must have an escape route from abusive relationships.Every married couple has rows and difficulties. But if you\u2019ve made that public commitment, it just helps you try harder to work your problems through.We can argue forever about whether favouring marriage means disadvantaging other arrangements. My approach is simple. If marriage rates went up, if divorce rates came down - if more couples stayed together for longer, would our society by better off? My answer is yes.But supporting marriage is not just about money, or tax breaks. It is insulting to the human spirit to believe that a relationship between two people is just about money, or even mainly about money. It isn\u2019t.  So recognising marriage more directly in the tax system is not enough.Flexible working. Family centres. Relationship advice. All of these things matter. Let us as a society and as a culture value and recognise marriage more.ConclusionFamily. Community. Society. The NHS. The environment. Our quality of life. These are the things that matter most to me. These are the things that drive me in politics. And I want us here to be optimistic about their future.Tony Blair said Britain is a young country. He is wrong. This is an old country, with a proud past and a bright future.Look at the forces shaping our world. Technology that can topple dictators. Innovations that can tackle climate change. The prospect of global trade and investment and development that can end the spectre of poverty and heal the divisions between rich and poor.Our generation of politicians must understand these forces, must harness them for progress. We must not be the party that says the world and our country is going to the dogs. We must be the Party that lifts people\u2019s sights and raises their hopes.We are getting ready to serve again. Standing up for what we believe. Reaching out for what we can achieve.Let us be confident as we say, together, here today.The best is yet to come.

aVLet me start by asking some questions:What kind of country is it where the government responds to the threat of climate change by allowing green taxes to fall as carbon emissions rise?What kind of country is it where the richest in the land pay a lower rate of tax than the people who have to clean their offices?What kind of country is it where the government halts a criminal investigation into corrupt arms sales to placate commercial interests?What kind of country is it where the government colludes with the Tories to exempt MPs from freedom of information?What kind of country is it where the government sneaks out a short statement on the last day of Parliament signing us up to host America\u2019s Son of Star Wars on British soil?And what kind of country is it where the government leads us into an illegal and disastrous war and then stops people from protesting against it?Well, I\u2019ll tell you what sort of country it\u2019s not.It\u2019s not a liberal country.That\u2019s why the Liberal Democrats have never been more necessary than we are today.Last year at our conference, I made it clear that under my leadership the Liberal Democrats will always put substance ahead of spin. And this year we have gone even further in setting out distinctive policies to pave the way to a better future for Britain.Take climate change. The film that you have just seen makes an overwhelming case for action on the environment now. This party \u2013 and this party alone \u2013 has committed to deliver that action. In England, Wales and Scotland, the Liberal Democrats are leading the fight against climate change.Last week the Green Alliance rated our environmental policies top of all the major parties \u2013 just as Friends of the Earth did in the recent Scottish election campaign. And on both occasions the Conservatives scored zero.Only we have the honesty to propose raising tax on pollution in order to cut tax on income.Only we have the foresight to map out the route to a zero carbon Britain.Only we have the vision to insist on British leadership in the international effort to tackle climate change.You might have noticed this week that we have one or two critics in the media. Well, I\u2019m happy to say that I answer to you and not to the media. Thank goodness.  That\u2019s why we Liberal Democrats can confront the difficult issues. Take tough decisions. Yes \u2013 and say controversial things too.That\u2019s what real leadership is about.That\u2019s what my leadership is about.That\u2019s why we - the Liberal Democrats - are at the cutting edge of the debates on tax, poverty and crime.And I won\u2019t have it any other way.When we go into the next election I will tell the hard, uncompromising truths about the state of this country. And about the radical action needed to change it.That\u2019s the honest way to earn peoples\u2019 trust.That\u2019s the only way to earn peoples\u2019 trust.That\u2019s the Liberal Democrat way to earn peoples\u2019 trust.But radical action doesn\u2019t feature on Labour\u2019s agenda. Gordon Brown spent the last decade wanting to move into number 10. But the most extraordinary thing he has done since he finally got the job is to praise Margaret Thatcher. It\u2019s like a soap opera. It\u2019s certainly an identity crisis. Gordon wants to be like Maggie. But he doesn\u2019t want to be like Tony. Tony also wanted to be like Maggie. But Maggie only wanted to be like Ronnie. Now Dave, he wants to be like Tony. But he doesn\u2019t want to be like William, or Iain, or Michael. And certainly not like Maggie either. Confused? You must be.But you can be clear on this: I don\u2019t want to be like any of them.And what about the Tories? This year, David Cameron is going back to basics. Last year the Conservative conference was about health, happiness and the sunshine glinting through the trees. This year it will be flag, fear \u2013 and foreigners. But why the right-turn?I\u2019ll tell you why.Because he\u2019s under pressure. And without convictions of his own, the Tory leader is buffeted by the beliefs of others.He\u2019s done a u-turn on grammar schools.An about turn on identity cards.And a wrong-turn on human rights.Margaret Thatcher would have to concede: He turns if you want him to. The laddie\u2019s all for turning.But we\u2019re not for turning \u2013 we know exactly what we stand for.Our next manifesto will be a programme fit for the purpose of government in twenty first century Britain: Radical, responsible \u2013 and liberal.You know, we might need that manifesto soon \u2013 very soon.But let me assure Gordon Brown of this: Whenever he calls the election - whether it\u2019s next week or next year - we\u2019ll be ready. Whenever he calls the election he will face a Liberal Democrat party determined to rattle the cage of British politics. Whenever he calls the election he will face a Liberal Democrat party which will compete for every vote and for every seat.I will make every effort, seize every opportunity, work every day to return the maximum number of Liberal Democrat MPs in the next House of Commons. And I know \u2013 I know \u2013 that I can expect nothing less from you. You proved it last year when you helped Willie Rennie win that stunning victory in Dunfermline: Gordon Brown\u2019s own backyard. And you proved it this year too when so many of you came from across the country to campaign in Ealing Southall and Sedgefield. In both contests, your hard work and commitment ensured that the Liberal Democrats emerged as the principal challengers to the government. And the Conservatives \u2013 David Cameron\u2019s Conservatives \u2013 were pushed into third place.But great campaigns need great candidates \u2013 and that\u2019s why we offer our thanks and congratulations to Nigel Bakhai and Greg Stone. And you know we have three equally talented candidates on our short-list for mayor of London. Chamali Fernando, Fiyaz Mughal, and Brian Paddick. Whichever one wins the nomination, I am certain that they will have enormous fun taking the fight to Ken Livingstone. And even more fun taking on the Tories if their candidate is one Boris Johnson. Boris Johnson: imagine that - the blondest suicide note in history.Now when it comes to the next general election, I believe there is some speculation that age will be a factor.You bet it will. Because I\u2019ll make it one.Because with age comes experience, and with experience comes judgement. And when you are deciding whether to send our young men and women to war, it pays to have that experience and it pays to have that judgement.So, if military action is proposed against Iran, who should the British people trust to stand up to George Bush?Should they trust the Labour and Conservative MPs who voted for the war in Iraq?Or should they trust the Liberal Democrats who stood \u2013 steadfast - against the tragic folly of that decision?While we stand by our record, our opponents seek to hide theirs.Mr. Brown is working hard to convince us that there has been real change in Number 10: That his arrival has somehow wiped the slate clean. That the last ten years of waste, failure and disappointment are to be forgiven and forgotten.Well, not so fast Gordon. You spent a decade blaming everything on the previous Conservative government. But as Chancellor over the last ten years you had unparalleled influence over government. You could have raised green taxes to tackle climate change. You could have stopped the ineffective, expensive and unnecessary identity card scheme. And you could have prevented Tony Blair from embarking on the catastrophe of the Iraq war. But you didn\u2019t.This is your legacy, Mr. Brown:The environment degraded.Civil liberties eroded.Iraq invaded.Not to mention the record for which you - and you alone - were responsible as Chancellor.A smash and grab raid on private pensions.A steady, disturbing rise in the number of home repossessions.And a national economic backdrop of £1.3 trillion in personal debt.With a record like that, it\u2019s no wonder that the Prime Minister wants to start afresh.But it\u2019s a record for which we will ensure that he takes responsibility:In spite of your claims of change, Mr. Brown, not much really has changed. New Labour remains blue Labour. And you\u2019re still wrong.Wrong on nuclear energy.Wrong on council tax.Wrong on student fees.And you are wrong, wrong, wrong on detention without charge.We don\u2019t need a change of tone in this country: We need a change of policies. And you, Gordon Brown, have not delivered.Now let me say a word about two important issues that have faced our country in recent times.Right now, British farmers are in crisis over foot and mouth. The necessary restrictions imposed following the outbreak have come at the worst possible time. We will continue to back necessary action to eradicate this disease. But we will also urge the government to get the balance right. We must get Britain\u2019s farmers back in business as soon as possible. Because there\u2019s no point killing off foot and mouth if we kill off our farming industry in the process.And I also want to mention Northern Rock. One of the most alarming features of the last week has been the complete collapse of trust in a leading bank - and perhaps the banking system in general. There have been people queuing in the streets, panicked by worries about their savings. In the short-term that panic has been stopped. But the underlying problem of excessive debt and reckless lending has not been addressed. And, for this, responsibility must rest with Gordon Brown, who has minimised the problem despite repeated warnings - not least from our Shadow Chancellor, and Deputy Leader, Vince Cable.The fact that David Cameron inflamed the situation with rash words is further evidence of what we already knew: The Conservatives are not fit to govern. Look at their record.They criticise the government\u2019s handling of the war in Iraq. But it was their votes that made that war possible.They protest against a \u2018broken society.\u2019 But it was their policies - under Margaret Thatcher - that widened inequalities and shattered social cohesion.They talk about the environment. But they have not made one single policy commitment.The Tories have had a bucketful of proposals put to them in recent months. We\u2019ve had the Clarke Commission, the Duncan Smith Commission, the Dorrell Commission, the Gummer Commission, and - of course - the Redwood Commission. Would you believe it? Advice from the Vulcan First Officer. Ideas straight from the bridge of the Starship Free Enterprise. Policies, Dave - but not as we know them.But for all the working groups, leaked reports, and photo opportunities, the Tories still don\u2019t know what their policies would be. They shy away from making the hard choices that are necessary for government. Because they are suffering from an identity crisis. You know there\u2019s really a very good case for the Tories having identity cards. How else will they know who they are? When they meet a hoodie, they don\u2019t know whether to hug \u2019em - or hang \u2019em.What our country needs is a political party that\u2019s prepared to take the lead and speak the truth. Because Britain needs a competition of ideas, not the stifling of debate and the undermining of accountability. But on so many of the major political issues there is a two-party consensus - comfortable, cosy and complacent. On the environment, taxes, pensions, nuclear power, tuition fees, Iraq. And that\u2019s a consensus that we alone can break: That we must break.That doesn\u2019t mean parties should never co-operate with each other.In Scotland the Liberal Democrats have campaigned consistently for more powers for the Scottish Parliament. Just yesterday, Nicol Stephen met the Labour and Conservative leaders in Scotland to discuss how devolution might be strengthened. But how those powers would be used would - I can tell you - be a matter for vigorous debate between the parties.That\u2019s the difference between the constructive cooperation we support and the cosy consensus that we oppose. And you know, we\u2019ve always been at our best when we have opposed that consensus.When David Steel spoke out against apartheid in the House of Commons, they shouted him down.When Paddy Ashdown argued for intervention in Bosnia, they shouted him down.And when Charles Kennedy argued against the war in Iraq, they shouted him down too.But Steel, Ashdown and Kennedy were right.So when they tried to shout me down - on extradition, on rendition, on the scandal of Guantanamo Bay - I would not be silenced.I will not be silenced.The Liberal Democrats will never be silenced.And I don\u2019t intend to be silenced on the issue of Europe either.The Government will not show leadership on Europe and the Conservatives wilfully distort the public debate. So it falls to us to make the overwhelming case for the European Union.A Union that has provided peace and prosperity.A Union that promotes human rights and democratic values.A Union that is needed today to tackle the threats of climate change and international terrorism.I will lead the public debate in defence of the European Union.David Cameron and his Europhobe allies wish to restrict the British people to a choice on a narrow question about the draft European Treaty. But if there is to be a referendum it shouldn\u2019t be restricted to that question. It must be a decision about the EU as a whole. Let\u2019s have an honest debate on the European Union followed by a real choice for the British people. That means a referendum on Britain\u2019s membership of the EU.We would ask the British people the real question - whether they wish to remain in the European Union or not. I will proudly lead the Liberal Democrats at the forefront of that debate. So I will not be silenced on Europe and I will not be silenced in defence of our liberal values - or silent when others seek to undermine them.Liberalism requires tolerance.But that does not mean indifference in the face of intolerance from others.Because freedom is indivisible and absolute.That\u2019s why I speak out against intolerance and extremism wherever and whenever they threaten our freedom.If a woman is forced into a marriage that she does not want -If a sportsman is barracked because of the colour of his skin -If a person is bullied because they\u2019re gay -Then I stand with them.I have spent my whole life speaking out against bigotry.You can\u2019t be a part-time liberal.Discrimination and intimidation have no place in a liberal society.And on the matter of faith, let\u2019s be clear. A truly liberal society guarantees the freedom of all religions, but it accepts the tyranny of none.People must be free to live without threat or fear.To say the things, write the words and live the lives they choose.Does that offend some people? Yes, of course.But the price of freedom is the risk of offence - and, for me, that price is always worth paying.What does that mean for us?We, the Liberal Democrats, must be the voice of those who are not heard -Of those who are marginalisedAnd of those who are rejected.Over the past few months, I have travelled throughout this country. I have had the privilege to meet - in private visits - some of the most extraordinary and courageous people: People from all walks of life.I met Jamal - a young musician who wants to go to university but is frustrated and angry at the prospect of being deep in debt.I learned from him and his friends of the terrible waste of talent and the alienation of so many young people.I met Anne, a 20-year-old woman in prison for drug offences. She\u2019s had little formal education. Yet she\u2019s studying to take GCSEs and wants to enrol with the Open University.I learned from her that if prisoners get proper education and training it will help them to find work on their release.That\u2019s the way to cut reoffending.I met Jane - a 26 year old former addict, in a shelter for the homeless. She has beaten her addiction. She now hopes to get custody of her four young children.I learned from her how important it is for the homeless to regain their self-respect and to feel that they are in control of their own lives.I met Michael, a 29 year old British soldier who had suffered terrible injuries in a mortar attack in Iraq. He was determined to get fit again and rejoin his unit.I learned from him at first hand what our young men and women are going through in Iraq.He told me he was lucky - two days before he was hit, one of his best friends had been killed by a single small piece of shrapnel. That\u2019s the price being paid for a war that should never have been.These are inspiring people:People with the spirit and determination to beat the odds.But for every success there are too many stories of shattered dreams and frustrated ambitions.There are too many forgotten people in Brown\u2019s Britain.People who don\u2019t make the headlines.People whose opinions no one ever seeks.You know, facts and figures about social exclusion are okay for studies and reports. But it\u2019s in the reality of peoples\u2019 lives that the pain of their stories is written.These people don\u2019t just feel shut out, discounted, cast aside.They are shut out, they are discounted - they are cast aside.Well, I tell you it\u2019s not good enough.So when people ask me what I feel about the state of Britain today, I say I\u2019m angry: Deeply angry.Things have to change if we want our country to be one truly united Britain.Whether you are black or white, male or female, rich or poor, gay or straight, sick or healthy, young or old.Government must stand for the interests of all, but the vested interests of none.People will have confidence in Westminster when it provides open, honest and transparent government.And you know, that\u2019s not just about listening to people: We\u2019ve had that already. Labour\u2019s Big Conversation. The Tories\u2019 \u2018Stand up, Speak up.\u2019 But there\u2019s no point talking to people when they\u2019re just not listening.Well, we Liberal Democrats offer something different.Our mission is to change the British political landscape, once and for all.To throw open the doors of government and let the people in.No more sleazy patronage, no more dodgy dossiers, no more abandoned investigations into secret arms deals - in fact, no more secret arms deals, full stop!And on the constitution, not piecemeal change or pick and mix proposals. But a commitment to fair votes, and an end to the lottery of first past the post.Real freedom of information, and an end to government efforts to undermine it.A wholly elected House of Lords, and an end to politics based on the power of patronage.And at the foundation of it all a Bill of Rights -A Bill of Rights to reclaim the civil liberties stolen from us by this Labour government.A Bill of Rights to anchor freedom of speech, freedom of conscience and freedom of association within our law.And I am prepared to go further still.Climate change is the greatest challenge facing the world today.So I want a Bill of Rights that puts the protection of the environment at the very heart of Britain\u2019s constitution: We should guarantee the right of every citizen to clean water, pure air and unpolluted land.You know, I joined this party because I believe in freedom. Not just the intellectual freedom of politicians and academics, but freedom in its most practical sense. The freedom we get from good health, decent education and a clean environment. And the Liberal Democrat challenge is to show how we can extend that freedom to every citizen in this country.Some people have the good fortune to be born into opportunity. But for millions of others life is a great deal tougher. In London - the capital of one of the richest nations in the world - just six miles separate Hampstead from Hackney. But they might as well be in different countries. If you live in Hackney you are four times as likely to suffer from long-term unemployment as your neighbour in Hampstead. If you live in Hackney you are twice as likely to be permanently sick or disabled. And if you live in Hackney you are four times as likely to have no qualifications at all.Who\u2019d have thought it, that after a decade of Labour government - a Labour government - the gap between rich and poor in this country would be wider than it was when Labour came to office?Who\u2019d have thought that after a decade of Labour government social mobility would be in decline?And who\u2019d have thought that our country would languish - shamefully - at the bottom of the UNICEF league table for the well-being of children.That\u2019s the record of Gordon Brown and the Labour government.And you know what: The people out there know it.The one and half million families across this country who are waiting for social housing: they know it.The millions of older people who struggle to get by on inadequate pensions: they know it.The parents who worry that their background determines the quality of their children\u2019s education and their future prospects: they know it too.You know we\u2019ve had a decade hearing from Labour about education, education, education.But let me educate them.After ten years these are the facts:Fewer than one in five of the most disadvantaged children get five good GCSEs;Less than one in five of the most disadvantaged children go onto higher education;And in this country today, 1.2 million young people are not in education or employment or training.This is unacceptable in 21st century Britain.Under the Liberal Democrat pupil premium, the money follows the pupil. Extra money for the most disadvantaged children. Our schools given incentives - our children given chances. The pupil premium will help to ensure that educational opportunity extends throughout our society. Because the state of the country is a reflection on us all. And where opportunity is denied freedom is denied too.Nearly sixty years ago that great Liberal William Beveridge identified \u2018Five Giants\u2019 which had to be tackled: Want, Disease, Ignorance, Squalor and Idleness.The language is out of date but the challenges posed in the twenty-first century are every bit as compelling.Having led the fight against the Five Giants, we Liberal Democrats should now lead the fight for Five Freedoms.Opportunity, good health, personal security, prosperity for all and a clean environment.First, the freedom born of opportunity.In this country today, a child\u2019s opportunity is shaped by background and parental income to a degree that is unacceptable.It doesn\u2019t have to be that way.We should invest in the most disadvantaged pupils. And give a fair deal to students. We should ensure that graduates leave university with high hopes, not huge debts.Second, the freedom born of good health.Labour has centralised, reorganised and disrupted the National Health Service - our National Health Service. And created a culture of boom and bust. More doctors and nurses trained than ever before - but without jobs for them to go to. It doesn\u2019t have to be that way.We can ensure that local people have the power to meet local health problems with local health solutions. We can take back our NHS.Third, the freedom born of personal security.Over the last ten years, Labour has created more than three thousand new criminal offences. And yet public confidence in the criminal justice system is at an all time low.It doesn\u2019t have to be that way.We can have more police officers and get them out on the streets. We can make prisoners work to compensate their victims. And we can have better education and training in prison to cut reoffending rates. Fourth, the freedom born of prosperity for all.Gordon Brown used his last budget to increase taxes on the lowest earners in order to fund tax cuts for the better off.It doesn\u2019t have to be that way.We will close the tax loopholes that favour the super-rich. We will cut the standard rate of national income tax to its lowest level for nearly a century. We will shift the burden of taxation from people to pollution. And the average family will see their taxes cut by one thousand pounds a year.And fifth, the freedom born of a clean environment.You know, the need for action has never been more urgent. I\u2019ve seen at first hand the devastation that flooding can cause. In Hull, Cheltenham, and Toll Bar \u2013 I\u2019ve seen it. It\u2019s a disgrace that this government pays no more than lip service to fighting climate change.But it doesn\u2019t have to be that way.We would take action now. By raising green taxes, by investing in renewables - by making Britain carbon neutral. And - as we have done this week - by ruling out further investment in nuclear power stations - on environmental, on security and on financial grounds too.There you have it - Five Freedoms for a liberal society.Opportunity, health, security, prosperity and - above all - the environment.These are the five freedoms for which we will fight.And I relish the prospect of that fight.Let me tell you this.I will lead this party into the next election with energy, ambition and determination.Because the stakes for this party have never been higher.And liberalism has never been needed more than it is today.So whenever people ask you: \u2018Why vote Liberal Democrat?\u2019 tell them this:We alone are prepared to break the cosy consensus of British politics and face up to the challenges confronting our society.To create a country that is free, fair and green.Free in thought, expression and conscience.Free from the disadvantage and discouragement that still blight the prospects of far too many of our people.And free from the growing threat of climate change.Only we can achieve that free, fair and green society.Because only we believe in it.Only we will work for it.Only we will fight for it.The Liberal Democrats versus Labour and the Tories. Today, our party is not only the real alternative: It is the only alternative. Not two against one. But one against two. I joined this party because, like you, I wanted change.I joined this party because, like you, I wanted opportunity - opportunity for all.I joined this party because I wanted a different kind of politics - yes, and a different kind of country too.This is what Liberal Democrats stand for.This is what I offer.And this is what we can achieve together.

aVI want to talk with you today about who I am, what I believe, what I am determined to lead this party and this great country to achieve.As we gather here today I know people have real concerns about the future of the country, the future of the economy and people in this hall have concerns about the future of our party too.And so I want to answer your questions directly, to talk with you about how amidst all the present difficulties we should be more confident than ever that we can build what I want to talk to you about today.  A new settlement for new times.  A fair Britain for the new age.  But let me start with something I hope you know already.I didn't come into politics to be a celebrity or thinking I'd always be popular. Perhaps, that's just as well.  No, 25 years ago I asked the people of Fife to send me to parliament to serve the country I love.And I didn't come to London because I wanted to join the establishment, but because I wanted and want to change it.So I'm not going to try to be something I'm not.And if people say I'm too serious, quite honestly there's a lot to be serious about - I'm serious about doing a serious job for all the people of this country.What angers me and inspires me to act is when people are treated unfairly.So when people share with me stories about the hard time they're having with bills, I want to help, because I was brought up seeing my parents having to juggle their budget like the rest of us.And when I talk to parents about schools, I'm determined that every child should have a good school, because while I got my break in a great local secondary, not all my friends got the chance to get on.And when I speak to victims of crime I get angry - because like them I know the difference between right and wrong.  And so here I am - working for this incredible country, while trying as far as possible to give my children an ordinary childhood. Some people have been asking why I haven't served my children up for spreads in the papers. And my answer is simple.  My children aren't props; they're people.And where I've made mistakes I'll put my hand up and try to put them right. So what happened with 10p stung me because it really hurt that suddenly people felt I wasn't on the side of people on middle and modest incomes - because on the side of hard-working families is the only place I've ever wanted to be. And from now on it's the only place I ever will be.  And so I want to give the people of this country an unconditional assurance - no ifs, no buts, no small print - my unwavering focus is taking this country through the challenging economic circumstances we face and building the fair society of the future.  The British people would not forgive us if at this time we looked inwards to the affairs of just our party when our duty is to the interests of our country.The people of Britain would never forget if we failed to put them first - and friends, they'd be right.And because this is a time of greater than ever change around us, it must be a time of higher ambition from us. And because the world of 2008 is now so different from the world of 1997 I want to talk about the new settlement we must build for these new times.You know, each generation believes it is living through changes their parents could never have imagined - but the collapse of banks, the credit crunch, the trebling of oil prices, the speed of technology, and the rise of Asia - nobody now can be in any doubt that we are in a different world and it's now a global age.In truth, we haven't seen anything this big since the industrial revolution. This last week will be studied by our children - as the week the world was spun on its axis - and old certainties were turned on their heads.And in these uncertain times, we must be, we will be, the rock of stability and fairness upon which people stand.And friends, it's a calling that summons us because in every time of profound change those with great wealth and privilege have always been able to look after themselves.But our duty, what gives us moral purpose, is serving the people who need us most- Britain's vast majority - people on middle and modest incomes who need to know that they are not on their own amidst this change - we are on their side.Where there are new risks and new pressures our duty is and will be security for all. And where there are new opportunities, our duty is and will be fair chances for everyone matched by fair rules applied to everyone.And insuring people against the new risks and empowering people with new opportunities is the mission of the hour. And those who say that governments should walk away when people face these risks and need these opportunities will be judged to be on the wrong side of history.And when the country is asking their government to meet these new challenges I say to our opponents: those who don't believe in the potential of government shouldn't be trusted to form one.So this is a defining moment for us - a test not just of our judgement but of our values. Today once again we are called to apply our enduring beliefs to completely new conditions.New Labour has always been at its best when we have applied our values to changing times.  In the 1990s Tony and I asked you to change policy to meet new challenges.We are and will always be a pro-enterprise, pro-business and pro-competition government. And we believe the dynamism of our five million businesses large and small is vital to the success of our country.  But the continuing market turbulence shows why we now need a new settlement for these times - a settlement that we as a pro-market party must pursue.A settlement where the rewards are for what really matters - hard work, effort and enterprise.A settlement where both markets and government are seen to be the servants of the people, and never their masters,Where what counts is not the pursuit of any sectional interest but the advancement of the public interest - and where at all times we put people first.Let us be clear the modern role of government is not to provide everything, but it must be to enable everyone.And just as we know that governments cannot and should not do everything, so too we know markets cannot deliver it all on their own.And just as those who supported the dogma of big government were proved wrong, so too those who argue for the dogma of unbridled free market forces have been proved wrong. And so it falls to this party and to this government, with its commitment both to fairness and to business, to propose and deliver what after recent events everyone should now be willing to accept - that we do all it takes to stabilise the still turbulent financial markets and then in the months ahead we rebuild the world financial system around clear principles. And friends the work begins tomorrow.I and then Alistair will meet financial and government leaders in New York to make these proposals:First, transparency - all transactions need to be transparent and not hidden.Second, sound banking, a requirement to demonstrate that risks can be managed and priced for bad times as well as good.Third, responsibility - no member of a bank's board should be able to say they did not understand the risks they were running and walk away from them.Fourth, integrity - removing conflicts of interest so that bonuses should not be based on short term speculative deals but on hard work, effort and enterprise.I know that the British people think it's hard work, effort and enterprise we need to reward. And fifth, global standards and supervision because the flows of capital are global, then supervision can no longer just be national but has to be global.And if we make these changes I believe London will retain its rightful place as the financial centre of the world.And we know that the challenges we face in this new global age didn't begin in the last week, or in the last months, but in fact reflect deeper changes in our world. For all its benefits, the global age has revealed not just financial instability but another major pressure - a rising global population demanding more energy.So the new settlement also requires another great and historic endeavour to end the dictatorship of oil and to avert catastrophic climate change, a transformation in our use of energy. New nuclear power, an unprecedented increase in renewables and investment in clean coal.And I am asking the climate change committee to report by October on the case for, by 2050 not a 60% reduction in our carbon emissions, but an 80% cut - and I want British companies and British workers to seize the opportunity and lead the world in the transformation to a low carbon economy and I believe that we can create in modern green manufacturing and service one million new jobs.And it's not just our duty but our basic philosophy that we do everything we can to help families through the world downturn. And while the Conservatives did nothing to help people with their gas and electricity bills in the last world downturn, this winter, millions of people will receive the help with heating bills, insulation, social tariffs - help they never received from the Conservatives.But you know, when it comes to public spending you can't just wave a magic wand to conjure up the money - not even with help from Harry Potter.And so there are tough choices and I have to say that as a result of the events of recent weeks there are going to be tougher choices we will have to make and priorities we will have to choose. And just as families have to make economies to make ends meet, so this government must and will ensure that we get value for money out of every single pound of your money that is spent.  But I say to you that we will invest it wisely, continuing our record investment in schools, Sure Start centres, transport and hospitals.And if we make the right decisions to take people through the world downturn fairly we will find that, despite the current troubles, British firms and British workers can reap the rewards of a world economy set to double in size.With Britain's great assets - our stability, our openness, our scientific genius, our creative industries, and yes our English language - I know that this can be a British century and I'm determined it will be.But my argument today is that the new settlement for the global age must do even more to empower people with new opportunities  insure people against new risks and as a result value hard work effort and enterprise. It's the economy that's been making the headlines, but there are other big changes too.People feel their communities are changing before their eyes and it's increasing their anxiety about crime and anti-social behaviour. And so we will be the party of law and order.And for the first time ever we've got more British pensioners than British children - more people living longer on fixed incomes and worried about whether they'll need long term care. And so we will be the party that will ensure security and dignity for pensioners.And there are new pressures on parents - worrying about balancing work and family life but also about advertising aimed straight at their children and what their children are watching or downloading from the internet. And so we will be the party of the family.And so the new settlement for our times show how Britain can meet all these challenges too and its more than about a fair prosperity - it must be about fair chances and fair rules too.You know some people say that there's an inevitable political cycle in this country - as sure as night follows day. I don't agree. The challenge of these new times demands a truly progressive government to help people cope with the new risks and make the most of the new opportunities. That's why I believe that now more than ever - even more than in 1997- this country needs a Labour government.You know to govern is to choose - and it's what a government chooses to do when it's tested that demonstrates its priorities and reveals its heart.It is not the arithmetic of statistics but the fabric of people's lives.When we talk about three million more people in work since 1997 - that's not just a number, that's a life that's been changed - three million times over. That's the young woman laid off in the mid 90's who's now built a booming business of her own. Three million new jobs not by accident, but by our actions. And in the years to come we will demonstrate again that real power of Labour to change lives.And when we talk about the one million small and medium-sized businesses set up in the last eleven years, that's not just a number - that's the entrepreneur who can treat her parents to a summer holiday, and the local businessman who's taken on two local teenagers as apprentices. One million new businesses demonstrating yet again the real power of Labour to change lives.And when we talk about one million people benefiting from new Labour's minimum wage that's not just a number - that's a dad doing security shifts who can now afford a birthday party for his child and it's a mum who doesn't have to go to a loan shark to pay for her kids' Christmas. One million people freed from exploitation- and now the minimum wage rising year on year - that's the real power of Labour to change lives.And when we talk about the 240,000 lives that are saved by the progress Labour's NHS has made in fighting cancer and heart disease, that's not just a number - that's the dad who lives to walk his daughter up the aisle and the gran who is there to clap and cry at her grandson's graduation. 240,000 families still together - and now thousands more with new and better treatments from an expanding NHS -- we're changing the world the only way it can ever really change - one life, one family, one hope at a time. That's the real power of Labour to change lives.And why do we always strive for fairness?Not because it makes good soundbites.Not because it gives good photo opportunities.Not because it makes for good P.R.No.We do it because fairness is in our DNA.It's who we are - and what we're for.It's why Labour exists.It's our first instinct, the soul of our party.It's why when things get tough, we get tougher. We stand up, we fight hard - for fairness. We don't give in, and we never will.For me fairness is treating others how we would be treated ourselves. So it isn't levelling down but empowering people to aspire and reach ever higher. And to take advantage of all the opportunities of the global economy I want to unleash a new wave of rising social mobility across our country.For too long we've developed only some of the talents of some people - but the modern route to social mobility is developing all the talents of all the people....helping those who are working their way up from very little and  lifting up those in the middle who want to get on. It means supporting what really matters - hard work and effort and enterprise. This is not just the new economic necessity, it is the modern test of social justice and the radical centre ground we occupy and will expand. And fairness is why Harriet is introducing the first ever equalities bill.  And let me thank her for her tireless work as deputy party leader. Fairness is why Ed Miliband is ensuring that community and third sector organisations can play their proper part in every neighbourhood.And it is why our whole party is leading the fight against the British National Party. Fairness is why John Denham is extending university access, why Ruth Kelly has introduced for the first time free bus travel for pensioners and why John Hutton and our Labour Members of the European Parliament but are fighting to free agency workers from the scourge of exploitation.But fairness for the future also means a big change that I want to explain today. We have always stood for public services that are universal, available to all. Now we must stand for public services that are not only available to all, but personal to each.For me, the fairer future starts with putting children first - with the biggest investment in children this country has ever seen. It means delivering the best possible start in life with services tailored to the needs of every single precious child.In 1997 there were no Sure Start centres and nursery education for only the few. Today, thanks to the work of Beverley Hughes there are children's centres opening in every community to serve 3 million children who a few years ago had nothing, and free nursery education for every three and four year old.But our ambitions must be greater still. I want Britain to take its place among the leading nations in pre-school services, and so I pledge here today in Manchester starting in over 30 communities, and then over 60, we will, stage by stage, extend free nursery places for two year olds for every parent who wants them in every part of the country backed by high quality, affordable childcare for all.That's the fairness parents want - and that's the fairness every Labour party member will go out and fight for.And because child poverty demeans Britain, we have committed our party to tackle and to end it. The measures we have taken this year alone will help lift two hundred and fifty thousand children out of poverty. The economic times are tough of course that makes things harder - but we are in this for the long haul - the complete elimination of child poverty by 2020. And so today I announce my intention to introduce ground-breaking legislation to enshrine in law Labour's pledge to end child poverty.And Ed Balls and I will never excuse, explain away or tolerate low standards in education. So we will keep up the pace of reform:  more academies, trust and specialist schools, more of the brightest and best graduates becoming teachers, more investment in building schools for the future - state of the art schools for world class schooling.Fairness demands nothing less than excellence in every school, for every child. So today I guarantee to parents two fundamental rights:Because every child should leave primary school able to read, write and count, any child who falls behind will not be left behind - but will now have a new guaranteed right to personal catch up tuition.And because all parents should see their children taught in schools which achieve good results at GCSE, our pledge today is that any parents whose local state school falls below the expected standard will have the right to see that school transformed under wholly new leadership, or closed and new school places provided.And we want to enable all families to use the internet to link back to their children's school - and so Jim Knight is announcing that we will fund over a million extra families to get online, on the way to our ambition of Britain leading the world with more of our people than any other major economy able to access the internet and broadband.And now as we celebrate the 60th anniversary of the NHS let me on behalf of all of us here, and all the people of the country - thank all the NHS staff - the cooks and cleaners, the paramedics and porters, the doctors and midwives and nurses.You have served our country and served a great ideal - the principle that in a fair society healthcare should not be a commodity to be bought by some but a right to be enjoyed by all. Labour is the party of the NHS - we created it, we saved it, we value it and we always will support it.And you know already that for me, this isn't a political agenda but a personal mission.  Last year in Bournemouth I told you how when I was 16, I got injured playing rugby and lost the sight forever in my left eye. I knew I couldn't play football or rugby anymore. But I could still read.But what I didn't tell you last year was that then one morning I woke up and realised my sight was going in my good eye. I had another operation and lay in the darkness for days on end. At that point my future was books on tape.But thanks to the NHS, my sight was saved by care my parents could never have afforded. And so it's precisely because I know and have heard from others about the miraculous difference a great surgeon and great nurses and great care can make that I'm so passionate about the values of the NHS and so committed to reforming it to serve these values even better.That's why in just one year in the fight against hospital infections, we have doubled the number of matrons and achieved a 36 percent reduction in MRSA.And let us remember what a Labour government has now achieved: the lowest ever waiting times in the whole history of the NHS.And now to respond to new times and higher aspirations we want to make the National Health Service more personal to people's needs - patients more involved in their own health care with more choice and more control than ever before.And I've always found it unfair that we cannot offer on the NHS the comprehensive services that private patients can afford to buy. And so in April a Labour Britain will become the first country in the whole world to offer free universal check ups for everyone over 40.And I say that there is no vested interest, no matter how powerful, that we are not prepared to take on when change is needed for the sake of the nation's health.We have already made it easier for busy families to go to the doctor. Whilst a year ago only 1 in 10 patients had access to GPs at weekends and in the evening. Now almost half of all practices are open and by the end of next year the majority will be open even longer. And today I want to show how this government will pursue what I believe to be one of the noblest and boldest contributions of this country to our shared human fortunes.Since the war nearly one third of Britain's Nobel prizes have been for our genius in medicine. We should now aspire to stretch the boundaries of human knowledge and human health ever further.I want Britain to lead the world in beating the diseases which cause so much heartbreak for families. Over the last few years we've made major breakthroughs in research relevant to cancer, Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and strokes and many more.But these are yet to be turned into treatments from, which we can all benefit from. And so let me tell you today that the unprecedented 15 billion pounds we are investing in medical research will be directed to turning the major advances of the last few years into actual treatments and cures for NHS patients.Over the next decade we can lead the way in beating cancer and other diseases - a great endeavour worthy of a great country: proud because we have a health service focused on 21st century needs.A NHS that is available to all and personal to each means meeting another challenge of the future: offering, for the first time, every patient with a long term condition their own care plan.But alongside new patient responsibilities will be new rights. And because we know that almost every British family has been touched by cancer, Alan Johnson and I know we must do more to relieve the financial worry that so often goes alongside the heartache. And so I can announce today for those in our nation battling cancer from next year you will not pay prescription charges.And this is not the limit of our commitment to a fair NHS in a fair society. As over the next few years the NHS generates cash savings in its drugs budget we will plough savings back into abolishing charges for all patients with long-term conditions. That's the fairness patients want and the fairness every Labour party member will go out and fight for.And in a fair society the fact that older people are living longer should be a blessing for their families not a burden. We are committed to linking pensions to earnings.And I am proud that we will now be implementing for the first time equality for women in their retirement.No-one should live in fear of their old age because they worry their social care will impose financial burdens they could never afford to face and that the minute they need care puts the family home at risk.The generation that rebuilt Britain from the ashes of the war deserves better and so I can tell you today that Alan Johnson and I will also bring forward new plans to help people to stay longer in their own homes and provide greater protection against the costs of care - dignity and hope for everyone in their later years.That's the fairness older people deserve - and the fairness every Labour party member will go out and fight for.So when people say in these tough times there's nothing we can do, there's nothing higher to aim for, no great causes left worth fighting for, my reply is our ideas are the ideas that will realise the hopes of families for a better future.  Providing free nursery care for more children who need it is a cause worth fighting for.Providing better social care for older people who need it is a cause worth fighting for. Delivering excellence in every single school is a cause worth fighting for. Universal check-ups and new help to fight cancer - these are all causes worth fighting for. This is the future we're fighting for.And in this world of vast economic and social change, new opportunity for all must be matched with a new responsibility from all. Our aim is a something for something, nothing for nothing Britain. A Britain of fair chances for all, and fair rules applied to all.So our policy is that everyone who can work, must work. That's why James Purnell has introduced reforms so that apart from genuine cases of illness, the dole is only for those looking for work or actively preparing for it. That's only fair to the people pulling their weight. And let me be clear about the new Labour policy on crime; taking action on the causes of crime will never mean indulging those who perpetrate it. Fairness demands that we both punish and prevent.Jacqui Smith and Jack Straw are introducing a landmark reform in our justice system - to put victims first.  In consultation with victim support we will create an independent commissioner who will stand up for victims, witnesses and families - the people the courts and police exist to serve.  And Damilola Taylor's father Richard is with is here today.He's an inspiring example of the determination to see some good come out of personal tragedy.  Last weekend he led thousands on a march through our capital, sending a united message.  We will take the knives off our streets.And justice seen is justice done - so you will be seeing more neighbourhood policing on the street, hearing more about the verdicts of the court, able to see the people who offended  doing community payback which will be what it says; hard work for the public benefit at the places and times the public can see it. That's only fair to the law abiding majority.Nobody in Britain should get to take more out of the system than they are willing to put in. I am proud that Britain will honour our obligations to provide refuge from persecution. And we recognise the contribution that migrants make to our economy and our society, but the other side of welcoming newcomers who can help Britain is being tough about excluding those adults who won't and can't. That's why we have introduced the Australian-style points-based system, the citizenship test, the English language test and we will introduce a migrant charge for public services.That's only fair to the public who play by the rules and to the new citizens who uphold the rules.So across the board, we will create rules that reward those who play by them and punish those who don't. That's what fairness means to me.You know our party so often in its history has been home to the big ideas - ideas later taken for granted, but revolutionary in their time. Just think, the vote for working men, and then for women, the NHS, legal protection from race or sex discrimination. These are no longer just Labour policies, they are established British values - they are the common sense of our age.And we should never forget one thing - that every single blow we have struck for fairness and for the future has been opposed by the Conservatives. And just think where our country would be if we'd listened to them. No paternity leave, no New Deal, no Bank of England independence, no Sure Start, no devolution, no civil partnerships, no minimum wage, no new investment in the NHS, no new nurses, no new police, no new schools.And so let's hear no more from the Conservatives - we did fix the roof while the sun was shining.And just think if we'd taken their advice on the global financial crisis. Their policy was to let Northern Rock fold and imperil the whole financial system, our Labour government saved Northern Rock so not a single UK depositor lost out.Their policy said, in this week of all weeks, that speculative short selling should continue. We acted decisively to end reckless speculation.And the conservative policy would mean that at this very moment, there would be no regulation at all to protect homeowners.  We are the party of protecting of homeowners rights.Do you know what their Shadow Chancellor really said? In the week that banks were collapsing the man who wants to run our economy not only said: this is not a problem caused by the financial markets but went on to say and, I quote, that it\u2019s \u201ca function of financial markets\u201d that people make \u201cloads of money out of the misery of others\u201d.Just imagine where we'd be if they'd been in a position to implement their beliefs - no rescue of Northern Rock, no action on speculation, no protection for mortgages, doing nothing to stop banks going under.What has become clear is that Britain cannot trust the Conservatives to run the economy.Everyone knows that I'm all in favour of apprenticeships, but let me tell you this is no time for a novice.But I believe in giving credit where it's due. The Conservative leader's team are smart - they've got a plan, and they are implementing it ruthlessly.Their strategy is to change their appearance, to give the appearance of change, and to conceal what they really think.And when salesmen won't tell you what they are selling, it's because they are selling something no-one should buy.But I'm a man for detail and I've discovered some clues about what would be in store in a Conservative Britain. They want us to believe that, like us, they now care about public services. But when Mr Cameron actually talks to his party about their spending plans he says the difference between Labour and Tory levels of public investment will be "dramatic" and "fundamental".They want to tell us we're all progressives now but the day that Hazel Blears and Caroline Flint were announcing a one billion pound package to support millions of homeowners, the Conservatives were confirming that their first tax priority is to take that one billion pounds from hard working families and hand it over to the 3,000 richest estates in Britain.And they want to tell us they now believe in investing in education, but they are committed to slashing 4.5 billion from the schools building programme, axing the educational maintenance allowances that help poorer students stay on and opposing the raising the education leaving age to eighteen and stopping training programmes. And yes friends, they would even take away Sure Start from infants and their parents. One of our greatest gifts to the future - one of the first priorities for Tory cuts.The Conservatives may want to represent the future, but whether its Europe or energy, planning or tax credits,  university places or 42 days, whenever they are tested on substance they have nothing to offer to meet the big challenges of tomorrow, because they are prisoners of their past.If you look beneath the surface, you'll see that the Conservatives might have changed their tune, but they haven't changed their minds.The Conservatives say our country is broken - but this country has never been broken by anyone or anything. This country wasn't broken by fascism, by the cold war, by terrorists.Of course there are problems, but this is a country being lifted up every day by the people who love it.We've got 4 million people helping neighbourhood watch, 6 million sports volunteers and over 5 million people doing amazing work as carers.And just as we celebrated our national triumph when we won the 2012 games for London, so too were Andy Burnham, Tessa Jowell and I, along with all of you, filled with pride this summer as our Olympic and Paralympics heroes showed British brilliance at its best.That's why for all the challenges, I don't believe Britain is broken - I think it's the best country in the world.  I believe in Britain. And stronger together as England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland we can make our United Kingdom even better.And ours is a country full of heroes.And we pay special tribute to the heroism of our armed forces, as Des Browne said yesterday - to their service and sacrifice in Iraq and in Afghanistan and in peacekeeping missions around the globe. Quite simply the best armed forces in the world.The whole lesson of the new world I described earlier is that we must work together to meet the great shared challenges vital to our future.And unlike the Conservatives who are extremists and isolationists on Europe, we will work with our partners in the European Union and we will work with America not just to deal with the immediate security challenges in Georgia and in Iran.And I tell you that what we do together for the poor and vulnerable is an act of compassion, but it is more than that.  It is what will determine whether this new global society succeeds or fails.And David Miliband, Douglas Alexander and I will do everything in our power to bring justice and democracy, to Burma, to Zimbabwe and to Darfur.And I promise you I will work with other countries to bring a permanent settlement - a secure Israel and a viable Palestine - to deliver peace for the people of the Middle East. And this week at Britain's request the United Nations has summoned the leaders of the world to a special summit on what we know is a global poverty emergency.You know, in the museum in Rwanda which commemorates the millions who lost their lives as the world looked the other way, there is a picture of a young boy called David - a ten year old who was tortured to death. His last words were "don't worry - the United Nations will come for us".But we never did. That child believed the best of us only to discover that the pieties repeated so often meant in reality nothing at all. The words "never again" became just a slogan and not what it should be - the crucible in which are values are tested. I tell you, this Labour government will not allow the world to stand by as more than 20,000 children die today from diseases we know how to cure. We will not pass by as 100 million men, women and children face a winter of starvation.So the poor will not go unheard tomorrow at the United Nations, because we the British people will speak up for them and for justice.The fair society. Fairness at home. Fairness in the world - that's the new settlement for new times.I know what I believe.I know who I am.I know what I want to do in this job.And I know that the way to deal with tough times is to face them down.Stay true to your beliefs.Understand that all the attacks, all the polls, all the headlines, all the criticism, it's all worth it, if in doing this job I make life better for one child, one family, one community.Because this job is not about me, it's about you.And I'll tell you what else I've learned - that tough times don't weaken the determination of people who believe in what they're doing but strengthen our resolve.You know when I talk to the people who do the tough jobs - nurses, teachers, police officers, soldiers, carers - about why they do what they do, so often they say to me "because I want to make a difference".And doesn't each of us want to say of ourselves:That I helped someone in need.That I come to the aid of a neighbour in distress.That I will not pass by on the other side.That I will give of myself for something bigger than myself.And each of us can make a contribution - but together we are even more than that.United we are a great movement led by hopes not fears, gathered person by person - one individual, and then a few more, then hundreds, then thousands, then finally millions strong, a movement where I want each of us to say to each other:This is our country, Britain. We are building it together, together we are making it greater;Together we are building the fair society in this place and in this generation.The mission of our times - the fair society, the cause that drives us on - and we will win, not for the sake of our party, together we will win for the future of our country.

aVI want to get straight to the point.We all know how bad things are, massive debt, social breakdown, political disenchantment. But what I want to talk about today is how good things could be.Don\u2019t get me wrong, I have no illusions. If win this election, it is going to be tough. There will have to be cutbacks in public spending, and that will be painful. We will need to confront Britain\u2019s culture of irresponsibility and that will be hard to take for many people. And we will have to tear down Labour\u2019s big government bureaucracy, ripping up its time-wasting, money-draining, responsibility-sapping nonsense.None of this will be easy. We will be tested. I will be tested. I\u2019m ready for that \u2013 and so I believe, are the British people. So yes, there is a steep climb ahead.But I tell you this. The view from the summit will be worth it.AFGHANISTANIf we win the election the first and gravest responsibility I will face is for our troops in Afghanistan and their families at home.I know that.I know about the mothers and the wives, the husbands and the children, counting the minutes between news bulletins, fearing the announcement of the next casualty. I know what they want \u2013 and deserve - from their government. A ruthless, relentless focus on fighting, winning and coming home.That must start at the top. Instead of a revolving door at the Ministry of Defence with a second rate substitute in charge, we need a politician from the front rank, and in Liam Fox we have one.We need a clear chain of command that flows right from the top. My national security council, with the key ministers and defence chiefs, will sit from day one of a new government, as a war cabinet.We need a strategy that is credible, and do-able. We are not in Afghanistan to deliver the perfect society. We are there to stop the re-establishment of terrorist training camps.Frankly, time is short. We cannot spend another eight years taking ground only to give it back again.So our method should be clear......send more soldiers to train more Afghans to deliver the security we need. Then we can bring our troops home.And I know the most urgent requirement of all. That those brave men and women we send into danger have every piece of equipment they need to do the job we ask of them. I will make sure that happens.And I have something else to say. When the country is at war, when Whitehall is at war, we need people who understand war in Whitehall.That\u2019s why I\u2019m proud to announce today that someone who has fought for our country and served for forty years in our armed forces will not only advise our defence team but will join our benches in the House of Lords and if we win the election could serve in a future Conservative Government:General Sir Richard Dannatt. As we welcome him to serve with us, let us all salute those who serve our country.FAMILY, COMMUNITY, COUNTRYWe could have come to Manchester this week and played it safe. But that\u2019s not what this party is about and it\u2019s certainly not what I\u2019m about.When I stood on that stage in Blackpool four years ago it wasn\u2019t just to head up this party, sit around and wait for the tide to turn. It was to lead this party and change it, so together we could turn the tide.Look what we\u2019ve done together. More women candidates, campaigning on the environment, the party of the NHS. And this year, here in Manchester, our most successful, dynamic conference for twenty years.I\u2019d like to thank everyone involved, the police who kept us safe and your chum and mine, Eric Pickles.But also this year, in these difficult times, we\u2019ve won the argument on the economy and debt as George Osborne showed in that magnificent speech on Tuesday.That was the success we achieved this year.But for me and Samantha this year will only ever mean one thing. When such a big part of your life suddenly ends nothing else - nothing outside - matters. It\u2019s like the world has stopped turning and the clocks have stopped ticking. And as they slowly start again, weeks later, you ask yourself all over again: do I really want to do this? You think about what you really believe and what sustains you.I know what sustains me the most. She is sitting right there and I\u2019m incredibly proud to call her my wife.My beliefs. I am not a complicated person. I love this country and the things it stands for.That the state is your servant, never your master. Common sense and decency. The British sense of community.I have some simple beliefs.That there is such a thing as society, it\u2019s just not the same thing as the state. That there is a \u2018we\u2019 in politics, and not just a \u2018me.\u2019Above all, the importance of family. That fierce sense of loyalty you feel for each other. The unconditional love you give and receive, especially when things go wrong or when you get it wrong. That powerful sense you have when you hold your children and there\u2019s nothing, absolutely nothing - you wouldn\u2019t do to protect them.This is my DNA: family, community, country. These are the things I care about. They are what made me. They are what I\u2019m in public service to protect, promote and defend. And I believe they are what we need in Britain today more than ever.I know how lucky I\u2019ve been to have the chances I had. And I know there are children growing up in Britain today who will never know the love of a father. Who are born in homes that hold them back. Who go to schools that keep them back.Children who will never start a business, never raise a family, never see the world. Children who will live the life they\u2019re given, not the life they want. That is what I want to change.I want every child to have the chances I had. That is why I\u2019m standing here.BIG GOVERNMENTBut we won\u2019t help anyone unless we face up to some big problems. The highest budget deficit since the war. The deepest recession since the war. Social breakdown; political disillusionment. Big problems for the next government to address.And here is the big argument in British politics today, put plainly and simply. Labour say that to solve the country\u2019s problems, we need more government.Don\u2019t they see? It is more government that got us into this mess.Why is our economy broken? Not just because Labour wrongly thought they\u2019d abolished boom and bust. But because government got too big, spent too much and doubled the national debt.Why is our society broken? Because government got too big, did too much and undermined responsibility.Why are our politics broken? Because government got too big, promised too much and pretended it had all the answers.Of course it was done with the best intentions. And let\u2019s be clear: not everything Labour did was wrong.Devolution; the minimum wage; civil partnerships, these are good things that we will we keep.But this idea that for every problem there\u2019s a government solution for every issue an initiative, for every situation a czar....It ends with them making you register with the government to help out your child\u2019s football team. With police officers punished for babysitting each other\u2019s children. With laws so bureaucratic and complicated even their own Attorney General can\u2019t obey them.Do you know the worst thing about their big government? It\u2019s not the cost, though that\u2019s bad enough. It is the steady erosion of responsibility. Our task is to lead Britain in a completely different direction.So no, we are not going to solve our problems with bigger government. We are going to solve our problems with a stronger society. Stronger families. Stronger communities. A stronger country. All by rebuilding responsibility.THE DEBT CRISISThe clearest sign of big government irresponsibility is the enormous size of our debt.If we win the election, we will have to confront Labour\u2019s Debt Crisis, deal with it, and take the country with us. I want everyone to understand the gravity of our situation.Our national debt has doubled in the last five years and our annual deficit next year will be over £170 billion.That\u2019s twice as big as when we nearly went bankrupt in the 1970s. It is a massive risk to our economy. If we spend more than we earn, we have to get the money from somewhere.Right now, the Government is simply printing it. Sometime soon that will have to stop, because in the end, printing money leads to inflation. Then the Government will have to borrow it.But we\u2019ll only be given the money if lenders are confident we can pay it back. If they\u2019re not, we\u2019ll have to pay higher interest rates and that could stop our economic recovery in its tracks.So we have three choices.Option one: we can just default on the debt. Not pay it. Other countries have done that in the past. But I don\u2019t think anyone in this country wants to go down that road.Option two: we could encourage inflation, which would wipe out the value of the debt, making it easier to pay off. But that\u2019s not just an economic disaster \u2013 it\u2019s a social disaster too. It doesn\u2019t just wipe out debts, it wipes out people\u2019s hard-earned savings.So we have the third option - for me the only option. We must pay down this deficit. The longer we leave it, the worse it will be for all of us.I know there are some who say we should just wait.Don\u2019t talk about the deficit. Don\u2019t even plan for what needs to be done. Just wait. Don\u2019t they understand \u2013 it\u2019s the waiting that\u2019s the problem.The longer we wait for a credible plan, the bigger the bill for our children to pay. The longer we wait, the greater the risk to the recovery. The longer we wait, the higher the chance we return to recession.Here\u2019s the most obvious reason we can\u2019t wait. The more we wait, the more we waste on the interest we\u2019re paying on this debt.Next year, Gordon Brown will spend more money on the interest on our debt than on schools. More than on law and order, more than on child poverty.So I say to the Labour Party and the trades unions just tell me what is compassionate, what is progressive about spending more on debt interest than on helping the poorest children in our country?The progressive thing to do, the responsible thing to do is to get a grip on the debt but in a way that brings the country together instead of driving it apart. That means showing leadership at the top which is why we will cut ministers\u2019 pay and freeze it for a parliament.It means showing that we\u2019re all in this together which is why we\u2019ll freeze public sector pay for all but the one million lowest paid public sector workers......for one year to help protect jobs.And it means showing that the rich will pay their share which is why for now the 50p tax rate will have to stay and Child Trust Funds for those on middle and higher incomes will have to go.Yes we have made some tough choices. But in British politics today that is the only responsible thing to do.PENSIONERSDealing with this debt crisis is not just about cuts in the short term. We must also live within our means over the long term. Everyone knows we have an ageing population.Our pension system was designed in a time when many people didn\u2019t live till 70 \u2026. It is out of date and it has to change. That\u2019s why this week we made the difficult decision to bring forward the raising of the pension age.I know that working longer will be tough for many people. But it will also allow us to help pensioners more.I got an email from a lady who wrote to me in desperation. She doesn\u2019t want me to reveal her name because she\u2019s so frightened of what might happen to her.She and her husband left school at fifteen and started work straight away. They bought their own home, where they\u2019ve lived for forty years. But they\u2019ve been let down terribly. She lost out on the 10p tax and took a drop in her pension. She and her husband aren\u2019t entitled to pension credit because they saved for their old age.Here\u2019s what she says:\u201cduring the cold spell this winter, we sat watching TV with blankets wrapped around us.The drug dealer and the druggies who live nearby had their windows wide open and the heating full on.We don\u2019t bother watching police dramas on the TV, we just look out of our window.Our savings are making no money.If one of us dies we cannot afford to stay in our home.\u201dThis lady doesn\u2019t want pity. Pensioners don\u2019t want pity. They just want to know that if they\u2019ve lived responsibly, they\u2019ll be looked after in their old age.Parties have been talking about raising the pension in line with earnings for years. But it never happens.Well let\u2019s be the party that finally makes it happen. Because of the difficult choice we\u2019ve made on the pension age we\u2019ll be able not just to deal with our debt but to raise the basic state pension in line with earnings. Not just for one year, but for every year.GROWTHCutting back on big government is not just about spending less. Getting our debt down means getting our economic growth up.Let\u2019s be clear where growth will come from. Not big government, with its Regional Development Agencies and National Investment Corporations but entrepreneurs. New businesses, new industries, new technologies.I get enterprise. I worked in business for seven years. And let me tell you what I learned during that time.Complicated taxes, excessive regulations they make life impossible for entrepreneurs.So I will always put the same questions to Ken Clarke and his business team.What are you doing to make it easier to start a business? Easier to take people on? What are you doing to make regulation less complicated? To make locating a business here more attractive?Ken Clarke and David Willetts this week helped launch our plan to Get Britain Working.It is a plan to boost science, skills, self-employment a plan to improve training, technology, tax incentives for entrepreneurs.This is what it means.It means the man who\u2019s lost his job and his confidence saying yes, I can set up on my own, I can take responsibility, there\u2019s nothing to stop me.It means the people he takes on, who thought they were written off, thinking yes I\u2019ve got another chance and I can provide for my family again.Self-belief is infectious and I want it to spread again throughout our country especially through the poorest places where Labour let hope fade away.In Britain today, there are entrepreneurs everywhere \u2013 they just don\u2019t know it yet. Success stories everywhere \u2013 they just haven\u2019t been written yet. We must be the people who release that potential.FINANCIAL REFORMAnd just a quick word to the man who says he abolished boom and bust and then saved the world.It was you Gordon Brown who designed the system of financial regulation that helped cause the financial crisis. You want to keep it the same. We say it needs to change.That\u2019s why we will give back to the Bank of England its power to regulate the City powers that should never have been taken away.BROKEN SOCIETYBut once we\u2019re generating economic growth - what are we going to do with it? What kind of society do we hope to build?Look at Britain in 2009. It is, in so many ways, a great place to live. Great culture and arts, great diversity, great sport.And think of the great sport coming up next year England in the World Cup, then the Olympics, then rugby and cricket too. And yes, let\u2019s get the Football World Cup here in 2018 as well.But in Britain today there is a dark side as well. After twelve years of big government, we still have those stubborn social problems.Poverty, crime, addiction. Failing schools. Sink estates. Broken homes.The truth is, it\u2019s not just that big government has failed to solve these problems. Big government has all too often helped cause them by undermining the personal and social responsibility that should be the lifeblood of a strong society.Just think of the signals we send out. To the family struggling to raise children, pay a mortgage, hold down a job.\u201cStay together and we\u2019ll give you less; split up and we give you more.\u201dTo the young mum working part time, trying to earn something extra for her family \u201cfrom every extra pound you earn we\u2019ll take back 96 pence.\u201dYes, 96 pence.Let me say that again, slowly.In Gordon Brown\u2019s Britain if you\u2019re a single mother with two kids earning £150 a week the withdrawal of benefits and the additional taxes mean that for every extra pound you earn, you keep just 4 pence.What kind of incentive is that? Thirty years ago this party won an election fighting against 98 per cent tax rates on the richest. Today I want us to show even more anger about 96 per cent tax rates on the poorest.And in that fight, there\u2019s one person this party can rely on. He\u2019s the man who has dedicated himself to the cause of social justice\u2026and shown great courage in standing up for those least able to stand up for themselves. Iain Duncan SmithAnd I am proud to announce today that if we win the election he will be responsible in government for bringing together all our work to help mend the broken society.LABOUR AND POVERTYLabour still have the arrogance to think that they are the ones who will fight poverty and deprivation.On Monday, when we announced our plan to Get Britain Working you know what Labour called it? \u201cCallous.\u201dExcuse me? Who made the poorest poorer? Who left youth unemployment higher? Who made inequality greater?No, not the wicked Tories\u2026 you, Labour: you\u2019re the ones that did this to our society.So don\u2019t you dare lecture us about poverty. You have failed and it falls to us, the modern Conservative Party to fight for the poorest who you have let down.FAMILYWe\u2019ll start with what is most important to me \u2013 and what I believe is most important for the country - families.I believe that a stable, loving home is the most precious thing a child can have. Society begins at home. Responsibility starts at home. That\u2019s why we cannot be neutral on this.Now I don\u2019t live in some fantasy land where every family is happily married with 2.4 kids. Nor am I going to stand here and pretend that family life is always easy.But by recognising marriage and civil partnerships in the tax system and abolishing the couple penalty in the benefits system, we\u2019ll help make it that little bit easier.But it\u2019s not just about money. It\u2019s also about emotional support, particularly in those fraught early years before children go to school. Labour understood this and we should acknowledge that.That\u2019s why Sure Start will stay, and we\u2019ll improve it. We will keep flexible working, and extend it. And we will not just keep but transform something that was there long before Sure Start began \u2013 health visitors.But making the country more family-friendly is not just about what government does. Responsibility goes much wider. It\u2019s about what we all do. It\u2019s about the way we live.Why aren\u2019t we building homes with enough room for a family to sit round a table and actually eat a meal together?It\u2019s about our culture. Why do so many magazines and websites and music videos make children insecure about the way they look or the experiences they haven\u2019t even had?And it\u2019s about our society. We give our children more and more rights, and we trust our teachers less and less. We\u2019ve got to stop treating children like adults and adults like children.It is about everyone taking responsibility. The more that we as a society do, the less we will need government to do.WELFAREBut you can\u2019t expect families to behave responsibly when the welfare system works in the opposite direction.In welfare, big government has failed people in a big way. There are two million children in Britain growing up in homes where no-one works. Two million.That is the highest in Europe. It is one in six children in our country.We have to break this cycle of welfare dependency.I got an email from a guy called Viv Williams. He lost his job last year and was desperate to get back into work. But he had a mortgage to pay so he went to register for Job Seeker\u2019s Allowance.He\u2019d twisted his ankle and walked in with a limp, so you know what they said? They told him he couldn\u2019t register for Job Seeker\u2019s Allowance because he wasn\u2019t fit to work so he\u2019d have to go on incapacity benefit.He told them there was nothing wrong with him, that he wanted to work. But no \u2013 he wasn\u2019t allowed to.This is a man who wanted to take responsibility for himself and his family and the system said no, you\u2019ve got to depend on the state.As he says: \u201cI told them, you\u2019re having a laugh.\u201d But it\u2019s not funny. The welfare system today sends out completely crazy signals.We have got to turn it around and with Theresa May and David Freud in charge we will. We\u2019re going to make it clear: If you really cannot work, we\u2019ll look after you. But if you can work, you should work and not live off the hard work of others.NHSSo we have to reform welfare and strengthen families. But when I think of my family, in the end there\u2019s only one thing that matters and that is that the people I love are healthy and well.My family owes so much to the National Health Service. No, it is not perfect. But I tell you, when you\u2019re carrying a child in your arms to Accident and Emergency in the middle of the night and don\u2019t have to reach for your wallet it\u2019s a lot better than the alternative.So we will never change the idea at the heart of our NHS, that healthcare in this country is free at the point of use and available to everyone based on need, not ability to pay.But that doesn\u2019t mean the NHS shouldn\u2019t change. It has to change because for many people, the service isn\u2019t good enough. Mostly, that\u2019s not the fault of those who work in the NHS.The fault lies with big government. With their endless targets and reorganisations, Labour have tried to run the NHS like a machine.But it\u2019s not a machine full of cogs. It is a living, breathing institution made up of people \u2013 doctors, nurses, patients.This lever-pulling from above \u2013 it has got to stop. With Andrew Lansley\u2019s reform plans, we\u2019re going to give the NHS back to people. We\u2019ll say to the doctors: those targets you hate, they\u2019re gone.But in return, we\u2019ll do more for patients. Choice about where you get treated. Information about how good different doctors are, how good different hospitals are.Information about the things that really matter, cancer survival times......the rate of hospital infections......your chances of surviving if you have a stroke.We will give doctors back their professional responsibility.But in exchange they will be subject to patient accountability. That\u2019s why we can look the British people in the eye and say this party is the party of the NHS now, today, tomorrow, always.CRIMEThe instinct to protect the people we love is so strong. Nearly two years ago it was that instinct \u2013 that love \u2013 that drove Fiona Pilkington to do something desperate.When I first read her story in the paper I found it difficult to finish the article \u2013 it\u2019s one of the saddest things I\u2019ve ever read.Fiona was so driven to despair by the vile thugs that bullied her and her lovely disabled daughter Francecca and by the police that didn\u2019t answer her cries for help that she could only see one way out. She put her daughter in her car, drove to a lay-by, and set it on fire.If no one would protect them then by ending their lives, she was keeping them safe.No one could hurt them anymore. Just think about what we allowed to happen here in our country. This goes deep and it\u2019s been going on for years.It is about a breakdown of all the things that are meant to keep us safe......a complete breakdown of responsibility.A breakdown of morality in the minds of those thugs a total absence of feeling or conscience. A breakdown in community where a neighbour is left to reach a pitch of utter misery. And a breakdown of our criminal justice system.Every part of it, the police, the prosecution services, the prisons......is failing under the weight of big government targets and bureaucracy. The police aren\u2019t on the streets because they\u2019re busy complying with ten different inspection regimes. The police say the CPS isn\u2019t charging people\u2026because they have to hit targets to reduce the number of unsuccessful trials.And the prisons aren\u2019t rehabilitating offenders\u2026because they\u2019re focused on meeting thirty-three different performance indicators.This all needs to change. I\u2019m not going to stand here and promise you a country where nothing bad ever happens. I do not underestimate how difficult it will be to deal with this problem of crime and disorder.We cannot rebuild social responsibility from on high. But the least we can do the least we can do is pledge to all the people who are scared, who live their lives in fear and who can\u2019t protect themselves, that a Conservative Government, with Chris Grayling, with Dominic Grieve, will reform the police, reform the courts, reform prisons. We will be there to protect you.TERRORISMWe understand too the grave responsibility we will have to protect our people from terrorism. This party knows only too well the pain and grief that terrorism brings.Twenty-five years ago, almost to the day on the Thursday night of our party conference in Brighton, the IRA exploded a bomb that injured and killed good friends and colleagues.Today let us honour their memory and send our thoughts and best wishes to all those, including Margaret Tebbit, who still bear the scars of that terrible night.SCHOOLSTo build a responsible society we need to teach our children properly. I come at education as a parent, not a politician.When I watch my daughter skip across the playground to start her first term in year one, I want to know that every penny of the education budget is following her and the other children into that school and that classroom.So when I see Ed Balls blow hundreds of millions on so-called \u201ccurriculum development\u201d on consultancies, on quangos like the QCDA and BECTA like every other parent with a child at a state school I want to say:This is my child, it's my money, give it to my headteacher instead of wasting it in Whitehall.But it\u2019s not just about money. It\u2019s about values. We know that discipline is vital but we overrule head teachers when they exclude a disruptive pupil.We know that every child has different abilities and different needs but too often we put them all in the same class so the brightest aren\u2019t stretched and those who are struggling fall behind.We know that competitive sport is important but we\u2019ve had minister after minister promising it and nothing ever happens.Discipline. Setting by ability. Regular sport.These are all things you find in a private school. Not because the Government tells them to do it, but because it\u2019s what parents want. Why can\u2019t parents in state schools always get what they want?With us, they will, because our reforms will create more good schools and more school places. Yes, our plans will increase competition \u2013 and no, that is not a dirty word. It means that when a good new school opens down the road, the other ones around it will want to improve. Big government has totally failed in state education and with Michael Gove we will get the radical change we need.COUNTRYFamily, community, country. In recent years we\u2019ve been hearing things about our country we haven\u2019t heard for a long time. People saying they don\u2019t know what it is to be British, what this country stands for.People in Scotland who want to leave the United Kingdom and people in England who say let them go.I am passionate about our Union and I will never do anything to put it at risk. And because of the new political force we have created with the Ulster Unionists, I\u2019m proud that at the next election we will be the only party fielding candidates in every part of the United Kingdom.Britishness is not mechanical, it\u2019s organic. It\u2019s an emotional connection to a way of life, an attitude, a set of institutions.Make these stronger and our national identity becomes stronger. To be British is to be open-minded.We don\u2019t care who you are or where you\u2019re from, if you\u2019ve got something to offer then this is a place you can call home.But if we want our country to carry on with this proud, open tradition, we\u2019ve got to understand the pressures of mass immigration and that\u2019s why we need to put limits on it.To be British is to be generous. Whenever there\u2019s a disaster on the other side of the world, British people dig deep into their pockets and give their money. Comic Relief didn\u2019t raise less money this year because of the recession \u2013 it raised more.That says big things about our country, and government should reflect that. That\u2019s why I\u2019m proud that we\u2019ve ring-fenced the budget for international development.To be British is to be sceptical of authority and the powers-that-be.That\u2019s why ID cards, 42 days and Labour\u2019s surveillance state are so utterly unacceptable and why we will sweep the whole rotten edifice away.And to be British is to have an instinctive love of the countryside and the natural world. The dangers of climate change are stark and very real. If we don\u2019t act now, and act quickly, we could face disaster.Yes, we need to change the way we live. But is that such a bad thing? The insatiable consumption and materialism of the past decade, has it made us happier or more fulfilled?Yes, we have to put our faith in technologies. But that is not a giant leap. Just around the corner are new green technologies, unimaginable a decade ago, that can change the way we live, travel, work.And yes, we need global co-operation. But that shouldn\u2019t be difficult. It just takes leadership, and that\u2019s what we need at the Copenhagen summit this December.POLITICSBut if you care about our country, you\u2019ve got to care about the health of our institutions. And today one of them, more than any other, is in a serious state of decline.Our parliament used to be a beacon to the world. But the expenses scandal made it a laughing stock.We apologised to the public, paid back the money that shouldn\u2019t have been claimed......and published all our expenses online to help stop this happening again.We\u2019ve led the way in other areas too......MPs\u2019 pay and pensions, cutting the cost of politics. But let me make something clear - this is not over.We are just starting the job of building the new politics we need. Because the anger over expenses reflected something deeper. The sense that people have been left powerless by big government.So it is time to shake things up. We need to redistribute power and responsibility. It\u2019s your community and you should have control over it......so we need decentralisation. It\u2019s your money and you should know what is being done with it......so we need transparency. It\u2019s your life that\u2019s affected by political decisions and the people who make those decisions should answer to you, so we need accountability.EUBut if there is one political institution that needs decentralisation, transparency, and accountability, it is the EU.For the past few decades, something strange has been happening on the left of British politics. People who think of themselves as progressives have fallen in love with an institution that no one elects, no one can remove, and that hasn\u2019t signed off its accounts for over a decade.Indeed even to question these things is, apparently, completely beyond the pale. Well, here is a progressive reform plan for Europe.Let\u2019s work together on the things where the EU can really help, like combating climate change, fighting global poverty and spreading free and fair trade.But let\u2019s return to democratic and accountable politics the powers the EU shouldn\u2019t have.And if we win the election, we will have as the strongest voice for our country\u2019s interests, the man who is leading our campaign for a referendum, the man who will be our new British Foreign Secretary: William Hague.WHAT WE CAN PROMISEFamily, community, country.Recognising that what holds society together is responsibility......and that the good society is a responsible society. That\u2019s what I\u2019m about \u2013 that\u2019s what any government I lead will be about.The problems we face are big and urgent. Rebuilding our broken economy......because unless we do, our children will be saddled with debt for decades to come.Mending our broken society......because unless we do, we will never solve those stubborn social problems that cause the size of government to rise.Fixing our broken politics......because unless we do, we will never reform public services......never see the strong, powerful citizens\u2026who will build the responsible society that we all want to see.This week you\u2019ve heard about our plans, our policies, the changes we want to make and the team to put them in place.But I know that whatever plans you make in Opposition, it\u2019s the unpredictable events that come to dominate a government.And it\u2019s your character, your temperament and your judgment, not your policies and your manifesto \u2013 that really make the difference.You can never prove you\u2019re ready for everything that will come your way as Prime Minister. But you can point to the judgments you\u2019ve made. And you can learn from the mistakes that others have made.I\u2019ve seen what happens when you win and you waste your mandate obsessing about the 24 hour news cycle and fighting each day as if it\u2019s a new general election, ducking the difficult things that would have really made a difference.That was Blair. And I\u2019ve seen what happens when you turn every decision into a political calculation. That was \u2013 that is \u2013 Brown.So I won\u2019t promise things I cannot deliver. But I can look you in the eye and tell you that in a Conservative Britain:If you put in the effort to bring in a wage, you will be better off. If you save money your whole life, you\u2019ll be rewarded. If you start your own business, we\u2019ll be right behind you. If you want to raise a family, we\u2019ll support you. If you\u2019re frightened, we\u2019ll protect you.If you risk your safety to stop a crime, we\u2019ll stand by you. If you risk your life to fight for your country, we will honour you.Ask me what a Conservative government stands for and the answer is this, we will reward those who take responsibility, and care for those who can\u2019t.CONCLUSIONSo if we cut big government back. If we move society forward.And if we rebuild responsibility, then we can put Britain back on her feet.I know that today there aren\u2019t many reasons to be cheerful.But there are reasons to believe. Yes it will be a steep climb. But the view from the summit will be worth it. Let me tell you what I can see.I see a country where more children grow up with security and love because family life comes first. I see a country where you choose the most important things in life - the school your child goes to and the healthcare you get. I see a country where communities govern themselves - organising local services, independent of Whitehall, a great handing back of power to people.I see a country with entrepreneurs everywhere, bringing their ideas to life - and life to our great towns and cities. I see a country where it\u2019s not just about the quantity of money, but the quality of life - where we lead the world in saving our planet. I see a country where you\u2019re not so afraid to walk home alone, where you\u2019re safe in the knowledge that right and wrong is restored to law and order.I see a country where the poorest children go to the best schools not the worst, where birth is never a barrier.No, we will not make it if we pull in different directions, follow our own interests, take care of only ourselves.But if we pull together, come together, work together - we will get through this together.And when we look back we will say not that the government made it happen......not that the minister made it happen......but the businesswoman made it happen......the police officer made it happen......the father made it happen......the teacher made it happen.You made it happen.

aVIt is an honour and a privilege to stand here, before the party I lead, before the country I love, as the Conservative prime minister of the United Kingdom.I want to tell you today, in the clearest terms I can, what we must do together, and what we can achieve together.But first, let's remember where we've come from. Three defeats. Thirteen party conferences \u2013 4,757 days in the wilderness.Remember what they said about us? They called us a dead parrot. They said we had ceased to be. That we were an ex-party.Turns out we really were only resting \u2013 and here we are. Back serving our country. Together in the national interest. Giving Britain the good, strong government it deserves.There are so many we need to thank for that. The British people. You have given us a chance and we will work flat out to prove worthy of that chance.I want to say a big thank you to those who led this party before me. William Hague got us back on our feet. Iain Duncan Smith helped us get back our heart. Michael Howard gave us back our confidence.I know that I am standing here as prime minister because they stood up for this party in good times and bad, and I will always remember that.And it is impossible to pay tribute to previous leaders of this party, without mentioning the greatest peacetime prime minister of the 20th century.Next week, Margaret Thatcher celebrates her 85th birthday. She'll be doing it in Downing Street, and I know everyone in this hall will want to wish her well.But there are some very special people I'd like to thank \u2013 you, the people of this party. I can't thank all of you individually \u2013 but I am going to single one of you out.His name is Harry Beckough. Harry joined our party in 1929 to fight Stafford Cripps. Since then, across 81 years and 21 elections, Harry has been with us.When Churchill warned of an iron curtain, Harry was with us. When this country had never had it so good, Harry was with us. When a lady refused to turn, Harry was with us.This year, when we fought the general election, Harry \u2013 aged 96 \u2013 was there, manning the loudhailer on the battle bus in Marlborough. And I'm delighted to say Harry is with us here today.I tell you something \u2013 this is a party for all generations. Harry, without people like you we wouldn't be here \u2013 and our party wouldn't be in government. So thank you for everything you've done, and all you represent.I'll never forget the night of 6 May. Watching the results coming in. The Tories back in the north. Winning in Wales. Sweeping across West Yorkshire. Taking seats we hadn't won in decades: Carlisle. Cannock. Thurrock. The end of a Labour government that had done so much damage.But, also, as I drove to London, there was that growing sense that we just weren't going to make it across the winning line.I went to bed at about 7am in a hotel, wishing like anything I was at home with Sam and the little ones, not knowing where it was all heading.I woke up two hours later and felt sure of the answer. The country wants leadership, not partisanship.Try the big thing. Do the right thing. Succeed and you can really achieve something. Fail and, well, at least you tried.I know there are a few who say that we should have sat tight, waited for our opponents to fall out and brought in a minority government. But a minority government would have limped through parliament, unable to do anything useful for our country.The voters left us with a hung parliament and they wanted us to respond responsibly, to do the right thing, not play political games.So I set out to form a strong, stable, coalition government. And I want to thank Nick Clegg for what he did.There were loads of phone calls and meetings in those five hectic days in May. My daughter Nancy asked at breakfast one morning: "Daddy, why are you spending so much time with this man Nick Leg?"Nick and I didn't agree about everything. He wanted clearer pledges on PR. I wanted them on the family.When I told him what I really thought of the European parliament, he said: "My God, it's worse than I thought."But we recognised we could work together. Not just lots of shared values, like wanting a country that is more free, more fair, more green, more decentralised, but a shared way of trying to do business.Reasonable debate, not tribal dividing lines. Give and take. Respect when you disagree. Trust. A sense that politics shouldn't be so different from the rest of life, where rational people do somehow find a way of overcoming their disagreements.Nick Clegg is not just sitting in government trying to win a few concessions here and there. The Liberal Democrats are proper partners, getting stuck in, making big decisions, shaping what we do and taking responsibility.That's why we can form a proper government and you can be proud of what we've done together.Now, I know there will be compromise, and I know we'll have to do things we might not like.Next May, there'll be a referendum on electoral reform. I don't want to change our voting system any more than you do. But let's not waste time trying to wreck the bill \u2013 let's just get out there and win the vote.Because you know what? At its best, this party always puts country first. We'll leave the vested interests to others.And no, we're not about self-interest either. This is the party of the national interest and, with this coalition, that's what we're showing today.People wondered what a coalition could achieve. But just look at what we are achieving already \u2013 together, in the national interest.Conservative policies, policies you campaigned on, policies we are delivering. Two hundred new academies. Ten thousand university places. Fifty thousand apprenticeships.Corporation tax \u2013 cut. The jobs tax \u2013 axed. Police targets \u2013 smashed. Immigration \u2013 capped. The third runway \u2013 stopped. Home Information Packs \u2013 dropped. Fat cat salaries \u2013 revealed. ID Cards \u2013 abolished. The NHS \u2013 protected. Our aid promise \u2013 kept.Quangos \u2013 closing down. Ministers' pay \u2013 coming down. A bank levy \u2013 coming up. A cancer drugs fund \u2013 up and running. £6bn of spending saved this year. An emergency budget to balance the books in five years. An EU referendum lock to protect our sovereign powers every year.For our pensioners \u2013 the earnings link restored. For our new entrepreneurs \u2013 employees' tax reduced. And for our brave armed forces \u2013 the operational allowance doubled.Look what we've done in five months. Just imagine what we can do in five years.In five years time, our combat troops will have left Afghanistan. This party has steadfastly supported our mission there, and so will this government.But that does not mean simply accepting what went before. In our first few weeks in office, we set a clear new direction. Focused. Hard-headed. Time-limited.We are not in Afghanistan to build a perfect democracy. No dreamy ideas. Just hard-headed national security \u2013 pure and simple.Almost every terrorist who took part in 9/11 was trained by al-Qaida in Afghanistan. If we left tomorrow, those training camps could easily come back, because Afghans are not yet capable of securing their own country.But we will not stay a day longer than we need to. British combat forces will not remain in Afghanistan after 2015.By then, they will have been there for 14 years and in Helmand province for nine \u2013 three years longer than world war two.For those who have served; for those who bear the scars; and for those who will never come home, this country has gratitude beyond words.This government has set a new direction right across our foreign policy.Our principles are simple. Don't neglect important relationships. Already we are restoring ties with India, with allies in the Gulf, with our friends in the Commonwealth.Don't make commitments without the right resources. Today, we're geared up to fight old wars. We have armoured brigades ready to repel Soviet tanks across the German plain.But we struggled to provide enough helicopters for our soldiers in Afghanistan, for the real war we are really fighting.Since becoming prime minister, nothing has shocked me more than the complete mess of the defence budget we inherited.So our defence review will match our commitments with the resources we've got. This will mean some big changes. But I promise you this: I will take no risks with Britain's security.That's why, when more and more countries have or want nuclear weapons, we will always keep our ultimate insurance policy, we will renew our nuclear deterrent based on the Trident missile system.But Britain's reputation is not just about might. It's about doing what is right. When this country has got it wrong, we'll admit it, as I did when I apologised for Bloody Sunday.When there's a cloud hanging over our reputation, we'll address it, as we have done by setting up an inquiry into whether this country was complicit in the mistreatment of detainees.We will always pursue British interests, but there are some red lines we must never cross.Like the sight of the man responsible for the Lockerbie bombing, the biggest mass murderer in British history, set free to get a hero's welcome in Tripoli. No. It was wrong, it undermined our standing in the world, and nothing like that must ever happen again.When I walked into Downing Street as prime minister, I was deeply conscious that I was taking over the heaviest of responsibilities, not least for the future of our United Kingdom.Tony Blair, Gordon Brown \u2013 and John Major before them \u2013 worked hard to bring lasting peace to Northern Ireland, and I will continue their work.And as the threat of dissident republican terrorism increases, I want to make it clear that we will protect the people of our country with every means at our disposal.And I want to make something else clear. When I say I am prime minister of the United Kingdom, I really mean it. England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland \u2013 we're weaker apart, stronger together, so together is the way we must always stay.But there is another side to life as prime minister. Like being made to watch the England football team lose 4-1 to Germany, in the company of the German chancellor.It's a form of punishment I wouldn't wish on anyone. I have to say, she is one of the politest people I have ever met \u2013 every time their players scored another goal, she would turn to me and say: "I really am terribly sorry."It's brought a whole new element to Anglo-German diplomatic relations: whatever you do, don't mention the score.But however different life has got as prime minister, there's one thing that, for me, has stayed the same. My belief about how this country needs to change.Let's start by being honest with ourselves. The mess this country is in \u2013 it's not all because of Labour.Of course, they must take some of the blame. Alright - they need to take a lot of the blame.Let me just get this off my chest. They left us with massive debts, the highest deficit, overstretched armed forces, demoralised public services, endless ridiculous rules and regulations and quangos and bureaucracy and nonsense.They left us a legacy of spinning, smearing, briefing, back-biting, half-truths and cover-ups, patronising, old-fashioned, top-down, wasteful, centralising, inefficient, ineffective, unaccountable politics, 10p tax and 90 days detention, an election bottled and a referendum denied, gold sold at half price and council tax doubled, bad news buried and Mandelson resurrected, pension funds destroyed and foreign prisoners not deported, Gurkhas kept out and extremist preachers allowed in.Yes, they deserve some blame, and we'll never let them forget it.But the point I want to make is this. The state of our nation is not just determined by the government and those who run it. It is determined by millions of individual actions \u2013 by what each of us do and what we choose not to do.Yes, Labour failed to regulate the City properly. But they didn't force those banks to take massive risks with other people's money.Yes, Labour tried to boss people around and undermined responsibility. But they weren't the ones smashing up our town centres on a Friday night or sitting on their sofas waiting for their benefits.Yes, Labour centralised too much and told people they could fix every problem. But it was the rest of us who swallowed it, hoping that if the government took care of things, perhaps we wouldn't have to.Too many people thought: "I've paid my taxes, the state will look after everything."But citizenship isn't a transaction in which you put your taxes in and get your services out. It's a relationship \u2013 you're part of something bigger than you, and it matters what you think and feel and do.So to get out of the mess we're in, changing the government is not enough. We need to change the way we think about ourselves, and our role in society.Your country needs you, and today I want to tell you about the part we've all got to play, and the spirit that will take us through.It's the spirit I saw in a group of NHS maternity nurses in my constituency who told me they wanted to form a co-op to use their own ideas and their nous to help new parents.It's the spirit you see just down the road in Balsall Heath, where local residents' street patrols have turned a no-go area into a place where people can once again feel safe.It's the spirit that, just today, has seen some of our leading social organisations come together to set up a new Citizen University, to help give people the skills they need to play a bigger part in society.It's the spirit of activism, dynamism, people taking the initiative, working together to get things done.Sometimes that spirit gets taken a little too far. I got a letter from a six-year-old girl called Niamh with a pound coin stuck to it. And there was a note from her mum, which said: "Dear Mr Cameron ... after hearing about the budget, Niamh wanted to send you her tooth fairy money to help."There we are, George \u2013 nearly there. Niamh: thankyou.What I'm talking about, the spirit we need, is the big society spirit \u2013 and here's why I think its time has come.All over the world, governments are wrestling with the same challenges. Not just building prosperous, competitive economies, providing good public services and paying for pensions but creating strong societies, improving quality of life, ensuring that everyone feels they belong.The countries that succeed will be those that find new ways of doing things, new ways of harnessing the common good, better alternatives to the old-fashioned state, and we're on the right side of that argument.Here at home, at this year's election, the result may not have been clear-cut when it came to the political parties. But it was clear enough when it came to political ideas.The old way of doing things: the high-spending, all-controlling, heavy-handed state, those ideas were defeated. Statism lost ... society won. That's what happened at the last election and that's the change we're leading.From state power to people power. From unchecked individualism to national unity and purpose. From big government to the big society.The big society is not about creating cover for cuts. I was going on about it years before the cuts.It's not government abdicating its role, it is government changing its role.It's about government helping to build a nation of doers and go-getters, where people step forward not sit back, where people come together to make life better.Of course the cynics and the defeatists will say it can't be done, that we're stuck in some inevitable decline. But that's what they said in the 70s. They were wrong then \u2013 and we'll prove them wrong again.We can build a country defined not by the selfishness of the Labour years but by the values of mutual responsibility that this party holds dear.A country defined not by what we consume but by what we contribute. A country, a society where we say: I am not alone. I will play my part. I will work with others to give Britain a brand new start.Over the coming months, we will need that spirit as we face up to our financial responsibilities. Everyone knows that this government is undertaking a programme of spending cuts.I know how anxious people are. "Yes", they say: "of course we need to cut spending. But do we have to cut now, and by this much? Isn't there another way?"I wish there was another way. I wish there was an easier way. But I tell you: there is no other responsible way.Back in May, we inherited public finances that can only be described as catastrophic. This year, we will borrow more money than we spend on the NHS. Just think about that.Every doctor's salary. Every operation. Every heating bill in every hospital. Every appointment. Every MRI scan. Every drug. Every new stethoscope, scalpel, hospital gown.Everything in our hospitals and surgeries \u2013 paid for with borrowed money, much of it from abroad. And then think about the interest.This year, we're going to spend £43bn on debt interest payments alone. £43bn \u2013 not to pay off the debt \u2013 just to stand still.Do you know what we could do with that sort of money? We could take 11 million people out of paying income tax. We could take every business in the country out of corporation tax.That's why we have acted decisively \u2013 to stop pouring so much of your hard-earned money down the drain.And it's stopped us slipping into the nightmare they've seen in Greece, confidence falling, interest rates rising, jobs lost and in the end, not less but more drastic spending cuts than if you'd acted decisively in the first place.Our emergency budget showed the world that Britain is back on the path of fiscal responsibility.It took us out of the danger zone \u2013 and the man we have to thank for that is George Osborne.The world has backed us. Our credit rating \u2013 the mark of trust in our economy \u2013 has been preserved. The International Monetary Fund, the G20, yes even the EU. They support what we're doing.There's just one group of people who don't. You guessed it, the people who mortgaged Britain to the hilt in the first place \u2013 Labour.Labour's plan is just to halve the deficit over four years. Let me tell you what that means.It means that even after years of cuts, not only would the national debt still be growing, it would be growing as a share of our national income.The problem would still be getting worse. And as a result, the cuts would be bigger, not smaller because the interest payments on that debt would be higher.That's why it's right to deal with this problem now, and right to deal with it properly.And I promise you that if we pull together to deal with these debts today, then just a few years down the line the rewards will be felt by everyone in our country.More money in your pocket. More investment in our businesses. Growing industries, better jobs, stronger prospects for our young people. And the thing you can't measure but you just know it when you see it, the sense that our country is moving forwards once again.The big society spirit means facing up to this generation's debts, not shirking responsibility. And here I want to say something to the people who got us into this mess. The ones who racked up more debt in 13 years than previous governments did in three centuries.Yes you, Labour. You want us to spend more money on ourselves, today, to keep racking up the bills, today and leave it to our children \u2013 the ones who had nothing to do with all this \u2013 to pay our debts tomorrow?That is selfish and irresponsible.I tell you what: these Labour politicians, who nearly bankrupted our country, who left a legacy of debts and cuts, who are still in denial about the disaster they created. They must not be allowed anywhere near our economy, ever, ever again.Reducing spending will be difficult. There are programmes that will be cut. There are jobs that will be lost. There are things government does today that it will have to stop doing.Many government departments will have their budgets cut by, on average, 25% over four years. That's a cut each year of around 7%.Of course, that's big. But let's remember, a lot of businesses have had to make the same or bigger savings in recent years.And when we're done with these cuts, spending on public services will actually still be at the same level as it was in 2006.The spending cuts we do have to make, we'll make in a way that is fair. Fairness includes protecting the service we most rely on \u2013 the health service.We said five years ago we were the party of the NHS and now in government, by protecting NHS spending from cuts, we are showing it.And as we work to balance the budget, fairness includes asking those on higher incomes to shoulder more of the burden than those on lower incomes.I'm not saying this is going to be easy, as we've seen with child benefit this week. But it's fair that those with broader shoulders should bear a greater load.And I think it's time for a new conversation about what fairness really means.Here's what I think. Yes, fairness means giving money to help the poorest in society. People who are sick, who are vulnerable, the elderly \u2013 I want you to know we will always look after you. That's the sign of a civilised society, and it's what I believe.But you can't measure fairness just by how much money we spend on welfare, as though the poor are products with a price tag, the more we spend on them the more we value them.Fairness means supporting people out of poverty, not trapping them in dependency. So we will make a bold choice.For too long, we have measured success in tackling poverty by the size of the cheque we give people. We say: let's measure our success by the chance we give. Let's support real routes out of poverty \u2013 a strong family, a good education, a job.So we'll invest in the early years, help put troubled families back on track, use a pupil premium to make sure kids from the poorest homes go to the best schools not the worst, recognise marriage in the tax system and, most of all, make sure that work really pays for every single person in our countryRemember last year? When you stood up to show how angry you were about the injustice of some low paid single mothers going out to work and losing 96p for every extra pound they earned?Well after months of hard work, I can tell you Iain Duncan Smith has found a way to end that system.So to that single mother struggling and working her heart out for her children, we can now say: "We're on your side; we'll help you work; we will bring that injustice to an end."Here's something else about fairness. Fairness isn't just about who gets help from the state.The other part of the equation is who gives that help, through their taxes. Taking more money from the man who goes out to work long hours each day so the family next door can go on living a life on benefits without working \u2013 is that fair?Fairness means giving people what they deserve \u2013 and what people deserve depends on how they behave.If you really cannot work, we'll look after you. But if you can work, but refuse to work, we will not let you live off the hard work of others.Tackling the deficit is what we have to do. But transforming our country is what we passionately want to do.Here again we need the big society spirit \u2013 of activism and dynamism. We need it to get growth.Let me tell you what I believe. It will be the doers and grafters, the inventors and the entrepreneurs who get this economy going.Yes, it will be the wealth creators \u2013 and no, those aren't dirty words.When you think of a wealth creator, don't think of the tycoon in a glass tower. Think of the man who gets up and leaves the house before dawn to go out and clean windows.Think of the woman who sits up late into the night trying to make the figures add up to make sure she can pay her staff.I can't tell you how much I admire people who leave the comfort of a regular wage to strike out on their own.I'll always remember what the owner of a small business told me once. He said: "When I was starting out, the government didn't lift a finger to help me. Then as soon as I start making money they're all over me trying to take it away."That is completely the wrong way round. We need to get behind our wealth creators. That's what we're doing.Dealing with the deficit so interest rates stay low. Slashing red tape. Cutting the small business profits rate, corporation tax and national insurance contributions for new businesses.But I don't think our job ends there. I don't believe in laissez-faire. Government has a role not just to fire up ambition, but to help give it flight.So we are acting to build a more entrepreneurial economy. Tens of thousands of university and apprenticeship places and a new generation of technical schools.A new Green Investment Bank, so the technologies of the future are developed, jobs created and our environment protected.Big infrastructure projects like high speed rail, super-fast broadband, carbon capture and storage.A £1bn regional growth fund to stimulate enterprise in those areas where the private sector is weak.And as we've announced this week, a new enterprise allowance that gives money and support to unemployed people who want to start their own business.And there's another way we're getting behind business \u2013 by sorting out the banks.Taxpayers bailed you out, now it's time for you to repay the favour and start lending to Britain's small businesses again.Just as we need the big society spirit to get our economy going, we need it in our society too.Social change is where this coalition has its beating, radical heart. This is what drives us. To change forever the way this country is run.We're going to start by taking power away from central government and giving it to people.On 11 May, a great shadow was cast over the empire of the quangocrats, the bureaucrats and the power-hoarders.He is the enemy of the bureaucratic state. Public chum number one. The big man on the side of the people. Eric Pickles.Eric has come in to government and hit the ground sprinting, leading the most radical shift in power this country has seen for decades.More freedom for local councils to keep more of the money when they attract business to their area, to finance big new infrastructure projects and to run new services.More power for neighbourhoods to keep local pubs open, stop post offices from closing, to run local parks, to plan the look, shape and feel of their area.New powers to you to choose the hospital you get treated in, the school your child goes to.And because information is power, we're bringing transparency to government.All those things the last government kept from you, who spends your money, what they spend it on, what the results are, where the waste is, we're putting it in your hands. After all, it's your money \u2013 so you should see where it's going.This is not about a bit more power for you and a bit less power for central government \u2013 it's a revolution.Let's leave Labour defending the status quo, the vested interests, the unions, the quangocrats, the elites, the establishment.We are the radicals now, breaking apart the old system with a massive transfer for power, from the state to citizens, politicians to people, government to society. That is the power shift this country needs today.And let me tell you why we desperately need this change. It's because the old way, of just pouring money into public services from on high, didn't make the difference it promised to.Health inequalities got worse. Almost four in ten children left primary school unable to read, write and do maths properly. There were nearly a million violent crimes a year.So if anyone tells you that all we need to improve our hospitals and schools or keep our streets safe is more money, tell them, been there, done that and it didn't work.So this is what radicalism means. No more top-down, bureaucrat-driven public services. We're putting those services in your hands.The old targets and performance indicators that drove doctors, nurses and police officers mad \u2013 they're gone.All that bureaucracy that meant nothing ever happened \u2013 we're stripping it away.The big, giant state monopolies \u2013 we're breaking them open to get new ideas in.Saying to the people who work in our public services - set up as a co-operative, be your own boss, do things your way.Saying to business, faith groups, charities, social enterprises \u2013 come in and provide a great service.Already, businesses are getting people trained and ready for work. GPs are coming together to deliver local NHS services. And next year, the first generation of free schools will open in the state sector.But as with any radical changes, there's going to be opposition. I want to give you an idea of the mentality we're fighting.Ed Balls, the man who used to be in charge of education in our country, said one of the dangers of our schools policy was that it would create "winners".Winners? We can't have that. The danger that your child might go to school and turn out to be a winner. Anti-aspiration. Anti-success. Anti-parents who just want the best for their children.What an unbelievable attitude from this Labour generation.Now I've heard people say there are some places where reform can't go \u2013 like law and order.I disagree. Of course the state has a clear role, to score a line between right and wrong, to punish those who step over it, and to do it in a way that gives people confidence.That's why I have no time for those who sneer at public attitudes to punishing criminals.Offenders who should go to prison will go to prison. Justice must be done.But we also have to recognise where the state is failing on crime. We spend £41,000 a year on each prisoner \u2013 and within a year of leaving, half of them reoffend.There are 150,000 people in Britain today who get their heroin substitutes on the state, their addictions maintained by the taxpayer.We have police officers who spend more time on paperwork than they do on patrol. It's here that reform is needed most.So let's get our best charities to help rehabilitate offenders, our best social enterprises to get people off drugs.Let's get more local people \u2013 who know their streets \u2013 to be special constables. And let's get our police officers out from behind their desks and on the streets fighting crime.I've seen what the police do for us \u2013 how they put themselves in the line of danger to keep us safe. So I want to give them more freedom. But in return for that freedom, police are going to have someone new to answer to.Not ministers \u2013 people. You.On the way are new elected police commissioners that you can vote in \u2013 and kick out. Neighbourhood beat meetings where you hold the police to account.I say to every policeman and woman in the country \u2013 don't be afraid of these changes. The more you've been controlled by the central state, the less people have respected you. I want to change that.More freedom for you to be out on the streets, policing the way you know best \u2013 and in a way local people support, that will mean more respect for the vital work that you do.This is the reform our public services need. From top-down to bottom-up. From state power to people power. The big society spirit blasting through.But the big society needs you to give it life. People already do so much to help others.Three weeks ago, volunteers were asked to come forward to help with the 2012 Olympic Games. You know how many applications have come in? 100,000.Together we're going to make these Olympics great for Britain and great for the world.And on the way we're going to throw everything we can into winning that bid for the 2018 World Cup.There is such an appetite out there for people to play their part. Our job is to help them, encourage them, break down the barriers that stop them.So let's scrap the health and safety rules that put people off. Let's get community organisers to stimulate social action in our poorest areas. Let's get going with national citizen service so more teenagers get some purpose in their lives.And today I can announce international citizen service, to give thousands of our young people, those who couldn't otherwise afford it, the chance to see the world and serve others.Last century, America's peace corps inspired a generation of young people to act, and this century, I want international citizen service to do the same.That's the big society spirit, around the world and back here at home.So that great project in your community \u2013 go and lead it. The waste in government \u2013 go and find it. The new school in your neighbourhood \u2013 go and demand it.The beat meeting on your street \u2013 sign up.The neighbourhood group \u2013 join up. That business you always dreamed of \u2013 start up. When we say "we are all in this together", that is not a cry for help but a call to arms.Society is not a spectator sport. This is your country. It's time to believe it. It's time to step up and own it.So mine is not just a vision of a more powerful country. It is a vision of a more powerful people.The knowledge in the heart of everyone \u2013 everyone \u2013 that they are not captive to the circumstances of their birth, they are not flotsam and jetsam in the great currents of wealth and power, they are not small people but big citizens. People that believe in themselves. A Britain that believes in itself.Not a promise of a perfect country. Just an achievable future of a life more fulfilled and fulfilling for everyone.At this time of great national challenge, two parties have come together to help make it happen. Yes, this is a new kind of government, but no, not just because it's a coalition.It is a new kind of government because it is realistic about what it can achieve on its own, but ambitious about what we can all achieve together.A government that believes in people, that trusts people, that knows its ultimate role is not to take from people but to give, to give power, to give control, to give everyone the chance to make the most of their own life and make better the lives of others.Yes, we will play our part \u2013 but the part you play will mean even more.Your country needs you. It takes two. It takes two to build that strong economy. We'll balance the budget, we'll boost enterprise, but you start those businesses that lead us to growth.It takes two to build that big society. We'll reform public services, we'll devolve power, but you step forward to seize the opportunity.Don't let the cynics say this is some unachievable, impossible dream that won't work in the selfish 21st century \u2013 tell them people are hungry for it.I know the British people and they are not passengers \u2013 they are drivers. I've seen the courage of our soldiers, the spirit of our entrepreneurs, the patience of our teachers, the dedication of our doctors, the compassion of our care workers, the wisdom of our elderly, the love of our parents, the hopes of our children.So come on \u2013 let's pull together. Let's come together.Let's work, together, in the national interest.

aVLiberal Democrats, we have now been in Government for 500 days. Not easy, is it? None of us thought it would be a walk in the park, but I suspect none of us predicted just how tough it would turn out to be. We've lost support, we've lost councillors, and we lost a referendum. I know how painful it has been to face anger and frustration on the doorstep. Some of you may have even wondered: Will it all be worth it in the end? It will be. And today I want to explain why. But above all I want to pay tribute to you. Your resilience. Your grace under fire. I have been genuinely moved by your spirit and your strength. Thank you. Thank you, above all, for never forgetting what we are in politics for. After the May elections, Alex Cole-Hamilton, one of our defeated candidates in Edinburgh said that if losing was part payment for ending child detention then, as he said: "I accept it, with all my heart." That is the liberal spirit and that is something we will never lose. The spirit that gave birth to our party a century and half ago, that kept us alive when the other two parties tried to kill us off. The spirit that means however great our past, our fight will always be for a better future. Down in Westminster we've been vilified like never before. The Left and the Right didn't like us much in opposition. They like us a whole lot less in Government. The Left accuse us of being powerless puppets, duped by a right wing Conservative clique. The Right accuse us of being a sinister left wing clique, who've duped powerless Conservatives. I do wish they'd make up their mind. So yes, it has been hard. And adversity tests the character of a party just as it tests any person. We've shown - you've shown - immense strength. After being hit hard, we picked ourselves up and we came out fighting. Fighting to keep the NHS safe. Fighting to protect human rights. Fighting to create jobs. Fighting for every family. Not doing the easy thing, but doing the right thing. Not easy, but right. And as for all those seats we lost in May, let me tell you this: I won't rest, we won't rest, until we've won every single one of those seats back. These may not be easy times for us as a party. But much more importantly: These are not easy times for the country. Economic insecurity. Conflict and terrorism. Disorder flaring up on our streets. Times like these can breed protectionism and populism. So times like these are when liberals are needed most. Our party has fought for liberal values for a century and half: justice, optimism, freedom. We're not about to give up now. This conference centre is on the site of the old Bingley Hall where William Gladstone stood a hundred and thirty years ago to found the National Liberal Federation. Gladstone observed that day that Birmingham had shown it was no place for 'weak-kneed Liberalism'. No change there then. So we are strong. United. True to our values. Back in Government and on your side.In Government you're faced with hard choices every day. The question is how you make them. Some ask 'how can we get a market to work here?' Others 'how can this win us more votes?' A few 'what will the press think?' For liberals, the litmus test is always the national interest. Not doing the easy thing. Doing the right thing. And that takes a certain kind of character. One which we've seen on display over the last few months. And indeed the last few days here in Birmingham. Brave. Principled. Awkward. Resolute. Optimistic. Unstoppable. No I'm not just talking about Paddy Ashdown. I am talking about everyone in this hall. But I think people still need to know more about the character of our party. Not just how we govern, but why. We proved something about ourselves last year, when we faced a historic choice: Whether or not to enter Government in coalition with the Conservatives. The easy thing would have been to sit on the opposition benches throwing rocks at the Government as it tried to get control of the public finances. It might even, in the short run, have been more popular, but it would not have been right. At that moment, Britain needed a strong government. Alistair Darling's recent book is called "Back from the Brink" - in reality Labour left us on the brink. Teetering on the edge of an economic precipice. So we put aside party differences for the sake of the national interest. People before politics. Nation before party. And while other countries have been riven by political bickering, we have shown that a coalition forged in a time of emergency could be a different kind of government, governing differently. Because let me tell you this: You don't play politics at a time of national crisis. You don't play politics with the economy. And you never, ever play politics with people's jobs. Our first big decision was to clear the structural deficit this parliament. To wipe the slate clean by 2015. This has meant painful cuts. Agonisingly difficult decisions. Not easy, but right. Because handing control of the economy to the bond traders: that's not progressive. Burying your head in the sand: that's not liberal. Saddling our children with the nation's debt: that's not fair. Labour says: the Government is going too far, too fast. I say, Labour would have offered too little, too late. Imagine if Ed Miliband and Ed Balls had still been in power. Gordon Brown's backroom boys when Labour was failing to balance the books, failing to regulate the financial markets, and failing to take on the banks. The two Eds, behind the scenes, lurking in the shadows, always plotting, always scheming, never taking responsibility. At this time of crisis what Britain needs is real leadership. This is no time for the back room boys Labour's economy was based on bad debt and false hope. Labour got us into this mess. But they are clueless about how to get us out. Another term of Labour would have been a disaster for our economy. So don't for a moment let Labour get away with it. Don't forget the chaos and fear of 2008. And never, ever trust Labour with our economy again. Government has brought difficult decisions. Of course the most heart wrenching for me, for all of us, was on university funding. Like all of you, I saw the anger. I understand it. I felt it. I have learned from it. And I know how much damage this has done to us as a party. By far the most painful part of our transition. From the easy promises of opposition to the invidious choices of Government. Probably the most important lesson I have learned is this: No matter how hard you work on the details of a policy, it's no good if the perception is wrong. We can say until we're blue in the face that no one will have to pay any fees as a student, but still people don't believe it. That once you've left university you'll pay less, week in week out, than under the current system, but still people don't believe it. That the support given to students from poorer families will increase dramatically, but still people don't believe it. The simple truth is that the Conservatives and Labour were both set on increasing fees, and in those circumstances we did the best thing we could. Working tirelessly to ensure anyone who wants to go to university can. Freeing part time students from up front fees for the first time. Ensuring fairer repayments for all graduates. But we failed to properly explain those dilemmas. We failed to explain that there were no other easy options. And we have failed so far to show that the new system will be much, much better than people fear. So: lessons learned. But the most important thing now is to get out there and show that university is for everyone. We should all take a leaf out of Simon Hughes' book - who has been busting a gut as the Government's Advocate for Access. Travelling the country, explaining the new system and finding ways to get young people from all backgrounds to apply to university. Simon didn't like the decision we made, and for reasons I respect. But rather than sitting back he has rolled up his sleeves and got on with making the new system work. Simon, thank you. Right now, our biggest concern is of course the economy. The recovery is fragile. Every worker, every family knows that. There is a long, hard road ahead. In the last few days alone we have seen a financial storm in the Eurozone. Rising unemployment. Falling stock markets. So we were right to pull the economy back from the brink. It is clearer now than ever that deficit reduction was essential to protect the economy, to protect homes and jobs. Deficit reduction lays the foundations for growth. But on its own it is not enough. That's why we're already: investing in infrastructure, reducing red tape, promoting skills, getting the banks lending. But the outlook for the global economy has got worse. So we need to do more, we can do more, and we will do more for growth and for jobs. Because we're not in politics just to repair the damage done by Labour, to glue back together the pieces of the old economy. We are here to build a new economy. A new economy safe from casino speculation. That's why a Liberal Democrat business secretary is putting a firewall into the banking system. Protecting the people who have worked hard and saved.  A new economy that safeguards the environment. That's why a Liberal Democrat environment secretary is creating the world's first Green Investment Bank, spending three billion pounds to create green jobs. A new economy where the lowest-paid get to keep the money they earn. That's why a Liberal Democrat chief secretary to the Treasury has put two hundred pounds into the pocket of every basic rate taxpayer and taken almost a million workers - most of them women - out of income tax altogether. A new economy based on skills. That's why one Liberal Democrat minister is creating a quarter of a million new apprenticeships, and another is investing in schools and early years education. A new economy that works for families. Where men and women can choose how to balance work and home. That's why Liberal Democrats are bringing in shared parental leave and more flexible working. And a new economy run for ordinary people rather than big finance. After the so-called masters of the universe turned out to be masters of destruction instead. Which is why when we come to sell those bank shares, I want to see a payback to every citizen. Your money was put at risk. Your money was used to bail out the banks. And so the money made by the banks is your money, too. An economy for everyone: In Scotland, Wales, in every part of the United Kingdom. For women and men. Young, old. Town, country. North, South. A new economy for the whole nation. Because as Liberal Democrats we act for the whole nation. In our long, proud liberal history, we have never served: the media moguls, the union barons or the bankers. We do not serve, and we will never serve, vested interests. We are in nobody's pocket. That's why we can make decisions in the national interest: Not easy, but right. That's why we speak up, first and loudest, when the establishment lets the people down. In the last three years, we've seen establishment institutions exposed one by one. The City of London, shattered by the greed of bankers. The media, corrupted by phone hacking.  Parliament, shamed by expenses. I was brought up to know that it is not polite to say 'I told you so'. But I'm sorry: We did. In 2006 when Vince Cable warned that "bad debts were growing" and that bank lending levels were "recklessly irresponsible". In 2002 when Tom McNally said: "The Government must guard the public interest as assiduously as Mr Murdoch guards his shareholder interests." And in 1996 when Paddy said that Parliament had become "A rotten mess.a dishevelled, disfigured old corpse of what was once called the Mother of Parliaments." Free to tell it like it really is because we are in nobody's pocket. Of all the claims Ed Miliband has made, the most risible is that his party is the enemy of vested interests. While we were campaigning for change in the banking system, they were on their prawn cocktail offensive in the City. While we've led the charge against the media barons, Labour has cowered before them for decades. The most shocking thing about the news that Tony Blair is godfather to one of Rupert Murdoch's children is that nobody was really shocked at all. And today Labour is in hock to the trade union barons: After their government stipend, 95% of Labour's money comes from unions. Most of it from just four of them. Let me be clear: The values of trade unionism are as relevant as ever. Supporting workers. Fighting for fairness at work. But I don't think the unions should be able to buy themselves a political party. Ed Miliband says he wants to loosen the ties between Labour and the union barons who helped him beat his brother. Let's see him put his money where his mouth is.  Let's see if he'll support radical reform of party funding. Every previous attempt has been blocked by the vested interests in the other two parties. We are all stuck in a system that we know is wrong. We've all been damaged by it. But if we learned anything from the expenses scandal. It is surely that if the system's broken.  We should not wait for the next scandal. We should fix it and fix it fast. So whether it is securing the economy, sorting the banks or cleaning up politics, we are making the big, difficult decisions. Not easy, but right. That's what it means to be a party of national government again. Not just making arguments, making change. In a coalition, we have two kinds of power: The power to hold our coalition partners back and the power to move the government forwards. So we can keep the government to a liberal path. Anchor the government in the centre ground. We were absolutely right to stop the NHS bill in its tracks. To ensure change on our terms. No arbitrary deadlines. No backdoor privatization. No threat to the basic principles at the heart of our NHS. We are right to stand up for civil liberties. No retreat to the illiberal populism of the Labour years.  We are right to insist on keeping the tax system fair. Asking the most of the people who have the most. And we will always defend human rights, at home as well as abroad. The European Convention on Human Rights and the Human Rights Act are not, as some would have you believe, foreign impositions. These are British rights, drafted by British lawyers. Forged in the aftermath of the atrocities of the Second World War. Fought for by Winston Churchill. So let me say something really clear about the Human Rights Act. In fact I'll do it in words of one syllable: It is here to stay. So we will always hold the liberal line. But much more important is the positive power of government: Not just stopping bad things but doing good things. Last year I walked through the door of No 10. But we all walked through a kind of door together. To being, once again, a party of national government. So we must move now beyond the reflexes of opposition to the responsibilities of government, and the opportunities of government, too. New social housing. Criminal justice reform.  Fixed term parliaments. Keeping our Post Offices open. House of Lords reform. Better mental health care. Safer banks.  Income tax down for ordinary workers. Capital gains tax up for the rich. Compulsory retirement scrapped. Pensions protected by a triple lock. ID cards: history. Child detention: ended. Just look at what we've announced in the last five days. After decades of campaigning, and thanks to Lynne Featherstone: Equal marriage, straight or gay. More power for consumers over the energy companies. Calling time on rewards for failure in boardrooms. Investing in education for girls in developing countries.  New powers to turn empty homes back into family homes. A five hundred million pound investment in growth. Liberal achievements from a liberal party of government. And we have stood by our commitments to act on the environment. The pollsters tell us that climate change has dropped down people's list of worries. That people have more immediate concerns. I understand that. So the politically convenient thing would have been to put this off to another day. Instead we have acted immediately. Not easy, but right. Ambitious carbon targets.  Energy market reform. Councils generating renewable energy.  A Green Deal to make bills lower and homes warmer. Carbon capture and storage.  Green buses, trains and trams. The world's first ever green investment bank. Green achievements. From a green party of government. I've learned quite a bit in the last 500 days. About the responsibilities of government. About the resilience of our party. The integrity of our members. About our determination to do the right thing. In government, every single day brings hard choices. You can quickly lose your way unless you are certain of your cause. Of why you are there in the first place. Every one of us in this hall has strong political convictions: Civil liberties. Internationalism. Human rights. Political reform. Responsible capitalism. Fighting climate change. But every one of us has a political passion too. The fire inside that drew us to politics in the first place. Let me tell you what I care most about. My passion is ensuring a fair start for every child. I have a simple, unquenchable belief: That every child can do good things, great things if only we give them the opportunities they deserve. Equal opportunity. It sounds so simple doesn't it? Everyone agrees with it. But then we allow prejudice, tradition and class to crush a million hopes and dreams, watch young children's lives go off track even before they go off to school, sit idly by while talent goes to waste. I know I have had all the advantages - good school, great parents. I was lucky. But it shouldn't be about luck. On Saturday I met a group of young people working with a charity called UpRising, here in Birmingham. All from really difficult backgrounds. One young woman, Chantal, told me that she only started to thrive when she found someone who believed in her. I want every child to believe in themselves. In terms of opportunity, we are a nation divided: Children from a poor background a year behind in language skills before the age of five; more young black men in prisons than at Russell Group universities. And within one city, two nations: In Hammersmith and Fulham in West London, more than half the children leaving state schools head to a good university. Just thirty minutes east - down the district line to Tower Hamlets - and just 4 percent do. Odds stacked against too many of our children. A deep injustice, when birth is destiny. That's why I've been leading the charge for social mobility - for fairer chances, for real freedom. People keep telling me that it's too hard. That it's futile to push for fairness into the headwinds of an economic slow down, or that it will just take too long. And that I should find some politically convenient 'quick wins' instead. I've also encountered fierce resistance from those who do so well out of the status quo. But for liberals the only struggles worth having are the uphill ones. Allowing schools to move poorer children up the queue for admissions. Making universities open their doors to everyone. Making firms work harder to get women on their boards. Breaking open internships. All controversial. All difficult. Not easy, but right. So I'm not backing down. I'm not slowing down. Because this will not be a liberal nation until every citizen can thrive and prosper, until birth is no longer destiny, until every child is free to rise. This summer, we saw the consequences of a society in which some people feel they have no stake at all. Nobody could fail to be horrified by what we saw during the riots. These weren't organised campaigns for change. They were outbursts of nihilism and greed. I'll never forget the woman I met in Tottenham, who told me the clothes she stood in were all the possessions she had left in the world after her home was torched. But in every city where trouble broke out, most people did the right thing. So many more people went out to clean up the streets than went out to trash them. In Manchester I met a café owner who boarded up her broken windows and started serving tea and coffee straight away to the people who were helping clear up. And here in Birmingham the community stood together in the face of disorder and tragedy. Or emergency services, our police and our courts all rose to the challenge. But we have to ensure that the offenders become ex-offenders for good. hree out of four had previous convictions. So we have to push ahead with the Government's rehabilitation revolution: Punishment that sticks, that changes behaviour. An end to the corrosive cycle of crime. And I want the criminal to look their victims in the eye to see the consequences of their actions, and to put it right. That's why there will be community payback projects in every city affected. Why we are investing in drug recovery wings in our prisons. Tackling gang culture. Tougher community penalties. Effective justice. Restorative justice. Liberal justice. But let me say something else: The rioters are not the face of Britain's young people. The vast majority of our young people are good, decent and doing the best they can. Don't condemn all of them because of the actions of a few. You know what really struck me? How so many of those who did join in the riots seemed to have nothing to lose. It was about what they could get, here and now. Not what lies in front of them, tomorrow and in the years ahead. As if their own future had little value. Too many of these young people had simply fallen through the cracks. Not just this summer but many summers ago, when they lost touch with their own future. So often the people who have gone off the rails are the ones who were struggling years earlier, not least in making that critical leap from primary to secondary school. So today I am launching a new scheme to help the children who need it most. In the summer before they start secondary school. A two-week summer school helping them to catch up in Maths and English, and getting them ready for the challenges ahead. We know this is a time when too many children lose their way, so this is a £50m investment to help them along the right path. And that is why we have found the money, even now, to invest in education. Protecting the schools budget. A two and a half billion pound Pupil Premium by the end of the parliament. More investment in early years education: 15 hours for all  three and four year-olds. New provision for the poorest two-year-olds. All steps towards a society where nobody is 'enslaved by poverty, ignorance or conformity'. Towards a liberal society. These are investments that will take years or even decades to pay off. By the time the two year-olds we help next year come to vote, I'll be 60. So why are we doing it, when it costs so much and takes so long? Because investing early makes such a huge difference, especially for the poorest children: Not easy, but right. So hold your heads up and look our critics squarely in the eye. This country would be in deep trouble today if we had not gone into Government last year. And Britain will be a fairer nation tomorrow because we are in Government today. Never apologise for the difficult things we are having to do. We are serving a great country at a time of great need. There are no shortcuts, but we won't flinch. Our values are strong. Our instincts are good: Reason not prejudice. Compassion not greed. Hope not fear. After the summer riots, message boards sprang up. They became known as 'peace walls'. And on the peace wall in Peckham there was a note that simply read: Our home. Our children. Our future. Six words that say more than six hundred speeches. Our home. Our children. Our future. Britain is our home. We will make it safe and strong. These are our children. We will tear down every barrier they face. And this is our future. We start building it today.

aVIn May 2010, this party stood on the threshold of power for the first time in more than a decade. We knew then that it was not just the ordinary duties of office that we were assuming. We were entering into Government at a grave moment in the modern history of Britain.At a time when people felt uncertainty, even fear. Here was the challenge: To make an insolvent nation solvent again. To set our country back on the path to prosperity that all can share in. To bring home our troops from danger while keeping our citizens safe from terror. To mend a broken society.Two and a half years later of course I can't tell you that all is well, but I can say this: Britain is on the right track.As Prime Minister it has fallen to me to say some hard things and to help our country face some hard truths. All of my adult life, whatever the difficulties, the British people have at least been confident about one thing. We have thought we can pay our way.That we can earn our living as a major industrial country...\u2026and we will always remain one.It has fallen to us to say - we cannot assume that any longer.Unless we act, unless we take difficult, painful decisions, unless we show determination and imagination, Britain may not be in the future what it has been in the past.Because the truth is this. We are in a global race today. And that means an hour of reckoning for countries like ours. Sink or swim. Do or decline.To take office at such a moment is a duty and an honour\u2026\u2026and we will rise to the challenge.Today I\u2019m going to set out a serious argument to this country about how we do that. How we compete and thrive in this world\u2026\u2026how we can make sure in this century, like the ones before, Britain is on the rise.Nothing matters more.Every battle we fight, every plan we make, every decision we take is to achieve that end\u2026\u2026Britain on the rise.BRITAIN CAN DELIVERThough the challenge before us is daunting, I have confidence in our country. Why? Because Britain can deliver. We can do big things.We saw it this summer. The Jubilee, the Olympics, the Paralympics\u2026\u2026the best country in the world\u2026\u2026and let\u2019s say it: with our Queen, the finest Head of State on earth.I was trying to think of my favourite moment. Was it telling President Hollande that no, we hadn\u2019t cheated at the cycling, we didn\u2019t have rounder wheels, it was just that we peddled faster than the French?No\u2026 for me it was seeing that young woman who swam her heart out for years\u2026\u2026nine training sessions a week, two hours a time.My best moment was putting that gold medal around the neck of Ellie Simmonds. And I am so grateful for what all those Paralympians did.When I used to push my son Ivan around in his wheelchair, I always thought that some people saw the wheelchair, not the boy.Today more people would see the boy and not the wheelchair \u2013 and that\u2019s because of what happened here this summer.And the Olympics showed us something else. Whether our athletes were English, Scottish, Welsh or from Northern Ireland \u2026they draped themselves in one flag.Now, there\u2019s one person who didn\u2019t like that \u2026and he\u2019s called Alex Salmond.I\u2019m going to see him on Monday to sort that referendum on independence by the end of 2014. There are many things I want this coalition to achieve but what could matter more than saving our United Kingdom \u2026let\u2019s say it: we\u2019re better together and we\u2019ll rise together \u2013 so let\u2019s fight that referendum with everything we\u2019ve got.There are so many people to thank for this summer. Those that won the bid, those that built the stadia, that ran the Games \u2026and of course: the man who put a smile on our faces\u2026\u2026the zinger on the zip-wire\u2026\u2026the Conservative Mayor of London: our Boris Johnson.And those Games-Makers. You know, I\u2019ve spent three years trying to explain the Big Society \u2026they did it beautifully in just three weeks.There is another group of people who stepped into the breach this summer \u2013 and we in this party never forget them. Our armed forces have been on the ground in Afghanistan for over ten years now. 433 men and women have made the ultimate sacrifice. Just last weekend there was a memorial service for one of the fallen, and the eulogy said this:\u201cAll that they had they gave. All that they might have had. All that they had ever been. All that they might ever have become.\u201dFor all those who serve, and their families, I repeat the commitment I made when this Government came to office. By the end of 2014, all UK combat operations in Afghanistan will have come to an end. Nearly all our troops will be home \u2013 their country proud, their duty done \u2026and let everyone in this hall stand and show how profoundly grateful we are for everything they do.CONSERVATIVES CAN DELIVERTo meet the challenges our country faces, we must have confidence in ourselves\u2026 confidence as a party. We\u2019ve been in office two and a half years now \u2013 and we\u2019ve done some big, life-changing things.Just ask Clive Stone, who you saw in a film earlier. I met him years ago, when we were in Opposition. He had cancer and he said to me: the drug I need \u2013 it\u2019s out there but they won\u2019t give it to me because it\u2019s too expensive \u2026please, if you get in, do something about it.And we have. A new cancer drugs fund that has got the latest drugs to more than 21,000 people and counting. There was a reason we could do that. It\u2019s because we made a big decision to protect the NHS from spending cuts.No other party made that commitment.Not Labour. Not the Liberal Democrats. Just us \u2013 the Conservatives.To all those people who said we\u2019d bring the NHS down ... I say \u2026well, yes, you\u2019ve got a point.I\u2019ll tell you what is down.Waiting lists \u2013 down. Mixed wards \u2013 down. The number of managers \u2013 down. Bureaucratic targets \u2013 down. Hospital infections \u2013 down.And what\u2019s up? The number of doctors, the number of dentists, the number of midwives, the number of operations carried out in our NHS.So be in no doubt: this is the party of the NHS and that\u2019s the way it\u2019s going to stay.We made a big decision to go on saving lives abroad too. I know some are sceptical about our aid budget. But picture the scene \u2013 you\u2019re in a health centre in Kinshasa. See the child with a needle in her arm, being injected with a Yellow Fever vaccine \u2026the difference between living and dying\u2026\u2026how can anyone tell me that\u2019s a waste of money.Since we gathered here in Birmingham on Sunday, British aid money has vaccinated 130 thousand children around the world. One hundred and thirty thousand children.You, the Conservative party helped do that, and you should be proud of what you\u2019ve done.Here\u2019s something else this party\u2019s done in government. Last December I was at a European Council in Brussels. It was three in the morning, there was a treaty on the table that was not in Britain\u2019s interests\u2026\u2026and twenty five people around that table were telling me to sign it.But I did something that no other British leader has ever done before \u2026I said no \u2013 Britain comes first \u2013 and I vetoed that EU treaty.We\u2019re doing big, Conservative things.For years people said you\u2019ll never reform public sector pensions, the trade unions won\u2019t stand for it. Well, we\u2019ve done it, and it\u2019s going to cut the cost to the taxpayer almost in half.For years people said benefits are out of control and there\u2019s nothing you can do about it. Well, because of our welfare cap, no family will be getting more in benefits than the average family earns.For years people asked why we couldn\u2019t get rid of those radical preachers who spout hatred about Britain while living off the taxpayer\u2026\u2026well, Theresa May \u2013 a great Home Secretary - has done it \u2013 and she\u2019s got Abu Hamza on that plane and out of our country to face justice.Be proud of what we\u2019ve done already. Two million of the lowest-paid workers being taken out of income tax altogether. Over eighteen million households helped with a freeze in their council tax \u2013 and we\u2019re freezing it all over again next year too.BRITAIN ON THE RISEBig, Conservative things - delivered by this government; made possible by this party. We can deliver. We can do big things.The Olympics reminded us how great it feels to be successful. But we mustn\u2019t let that warm glow give us a false sense of security. All around the world, countries are on the rise.Yes, we\u2019ve been hearing about China and India for years \u2026but it\u2019s hard to believe what\u2019s happening in Brazil, in Indonesia, in Nigeria too.Meanwhile, the old powers are on the slide. What do the countries on the rise have in common?They are lean, fit, obsessed with enterprise, spending money on the future \u2013 on education, incredible infrastructure and technology.And what do the countries on the slide have in common?They\u2019re fat, sclerotic, over-regulated, spending money on unaffordable welfare systems, huge pension bills, unreformed public services.I sit in those European Council meetings where we talk endlessly about Greece\u2026\u2026while on the other side of the world, China is moving so fast it\u2019s creating a new economy the size of Greece every three months.I am not going to stand here as Prime Minister and allow this country to join the slide. My job \u2013 our job - is to make sure that in this twenty first century, as in the centuries that came before, our country, Britain, is on the rise. And we here know how that is done.It is the collective result of individual effort and aspiration\u2026\u2026 the ideas you have, the businesses you start, the hours you put in.Aspiration is the engine of progress. Countries rise when they allow their people to rise. In this world where brains matter more, where technologies shape our lives, where no-one is owed a living \u2026the most powerful natural resource we have is our people.Not just the scientists, the entrepreneurs, the engineers ... not just the teachers, the parents, the nurses \u2026 but all our people: including the poorest, those who\u2019ve never had a job, never had a chance, never had hope.That\u2019s why the mission for this government is to build an aspiration nation \u2026 to unleash and unlock the promise in all our people.And for us Conservatives, this is not just an economic mission \u2013 it\u2019s also a moral one. It\u2019s not just about growth and GDP\u2026\u2026it\u2019s what\u2019s always made our hearts beat faster \u2013 aspiration; people rising from the bottom to the top.Line one, rule one of being a Conservative is that it\u2019s not where you\u2019ve come from that counts, it\u2019s where you\u2019re going.We\u2019ve been led by the daughter of a grocer, the son of a music hall performer ... by a Jew when Jews were marginalised, by a woman when women were sidelined. We don\u2019t look at the label on the tin; we look at what\u2019s in it.Let me put that another way. We don\u2019t preach about one nation but practise class war \u2026we just get behind people who want to get on in life.The doers. The risk takers. The young people who dream of their first pay-cheque, their first car, their first home \u2013 and are ready and willing to work hard to get those things.While the intellectuals of other parties sneer at people who want to get on in life, we here salute you.They call us the party of the better-off \u2026 no: we are the party of the want to be better-off, those who strive to make a better life for themselves and their families \u2013 and we should never, ever be ashamed of saying so.THE RIGHT IDEASThis party has a heart but we don\u2019t like wearing it on our sleeve. Conservatives think: let\u2019s just get on with the job and help people and not bang on about it. It\u2019s not our style. But there\u2019s a problem with that.It leaves a space for others to twist our ideas and distort who we are: the cartoon Conservatives who don\u2019t care. My mission from the day I became leader was to change that. Yes, to show the Conservative party is for everyone: North or South, black or white, straight or gay.But above all - to show that Conservative methods are not just the way we grow a strong economy, but the way we build a big society.That Conservative methods are not just good for the strong and the successful but the best way to help the poor, and the weak, and the vulnerable.Because it\u2019s not enough to know our ideas are right \u2013 we\u2019ve got to explain why they are compassionate too. Because we know what we\u2019re up against.We say we\u2019ve got to get the private sector bigger and the public sector smaller\u2026our opponents call it \u2018Tory cuts, slashing the state\u2019. No: it\u2019s the best way to create the sustainable jobs people need.We say help people become independent from welfare\u2026our opponents call it: \u2018cruel Tories, leaving people to fend for themselves.\u2019No: there is only one real route out of poverty and it is work.We say we\u2019ve got to insist on a disciplined, rigorous education for our children \u2026 our opponents call it: \u2018elitist Tories, old-fashioned and out of touch.\u2019No: a decent education is the only way to give all our children a proper start in this world.The reason we want to reform schools, to cut welfare dependency, to reduce government spending is not because we\u2019re the same old Tories who want to help the rich... it\u2019s because we\u2019re the Tories whose ideas help everyone - the poorest the most.A strong private sector. Welfare that works. Schools that teach. These three things are essential to helping our people rise They are essential to our success in this world.And you know what \u2013 Labour will fight them all the way. So these things are not just the battle-ground for Britain\u2019s future \u2026 they are also the battle-lines for the next election \u2013 and it is a fight we\u2019ve got to win, for our party and our country.ECONOMYTo help our people rise, then \u2013 number one \u2013 we need an economy that creates good jobs. We need businesses, of every size, in every type of industry, in every part of the country \u2013 investing and taking people on.There are some basic things they need to do that. Low interest rates so they can afford to take out a loan.And confidence that it\u2019s worth investing - because the customers will be there, whether at home or abroad. Getting the deficit down is essential for both.That\u2019s why our deficit reduction plan is not an alternative to a growth plan: it\u2019s the very foundation of our growth plan. It\u2019s the only way we\u2019ll get Britain on the rise.Now I know you are asking whether the plan is working. And here\u2019s the truth: the damage was worse than we thought, and it's taking longer than we hoped.The world economy \u2013 especially in the Eurozone \u2013 has been much weaker than expected in the past two years. When some of our big trading partners like Ireland, Spain and Italy are suffering, they buy less from us. That hurts our growth and makes it harder to pay off our debts.But here is the crucial thing you need to know.Yes it\u2019s worse than we thought, yes it\u2019s taking longer, but we are making progress. Thanks to the grit and resolve of George Osborne, we have cut a quarter off the deficit in the past two years. 25 per cent. That\u2019s helped to keep interest rates at record low levels......keeping mortgages low. Leaving more money in your pockets. Giving businesses more confidence to invest. Creating more jobs.And if you don\u2019t believe me, just look at the job creation figures. Since this government took office, over one million new jobs have been created in the private sector. That is more \u2013 net \u2013 in the last two years than Labour managed in ten years.LABOURNow, the Labour politicians who got us into the mess say they have a different way out of it. They call it Plan B and it goes like this: We should stop worrying about deficit reduction, borrow more money and spend it to boost the economy.It sounds so reasonable when you put it like that. Let me tell you why it\u2019s not.Right now, while we\u2019ve got a deficit, the people we\u2019re borrowing money from believe that we\u2019ll pay it back - because we\u2019ve set out a tough plan to cut spending and live within our means.That\u2019s why our interest rates are among the lowest in the world, even though the deficit left to us by Labour was one of the highest in the world.If we did what Labour want, and watered down our plans, the risk is that the people we borrow money from would start to question our ability and resolve to pay off our debts.Some may actually refuse to lend us that money. Others would only lend it to us at higher interest rates.That would hurt the economy and hit people hard.If you have a mortgage of £100,000, just a 1 per cent interest rate rise would mean an extra thousand pounds to pay each year. Labour\u2019s plan to borrow more is actually a massive gamble with our economy and our future. And it would squander the sacrifices we\u2019ve already made.We\u2019re here because they spent too much and borrowed too much. How can the answer be more spending and more borrowing? I honestly think Labour haven\u2019t learned a single thing.When they were in office, their answer was always: Borrow more money.Now they\u2019re out of office it\u2019s: Borrow more money.Whatever the day, whatever the question, whatever the weather it\u2019s: borrow more money.Borrow, borrow, borrow.Labour: the party of one notion: more borrowing. I sometimes wonder if they know anything about the real economy at all.Did you hear what Ed Miliband said last week about taxes? He described a tax cut as the government writing people a cheque.Ed... Let me explain to you how it works. When people earn money, it\u2019s their money. Not the government\u2019s money: their money.Then, the government takes some of it away in tax. So, if we cut taxes, we\u2019re not giving them money - we\u2019re taking less of it away. OK?And while we\u2019re on that - who suffers when the wealthy businessman goes off to live in Geneva? Not him \u2013 he\u2019s paying about half the tax he would do here \u2026 it\u2019s those who want to work who suffer because the jobs aren\u2019t being created here.We promised that those with the broadest shoulders would bear the biggest burden \u2026 and with us, the rich will pay a greater share of tax in every year of this Parliament than in any one of the thirteen years under Labour.Under Labour.We haven\u2019t forgotten, you know. We remember who spent our golden legacy, who sold our gold \u2026who busted our banks, who smothered our businesses \u2026 who wracked up our debts, who wrecked our economy \u2026who ruined our reputation, who risked our future \u2026who did this? \u2013 Labour did this \u2013 and this country should never forget it.ASPIRATION ECONOMYTo get Britain on the rise we need a whole new economy \u2026more enterprising, more aspirational \u2026and it\u2019s taking shape already.We\u2019re getting our entrepreneurial streak back: last year the rate of new business creation was faster than any other year in our history.Let me repeat that.The rate at which new businesses started \u2013 faster than any year on record. We\u2019re making things again. We had a trade surplus in cars last year for the first time in almost 40 years.And it\u2019s not just the old industries growing, it\u2019s the new. We\u2019re number one in the world for offshore wind. Number one in the world for tidal power. The world\u2019s first green investment bank.Britain leading; Britain on the rise. We\u2019re showing we can do it. Look at the new investment coming in.In the last two years, Google, Intel, Cisco \u2013 the big tech firms \u2013 they\u2019ve all set up new bases here. And we are selling to the world again.When I became Prime Minister I said to the Foreign Office: those embassies you\u2019ve got \u2026turn them into showrooms for our cars, department stores for our fashion, technology hubs for British start-ups.Yes, you\u2019re diplomats but you need to be our country\u2019s salesforce too. And look what\u2019s happening. In just two years, our exports to Brazil are up 25 per cent \u2026 to China \u2013 40 per cent \u2026 to Russia \u2013 80 per cent.There are so many opportunities in this world. I want to tell you about one business that\u2019s seizing them. It\u2019s run by a guy called Alastair Lukies.He and his business partner saw a world with almost 6 billion mobile phones and just 2 billion bank accounts. They saw the huge gap in the market\u2013 and they started a mobile banking firm \u2026 helping people in the poorest parts of the world manage their money and start new companies.He\u2019s been with me on trade missions all over the world \u2013 and his business is booming. Back in 2010, when we came to office, they employed about 100 people \u2013 now it\u2019s more than 700.Then they were nowhere in Africa, nowhere in Asia, now they are the global player, with one million new users every month. So don\u2019t let anyone tell you Britain can\u2019t make it in this world \u2013 we\u2019re the most enterprising, buccaneering, creative, dynamic nation on earth.And to those who question whether it\u2019s right to load up a plane with businesspeople \u2013 whether we\u2019re flying to Africa, Indonesia, to the Gulf or China \u2026whether we\u2019re taking people from energy, finance, technology or yes \u2013 defence \u2026 I say \u2013 there is a global battle out there to win jobs, orders, contracts \u2026 and in that battle I believe in leading from the front.To get our economy on the rise there\u2019s a lot more to do \u2013 and frankly a lot more fights to be had. Because there are too many of what I\u2019d call the \u201cyes-but-no\u201d people. The ones who say \u201cyes, our businesses need to expand \u2026but no we can\u2019t reform planning.\u201dIt\u2019s simple. For a business to expand, it needs places to build. If it takes too long, they\u2019ll just build elsewhere.I visited a business the other day that wanted to open a big factory just outside Liverpool. But the council was going to take so long to approve the decision that they\u2019re now building that factory on the continent \u2013 and taking hundreds of jobs with them.If we\u2019re going to be a winner in this global race we\u2019ve got to beat off this suffocating bureaucracy once and for all. And then there are those who say \u201cyes of course we need more housing\u201d \u2026 but \u201cno\u201d to every development \u2013 and not in my backyard.Look - it's OK for my generation. Many of us have got on the ladder. But you know the average age that someone buys their first home today, without any help for their parents? 33 years old.We are the party of home ownership \u2013 we cannot let this carry on.So yes \u2013 we\u2019re doubling the discount for buying your council house \u2026we\u2019re helping first-time buyers get a 95 per cent mortgage \u2026but there\u2019s something else we need to do \u2013 and that\u2019s accept we need to build more houses in Britain.There are young people who work hard year after year but are still living at home. They sit in their childhood bedroom, looking out of the window dreaming of a place of their own.I want us to say to them \u2013 you are our people, we are on your side, we will help you reach your dreams.WELFAREIf we want our people to rise so Britain can rise, we must tackle welfare. Here\u2019s two facts for you.Fact one. We spend £90 billion a year on welfare for working-age people. Not pensions. Just welfare for working age people \u2013 and that\u2019s one pound in every eight the government spends.Fact two. More of our children live in households where nobody works than almost any other nation in Europe. Let me put it simply. Welfare isn\u2019t working. And this is a tragedy.Our reforms are just as profound as those of Beveridge 60 years ago. He had his great evils to slay. Squalor. Ignorance. Want. Idleness. And Disease.Here are mine.First, unfairness.What are hard-working people who travel long distances to get into work and pay their taxes meant to think when they see families \u2013 individual families \u2013 getting 40, 50, 60 thousand pounds of housing benefit to live in homes that these hard working people could never afford themselves?It is an outrage. And we are ending it by capping housing benefit.The second evil: injustice.Here\u2019s the choice we give our young people today.Choice one: Work hard. Go to college. Get a job. Live at home. Save up for a flat. And as I\u2019ve just said, that can feel like forever.Or: Don\u2019t get a job. Sign on. Don\u2019t even need to produce a CV when you do sign on. Get housing benefit. Get a flat. And then don\u2019t ever get a job or you\u2019ll lose a load of housing benefit.We must be crazy.So this is what we\u2019ve done.Now you have to have to sign a contract that says: you do your bit and we\u2019ll do ours.It requires you to have a real CV and it makes clear: you have to seek work and take work \u2013 or you will lose your benefit. And we\u2019re going to look at ending automatic access to housing benefit for people under 25 too.If hard-working young people have to live at home while they work and save, why should it be any different for those who don\u2019t?The next evil: bureaucracy.Sign on. Sign here. Come back in a fortnight. Repeat as required.What does this do for the guy who\u2019s been out of work for years, playing computer games all day, living out a fantasy because he hates real life?For people like him we\u2019re doing something new. The Work Programme takes the money we\u2019re going to save from getting people off the dole \u2026and uses it today to get them into work, with proper training.We\u2019re spending up to £14,000 on one individual to get them into work \u2013 and already almost 700,000 people have got onto the Work Programme.So let\u2019s be clear: in British politics today it is this party saying no-one is a write-off, no-one is hopeless \u2026and with Iain Duncan Smith leading this revolution let this be the party that shows there is ability and promise in everyone.And just one more thing on welfare.You know our work experience programme, where we give young people the chance to work in a supermarket, a shop, an office?Here\u2019s what one union official said about it. I quote: \u201cThe scheme belongs back in the nineteenth century, along with Oliver Twist and the workhouse. It is nothing short of state sponsored slavery\u2026\u201dHonestly. What an appalling, snobbish attitude to the idea of work. We\u2019re not sending children up chimneys, we\u2019re giving them a chance. What\u2019s cruel isn\u2019t asking something of people \u2013 it\u2019s when we ask nothing of them. Work isn\u2019t slavery, it\u2019s poverty that is slavery\u2026\u2026and again it\u2019s us, the modern compassionate Conservative party, who are the real champions of fighting poverty in Britain today.EDUCATIONTo help people to rise, to help Britain rise, there\u2019s a third \u2013 crucial \u2013 thing we must do. Educate all our children.And I mean really educate them, not just pump up the grades each year. In maths, in science, in reading, we\u2019ve fallen behind \u2026not just behind Germany and Canada but Estonia and Australia too.This is Britain\u2019s real school report and the verdict is clear: must try harder. You\u2019ve heard of pushy parents, sharp-elbowing their way to a better education for their kids?Well \u2013 this is a pushy government.My approach is very simple. I\u2019ve got two children in primary school, and I want for your children what I want for mine. To go to schools where discipline is strict, expectations are high and no excuses are accepted for failure.I don\u2019t want great schools to just be the preserve of those that can pay the fees, or buy the nice house in the right catchment area \u2026I want those schools to be open to every child \u2013 in every neighbourhood.And the reason I know that every child can go to a school like that is because with this Government, more and more new ones are opening.We\u2019ve heard from some of them this week \u2026 not just the 79 new free schools \u2013 with over a hundred more to come\u2026\u2026but from some of the more than 2000 academies we\u2019ve helped create \u2013 state schools given all the freedoms, and carrying all the high expectations, of private schools.Yes \u2013 that\u2019s my plan \u2013 millions of children sent to independent schools \u2026independent schools, in the state sector.That\u2019s the genuine revolution that\u2019s now underway.The Harris Academy in Peckham has increased the number of students getting five good GCSEs \u2013 from 12 percent when it was under local authority control to almost 90 percent now.The transformation has been astonishing \u2013 and the methods have been Conservative.Smart uniforms, teachers in suits. Children taught physics, chemistry and biology not soft options. Children set by ability \u2013 with excellence applauded, extra resources for those most in need but no excuses for slacking.When you see a school like that succeed it prompts the question: Why can\u2019t every school be that way? Why can\u2019t every child have those chances?It\u2019s not because parents aren\u2019t ambitious enough \u2013 most of these schools are massively over-subscribed.It\u2019s because the old educational establishment \u2013 the left-wing local authorities, the leaders of the teachers unions, the Labour party theorists \u2013 stood in the way.When we saw a badly failing school in Haringey and wanted to turn it into an Academy, the Labour authority, the Labour MP and the teaching unions said no.When inspirational teachers and parents \u2013 in Hammersmith, in Norwich, in Bristol and in Wigan \u2013 wanted to open free schools, the left-wing establishment said no.When we proposed: More pay for good teachers... Getting rid of bad teachers \u2026Longer school days to help children learn\u2026 Flexible school hours to help parents work \u2026More stretching exams for those who\u2019re really able\u2026 Less nonsense about health and safety\u2026the left-wing establishment have said just one thing: No.When you ask them: why is a school failing? Why aren\u2019t the children succeeding? You hear the same thing over and over again.\u2018What can you expect with children like these?\u2019 they say. \u2018These children are disadvantaged.\u2019Of course we want to tackle every disadvantage. But isn\u2019t the greatest disadvantage of all being written off by those so in hock to a culture of low expectations that they have forgotten what it\u2019s like to be ambitious, to want to transcend your background, to overcome circumstance and succeed on your own terms?It\u2019s that toxic culture of low expectations \u2013 that lack of ambition for every child \u2013 which has held this country back.Well, Michael Gove and I are not waiting for an outbreak of sanity in the headquarters of the NUT or an embrace of aspiration in the higher reaches of Labour before we act.Because our children can\u2019t wait.So when people say we should slow down our education reforms \u2013 so adults can adjust to them, I say:I want more free schools, more Academies, more rigorous exams in every school, more expected of every child.And to all those people who say: he wants children to have the kind of education he had at his posh school \u2026I say: yes \u2013 you\u2019re absolutely right.I went to a great school and I want every child to have a great education.I\u2019m not here to defend privilege, I\u2019m here to spread it.CONCLUSIONI don\u2019t have a hard luck story. My dad was a stockbroker from Berkshire.It\u2019s only when your dad\u2019s gone that you realise \u2013 not just how much you really miss them \u2013 but how much you really owe them.My dad influenced me much more than I ever thought. He was born with no heels on his feet and legs about a foot shorter than they\u2019re meant to be. But he never complained - even when he lost both those legs later in life.Because disability in the 1930s was such a stigma, he was an only child. Probably a lonely child.But Dad was the eternal optimist. To him the glass was always half full. Usually with something alcoholic in it.When I was a boy I remember once going on a long walk with him in the village where we lived, passing the church he supported and the village hall where he took part in interminable parish council meetings.He told me what he was most proud of. It was simple \u2013 working hard from the moment he left school and providing a good start in life for his family.Not just all of us, but helping his mum too, when his father ran off. Not a hard luck story, but a hard work story.Work hard. Family comes first. But put back in to the community too.There is nothing complicated about me. I believe in working hard, caring for my family and serving my country. And there is nothing complicated about what we need today.This is still the greatest country on earth. We showed that again this summer. 22nd in world population. 3rd in the medals table.But it\u2019s tough. These are difficult times. We\u2019re being tested. How will we come through it? Again, it\u2019s not complicated. Hard work. Strong families. Taking responsibility. Serving others.As I said on the steps of No10 Downing Street before walking through that door: Those who can should, those who can\u2019t we will always help.The job of this party \u2026 of this government \u2026 is to help to bring out the best in this country. Because at our best we\u2019re unbeatable.We know Britain can deliver because we\u2019ve seen it time and again.This is the country that \u2026 invented the computer, defeated the Nazis, started the web, saw off the slave trade, unravelled DNA and fought off every invader for a thousand years.We even persuaded the Queen to jump out of a helicopter to make the rest of the world smile \u2026. there is absolutely nothing we cannot do.Can we make Britain the best place in the world to start a business, grow a business and help that business take on the world and win? Yes.Can we \u2013 the people who invented the welfare state in the first place \u2013 turn it into something that rewards effort, helps keep families together and really helps the poorest with a new start in life. Yes.Can we take our schools and turn out students that will take on the brightest in the world? Yes. Of course we can.Let us here in this hall, here in this government, together in this country make this pledge \u2013 let\u2019s build an aspiration nation \u2026let\u2019s get Britain on the rise.Deficit, paid down. Tough decisions, taJken. Growth, fired up. Aspiration, backed all the way.We know what it takes to win \u2026 to win in the tough world of today \u2026 to win for all our people \u2026 to win for Britain.So let\u2019s get out there and do it.

aVIt's great to be in Brighton. And I want to start by thanking somebody from the bottom of my heart for the kindest of words. Not Justine \u2026oh, I would like to thank her, a round of applause for Justine please, ladies and gentlemen. Not my mum \u2026 but a woman called Ella Philips. It was local election day, Ella rode past me on her bike, she fell off \u2026it\u2019s not funny! I helped her up and afterwards she called me something I had never been called before: she said I was an \u201caction hero\u201d. Why are you laughing? She said I was an action hero \u201cwho mysteriously appeared out of nowhere\u201d. And she said, \u201cWhat added to all the confusion was that Ed was actually attractive and not geeky at all\u201d. I promise you, she did say that. She said, \u201cEven the way he appeared was suave\u201d. I don\u2019t know why you find this so funny, friends. \u201cHe was dressed casually, but he had style\u201d. Sounds quite me, doesn\u2019t it? Now I was pretty pleased with this, as you can tell, until something dawned on me: Ella was concussed. She was badly concussed. In fact, she herself said, \u201cI was seeing things because I was still in quite a daze\u201d. Well, Ella, you are not kidding. But let me say, Ella, if you are watching today, thank you, you have made my year. I want to start today with the simplest of thoughts. An idea that has inspired change for generations. The belief that helped drive us out of the Second World War and into that great reforming government of 1945. An ambition that is more important now than it has been for decades. An emotion that is felt across our country at kitchen tables every night. A feeling that is so threatening to those who want to keep things as they are. Words that are so basic and yet so powerful, so modest and yet so hard to believe. Six simple words that say: Britain can do better than this. Britain can do better than this; we are Britain, we are better than this. Are you satisfied with a country where people are working for longer for less, year after year? Are you satisfied with a country divided losing touch with the things we value the most? Are you satisfied with a country that shuts out the voices of millions of ordinary people and listens only to the powerful? Are you satisfied with a country standing apart as two nations? Well I am not satisfied. We are Britain, we are better than this. And we have to rebuild anew One Nation. An economy built on your success, a society based on your values, a politics that hears your voice \u2013 rich and poor alike \u2013 accepting their responsibilities top each other. One Nation, we are going to make it happen, and today I am going to tell you how. I want to start with leadership. Leadership is about risks and difficult decisions. It is about those lonely moments when you have to peer deep into your soul. I ran for the leadership of this party, it was really hard for my family, but I believed that Labour needed to turn the page and I was the best person to do it. I when I became leader I faced a decision about whether we should stand up to Rupert Murdoch. It wasn\u2019t the way things had been done in the past, but it was the right thing to do so I did it. And together we faced them down. And then the other week I faced an even bigger decision about whether the country should go to war. The biggest decision any leader faces, the biggest decision any Parliament faces, the biggest decision any party faces. All of us were horrified by the appalling chemical weapons attacks in Syria, but when I stood on the stage three years ago, when I became your leader, I said we would learn the lessons of Iraq. It would have been a rush to war, it wasn\u2019t the right thing for our country. So I said no. It was the right thing to do. You see, the real test of leadership is not whether you stand up to the weak, that\u2019s easy; it\u2019s whether you stand up to the strong and know who to fight for. And you know I am reminded of a story back when I was starting out, standing to be an MP in Doncaster, with a woman called Molly Roberts. Molly was in her seventies, and there I was candidly trying to get her vote, sitting in her front from sipping a mug of tea. And she said to me, \u201cHow can you, who weren\u2019t brought up in this area, possibly understand the lives of people here, their hopes and their struggles?\u201d It was the right question, and here is the answer. For me it lies in the values I was brought up with. You see in my house it was my mum that taught me these values. About the importance of reaching out a listening to people, of understanding their hopes and their struggles. She is the most patient, generous person I have met in my whole life. And she taught me never to be contemptuous of others, never to be dismissive of their struggle. Now she was teaching me a lesson of life. And some people will say, ah yeah but you have to leave decency behind when it comes to politics. Well I say they are wrong, because only if you reach out and listen can you do the most important thing a leader can do, the most important qualification in my view for being Prime Minister. Only then will you have the ability to walk in the shoes of others and know who to fight for, whoever your opponent, however powerful they are, guided by the only thing that matters: your sense of what is right. This is what I believe, this is where I stand, this is the leadership Britain needs. And when I think about who we need to fight for I think about all the people I have met over the last year. I think of the people Britain and their enormous and extraordinary spirit. I think of our troops, serving so bravely all around the world. Let us pay tribute to them today. You know I have seen in Afghanistan those young men and women, young men and women who are young enough to be my son or daughter serving our country, and it is a truly humbling experience. And the events of the last few days in Kenya remind us of the importance of being ever-vigilant against terrorism at home and around the world. I think of the brave men and women of our police force, who serve with so little credit each and every day for our country. Let us thank them for what they do. And then I think of all the people I have met over the last year. During the local election campaign I did something unusual. I went to town centres, market squares and high streets and I stood on a pallet \u2013 not a soapbox, but a pallet. And I talked to people about their lives. I remember this town meeting I had in Cleverly. It was just coming to the end of the meeting and this bloke wandered up. He was incredibly angry. It\u2019s a family show so I won\u2019t exactly repeat what he said. He was so angry he wouldn\u2019t give me his name, but he did tell me his story about how he spent the last ten years looking after his disabled wife, and then another four years looking for a job and not finding one. He was angry about immigration and some people in the crowd booed him. But actually he wasn\u2019t prejudiced, he just felt the economy didn\u2019t work for him. And then I think about the two market traders I met in Chesterfield, standing by their stalls, out in all weathers, working all hours, and they said look this country just doesn\u2019t seem to be rewarding our hard work and effort. There seem to be some people getting something for nothing. This society is losing touch with our values. And then I think about this beautiful sunny spring day I spent in Lincoln. And the face in the crowd, this young woman who said she was an ambulance controller. So proud to be working for our National Health Service. And so proud too of her young son. Because she was a single parent, nineteen years old, and what she said to me was, \u201cWhy does everybody portray me as a burden on the system? I am not a burden on the system, I am going out, I am doing the right thing for the country, why doesn\u2019t anyone listen to my voice?\u201d And then I think about this scaffolder I met just around the corner from where I live. I was just coming back from a local café I\u2019d been at. He stopped in me the street, he said to me, \u201cWhere\u2019s your bodyguard?\u201d I said I don\u2019t have one, but that\u2019s another story. He told me his story. And what he said to me was \u201clook, I go out, I do the work, I go all around the country, again out in all weathers, I earn a decent wage, but I still can\u2019t make ends meet\u201d. And he said to me, \u201cIs anyone ever going to do anything about those gas and electric bills that just go up and up, faster than I can earn a living?\u201d He wanted someone to fight for him. Now if you listen to these stories \u2013 four of millions of the stories of our country \u2013 and you have your own, and your friends and family, what do you learn? All of these people love Britain, they embody its great spirit, but they all believe that Britain can do better than this. Today I say to them and millions of others you\u2019re right, Britain can do better than this, Britain must do better than this, Britain will do better than this with a government that fights for you. But for Britain to do better than this we\u2019ve got to understand why we got here, why things are so tough at the moment even while they tell you there is a recovery and why unless we put things right it will only be a recovery for the few. Now what I\u2019m about to tell you is the most important thing I\u2019m going to say today about what needs to change about our country. For generations in Britain when the economy grew the majority got better off. And then somewhere along the way that vital link between the growing wealth of the country and your family finances was broken. This is, this goes beyond one party or one government. It is more important to you than which party is in power, even more important than that. You see, when I was growing up in the 1980s, I saw the benefits of growing prosperity, people able to buy a house, a car, even a second car, go on a foreign holiday their grandparents would never have dreamed of. Not spend all their hours at work, able to spend time with kids, not working all the hours that god sends, have a secure pension in retirement and also believe that their kids would have a better life than them. That feels a long way away from where Britain is today doesn\u2019t it and that is because it is. You see, somewhere along the way that link got broken. They used to say a rising tide lifts all boats, now the rising tide just seems to lift the yachts. Now I say this to the people of Britain. If I were you I wouldn\u2019t even take a second look at a political party unless they make this their central defining purpose because your future depends on it. Your children\u2019s future depends on it. Britain\u2019s future depends on it. I say we are Britain we can do better than this. Now I have got a question for you ladies and gentlemen, do the Tories get it? [Audience: No] Oh come on, I didn\u2019t hear you, do the Tories get it? [Audience: No] Ok that is better. They don\u2019t get it do they. I want to say this. I understand why three and a half years ago some people might have thought that David Cameron did get it and that is why people voted for him at the last general election. But they voted for change and I don\u2019t believe they got the change that they were voting for. Let me just explain it this way: next week we are going to see David Cameron resuming his lap of honour for how brilliantly he\u2019s done as Prime Minister. Claiming credit for his enormous achievements, how he has saved the economy as they put it. No doubt he\u2019ll even be taking off his shirt and flinging it into the crowd expecting adoration from the British people like he did recently on holiday and maybe I should make this promise while I\u2019m about it, if I become Prime Minister I won\u2019t take my shirt off in public, I mean it is just not necessary is it. I\u2019ll try and keep the promise. Anyway, back to David Cameron, so he is going on this lap of honour, everything is brilliant, he\u2019s saved the economy, George Osborne, he deserves the garlands as well, you know, aren\u2019t they brilliant. Come on. The slowest recovery in one hundred years. One million young people looking for work. More people on record working part-time who want full time work. More people than for a generation out of work for longer. The longest fall in living standards since 1870. That is not worthy of a lap of honour. That is worthy of a lap of shame and that is the record of this government. He does have one record though but I don\u2019t think it credits a lap of honour. He has been Prime Minister for 39 months and in 38 of those months wages have risen more slowly than prices. That means your living standards falling year, after year, after year. So in 2015 you\u2019ll be asking am I better off now than I was five years ago? And we already know the answer for millions of families will be no. You\u2019ve made the sacrifices, but you haven\u2019t got the rewards. You were the first into the recession but you are the last one out. Now of course it would have taken time to recover from the global financial crisis whoever was in power. But when these Tories tell you that the pain will be worth the gain, don\u2019t believe them. They can\u2019t solve the cost of living crisis and here is why. The cost of living crisis isn\u2019t an accident of David Cameron\u2019s economic policy it is in his economic policy. Let me explain why. You see he believes in this thing called the global race, but what he doesn\u2019t tell you is that he thinks for Britain to win the global race you have to lose, lower wages, worse terms and conditions, fewer rights at work. But Britain can\u2019t win a race for the lowest wages against countries where wages rates are pennies an hour and the more we try the worse things will get for you. Britain can\u2019t win a race for the fewest rights at work against the sweat shops of the world and the more we try the worse things will get for you. And Britain can\u2019t win a race for the lowest skilled jobs against countries where kids leave school at the age of 11. And the more we try the worse things will get for you. It is a race to the bottom. Britain cannot and should not win that race. You see it is not the low achievements of these Tories that really gets me. That is bad enough. It is their low aspirations; it is their low aspirations for you. It is their low aspirations for Britain but their high hopes for those at the top. The City bonuses are back. Up 82% in April alone thanks to the millionaire\u2019s tax cut. So when they tell you the economy is healing, that everything is fixed, just remember, they are not talking about your life, they are talking about their friends at the top. That is who they are talking about; it is high hopes for them. And every so often you know the mask slips doesn\u2019t it. The other day a man they call Lord Howell, he was I think their advisor on fracking at one point\u2026 There is nothing funny about that. He said it was wrong to frack in some areas but it was ok in others, it was ok in the North East of England because he said, and I quote \u2018it was full of desolate and uninhabited areas.\u2019 In one casual aside dismissing one whole region of the country. Let\u2019s tell these Tories about the North East of England and every other part of Britain. People go out to work. They love their kids. They bring up their families. They care for their neighbours. They look out for each other. They are proud of their communities. They are proud of their communities. They hope for the future. The Tories call them inhabitants of desolate areas. We call them our friends, our neighbours, the heroes of our country. They are fed up of a government that doesn\u2019t understand their lives and a Prime Minister who cannot walk in their shoes. We are Britain, we are better than this. Now, to make Britain better we have got to win a race to the top, not a race to the bottom. A race to the top which means that other countries will buy our goods the companies will come and invest here and that will create the wealth and jobs we need for the future but we are not going to be able to do it easily. It is going to be tough and let me just say this friends. You think opposition is tough, you should try government. It is going to be tough; it is not going to be easy. And I\u2019m not going to stand here today and pretend to you it is. We are going to have to stick to strict spending limits to get the deficit down. We are not going to be able to spend money we don\u2019t have and frankly if I told you we were going to you wouldn\u2019t believe me, the country wouldn\u2019t believe me and they would be right not to believe me. But we can make a difference. We can win the race to the top and let me tell you how. It is about the jobs we create, it is about the businesses we support, it is about the talents we nurture, it is about the wages we earn and it is about the vested interests that we take on. Let me start with the jobs of the future. The environment is a passion of mine because when I think about my two kids who are 2 and 4 at the moment and not talking that much about the environment, more interested in The Octonauts. There\u2019s a plug. In 20 years\u2019 time they\u2019ll say to me \u2018were you the last generation not to get climate change or the first generation to get it?\u2019 That is the question they\u2019ll be asking. But it is not just about environmental care. It is also about the jobs we create in the future. You see some people say, including George Osborne, that we can\u2019t afford to have environmental at a time like this. He is dead wrong. We can\u2019t afford not to have an environmental commitment at a time like this. That is why Labour will have a world leading commitment in government to take all of the carbon out of our energy by 2030. A route map to one million new green jobs in our country. That is how we win the race to the top. And to win that race to the top we have also got to do something else, we\u2019ve got to support the businesses of the future. Now many of the new jobs in the future will come from a large number of small businesses not a small number of large businesses. And this is really important. If you think 15 years ahead, the rate of change and dynamism is so great that most of the new jobs that will be being done will be by companies that don\u2019t yet exist. Now that changes the priorities for government. When this government came to office, since they came to office they cut taxes for large business by £6 bn but raised taxes on small businesses. Now I don\u2019t think that is the right priority. Yes we need a competitive tax regime for large businesses but frankly they\u2019ve short-changed small business and I\u2019m going to put it right. If Labour wins power in 2015 we will use the money that this government would use to cut taxes for 80,000 large businesses to cut business rates for 1.5 million businesses across our country. That is the way we win the race to the top. One Nation Labour. The party of small business. Cutting small business rates when we come to office in 2015 and freezing them the next year benefitting businesses by at least £450 a year. That is how we win the race for the top friends, and to win that race to the top we\u2019ve also got to nurture the talents of the next generation. The skills of people. There are so many brilliant businesses in our country who provide amazing training for the workforce, but look, we have got to face facts, leading businesses say this to me too which is there aren\u2019t enough of them and we have got to work to change that so we will say if you want a major government contract you must provide apprenticeships for the next generation. And we\u2019ll also say to companies doing the right thing, training their workforce that they will have the power to call time on free-riding by competitors who refuse to do the same. That\u2019s how we win the race to the top friends. It\u2019s not just business that has to accept responsibility though, it\u2019s young people. We have a tragedy in this country. Hundreds of thousands of young people who leave school and end up on the dole. We\u2019ve got this word for it haven\u2019t we? NEET: Not in education employment or training. Behind that short word is a tragedy of hundreds of thousands of wasted lives. If the school system fails our young people they shouldn\u2019t be ending up on benefits. They should be ending up in education or training so they can get back on the road to a proper career. That requires them to accept responsibility but it requires government too to accept our responsibilities for the next generation in Britain, and that\u2019s what we\u2019ll do. But to win the race to the top we\u2019ve also got to take advantage of the talents of Britain\u2019s 12 million parents. Justine and I had one of the great privileges in any parent\u2019s life this year, which was taking our son Daniel to his first day at school. He was nervous at first, but actually pretty soon he started having fun; it\u2019s a bit like being leader of the Labour Party really. Well it\u2019s not exactly like being leader of the Labour Party. But look, for so many parents in this country the demands of the daily school run, combined with their job are like their very own daily assault course and we\u2019ve got to understand that. Because we can\u2019t win the race to the top with stressed out parents and family life under strain \u2013 we\u2019ve got to change that. In the last century, schools stayed open till mid-afternoon and that was okay back then because one parent usually stayed at home. But it\u2019s not okay now: that\u2019s why we want every primary school in Britain to have the breakfast clubs and after school care that parents need and that\u2019s what the next Labour government will do. To win the race to the top we\u2019ve also got to deal with the issue of low pay. The National Minimum Wage, one of the last Labour government\u2019s proudest achievements, friends. But we have to face facts: there are millions of people in this country going out to work, coming home at night, unable to afford to bring up their families. I just think that\u2019s wrong in one of the richest countries in the world. The next Labour government must write the next chapter in dealing with the scourge of low pay in this country. And to do that though, we\u2019ve got to learn lessons from the way the minimum wage came in, because it was about business and working people, business and unions working together in the right way so we set the minimum wage at the right level and we\u2019ve got to do the same again. The minimum wage has been falling in value and we\u2019ve got to do something about it. There are some sectors, and I don\u2019t often say anything nice about the banks but I will today, there are some sectors which actually can afford to pay higher wages, and some of them are \u2013 a living wage in some of the banks. So we\u2019ve got to look at whether there are some sectors where we can afford a higher minimum but we\u2019ve got to do it on the right basis \u2013 business and working people working together. That\u2019s what we will do: the next Labour government will strengthen the minimum wage to make work pay for millions in our country. That\u2019s how we win the race to the top. And to win that race to the top we\u2019ve got to call a halt to the race to the bottom, between workers already here and workers coming here. I\u2019m the son of two immigrant parents. I\u2019m proud of the welcome Britain gave me and my family, and we\u2019ve always welcomed people who work, contribute and are part of our community. Let me say this, if people want a party that will cut itself off from the rest of the world, then let me say squarely: Labour is not your party. But if people want a party that will set the right rules for working people then Labour is your party, the only party that will do it. Employers not paying the minimum wage and government turning a blind eye \u2013 it\u2019s a race to the bottom; not under my government. Recruitment agencies hiring only from overseas \u2013 it\u2019s a race to the bottom; not under my government. Shady gang masters exploiting people in industries from constructing to food processing \u2013 it\u2019s a race to the bottom; not under my government. Rogue landlords, putting 15 people in tied housing \u2013 it\u2019s a race to the bottom; not under my government. And our country, sending out a message to the world that if you need to engage in shady employment practices, then Britain is open for businesses? It\u2019s a race to the bottom; not under my government. And in case anyone asks whether this is pandering to prejudice, let\u2019s tell them, it isn\u2019t. It\u2019s where Labour has always stood \u2013 countering exploitation, whoever it affects, wherever they come from. We\u2019ve never believed in a race to the bottom, we\u2019ve always believed in a race to the top, that is our party. And to win the race to the top we\u2019ve also got to take on the vested interests that hold our economy back. In the 1990s we committed to a dynamic market economy. Think of those words: \u2018dynamic, \u2018market\u2019, \u2018economy\u2019. And then think about this, what happens when competition fails? What happens when it just fails again and again and again? Then government has to act. Train companies that put the daily commute out of reach. Payday lenders who force people into unpayable debt. Gas and electric companies that put prices up and up and up. It\u2019s not good for an economy. It\u2019s not a dynamic market economy when one section of society does so well at the expense of others. It\u2019s bad for families, it\u2019s bad for business and it\u2019s bad for Britain too. Now some people will just blame the companies but actually I don\u2019t think that\u2019s where the blame lies. I think it lies with government. I think it lies with government for not having had the strength to take this on. Not having stood up to the powerful interests. Not having the strength to stand up to the strong. Take the gas and electricity companies. We need successful energy companies, in Britain. We need them to invest for the future. But you need to get a fair deal and frankly, there will never be public consent for that investment unless you do get a fair deal. And the system is broken and we are going to fix it. If we win the election 2015 the next Labour government will freeze gas and electricity prices until the start of 2017. Your bills will not rise. It will benefit millions of families and millions of businesses. That\u2019s what I mean by a government that fights for you. That\u2019s what I mean when I say Britain can do better than this. Now the companies aren\u2019t going to like this because it will cost them more but they have been overcharging people for too long because of a market that doesn\u2019t work. It\u2019s time to reset the market. So we will pass legislation in our first year in office to do that, and have a regulator that will genuinely be on the customers\u2019 side but also enable the investment we need. That\u2019s how Britain will do better than this. So, making Britain better than this starts with our economy \u2013 your economic success as a foundation for Britain\u2019s economic success. But it doesn\u2019t just stop there it goes to our society as well. I told you earlier on about those market traders in Chesterfield and how they felt that society had lost touch with their values. I think what they were really saying was this: that they put in huge hard work and effort, they bring up their kids in the right way and they just feel that their kids are going to have a worse life than them. And nowhere is that more true than when it comes to renting or buying a home. There are 9 million people in this country renting a home, many of whom who would want to buy. 9 million people \u2013 we don\u2019t just have a cost of living crisis, we have a housing crisis too. In 2010 when we left office there was a problem. There were one million too few homes in Britain. If we carry on as we are, by 2020 there will be two million too few homes in Britain. That is the equivalent of two cities the size of Birmingham. Wave got to do something about it and the next Labour government will. So we\u2019ll say to private developers, you can\u2019t just sit on land and refuse to build. We will give them a very clear message \u2013 either use the land or lose the land, that is what the next Labour government will do. We\u2019ll say to local authorities that they have a right to grow, and neighbouring authorities can\u2019t just stop them. We\u2019ll identify new towns and garden cities and we\u2019ll have a clear aim that by the end of the parliament Britain will be building 200,000 homes a year, more than at any time in a generation. That\u2019s how we make Britain better than this. And nowhere do we need to put the values of the British people back at the heart of our country more than in our National Health Service, the greatest institution of our country. You know I had a letter a couple of months back from a 17 year old girl. She was suffering from depression and anxiety and she told me a heart-breaking story about how she had ended up in hospital for 10 weeks. Mental health is a truly one nation problem. It covers rich and poor, North and South, young and old alike and let\u2019s be frank friends, in the privacy of this room; we\u2019ve swept it under the carpet for too long. It\u2019s a bit of a British thing isn\u2019t it; we don\u2019t like to talk about it. If you\u2019ve got a bad back or if you\u2019re suffering from cancer you can talk abbot it but if you\u2019ve got depression or anxiety you don\u2019t want to talk about it because somehow it doesn\u2019t seem right \u2013 we\u2019ve got to change that. It\u2019s an afterthought in our National Health Service. And here\u2019s a really interesting thing \u2013 so you might say, it\u2019s going to be really tough times Ed, you told us that before. You said there would be really difficult decisions in government, and that\u2019s true, so how are you going to make it work? Well here\u2019s the thing, the 17-year-old said in that letter, look if someone had actually identified the problem when it started three years earlier I wouldn\u2019t have ended up in hospital. I wouldn\u2019t have ended up costing the state thousands of pounds and the anguish that I had. So it\u2019s about that early identification and talking about this issue. And if it\u2019s true of mental health, it\u2019s true in an even bigger way about care for the elderly. There\u2019s so much more our country could be doing for our grandmas and granddads, mum and dads, nuclease and aunts. And it\u2019s the same story. Just putting a £50 grab rail in the home stops somebody falling over, prevents them ending up in hospital with the needless agony, and all of the money that it costs. The 1945 Labour government, in really tough times, raised its sights and created the National Health Service. I want the next Labour government to do the same, even in tough times, to raise our sights about what the health service can achieve, bringing together physical health, mental health, and the care needs of the elderly: a true integrated National Health Service. That\u2019s the business of the future. But we don\u2019t just need to improve the health service, friends; we\u2019ve got to rescue it from these Tories.And the Liberals too. Now look, before the election, I remember the speeches by David Cameron. I remember one where he said the three most important letters to him were NHS. Well he has got a funny way of showing it, hasn\u2019t he? And when they came to office, they were still saying how brilliant was in the health service, how the health service was doing great things and the doctors and nurses and so on. Now have you noticed they have changed their tune recently? Suddenly they are saying how bad everything is in the NHS. Now the vast majority of doctors and nurses do a fantastic job. Sometimes things go wrong. And when they do, we should be the first people to say so. But hear me on this. The reason David Cameron is running down the NHS is not because the doctors and nurses aren\u2019t doing as good a job as they were before. It is because they have come to a realisation that the health service is getting worse on their watch and they are desperately thrashing around trying to find someone else to blame. Blame the doctors, blame the nurses, blame the last Labour government. That is what they are doing. Well let me tell you about the record of the last Labour government. When we came to office there were waiting time targets of 18 months that were not being met, when we left office there were waiting time targets of 18 weeks that were being met. When we came to office there was an annual winter A&E crisis, when we left office the people had A&E services they could rely on. When we came to office there were fewer doctors and nurses, we when left office more doctors and nurses than ever before. And when we came to office people said well the health service, it was a good idea in previous generations but I don\u2019t really believe it will be there in the next, and we left office with the highest public satisfaction in the history of the health services. Yes friends, we did rescue the National Health Service. So when you hear David Cameron casting around for someone to blame for what is happening in the NHS just remember it is not complicated, it\u2019s simple, it\u2019s as simple as ABC: when it comes to blame, it is Anyone But Cameron. We know who is responsible, the top-down reorganisation that nobody voted for and nobody wanted, the abolition of NHS Direct, the cuts to social care, the fragmentation of services. We know who is responsible for thousands of fewer nurses, we know who is responsible not just for an annual A&E crisis, but an A&E crisis for all seasons. It is this Prime Minister who is responsible. So friends it is the same old story, we rescue the NHS, they wreck the NHS and we have to rescue it all over again. And that is what the next Labour government will do. Right, I have explained to you how we can make Britain better by changing our economy and changing our society, and now I want to talk about how we change our politics. And here is the bit you have all been looking forward to: party reform. Now look let me say to you, change is difficult, change is uncomfortable. And I understand why people are uncomfortable about some of the changes, but I just want to explain to you why I think it is so important. With all of the forces ranged against us, we can\u2019t just be a party of 200,000 people. We have got to be a party of 500,000, 600,000, or many more. And I am optimistic enough \u2013 some might say idealistic enough \u2013 to believe that is possible. And the reason it is possible in our party is the unique link we have with the trade unions. The unique link. I don\u2019t want to end that link, I want to mend that link. And I want to hear the voices of individual working people in our party, louder than before. Because you see, think about our history. It is many of you who have been telling us that actually we haven\u2019t been rooted enough in the workplaces of our country. And that is what I want to change. And that is the point of my reforms. See my reforms are about hearing the voices of people from call centre workers to construction workers, from people with small businesses to people working in supermarkets at the heart of our party. Because you see it is about my view of politics. Leaders matter, of course they do, leadership matters, but in the end political change happens because people make it happen. And you can\u2019t be a party that properly fights for working people unless you have working people at the core of your party, up and down this country. That is the point of my reforms. And I want to work with you to make them happen so that we can make ourselves a mass-membership party. Friends, let\u2019s make ourselves truly the people\u2019s party once again. But to change our politics we have got to a lot more than that. We have got to hear the voices of people that haven\u2019t been heard for a long time. I think about our young people, their talent, their energy, their voices. The voices of young people demanding a job, the voices of young people who demand that we shoulder and don\u2019t shirk our responsibilities to the environment. The voices of gay and lesbian young people who led the fight and won the battle for equal marriage in Britain. And the voices of young people, particularly young women, who say in 2013 the battle for equality is not won. You see they are not satisfied that 33% of Labour MPs are women, they want it to be 50% and they are right. They are not satisfied that 40 years after the Equal Pay Act, we still do not have equal pay for work of equal value in this country. They are not satisfied and they are right. And they are not satisfied that in Britain in 2013, women are still subject to violence, harassment, and everyday sexism. They are not satisfied and they are right. Friends, let\u2019s give a voice to these young people in our party. And let\u2019s give a voice to these young people in our democracy, let\u2019s give the vote to 16 and 17 year olds and make them part of our democracy. But you know we have got to win the battle for perhaps the most important institution of all, our United Kingdom. Friends, devolution works. Carwyn Jones, our brilliant First Minister of Wales, he is showing devolution works. And let\u2019s praise the leadership of our Scottish Joanne Lamont for the brilliant job she is doing against Alex Salmond. Now that referendum on September the 18th 2014, it is going to be conducted on the basis of fact and figures and arguments and counterarguments, but I have a story I want to tell you which I think says even more. It\u2019s the story of Cathy Murphy. Cathy Murphy lives in Glasgow, she worked in the local supermarket. In 2010, Cathy was diagnosed with a serious heart problem, but she came to Labour conference nonetheless in 2011 as a delegate. She fell seriously ill. Her family were called down from Glasgow. The doctors said to her that to save her life they\u2019d have to give her a very long and very risky operation. She had that operation a few weeks later at the world-leading Liverpool Broadgreen hospital. Cathy pulled through. She went back to Glasgow some weeks later. She comes back down to Liverpool every six months for her check-up. Now she said to me the nurses and doctors don\u2019t ask whether she is English or Scottish, the hospital doesn\u2019t care where she lives. They care about her because she is Scottish and British, a citizen of our United Kingdom. Friends, Cathy is with us today, back as a delegate. Where is she? Cathy\u2019s here. Friends, I don\u2019t want Cathy to become a foreigner. Let\u2019s win the battle for the United Kingdom. So I have talked to you today about policy and what a Labour government would do, how it would make Britain better and win a race to the top in our economy, put our society back in touch with people\u2019s values and change our politics so it lets new voices in. But the next election isn\u2019t just going to be about policy. It is going to be about how we lead and the character we show. I have got a message for the Tories today: if they want to have a debate about leadership and character, be my guest. And if you want to know the difference between me and David Cameron, here\u2019s an easy way to remember it. When it was Murdoch versus the McCanns, he took the side of Murdoch. When it was the tobacco lobby versus the cancer charities, he took the side of the tobacco lobby. When it was the millionaires who wanted a tax cut versus people paying the bedroom tax, he took the side of the millionaires. Come to think of it, here is an even easier way to remember it: David Cameron was the Prime Minister who introduced the bedroom tax, I\u2019ll be the Prime Minister who repeals the bedroom tax. You see here is the thing about David Cameron. He may be strong at standing up to the weak, but he is always weak when it comes to standing up against the strong. That is the difference between me and David Cameron, so let\u2019s have that debate about leadership and character, and I relish that debate. And we know what we are going to see from these Tories between now and the general election, it is the lowest form of politics, it is divide and rule. People on benefits versus those in work. People in unions against those outside union. People in the private sector versus those in the public sector. People in the north against those in the south. It is the worst form of politics. Like sending vans into areas of Britain where people\u2019s mums and granddads have lived for years, generations, and telling people to go home. I say we are Britain, we are better than this. Telling anyone who\u2019s looking for a job that they are a scrounger. However hard they are looking, even if the work is not available. I say we are Britain we are better than this. So come on. So David Cameron I have got a message for you. You can tell your Lynton Crosby, it might work elsewhere, it won\u2019t work here. We\u2019re Britain, we\u2019re better than this. Friends, the easy path for politics is to divide, that\u2019s the easy part. You need to know this about me, I believe in seeing the best in people, not the worst. That\u2019s what I am about. That\u2019s how we create One Nation. That\u2019s how we make Britain better than this. That\u2019s how we have a government that fights for you. Now, it is going to be a big fight between now and the general election. Prepare yourself for that fight. But when you think about that fight, don\u2019t think about our party, think about our country. I don\u2019t want to win this fight for Labour; I want to win it for Britain. And just remember this, throughout our history, when the voices of hope have been ranged against the voices of fear, the voices of hope have won through. Those who said at the dawn of the industrial revolution that working people needed the vote and they wouldn\u2019t wait \u2013 they knew Britain could be better than this, and we were. Those that said, at the birth of a new century, those who said at the birth of a new century that working people needed a party to fight for them and the old order wouldn\u2019t do \u2013 they knew Britain could be better than this, and we were. Those who said at our darkest hour in the Second World War that Britain needed to rebuild after the war and said \u2018never again\u2019, they knew Britain could be better than this, and we did. Those who said, as the 20th Century grew old, that the battle for equality was still young; they knew Britain could do better than this, and we did. And so now it falls to us, to build One Nation, a country for all, a Britain we rebuild together. Britain\u2019s best days lie ahead. Britain can do better than this. We\u2019re Britain, we\u2019re better than this. I\u2019ll lead a government that fights for you.

aVBefore I say anything else, I\u2019m sure I speak on behalf of all Liberal Democrats when I say that our hearts and condolences go out to the family and friends of Alan Henning and David Haines for their tragic loss. These were good men. In the work they did they stood for hope and compassion \u2013 the things that everyone in this room believes are more important than anything else. We have to take on the cowards who took their lives. We have to defeat their barbarity to help protect the millions of people who now live under the threat and fear of these merciless killers. Britain will not be intimidated. We will not be divided. We will not allow this brutal organisation to pervert Islam. And to Isil we say this: All you have done is unite the people of Britain \u2013 Muslim and non-Muslim, people of all faiths and none \u2013 around a single aim. All you have done is give the British forces who are being deployed to Iraq \u2013 some of the best professionals in the world \u2013 a clear, single objective. We and our allies \u2013 including in the Middle East \u2013 are going to find you, we are going to destroy your bases, we will cut off your supplies, isolate you from your support \u2013 and for the sake of peace, democracy and the freedom of all those you terrorise, we are not going to stop until it\u2019s done. And let\u2019s also take this opportunity to pay tribute to our armed forces \u2013 including the RAF personnel who are being deployed over Iraq, as well as the many men and women helping fight dangerous threats across the world. Our immense gratitude should go without saying \u2013 but it\u2019s important we say it too. Al Murray \u2013 he of Pub Landlord fame \u2013 said a great thing on Trafalgar Square in the days leading up to the Scottish referendum. I was there stood in the crowd with thousands of others and it really stuck in my mind. He said that there is something wonderfully vague about being British. After all, he said, that\u2019s why we call ourselves Brit \u2013 ish. And it\u2019s true. You can be British as well as Scottish, English, Northern Irish, Welsh\u2026ish. At the same time you can be black, white, Asian, Indian, African, European, mixed, not-mixed. You can be gay, straight, bi-sexual, transgender. Christian, Muslim, Jewish, Hindu, Sikh, atheist. The Scottish referendum was not only momentous because it reaffirmed Scotland\u2019s place in the UK \u2013 and for that I will be eternally grateful for the unbelievable efforts of Willie, Alistair, Danny, Jo, Mike, Charles, Ming, the whole Scottish team\u2026 The Scottish referendum was also brilliant because it forced us to hold up a mirror and think about who we are. Four nations, yes, but also 64 million people with identities which are distinct yet overlapping, because these Isles of ours are among the most diverse and inclusive in the world. And yet something very un-British is taking root in our politics. A growing movement of people who want to pull us apart. Salmond, Farage, the bitter tribalism of left and right \u2013 in their different ways they\u2019re all doing the same thing. A growing pick-a-side politics, in a world of us-versus-them. Worried about your job? Your business? Your children\u2019s future? Your way of life? No matter, just blame Europe/Brussels/foreigners/immigrants/the English/the South/professional politicians/Westminster/big business/anybody claiming benefits/even onshore wind farms\u2026 Life is so simple when you know who \u2013 or what \u2013 to blame. It\u2019s seductive and it\u2019s beguiling. That much may even be proved tomorrow, if the people of Clacton give the UK Independence Party an MP. But resentment, the politics of fear, doesn\u2019t pay the bills or create a single job. Claiming to address people\u2019s acute anxiety about the modern world, it provides nothing but the false comfort of grievance. Dressed up as the politics of hope, it is in fact a counsel of despair. Why do you think I took on Nigel Farage in the TV debates at the European elections? Because I thought it would be easy? \u2013 me defending Britain\u2019s membership of the EU, him bashing Brussels. No, I did it for the same reason this party must now come out fighting: Because someone has to stand up for the liberal Britain in which we and millions of decent, reasonable people believe. For tolerance, compassion, openness, unity \u2013 the values this party holds so dear. Labour won\u2019t defend those values. Even after four years in opposition Labour have nothing to say \u2013 or have forgotten to say anything of any value on the economy. The Tories won\u2019t either. We heard all we needed to know last week: compassionate conservatism is dead and buried. If the Liberal Democrat voice is marginalised in British politics our country will be meaner, poorer and weaker as a result. We must not and cannot let that happen. We must make our voice heard. That\u2019s not easy these days. Disenchantment and anger towards the political class is now at an all-time high and, for a lot of people, we\u2019re included in that. The British people no longer feel an automatic deference to their politicians \u2013 and that\u2019s a good thing. Authority everywhere is challenged. And \u2013 in what might be the least fashionable statement made by any party leader this conference season \u2013 politicians of every party have fed this growing cynicism by exaggerating and overstating what government\u2019s can do. We\u2019ve all done it. I\u2019ve been there. When I apologised for the disappointment and anger caused by our inability to scrap tuition fees, I knew we could never, ever make that mistake again. And we won\u2019t. We understand that political parties must show by doing: our promise of more must be built on a record of delivery, not just words. So if you meet someone who doesn\u2019t believe we\u2019ll raise the personal allowance to £12,500, tell them how we already raised it to £10,500. If they\u2019re not persuaded we can help young people with their travel costs to college, tell them we\u2019ve created more apprenticeships than any Government since the war. If they\u2019re cynical about our promises to help with young children, tell them we\u2019re the first party ever to start providing free support to two year olds across the country, tax free childcare and free school meals for infants. And all of it while fixing our broken public finances \u2013 so they can be sure we\u2019ll finish balancing the books fairly too. Danny set it all out on Sunday: Eliminating the deficit in the first three years of the next parliament, and then bringing debt down steadily and sustainably. Running a budget that is balanced overall and \u2013 this is crucial \u2013 doing it in a way that allows us to invest in Britain\u2019s creaking infrastructure too. The Liberal Democrats will borrow less than Labour, but we\u2019ll cut less than the Tories. We\u2019ll finish the job, but we\u2019ll finish it in a way that is fair. And just as we are refusing to saddle our children with mountains of debt, we are determined to hand them on a clean planet too. Both parties in this Government promised we would stick to our green commitments, but it has taken constant pressure from the Liberal Democrats \u2013 not least Ed Davey \u2013 to hold the Tories to their word. And I can tell you now that a sustainable environment will remain at the heart of our vision for Britain\u2019s future \u2013 it\u2019s not green crap to us. A plan that is credible. A party which has learnt from our mistakes. A party proud to have delivered on the commitments we made on the front page of our last manifesto \u2013 remember this? \u2013 and a whole lot more. The biggest change in income tax in a generation \u2013 designed and delivered by Lib Dems. The biggest overhaul of our pensions system \u2013 designed and delivered by Lib Dems. The biggest amount of money going into early years education every year, more than any previous government \u2013 designed and delivered by Lib Dems. The biggest shake-up of parental leave, revolutionising the rules for mothers who want to work and fathers who want to stay at home \u2013 designed and delivered by Lib Dems. The biggest ever commitment to renewable energy \u2013 designed and delivered by Lib Dems. And one of the biggest, proudest achievements for all of us: giving gay couples the same right to marry as everyone else \u2013 designed and delivered by Lib Dems. That is an extraordinary record from anyone, let alone a party that had never been in government before, let alone at a time of upheaval and strife. So when you meet people who still aren\u2019t sure about us, ask them this: How will you judge us? By the one policy we couldn\u2019t deliver in government, or by the countless policies we did deliver in Government? Fixing Britain\u2019s shattered economy, making sure the recovery spreads to every part of the UK, cutting taxes for millions for people, investing in young children and protecting Britain\u2019s schools\u2026Judge us on that record. By the four years we worked tirelessly to make sure public services are safeguarded for future generations\u2026 The environment \u2013 safeguarded for future generations too\u2026Privacy, protected\u2026Civil liberties, defended\u2026Older people, treated with dignity. And all children \u2013 from before they even start at school \u2013 given a chance, so that they can all live out their dreams and all live their lives in full. Judge us on that record. And, while this party has learnt from our mistakes, can the same be said of our opponents? Ed Miliband is now promising a new Nirvana where everyone will be well-off, no one will be out of pocket, we don\u2019t need to cut government spending and the public finances will be miraculously fixed. Sounds great. How does he intend to deliver this? Well, he promised a rise in the minimum wage by 2020 \u2013 which was already going to happen. A one year limit on the increase in child benefit \u2013 which is already in place. And a cut in Ministerial pay \u2013 which this Government introduced in our first week in office. This is a man who was part of the government which wasted their chance and ruined the economy, destroying jobs and slashing incomes \u2013 and yet not a single word on the deficit. A man who was part of the government which obliterated trust in our immigration system \u2013 and yet not a word on how you rebuild it. So much for a radical plan from the official Opposition. David Cameron and George Osborne, meanwhile, say don\u2019t worry: immigration can be slashed, human rights redrawn, taxes lowered, the NHS protected, and we can have all the benefits of being in Europe while opting out of the bits we don\u2019t like. Every worry can be fixed with a big wave of the Union Jack. How do they intend to deliver that? Well, they\u2019ve quietly ditched their commitment to reduce net migration to tens of thousands. Conservative Ministers have dragged their feet in implementing Lib Dem border controls. They want to scrap the universal human rights Brits have enjoyed since the days of Winston Churchill. And they\u2019re prepared to jeopardise Britain\u2019s membership of the EU \u2013 and our prosperity with it \u2013 in order to appease their backbenchers. So much for a credible plan from the Conservative Party. And most astonishingly of all, they have chosen to single out the working-age poor to bear the brunt of the final years of deficit reduction, while refusing to ask the super-rich to make a single additional contribution\u2026 That\u2019s the people scraping by on the minimum wage. The jobseekers who\u2019ve found themselves temporarily down on their luck. The men and women trying to earn their way out of poverty, often working more than one job. \u2026And given the Conservatives are not planning a single tax increase, how will they pay for all their spending commitments? They will have no choice but to cut the services they have not protected like social care, policing, education \u2013 education \u2013 to the bone. No wonder they\u2019ve stopped claiming that we\u2019re all in it together. Say what you will about the Liberal Democrats\u2026We may no longer be untainted, as we were by the freedom of opposition\u2026 I may no longer be the fresh faced outsider\u2026But we still stand for a different kind of politics. Treating people like adults. Not shirking the difficult dilemmas this country faces, but confronting them head on. Not pretending there\u2019s a magic wand answer to every problem when there isn\u2019t. Not doing things just because they\u2019re popular. Not being afraid to court controversy when we have to stand up for something we believe. Trying, every day, to do what lies at the heart of politics at its best \u2013 decent people, driven by decent values, resolving problems which can only be resolved together for the good of all. So our mission now is to give people a reason to reject bitter, us-and-them politics, to shun the politics of blame and fear, and choose something better. To do that, we have to provide the one thing that so many people across Britain still lack and crave: Opportunity. Government can\u2019t do everything for you. It can\u2019t make life perfect \u2013 and no one should pretend it can. But government can strive to level the playing field so that you and your family can look to your future and see the chance to get on. No matter who you are. Opportunity for Everyone. If you can see that you have a fair chance to get on in life, you don\u2019t need to look for someone to blame. If you give people a sense of fair play\u2026The power to shape their own lives and that of their communities\u2026The chance to fulfil their talents, pursue their aspirations, regardless of the circumstances of their birth\u2026 The anger, the powerlessness will wane and the hope of a better future can take root. After the London riots three years ago, I commissioned some research into why some people had rioted and others had not. I\u2019ll never forget hearing about the young men and women who told the researchers: of course I didn\u2019t riot. They wanted to apply for apprenticeships. They\u2019d seen jobs they wanted and didn\u2019t want to ruin their chances. Give people a future and they won\u2019t trash the present. Give people hope and they turn their backs on fear. And yet Britain is still a place where opportunity is handed down like an heirloom, not spread around like a universal right. Educational achievement, professional advancement, wealth, life expectancy \u2013 all our measures of success are still umbilically tied to an individual\u2019s background rather than the talents they possess. So the question is: which political party can do something about it? Look, I\u2019m sure Ed Miliband and David Cameron would say that their parties are parties of opportunity \u2013 no one\u2019s against opportunity. But the point is: they can\u2019t deliver it for everybody. There is no opportunity without a stronger economy \u2013 to give people good jobs, business opportunities, the money to follow their dreams. That\u2019s why Labour is not the answer. And without a fairer society you can\u2019t create opportunity for everyone, instead of just those lucky few at the top. That\u2019s why the Conservatives are not the answer. Fairness without a strong economy does not work. A strong economy without fairness doesn\u2019t work either. And \u2013 as the last few weeks have now put beyond doubt \u2013 there\u2019s only one party with the head and the heart \u2013 the resolve and the compassion \u2013 to deliver both. To deliver opportunity for everyone \u2013 and it\u2019s us. It starts with giving people power over their lives. Powerlessness is the enemy of opportunity. It\u2019s why we care as passionately about civil liberties as we do about good schools. It\u2019s why blocking the so-called snooper\u2019s charter was as important as delivering a massive increase in free childcare. Because a Big Brother state which demands the storage of the websites you visit is as threatening to real freedom and opportunity as a state which fails to help toddlers get the support and care they need. And while we\u2019re on the subject\u2026 I say this to Theresa May: stop playing party politics with national security. Stop playing on people\u2019s fears simply to try and get your own way. Your Communications Data Bill was disproportionate, disempowering \u2013 we blocked it once and we\u2019d do it again. There are times when the state needs to keep its nose out of our lives, to give us the freedom to make the most of our lives. There are times when the state needs to extend a helping hand so that everyone can make the most of their lives. That is a smart, liberal, enabling state. And at its heart are powerful citizens. But, if there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learnt over the last four and a half years, it\u2019s that the hardest thing about being in power\u2026 Is getting vested interests to give up their hold on power. Just look at where we\u2019ve been thwarted. Giving people a democratic say over their lawmakers in the House of Lords \u2013 blocked by Labour and the Conservatives. A clean up of party funding to restrain the influence of big money \u2013 blocked by Labour and the Conservatives. The Conservatives have even told us in the most explicit terms: you can\u2019t have your Mansion tax because our donors won\u2019t wear it. So proud are they of this act of brazen self-interest they even wrote to wealthy homeowners boasting about it \u2013 in the hope of courting more cash. Within hours of the historic Scotland vote, when we were meant to be cracking on with the plan for further devolution \u2013 a plan that this party will not see hijacked, or diluted, or delayed\u2026 They were at it again. The Tories trying to impose an entirely self-serving system of Tory votes for English laws on the House of Commons, in order to give more say to their MPs. Labour ignoring the problem altogether in order to give more say to their MPs. Well they can both forget it: whatever reforms we do will be fair and right by the British people, and that will be guaranteed by our MPs. And they still simply cannot grasp that spreading opportunity means putting people in control \u2013 in Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales, and in communities up and down England too. We\u2019ve done a lot to release Whitehall\u2019s grip: by the time the election is called next year every single part of the UK \u2013 every nation, every City, our towns and villages \u2013 will all have more power than the day the Coalition was formed \u2013 just as we said. But I want us to go so much further, supporting strong, prosperous, empowered communities \u2013 able to shape their own futures. And to anyone who thinks that in the next parliament we should cut our losses and give up on our ambitions for real, meaningful political reform: no way. This country deserves better than the tawdry Westminster politics we get from Labour and the Tories \u2013 and I am going to keep hammering away at the system every single day, because bit by bit that system will break to let the people in. And if power is still hoarded at the centre, the ability for people to liberate themselves from the circumstances of their birth is still denied to too many people. I have fought tirelessly to instil opportunity in the earliest years of a child\u2019s life. Did you know Michael Gove raided the budget for much needed school places in order to fund his Free School obsession? Did you see the frenzied bile from the Tory Right against our plan to give young children at primary school a healthy meal at lunchtime? Have you ever heard the dated snobbery from some Conservatives against the value of vocational qualifications and good quality careers advice? Of all the faultlines which have opened up in this Coalition Government, the one that has been most revealing is the way in which self-proclaimed Conservative educational reformers sought to suffocate almost every single initiative designed to instil opportunity at an early age \u2013 for all children, not just some. A world class education system is one that releases the potential in all children, not just some. My mother worked as a teacher for children with dyslexia when myself, my brothers and sister were growing up. Those days it wasn\u2019t as readily recognised that very bright children can be hampered by learning difficulties which may obscure their talents, but don\u2019t make them any less bright. Those days countless children were discarded by the education system because children were not treated as individuals, they were expected to conform to the rigours of the classroom or be left behind. And my mother drummed into us what seems so obvious today. That you don\u2019t write anyone off. You don\u2019t overlook anyone\u2019s talents. Given half a chance, everyone can shine. For me, that is what our new commitment to expanding childcare to all two, three and four year olds is all about. That is what our new commitment to healthy lunches for all primary school children is all about. That is what our new commitment to helping with the travel costs faced by all college students is all about. That is what our new commitment to a qualified teacher in every classroom is all about. That is what protecting funding from cradle to college \u2013 even as we clear the deficit \u2013 is all about. Education. Opportunity. That is what the Liberal Democrats are all about. Almost exactly thirteen years ago Phil Willis and myself visited a number of schools in Denmark, Holland and Sweden. The idea of the Pupil Premium was born. Today it funds breakfast clubs; homework clubs; it helps involve parents who are otherwise disengaged. It gives teachers the time to focus on children, one on one. And the many wonderful, wonderful teachers I meet across the country, working in the noblest profession of all, tell me the ability to do that is priceless in unlocking the talents of every child. The thrill I get every time I hear from a teacher about how great they think the Pupil Premium is never diminishes \u2013 and it reminds me that in politics being clear about what you want and then doggedly, stubbornly working away until you make it happen is what really counts. We are the party of education and we always will be \u2013 because it is the driver of opportunity. Because if you want to spread opportunity you can\u2019t just stop at today. You have to think about tomorrow too. And for that same reason, our next manifesto will contain something I can guarantee you none of the others will: A commitment to five green laws. Laws that will commit British governments to reducing carbon from our electricity sector\u2026Create new, legal targets for clean air and water\u2026Give everyone access to green space\u2026 Massively boost energy efficiency and renewable energy\u2026 Prioritise the shift to green cars\u2026Bring an end to dirty coal\u2026 Because Liberal Democrats understand that opportunity for everyone means thinking not just of this generation, but of future generations too. There are two other big commitments I want to single out today. For me, they epitomise the way in which we are striving to spread opportunity wherever we can. And \u2013 while I\u2019m not going to get dragged into endless speculation about this or that red line in the event of another hung parliament \u2013 people do have a right to know what our priorities are. Forget talk of deals, let\u2019s just dwell on our values. This isn\u2019t about tactics in a negotiation, this is about what our values are and where we want to take the country. So the next priority I want to highlight is tax: raising the point at which you start paying income tax to £12,500. I know that some people think I bang on too much about our success in raising the personal allowance from where we found it \u2013 just under £6,500 \u2013 to £10,500. But I don\u2019t think we bang on about it enough. It is, in my view, quite remarkable that a party experiencing it\u2019s first stint in government, which only has 9% of the MPs in Westminster, should have succeeded in driving through the biggest and fairest transformation of our income tax system in a generation. If that isn\u2019t something to bang on about \u2013 loud and proud \u2013 I really don\u2019t know what is. Over 3 million people on low pay taken out of paying any tax at all. An £800 tax cut for over 24 million people. And with our new policy of an even higher allowance, nearly a million more people will pay no income tax, and 30 million people will be an additional £400 better off. Labour would never have made this change because it\u2019s all about liberating people through their own hard work rather than making them more dependent on an overweening state. The Conservatives couldn\u2019t have been more explicit that it wasn\u2019t their priority during our Budget negotiations where, year after year, it was frequently referred to as \u2018your tax cut, Nick\u2019. Apparently it\u2019s our tax cut in private, but it\u2019s their tax cut in public. In 2012 \u2013 I\u2019ll never forget this \u2013 Danny and I said: let\u2019s go further and faster to cut people\u2019s income tax. It\u2019s possible now, so why wait? George Osborne turned to me and said: I don\u2019t want to deliver a Liberal Democrat Budget. He insisted instead on the Tory bit of the Budget: a cut to the top rate of tax. I can\u2019t think of a better, simpler illustration of what sets the two coalition parties apart: Tories insisting on tax cuts for the few; Lib Dems insisting on tax cuts for the many. And, when they say now that they\u2019ve signed up to our plan to raise the personal allowance to 12.5k\u2026 just scratch beneath the surface. They\u2019re giving a tax cut worth four times as much to the highest earners. And who pays for their income tax cut? You do. It\u2019s no secret. The Conservatives told you last week what they want to do: Everything they promise will be paid for by cutting the support to the working age poor and cutting further and faster the money which goes to our schools, our police, our social care homes and other unprotected services. We, by contrast, have set out how we\u2019ll fairly fund the first step of raising the personal allowance to £11,000 in the first year of the next parliament. So the choice is clear: unfunded, unfair Tory tax cuts or Lib Dem tax cuts which are funded and fair. The difference is that they want to cut taxes for the wealthiest, paid for by the working age poor\u2026 We want to cut taxes for working people, paid for by the wealthiest. And then there\u2019s one more policy. One I care about passionately. Mental health. The second class status given to mental health in the NHS was the subject of the first question I ever asked at Prime Ministers Questions. I have campaigned to end the Cinderella treatment of mental health services ever since \u2013 because it threatens the opportunities available to hundreds and thousands of our fellow citizens. Anxiety, panic attacks, depression, anorexia, bulimia, self-harm, bi-polar disorder \u2013 these and many other mental health conditions are one of the last remaining taboos in our society, and yet they will affect one in four people. Much progress has been made \u2013 people now speak out in the way they never did before\u2026We have put mental health on the same legal footing in the NHS as physical health\u2026 We\u2019re massively expanding talking therapies and transforming the help children can get as they move into adulthood \u2013 but there\u2019s still a long, long way to go. I want this to be a country where a young dad chatting at the school gates will feel as comfortable discussing anxiety or depression as the mum who\u2019s explaining how she sprained her ankle. There are many brave campaigners who have been leading the way \u2013 not least our very own Paul Burstow and Norman Lamb who deserve medals for all the tireless work they have done in Government. Earlier this year I visited a group of young mental health service users to talk about their experiences of the care they received. They sat round in a circle, away from the television cameras, these brave, articulate young men and women, and with astonishing honesty and candour they told me \u2013 a complete stranger \u2013 all about the things they had been through. The despair, the shame, the bullying, the parents and siblings who didn\u2019t know how to cope with them. And for some of them, the very darkest thoughts imaginable, including attempts to take their own lives. And I heard about their recoveries too; their resolve; with the right treatment their determination \u2013 some of them just teenagers \u2013 to deal with their issues and live full and happy lives. If they can speak out to me\u2026 I can speak up for them. This morning I announced that next year, for the first time ever, we will introduce national waiting times for patients with mental health conditions. Labour introduced waiting times in physical health \u2013 we will do the same for the many people struggling with conditions that you often can\u2019t see, that we often don\u2019t talk about, but which are just as serious. So if you are waiting for talking therapies to help with your depression, you will be seen within six weeks \u2013 18 weeks at an absolute maximum \u2013 just as if you are waiting for an operation on your hip. If you are a young person experiencing psychosis for the first time, you will be seen within 2 weeks, something we are going to roll out across the country \u2013 just as if you suspect you have cancer. If you are having a breakdown, if you are thinking of harming yourself, for any emergency which takes you to A&E, you\u2019ll get the help you need \u2013 just as if you had gone to hospital with chest pains or following an accident. These are big, big changes. And in Government again the Liberal Democrats will commit to completing this overhaul of our mental health services \u2013 ending the discrimination against mental health for good. And while I know not everyone in the party is going to agree, I can tell you now: I want this smack bang on the front page of our next manifesto. One of a small number of top priorities. This is a great liberal cause. Let\u2019s be the first political party to give mental health the status it deserves. For the countless people who are suffering alone; who are failing to get the treatment they need on time and in the right way; who are being denied the chance to get on in their lives. For the families who are being strained to breaking point. For a Britain that is compassionate, open and leads the way. And to make sure this and all other care is properly funded, this week we have set out how we\u2019ll pay for the rising costs of our treasured NHS. Everyone now accepts it needs more money. And it\u2019s a good thing that all of the parties have chosen to talk about this at their Conferences. But it\u2019s still the case that only one party has spelt out a credible plan to pay for it. Not only will the Liberal Democrats protect the NHS Budget in real terms, we will raise an extra £1bn for it every year, by ending three different tax breaks which benefit the highest earners, including scrapping George Osborne\u2019s ludicrous shares for rights gimmick. And, once we have finished the job on the deficit and public spending is rising, we are committing ourselves to ensuring NHS spending rises too. Words in speeches are all well and good \u2013 we all love our NHS. But what it needs is money \u2013 and that\u2019s what the Liberal Democrats will guarantee. Friends, between now and the election our opponents will do everything they can to do us down \u2013 and we\u2019ll give as good as we get. All that\u2019s ok in the rough and tumble of politics. But what isn\u2019t ok is our motives being caricatured. Not me, not you, not our party, not our reasons for wanting to govern again. And we mustn\u2019t allow coalition to be caricatured either. This government has provided the country with the political stability without which the economic recovery and hundreds of thousands of new jobs would never have materialised. I often hear the Conservatives claim that the economic recovery is \u201cGeorge Osborne\u2019s recovery\u201d. \u2026Pretty rich coming from a Treasury where the person responsible for the really tough job of repairing the damage to our public finances is a Liberal Democrat\u2026And people know the truth: After the 2010 election, the Conservatives could not have formed a government and secured this economic recovery without the Liberal Democrats\u2026 and the Liberal Democrats could not have secured this economic recovery without the Conservatives. It\u2019s called Coalition \u2013 and in my judgement it is most likely Britain will have more in the future. That doesn\u2019t mean when there are real disagreements and disputes with our coalition partners we shouldn\u2019t talk about them. On the contrary \u2013 don\u2019t hold back. But that isn\u2019t the same as seeking to wash our hands of the whole thing \u2013 and that is something I will never do. Because I don\u2019t believe the British public would buy it for a second. They know we\u2019ve been in Government for this Parliament and we\u2019re not suddenly going to pretend that it had nothing to do with us. Because I\u2019m immensely proud of what we\u2019ve achieved and I don\u2019t want the Tories claiming all the credit for everything we\u2019ve done. And because I never lose sight of the fact that simply forming a successful coalition unlocks the grip on power of the old, establishment parties. It undermines the soulless pendulum swing of red/blue blue/red politics, and destroys once and for all their desperate claims that single party Government is the only kind of Government fit for our country. As someone who has grown more, not less, impatient with the establishment during my time in office, I have realised that what the vested interests would relish most is to eject us from office before our time is up. What disrupts those same vested interests most is seeing this Government through. So, however tempting it might be, we should never play our opponents game. I will not, no matter how much anyone goads me to do it, seek to distance us from the achievements of this Government, because it would only play into the hands of those who say we should never have been in Government at all. I believe \u2013 despite the febrile, angry mood of our times \u2013 there are millions of our fellow citizens who still long for a politics of reason, of fairness and of decency. In seven months the people of this country will need to make a choice. You can pick a Labour party which has learnt no lessons from the past and which \u2013 left to its own devices \u2013 will jeopardise the economy all over again. You can pick a Conservative party which doesn\u2019t share your values and which \u2013 left to its own devices \u2013 will make poor people poorer while it keeps cutting away at the services everybody needs. Ed Miliband \u2013 you might have forgotten what you did to our economy, but we have not. And the British people don\u2019t want a Labour government running their country, racking up debts for our children and grandchildren to pay. David Cameron \u2013 you can copy our ideas but you will never imitate our values. And the British people don\u2019t want a Conservative Government running their country which only looks after its own kind. It is left to our party, to us, to work our hearts out each and every day to give the people of Britain a stronger economy and a fairer society. We will do everything we can to ensure you and your family have the opportunities to get on. In that Britain we can defeat the politics of blame and grievance and fear. And we have seven short months to tell people, to show people: there is still a party that speaks to the decent, British values they hold. So let our opponents say what they will, after all the knocks, setbacks and bruises we will go to the country with our heads held high. Say what they will, we will go to the country with a plan that builds on everything we have achieved with a credible promise of more. Say what they we will, we are now the only party holding firm to decent, liberal values while anger and blame are on the rise. The only party refusing to trade in fear because we believe what the British people want desperately from their politics is hope. The only party who are as economically competent as we are socially fair \u2013 a party of the head and the heart, of compassion and resolve. The only party who says no matter who you are, no matter where you are from, we will do everything in our power to help you shine.

aVFriends, thank you so much for that incredible welcome and Rohi, thank you so much for that incredible welcome. Rohi, thank you so much for the way you introduced me and the way our family and you have contributed so much to our community. That was absolutely brilliant. Thank you very much. I am truly delighted to be invited to make this speech today, because for the past two weeks, as you\u2019ve probably known I\u2019ve had a very easy, relaxing time. Hardly anything of any importance at all has happened to me. You might have noticed in some of our newspapers they\u2019ve taken a bit of an interest in me lately. Some of the things I\u2019ve read are this. According to one headline \u201cJeremy Corbyn welcomed the prospect of an asteroid \u2018wiping out\u2019 humanity.\u201d Now, asteroids are pretty controversial. It\u2019s not the kind of policy I\u2019d want this party to adopt without a full debate in conference. So can we have the debate later in the week! Another newspaper went even further and printed a \u2018mini-novel\u2019 that predicted how life would look if I were Prime Minister. It\u2019s pretty scary I have to tell you. It tells us football\u2019s Premier League would collapse, which makes sense, because it\u2019s quite difficult to see how all our brilliant top 20 teams in the Premiership would cope with playing after an asteroid had wiped out humanity. So that\u2019s a no-no for sure! And then the Daily Express informed readers that \u2013 I\u2019m not quite sure how many greats there are here, but I think there are three or four - great-great-great grandfather, who I\u2019d never heard of before was a very unpleasant sort of chap who apparently was involved in running a workhouse. I want to take this opportunity to apologise for not doing the decent thing and going back in time to have a chat with him about his appalling behaviour. But then there\u2019s another journalist who had obviously been hanging around my street a great deal, who quotes: \u201cNeighbours often see him riding a Chairman Mao style bicycle.\u201d Less thorough journalists might just have referred to it as just a \u2018bicycle\u2019, but no. So we have to conclude that whenever we see someone on a bicycle from now on, there goes another supporter of Chairman Mao. Thus, the Daily Express has changed history. But seriously Conference it\u2019s a huge honour and a privilege for me to speak to you today as Leader of the Labour Party. To welcome all our new members. More than 160,000 have joined the Labour party. And more than 50,000 have joined since the declaration of the leadership and deputy leadership election results. I\u2019m very proud to say that in my own constituency, our membership as of last night had just gone over 3,000 individual members and 2,000 registered supporters. 5,000 people in my constituency. I want to say first of all thank you to all of the people of my constituency of Islington North and Islington North Labour party for their friendship, support and all the activities we\u2019ve done and all the help and support they\u2019ve given me in the past few weeks. I\u2019m truly grateful to you. Thank you very much indeed to everyone in Islington. Above I want to welcome all our new members to this party, everyone who\u2019s joined this party in this great endeavour. To change our party, change our country, change our politics and change the way we do things. Above all I want to speak to everyone in Britain about the tasks Labour has now turned to. Opposing and fighting the Tory government and the huge damage it is doing. Developing Labour\u2019s alternative. Renewing our policies so we can reach out across the country and win. Starting next year. In Wales. In Scotland. In London. In Bristol. In local government elections across Britain. I want to repeat the thanks I gave after my election to all the people who have served the Labour Party so well in recent months and years. To Ed Miliband for the leadership he gave our party, and for the courage and dignity he showed in the face of tawdry media attacks. And also for the contribution I know he will be making in the future. Especially on the vital issues of the environment and climate change. Thank you Ed. Thank you so much for all you\u2019ve done. And to Harriet Harman not just for her leadership and service, but for her commitment and passion for equality and the rights of women. The way she has changed attitudes and law through her courage and determination. The Equality Act is one of many testaments to her huge achievements. Thank you, Harriet, for everything you\u2019ve done and everything you continue to do. I also want to say a big thank you to Iain McNicol, our General Secretary, and all our Party staff in London and Newcastle and all over the country for their dedication and hard work during the General Election and leadership election campaigns. And also to all the staff and volunteers who are doing such a great job here this week in Brighton at this incredible conference we\u2019re holding. Thank you to all of them. They\u2019re part of our movement and part of our conference. Also I want to say a special thank you to the fellow candidates who contested the leadership election for this party. It was an amazing three month experience for all of us. I want to say thank you to Liz Kendall, for her passion, her independence, determination and her great personal friendship to me throughout the campaign. Liz, thank you so much for that and all you contribute to the party. I want to say thank you to Yvette Cooper for the remarkable way in which she\u2019s helped to change public attitudes towards the refugee crisis. And now for leading a taskforce on how Britain and Europe can do more to respond to this crisis. Yvette, thank you for that. And to Andy Burnham, our new Shadow Home Secretary, for everything he did as Health Secretary to defend our NHS \u2013 health service free at the point if use as a human right for all. I want to say thank you to all three for the spirit and friendship with which they contested the election. Thank you Liz. Thank you Yvette. Thank you Andy. I want to thank all those who took part in that election, at hustings and rallies all across the country. Our Party at its best, democratic, inclusive and growing. I\u2019ve got new people to thank as well. The talented colleagues working with me in the Shadow Cabinet and on Labour\u2019s front bench. An inclusive team from all political wings of our Party. From every part of our country. It gives us the right foundation for the open debate our Party must now have about the future. I am not leader who wants to impose leadership lines all the time. I don\u2019t believe anyone of us has a monopoly on wisdom and ideas - we all have ideas and a vision of how things can be better. I want open debate in our party and our movement. I will listen to everyone. I firmly believe leadership is about listening. We will reach out to our new members and supporters. Involve people in our debates on policy and then our Party as a whole will decide. I\u2019ve been given a huge mandate, by 59 per cent of the electorate who supported my campaign. I believe it is a mandate for change. I want to explain how. First and foremost it\u2019s a vote for change in the way we do politics. In the Labour Party and in the country. Politics that\u2019s kinder, more inclusive. Bottom up, not top down. In every community and workplace, not just in Westminster. Real debate, not necessarily message discipline all the time. But above all, straight talking. Honest. That\u2019s the politics we\u2019re going to have in the future in this party and in this movement. And it was a vote for political change in our party as well. Let me be clear under my leadership, and we discussed this yesterday in conference, Labour will be challenging austerity. It will be unapologetic about reforming our economy to challenge inequality and protect workers better. And internationally Labour will be a voice for engagement in partnership with those who share our values. Supporting the authority of international law and international institutions, not acting against them. The global environment is in peril. We need to be part of an international movement to cut emissions and pollution. To combat the environmental danger to our planet. These are crucial issues. But I also want to add this. I\u2019ve been standing up for human rights, challenging oppressive regimes for 30 years as a backbench MP. And before that as an individual activist, just like everyone else in this hall. Just because I\u2019ve become the leader of this party, I\u2019m not going to stop standing up on those issues or being that activist. So for my first message to David Cameron, I say to him now a little message from our conference, I hope he\u2019s listening \u2013 you never know: Intervene now personally with the Saudi Arabian regime to stop the beheading and crucifixion of Ali Mohammed al-Nimr, who is threatened with the death penalty, for taking part in a demonstration at the age of 17. And while you\u2019re about it, terminate that bid made by our Ministry of Justice\u2019s to provide services for Saudi Arabia - which would be required to carry out the sentence that would be put down on Mohammed Ali al-Nimr. We have to be very clear about what we stand for in human rights. A refusal to stand up is the kind of thing that really damages Britain\u2019s standing in the world. I have huge admiration for human rights defenders all over the world. I\u2019ve met hundreds of these very brave people during my lifetime working on international issues. I want to say a special mention to one group who\u2019ve campaigned for the release of British resident Shaker Aamer from Guantanamo Bay. This was a campaign of ordinary people like you and me, standing on cold draughty streets, for many hours over many years. Together we secured this particular piece of justice. That\u2019s how our human rights were won by ordinary people coming together. Ordinary people doing extraordinary things \u2013 that is how our rights and our human rights have been won. The Tories want to repeal the Human Rights Act and some want leave the European convention on Human Rights. Just to show what they\u2019re made of, their new Trade Union Bill which we\u2019re opposing very strongly in the House and the country, is also a fundamental attack on human rights and is in breach of both the ILO and the European Convention on Human Rights. Now I\u2019ve been listening to a lot of advice about how to do this job. There\u2019s plenty of advice around, believe me. Actually I quite like that.  I welcome that. I like to listen to advice, particularly the advice which is unwelcome. That is often the best advice you get. The people that tell you, \u201cyes, you\u2019re doing great, you\u2019re brilliant, you\u2019re wonderful\u201d. Fine. Thank you, but what have I got wrong? \u201cOh, I haven\u2019t got time for that.\u201d I want to listen to people. But I do like to do things differently as well. I\u2019ve been told never to repeat your opponents\u2019 lines in a political debate. But I want to tackle one thing head on. The Tories talk about economic and family security being at risk from us the Labour party, or perhaps even more particularly, from me. I say this to them. How dare these people talk about security for families and people in Britain? Where\u2019s the security for families shuttled around the private rented sector on six month tenancies - with children endlessly having to change schools? Where\u2019s the security for those tenants afraid to ask a landlord to fix a dangerous structure in their own homes because they might be evicted because they\u2019ve gone to the local authority to seek the justice they\u2019re entitled to? Where\u2019s the security for the carers struggling to support older family members as Tory local government cuts destroy social care and take away the help they need? Where\u2019s the security for young people starting out on careers knowing they are locked out of any prospect of ever buying their own home by soaring house prices? Where\u2019s the security for families driven away from their children\u2019s schools, their community and family ties by these welfare cuts? Where\u2019s the security for the hundreds of thousands taking on self-employment with uncertain income, no sick pay, no Maternity Pay, no paid leave, no pension now facing the loss of the tax credits that keep them and their families afloat? And there\u2019s no security for the 2.8 million households in Britain forced into debt by stagnating wages and the Tory record of the longest fall in living standards since records began. And that\u2019s the nub of it. Tory economic failure. An economy that works for the few, not for the many. Manufacturing still in decline. Look at the Tory failure to intervene to support our steel industry as the Italian government has done. So, as we did yesterday in conference, we stand with the people on Teesside fighting for their jobs, their industry and their community. The company has said that it will mothball the plant and lay the workers off, therefore it is not too late now, again, to call on the Prime Minister even at this late stage, this 12th hour, to step in and defend those people, like the Italian government has done. Why can\u2019t the British government? What is wrong with them? There\u2019s an investment crisis. Britain at the bottom of the international league on investment. Just below Madagascar and just above El Salvador.  So we\u2019re doing quite well! Britain\u2019s balance of payment deficit £100 billion last year. Loading our economy and every one of us with unsustainable debt for the future. And the shocks in world markets this summer have shown what a dangerous and fragile state the world economy is in. And how ill prepared the Tories have left us to face another crisis. It hasn\u2019t been growing exports and a stronger manufacturing sector that have underpinned the feeble economic recovery. It\u2019s house price inflation, asset inflation, more private debt. Unbalanced. Unsustainable. Dangerous. The real risk to economic and family security. To people who have had to stretch to take on mortgages. To people who have only kept their families afloat through relying on their credit cards, and payday loans. Fearful of how they will cope with a rise in interest rates. It\u2019s not acceptable. The Tories\u2019 austerity is the out-dated and failed approach of the past. So it\u2019s for us, for Labour to develop our forward-looking alternative. That\u2019s what John McDonnell started to do in his excellent speech to conference. At the heart of it is investing for the future. Every mainstream economist will tell you that with interest rates so low now is the time for public investment in our infrastructure. Investment in council housing, and for affordable homes to rent and to buy. John Healey\u2019s plan for 100,000 new council and housing association homes a year. To tackle the housing crisis, drive down the spiralling housing benefit bill and so to make the taxpayer a profit. A profit for the taxpayer because the benefit bill falls when the cost of housing falls. It\u2019s quite simple actually and quite a good idea. Investment in fast broadband to support new high technology jobs. A National Investment Bank to support investment in infrastructure. To provide finance to small and medium sized firms that our banks continue to starve of the money they need to grow. A Green New Deal investing in renewable energy and energy conservation to tackle the threat of climate change. The Tories of course are selling off the Green Investment Bank. They are simply not interested in this. This is the only way to a strong economic future for Britain. That\u2019s sustainable. That turns round the terrible trade deficit. That supports high growth firms and businesses. That provides real economic security for our people. The economy of the future depends on the investment we make today in infrastructure, skills, and schools. I\u2019m delighted that Lucy Powell is our new shadow Education Secretary.She has already set out how the education of every child and the quality of every school counts. Every school accountable to local government, not bringing back selection.We have aspirations for all children, not just a few. Now my first public engagement as Labour leader came within an hour of being elected. I was proud to speak at the \u2018Refugees Welcome\u2019 rally in London. I wanted to send out a message of the kinder politics we are pursuing and a caring society we want to achieve. I have been inspired by people across our country. Making collections for the refugees in Calais. Donating to charities. The work of Citizens UK to involve whole communities in this effort. These refugees are the victims of war - many the victims of the brutal conflict in Syria. It is a huge crisis, the worst humanitarian crisis in Europe since the Second World War. And globally it\u2019s the biggest refugee crisis there has ever been. But the scale of the response from the government, Europe and the international community isn\u2019t enough. And whilst the government is providing welcome aid to the region, especially in the Lebanon, we all know much more needs to be done. Because it\u2019s a crisis of human beings just like you and just like me looking for security and looking for safety. Let\u2019s reach out the hand of humanity and friendship to them. Now let me say something about national security. The best way to protect the British people against the threats we face to our safety at home and abroad is to work to resolve conflict. That isn\u2019t easy, but it is unavoidable if we want real security. Our British values are internationalist and universal. They are not limited by borders. Britain does need strong, modern military and security forces to keep us safe. And to take a lead in humanitarian and peace keeping missions - working with and strengthening the United Nations. On my first day in Parliament as Labour Leader it was a privilege to meet the soldiers and medics who did such remarkable work in tackling the Ebola crisis in Sierra Leone. There is no contradiction between working for peace across the world and doing what is necessary to keep us safe. Today we face very different threats from the time of the Cold War which ended thirty years ago. That\u2019s why I have asked our Shadow Defence Secretary, Maria Eagle, to lead a debate and review about how we deliver that strong, modern effective protection for the people of Britain. I\u2019ve made my own position on one issue clear. And I believe I have a mandate from my election on it. I don\u2019t believe £100 billion on a new generation of nuclear weapons taking up a quarter of our defence budget is the right way forward. I believe Britain should honour our obligations under the Non Proliferation Treaty and lead in making progress on international nuclear disarmament. But in developing our policy through the review we must make sure we all the jobs and skills of everyone in every aspect of the defence industry are fully protected and fully utilised so that we gain from this, we don\u2019t lose from this. To me, that is very important. And on foreign policy we need to learn the lessons of the recent past. It didn\u2019t help our national security that, at the same time I was protesting outside the Iraqi Embassy about Saddam Hussein\u2019s brutality, Tory ministers were secretly conniving with illegal arms sales to his regime. It didn\u2019t help our national security when we went to war with Iraq in defiance of the United Nations and on a false prospectus. It didn\u2019t help our national security to endure the loss of hundreds of brave British soldiers in that war while making no proper preparation for what to do after the fall of the regime. Nor does it help our national security to give such fawning and uncritical support to regimes like Saudi Arabia and Bahrain - who abuse their own citizens and repress democratic rights. These are issues we have to stand up on and also recognise in some cases they are using British weapons in their assault on Yemen. We have got to be clear on where our objectives are. But there is a recent object lesson in how real leadership can resolve conflicts, prevent war and build real security. It\u2019s the leadership, the clever and difficult diplomacy that has been shown by Barack Obama and others in reaching the historic deal with Iran. A deal that opens the way for new diplomatic efforts to resolve the conflict in Syria. The scale of the destruction and suffering in Syria is truly dreadful. More than a quarter of a million people killed. More than ten million driven from their homes. I yield to no-one in my opposition to the foul and despicable crimes committed by Isil and by the Assad government including barrel bombs being dropped on civilian targets. We all want the atrocities to stop and the Syrian people free to determine their own destiny. But the answer to this complex and tragic conflict can\u2019t simply be found in a few more bombs. I agree with Paddy Ashdown when he says that military strikes against Isil aren\u2019t succeeding, not because we do not have enough high explosives, but because we do not have a diplomatic strategy on Syria. That\u2019s the challenge for leadership now, for us, for David Cameron. The clever, patient, difficult diplomacy Britain needs to play a leading role in. That\u2019s why Hilary Benn and I together are calling for a new United Nations Security Council resolution that can underpin a political solution to the crisis. I believe the UN can yet bring about a process that leads to an end to the violence in Syria. Yesterday\u2019s meetings in New York were very important. Social democracy itself was exhausted. Dead on its feet. Yet something new and invigorating, popular and authentic has exploded. To understand this all of us have to share our ideas and our contributions. Our common project must be to embrace the emergence of a modern left movement and harness it to build a society for the majority. Now some media commentators who\u2019ve spent years complaining about how few people have engaged with political parties have sneered at our huge increase in membership. If they were sports reporters writing about a football team they\u2019d be saying: \u201cThey\u2019ve had a terrible summer. They\u2019ve got 160,000 new fans. Season tickets are sold out. The new supporters are young and optimistic. I don\u2019t know how this club can survive a crisis like this.\u201d We celebrate the enthusiasm of so many people, old and young, from all communities. In every part of the country. Joining Labour as members and supporters. And we need to change in response to this movement. Our new members want to be active and involved. Want to have a say in our Labour Party\u2019s policies. Want to lead local and national campaigns against injustice and the dreadful impact of Tory austerity. Want to work in their local communities to make people\u2019s lives better. They don\u2019t want to do things the old way. Young people and older people are fizzing with ideas. Let\u2019s give them the space for that fizz to explode into the joy we want of a better society. They want a new politics of engagement and involvement. Many of them are already active in their communities, in voluntary organisations, in local campaigns. And we\u2019ve convinced them now to take a further step and join our Labour Party. What a tremendous opportunity for our Labour Party to be the hub of every community. The place where people come together to campaign. To debate, to build friendships, to set up new community projects. To explain and talk to their neighbours about politics, about changing Britain for the better. That\u2019s going to mean a lot of change for the way we\u2019ve done our politics in the past. Our new Deputy Leader Tom Watson is well up for that challenge. He\u2019s leading the charge and leading the change of the much greater use of digital media as a key resource. That is the way of communication, it is not just through broadsheet newspapers or tabloids, it\u2019s social media that really is the point of communication of the future. We have got to get that. One firm commitment I make to people who join our Labour Party is that you have a real say, the final say in deciding on the policies of our party. No-one - not me as Leader, not the Shadow Cabinet, not the Parliamentary Labour Party - is going to impose policy or have a veto. The media commentariat don\u2019t get it. They\u2019ve been keen to report disagreements as splits: agreement and compromise as concessions and capitulation No. This is grown up politics. Where people put forward different views. We debate issues. We take a decision and we go forward together. We look to persuade each other. On occasions we might agree to disagree. But whatever the outcome we stand together, united as Labour, to put forward a better way to the misery on offer from the Conservatives. There\u2019s another important thing about how we are going to do this. It\u2019s a vital part of our new politics. I want to repeat what I said at the start of the leadership election. I do not believe in personal abuse of any sort. Treat people with respect. Treat people as you wish to be treated yourself. Listen to their views, agree or disagree but have that debate. There is going to be no rudeness from me. Maya Angelou said: \u201cYou may not control all the events that happen to you, but you can decide not to be reduced by them.\u201d I want a kinder politics, a more caring society. Don\u2019t let them reduce you to believing in anything less. So I say to all activists, whether Labour or not, cut out the personal attacks. The cyberbullying. And especially the misogynistic abuse online. And let\u2019s get on with bringing values back into politics. So what are our first big campaigns? I want to start with a fundamental issue about democratic rights for Britain. Just before Parliament rose for the summer the Tories sneaked out a plan to strike millions of people off the electoral register this December. A year earlier than the advice of the independent Electoral Commission. It means two million or more people could lose their right to vote. That\u2019s 400,000 people in London. It\u2019s 70,000 people in Glasgow. Thousands in every town and city, village and hamlet all across the country That\u2019s overwhelmingly students, people in insecure accommodation, and short stay private lets. We know why the Tories are doing it. They want to gerrymander next year\u2019s Mayoral election in London by denying hundreds of thousands of Londoners their right to vote. They want to do the same for the Assembly elections in Wales. And they want to gerrymander electoral boundaries across the country. By ensuring new constituencies are decided on the basis of the missing registers when the Boundary Commission starts its work in April 2016. Conference we are going to do our best to stop them. We will highlight this issue in Parliament and outside. We will work with Labour councils across the country to get people back on the registers. And from today our Labour Party starts a nationwide campaign for all our members to work in every town and city, in every university as students start the new term, to stop the Tory gerrymander. To get people on the electoral register. It\u2019s hard work - as I know from 10 years as the election agent for a marginal London constituency. But now we have new resources. The power of social media. The power of our huge new membership. Conference, let\u2019s get to it. Get those people on the register to give us those victories but also to get fairness within our society. And, friends, we need to renew our party in Scotland. I want to pay tribute today to our leader in Scotland, Kezia Dugdale and her team of MSPs in the Scottish Parliament. I know that people in Scotland have been disappointed by the Labour Party. I know you feel we lost our way. I agree with you. Kezia has asked people to take another look at the Labour Party. And that\u2019s what I want people across Scotland to do. Under Kezia and my leadership we will change. We will learn the lessons of the past. And we will again make Labour the great fighting force you expect us to be. We need to be investing in skills, investing in our young people \u2013 not cutting student numbers. Giving young people real hope and real opportunity. Conference, it is Labour that is the progressive voice for Scotland. There\u2019s another big campaign we need to lead. David Cameron\u2019s attack on the living standards of low paid workers and their families through the assault on tax credits. First, remind people over and over again David Cameron pledged during the election not to cut child tax credits. On the Question Time Leader\u2019s debate he said he had rejected child tax credit cuts. It\u2019s a shocking broken promise - and the Tories voted it through in Parliament just two weeks ago. How can it be right for a single mother working as a part time nurse earning just £18,000 to lose £2,000 to this broken promise? Some working families losing nearly £3,500 a year to this same broken promise. And how can it be right or fair to break this promise while handing out an inheritance tax cut to 60,000 of the wealthiest families in the country?  See the contrast So we\u2019ll fight this every inch of the way. And we\u2019ll campaign at the workplace, in every community against this Tory broken promise. And to expose the absurd lie that the Tories are on the side of working people, that they are giving Britain a pay rise. It was one of the proudest days of my life when cycling home from Parliament at 5 o\u2019clock in the morning having voted for the national minimum wage legislation to go through. So of course it\u2019s good to see a minimum wage. But the phoney rebranding of it as a living wage doesn\u2019t do anyone any good. And the Institute of Fiscal Studies has shown Cameron\u2019s broken promise mean millions of workers are still left far worse off. They can and must be changed. As I travelled the country during the leadership campaign it was wonderful to see the diversity of all the people in our country. And that is now being reflected in our membership with more black, Asian and ethnic minority members joining our party. Even more inspiring is the unity and unanimity of their values. A belief in coming together to achieve more than we can on our own. Fair play for all. Solidarity and not walking by on the other side of the street when people are in trouble. Respect for other people\u2019s point of view. It is this sense of fair play, these shared majority British values that are the fundamental reason why I love this country and its people. These values are what I was elected on: a kinder politics and a more caring society. They are Labour values and our country\u2019s values. We\u2019re going to put these values back into politics. I want to rid Britain of injustice, to make it fairer, more decent, more equal. And I want all our citizens to benefit from prosperity and success. There is nothing good about cutting support to the children of supermarket workers and cleaners. There is nothing good about leaving hundreds of thousands unable to feed themselves, driving them to foodbanks that have almost become an institution. And there is nothing good about a Prime Minister wandering around Europe trying to bargain away the rights that protect our workers. As our Conference decided yesterday we will oppose that and stand up for the vision of a social Europe, a Europe of unity and solidarity, to defend those rights. I am proud of our history. It is a history of courageous people who defied overwhelming odds to fight for the rights and freedoms we enjoy today. The rights of women to vote. The rights and dignity of working people; Our welfare state. The NHS - rightly at the centre of Danny Boyle\u2019s great Olympic opening ceremony. The BBC. Both great institutions. Both under attack by the Tories. Both threatened by the idea that profit comes first, not the needs and interests of our people. That\u2019s the difference between us and the Tories. So let me make this commitment. Our Labour Party will always put people\u2019s interests before profit. Now I want to say a bit more about policy \u2013 and the review that Angela Eagle has announced this week. Let\u2019s start by recognising the huge amount of agreement we start from, thanks to the work that Angela led in the National Policy Forum. Then we need to be imaginative and recognise the ways our country is changing. In my leadership campaign I set out some ideas for how we should support small businesses and the self-employed.That\u2019s because one in seven of the labour force now work for themselves. Some of them have been driven into it as their only response to keep an income coming in, insecure though it is. But many people like the independence and flexibility self-employment brings to their lives, the sense of being your own boss. And that\u2019s a good thing. But with that independence comes insecurity and risk especially for those on the lowest and most volatile incomes. There\u2019s no Statutory Sick Pay if they have an accident at work. There\u2019s no Statutory Maternity Pay for women when they become pregnant They have to spend time chasing bigger firms to pay their invoices on time, so they don\u2019t slip further into debt. They earn less than other workers. On average just £11,000 a year. And their incomes have been hit hardest by five years of Tory economic failure. So what are the Tories doing to help the self-employed, the entrepreneurs they claim to represent? They\u2019re clobbering them with the tax credit cuts. And they are going to clobber them again harder as they bring in Universal Credit. So I want our policy review to tackle this in a really serious way. And be reflective of what modern Britain is actually like. Labour created the welfare state as an expression of a caring society \u2013 but all too often that safety net has holes in it, people fall through it, and it is not there for the self-employed.  It must be. That is the function of a universal welfare state. Consider opening up Statutory Maternity and Paternity Pay to the self-employed so all new born children can get the same level of care from their parents. I\u2019ve asked Angela Eagle, our Shadow Business Secretary, and Owen Smith, our Shadow Work and Pensions Secretary, to look at all the ways we can we support self-employed people and help them to grow their businesses. And I want to thank Lillian Greenwood, our Shadow Transport Secretary for the speed and skill with which she has moved policy on the future of our railways forward. It was wonderful to see Conference this morning agree our new plan to bring private franchises into public ownership as they expire. Labour\u2019s policy now is to deliver the fully integrated, publicly owned railway the British people want and need. That\u2019s the Labour policy, that\u2019s the one we\u2019ll deliver on. Housing policy too is a top priority. Perhaps nowhere else has Tory failure been so complete and so damaging to our people. In the last parliament at least half a million fewer homes built than needed. Private rents out of control. A third of private rented homes not meeting basic standards of health and safety. The chance of owning a home a distant dream for the vast majority of young people. There\u2019s no answer to this crisis that doesn\u2019t start with a new council house-building programme. With new homes that are affordable to rent and to buy. As John Healey, our Shadow Housing Minister, has shown it can pay for itself and make the taxpayer a profit by cutting the housing benefit bill by having reasonable rents, not exorbitant rents And we need new ideas to tackle land hoarding and land speculation. These are issues that are so vital to how things go forward in this country. I want a kinder, more caring politics that does not tolerate more homelessness, more upheaval for families in temporary accommodation. A secure home is currently out of reach for millions. And John Healey has already made a great start on a fundamental review of our housing policies to achieve that. And we are going to make mental health a real priority. It\u2019s an issue for all of us. Every one of us can have a mental health problem. So let\u2019s end the stigma. End the discrimination. And with Luciana Berger, our Shadow Minister for Mental Health, I\u2019m going to challenge the Tories to make parity of esteem for mental health a reality not a slogan. With increased funding \u2013 especially for services for children and young people. As three quarters of chronic mental health problems start before the age of 18. Yet only a quarter of those young people get the help they need. All our work on policy will be underpinned by Labour\u2019s values. End the stigma, end the discrimination, treat people with mental health conditions as you would wish to be treated yourself. That\u2019s our pledge. Let\u2019s put them back into politics. Let\u2019s build that kinder, more caring world. Since the dawn of history in virtually every human society there are some people who are given a great deal and many more people who are given little or nothing. Some people have property and power, class and capital, status and clout which are denied to the many. And time and time again, the people who receive a great deal tell the many to be grateful to be given anything at all. They say that the world cannot be changed and the many must accept the terms on which they are allowed to live in it. These days this attitude is justified by economic theory. The many with little or nothing are told they live in a global economy whose terms cannot be changed. They must accept the place assigned to them by competitive markets. By the way, isn\u2019t it curious that globalisation always means low wages for poor people, but is used to justify massive payments to top chief executives. Our Labour Party came into being to fight that attitude. That is still what our Labour Party is all about. Labour is the voice that says to the many, at home and abroad: \u201cyou don\u2019t have to take what you\u2019re given.\u201d Labour says: \u201cYou may be born poor but you don\u2019t have to stay poor. You don\u2019t have to live without power and without hope. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to set limits on your talent and your ambition - or those of your children. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to accept prejudice and discrimination, or sickness or poverty, or destruction and war. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be grateful to survive in a world made by others. No, you set the terms for the people in power over you, and you dismiss them when they fail you.\u201d That\u2019s what democracy is about. That has always been our Labour Party\u2019s message. You don\u2019t have to take what you\u2019re given. It was the great Nigerian writer Ben Okri who perhaps put it best: \u201cThe most authentic thing about us is our capacity to create, to overcome, to endure, to transform, to love\u201d. But they\u2019re at it again. The people who want you to take what you\u2019re given. This Tory government. This government which was made by the few - and paid for by the few. Since becoming leader David Cameron has received £55 million in donations from hedge funds. From people who have a lot and want to keep it all. That is why this pre-paid government came into being. To protect the few and tell all the rest of us to accept what we\u2019re given. To deliver the £145 million tax break they have given the hedge funds in return. They want us to believe there is no alternative to cutting jobs. Slashing public services. Vandalising the NHS. Cutting junior doctor\u2019s pay. Reducing care for the elderly. Destroying the hopes of young people for a college education or putting university graduates into massive debt. Putting half a million more children in poverty. They want the people of Britain to accept all of these things. They expect millions of people to work harder and longer for a lower quality of life on lower wages. Well, they\u2019re not having it. Our Labour Party says no.The British people never have to take what they are given. And certainly not when it comes from Cameron and Osborne. So Conference, I come almost to the end of my first conference speech, and I think you for listening OK, alright, don\u2019t worry. Listen, I\u2019ve spoken at 37 meetings since Saturday afternoon, is that not enough? Well talk later. So I end conference with a quote. The last bearded man to lead the Labour Party was a wonderful great Scotsman, Keir Hardie who died about a century ago this weekend and we commemorated him with a book we launched on Sunday evening. Kier grew up in dreadful poverty and made so much of his life and founded our party. Stood up to be counted on votes for women, stood up for social justice, stood up to develop our political party. We own him and so many more so much. And he was asked once summaries what you are about, summarise what you really mean in your life. And he thought for a moment and he said this: \u201cMy work has consisted of trying to stir up a divine discontent with wrong\u201d. Don\u2019t accept injustice, stand up against prejudice. Let us build a kinder politics, a more caring society together. Let us put our values, the people\u2019s values, back into politics. Thank you.
