VMr. Bird, ladies and gentlemen, - I am deeply grateful to you for this resolution, and for the manner in which it has been proposed and seconded. The proposer is known to all England as, though not in Parliament, much more important than most members of Parliament as being President of the National Liberal Federation; and as for the seconder, I fold the returning prodigal to my arms. Gentlemen, I should be vain and I should be mistaken if I took more than a very small part of this resolu­tion as being devoted to myself. The task of legislation, the hard work of the Government, falls mainly on my colleagues in the Commons, and among those colleagues who have all done strenuous and admirable work, we must all enthusiastically give the first place to the Chancellor of the Exchequer who has laboured so brilliantly and so effectively for the Government, and who in so doing has left so perma­nent a mark on the financial legislation of the country. Now, gentlemen, this meeting, I suppose, represents that break-up of the Liberal Party which is so frequent a theme of Conservative orators, and lately of Mr. Balfour himself. But in any case it is difficult to feel that this is not a memorable occasion, for we meet on the battlefield. We meet on the field where the first blow is to be struck, for, as you know, your great Welsh measure is the first that we put in the front of our pro­gramme. But, gentlemen, if it be memorable to you it is much more memorable to me. It is more than six and twenty years since I first visited Cardiff - since I was last in Cardiff - when I came to the coming of age of my old college friend, Lord Bute. Well, one feels almost like a Rip Van Winkle when one reads the figures of the progress that you have made in the meantime. When I was last here you had a popula­tion of 40,000. I come back and find you with a population of 150,000. When I was last here your rateable value was about £150,000, and it is now over £860,000. And as for your shipping, I cannot get the figures of the year when I was here in 1868, but ten years before that your shipping amounted to a million and a half tons, and now it amounts to no less than 15 million tons. Such progress resembles the progress of one of the American cities of the West. It is a proud and pleasing reflection for the inhabitants and the citizens of Cardiff to see so rapid a progress, combined with so material and splendid a result.The Functions of the FederationBut, gentlemen, this visit is memorable to me for another reason, and it is this: It is the first time that I have been privileged to address the National Liberal Federation, and on such an occasion I cannot help asking - What are the purposes and functions of that Federation? I take it that your first and your most important function is this: To thrash out the various issues that lie before the Liberal Party. For that purpose you must discuss many questions, and you must look far ahead. That task is comparatively easy, because you are bound and circumscribed by no limit. You might, if you choose, survey the whole field of human endeavour, and mark out in each department what to promote and what to avoid, and no one could blame you. But after this task of thrashing out, there comes a ranch more delicate and difficult operation, and that is, the operation of winnowing - an opera­tion which has to be performed before every Session by that committee which you call the Cabinet, and which is subject to all those influences which Mr. Thomas has so graphically described. Now, gentlemen, the Cabinet have to select from a vast field the Bills which they think should be brought forward in the Session. This is always an arduous task, but it is especially arduous for the present Government. We have inherited a vast programme of measures of first-rate import­ance. That has been inherited by us, not simply from various meetings of the Federation and various declarations of our leaders, but also from the inherent necessities of the case, because it has been our task to adapt to existing circumstances the new state of things created by the Reform Bill of 1884, to accommodate the new wine of that Reform Bill and the new spirit to the old bottles of the Constitution; and I venture to say that that is a very arduous and a heavy piece of work. Now, this programme as it stands now, without any addition, would require many energetic years in which a strong Government, supported by a united and powerful Liberal Party, would have to do their best to carry into effect. But what is sometimes forgotten is this - that we cannot pass all the measures of this programme simul­taneously; that we cannot bring them all into line, and that we cannot order a simultaneous advance like the last charge of our army at Waterloo without limiting the Session to a barren record of first readings.The Campaign against the House of LordsI would further ask you to remember that in addition to this pro­gramme we have entered upon a long foreseen and inevitable cam­paign, a campaign which has been coming nearer to us day by day, and year by year, until we can no longer honourably avoid it - I mean the campaign against the House of Lords. That campaign alone would tax the energies of the Liberal Party at its best, because it cannot fail to be long, it cannot fail to be arduous, and you will need all your energies to surmount the difficulties which it involves. This, then, is our position as regards objects. What is our position as regards means? Remember, gentlemen, that very few measures of the first class can be carried through in a single Session, even by a Tory Government. Well, you laugh, but a Tory Government has in one way much greater facilities for the business of legislation than we have, because whereas we have to deal with two Chambers, one of which is permanently hostile, the Tory Government has only got to deal with one. That being the case, we have to consider whether, with the barrier of the House of Lords permanently placed against Liberal legislation, we shall give the House of Com­mons an opportunity of passing Liberal measures, though certain that they must meet with disaster elsewhere, or whether we shall bow our neck to the yoke of the House of Lords and only introduce those Bills which we think their lordships are likely to pass. (\u2018Never!\u2019) Gentlemen, it is a very easy thing to say \u2018Never,\u2019 but if you do not consult the susceptibilities and the attitude of the House of Lords the Liberal Government stands a very good chance of ending its Session as a barren Session, and that, in my opinion, is one of the intolerable disabilities, and one of the intolerable degradations which make our campaign against the House of Lords inevitable.Bills of the First ClassI say then that the task of winnowing is difficult. But we know also the bewildering amount of oratory which every Bill of the first class entails. It almost seems to me as if an enormous amount of debating and speaking is considered the due of a Bill of the first class, very much in the same way as an Indian prince of very high rank is entitled to a greater salute of artillery than a prince of lower rank, and, I must confess, I much wish that some of our Bills of the first rank could in respect of debating be treated as Bills of a lower rank. We know, then, that a great multiplicity of speeches and of repeated speeches is considered necessary to every Bill of the first class. And we know the creaking and the groaning of the old constitutional machine when it is turning out any great measure. We know also the number of complicated stages through which, by the wisdom of Parliament, every measure has to be sifted and strained before it can hope to arrive at any good result; and therefore you must bear in mind, when our pro­cess of winnowing is going on, that there are only very few measures of the first class that we can hope to pass even through the House of Commons, and fewer still to pass the House of Lords. I do not think that the country and the Liberal Party are sufficiently alive to the con­siderations that I have laid before you; for, whilst this process of winnowing is going on, all Cabinet Ministers are subject to a bombard­ment of correspondence - and I venture to say that the correspondence of even Cabinet Ministers on this point would yield in multiplicity to that of our excellent Welsh whip, Mr. Ellis, but we, at any rate, are bom­barded by appeals, some of them menacing, some of them coaxing and cajoling, but all of them extremely earnest, and praying that the par­ticular hobby of the writer shall be made the first Government Bill. Well, gentlemen, from our correspondence we might gather that each article of the programme was equally urgent and supreme, and each article of the programme equally incapable of postponement.Pleas for the First PlaceAny delay in pushing forward each measure that has been recorded in what is called the Newcastle programme implies, we are told, the alienation of all the earnest and thoughtful members of the Liberal Party - in fact, the backbone of the Liberal Party. And I have come to the conclusion that the Liberal Party is extremely rich in backbones. I do not suppose that it can have too many backbones, but my correspondence makes me feel that there is a multiplicity of backbones in the Liberal Party, all preparing to be alienated if certain measures are not pushed forward. Well, I frankly tell you that I do not believe all this; I do not believe that the earnest and thoughtful Liberals are always ready to take this kind of action. I believe that the earnest and thoughtful Liberals watch the political barometer, and the courses and currents, sometimes even in silence; and would even go so far in the extremity of their forbearance as to give some measure of confi­dence to the Government in laying out the plan of campaign. After all, the Government, owing to these means and to others, has exceptional means of information, and the Government has more to lose than any other body of men by miscalculation: for they have the responsibility, and on them will be laid the blame. These then being the difficulties of our position in the process of winnowing, I think it much better to lay them frankly and freely before this assembly which includes the National Liberal Federation - a body which, at any rate, may claim to be distinctively composed of earnest and thoughtful Liberals - for I believe that there is no policy so fatal as that which is popularly, but I believe wrongly, ascribed to the ostrich, which, when it sees the pressing peril, is supposed to bury its head in the sands, and to have thereby thought to have got rid of the danger when it passes out of its range of vision. These are our difficulties, but these are the difficulties of wealth and affluence, wealth of ideas and affluence of energy, and they are difficulties in their nature nearly akin to sources of strength, and it is only that they may be mitigated in their power that I lay them before this assembly tonight.\u2018A Fraudulent Raree Show\u2019The difficulties of our opponents are very different in their nature. Those are not their difficulties - the difficulties of an affluence of ideas and a superfluous wealth of energy. Their difficulties are those of sterility and barrenness. If it would not be disrespectful to them, I should like to say that their present condition reminds me of a fraudu­lent raree show at a country fair. You are invited to step up. There is the big partner with the big drum, there is the junior partner with the pan-pipes, and there is the handy young man from over the way with a bushel of programmes ready to hand to every passer-­by. So, sir, the bewildered voter or the bewildered passer-by is enticed by these promises to enter the tent, and is somewhat disap­pointed to find nothing inside.The Last Tory ProgrammeWhat, indeed, is the last programme that was laid before us by the last Conservative leader who has spoken? It was Mr. Balfour, at Manchester, who gave it you, and he said that there were three points - cardinal points - of their policy. The first was the mainten­ance of the Empire. I should like to know in what respect this Government has fallen short of its duties in respect of the Empire? The next was to have Socialist legislation, without the last syllable and to call it social legislation. Well, I should like to know what Conservative Government is likely to do as much as we have done in the way not merely of social legislation but of social administration. And the last task of the Conservative Government would be the preservation of institutions from destruction. What institution is it that we propose to destroy? Why, gentlemen, we have distinctly announced that we do not propose to touch the House of Lords, we only propose to adjust the relations of that body with the House of Commons.We should be told, I suppose, that we propose to destroy churches - but we do not propose to destroy churches, though we do purpose to remove two churches from the position of unjust predominance which in our opinion they ought not to occupy. If then, I may draw any deduction from Mr. Balfour\u2019s speech it would be this, that the process of winnowing with the Conservative party will not be a difficult one, but with us, on the other hand, it is what the French call an embarrassment of riches. Now, gentlemen, that process of winnowing is still going on, and I therefore cannot state to you tonight what the exact results of it may be. But on one or two points I may state quite plainly what the position may be assumed to be.A Business ProgrammeIn the first place we are anxious that the programme of business for 1895 should be a business programme. We are anxious, therefore, to announce at the commencement of the Session in the Queen\u2019s Speech only those measures which we see a reasonable prospect of passing. I myself think that it is quite rational and proper for a Government with a small majority, and for which both its friends and its opponents prophesy but a short lease of existence - as was our case in 1892 - I quite admit that for such a Government it is proper in their first Queen\u2019s Speech not so much to limit themselves to what is practicable from a business point of view, as to lay before Parliament what they hope to effect if only life and health be given them. But I think if life and health be given, if life be prolonged and health be given, it is objectionable to repeat that process - because the Government are pledged to the policy, and it is unnecessary on each occasion to repeat those pledges. What we have then to do is to lay before Parliament a list of those measures which we think can be, and should be, passed in the current Session. To do more than that is to confuse the public issues and the minds of the people at large - so I ask you to remember, when you come to read and to hear that document, that the principle and basis on which it is framed is that of being a busine\u000a\u000a\u000a\u000ass statement of a business programme.Welsh and Scotch DisestablishmentMy second point is this - that that limitation of the Queen\u2019s Speech does not affect you. You stand first on the list - I am not sure that that announcement would be received so warmly in every part of the United Kingdom. I am afraid that in my own native country of Scotland there are some heartburnings at the precedence given to Wales. They are heartburnings expressed in a genial and friendly spirit, but they are still heartburnings of that nature which Mr. Thomas has so graphically described. Now, gentlemen, I do not think that that complaint is unnatural, but, on the other hand, my fellow countrymen must remember what is our position. It is impossible for us to pass two Disestablishment Bills through the House of Commons in one Session, mere especially when we remember the certain fate which awaits both of them in the House of Lords. All we can do, having given precedence to Wales, for reasons which I explained to my fellow countrymen at Glasgow, all that we can do is to give a clear and tangible proof that our policy in respect to Scottish Disestablishment is tangible and unchanged. Well, I promised at Glasgow that I would endeavour to effect that, if it could be done without any sacrifice of Parliamentary time. To do that I only see one possible course. There is a Bill of Sir Charles Cameron\u2019s, an excellent Bill, which has been drawn for the purposes of Scottish Disestablishment. A Government would no doubt prefer - because, I take it, it would be a more proper and a more dignified course - to introduce a Bill of their own, but if, as I think must be the case, the Government are unable to do this, and if no better method of giving effect to their wishes arise, they will be prepared to adopt Sir Charles Cameron\u2019s Bill as their own, and so to lay before the Scottish people, before a dissolution occurs, a practical measure of Disestablishment in its broad scope (reserving the right of freedom as to details) which they in due course, if life and health once more be given them, will be prepared to present to Parliament.The General Question of DisestablishmentWe now come to the general question raised by both Scotland and Wales with respect to Disestablishment. It seems to me that there are three points of view from which Establishments may be regarded. There is, first, the clear, hard, logical school, which regards all prefer­ence given by the public or the State, or the public in its character of the State, to any form of faith as injudicious, derogatory and degrad­ing both to the State and to the Church. It holds that there should be absolute religious equality, and that each church should be supported by its own adherents. That is a general proposition which it is difficult to dispute, and which, if we were beginning with a clean slate, there would probably be none found to dispute.A Question of \u2018National Option\u2019But, as we are not beginning with a clean slate, there is a. second school which regards the question of Church Establishments as a question of national option. It holds that it is a question for the decision of the nation which is affected, and that if it be really the national wish to recognise religion in the shape of Establishment, there is nothing absolutely immoral in the carrying out of that wish. It is quite possible that a Church may be happier, freer, more power­ful, if you will, without the fetters of Establishment. But if, on the other hand, the mass of the nation holds to a Church Establish­ment as it exists, and does not wish to disturb it, this second school, of which I have spoken, holds that there is nothing immoral in a nation carrying out its wish. When you recollect in how many worse ways money may be spent by the public, it is perhaps not an unreason&\u000a\u000ashy;able proposition. You might, for example take the case of Spain, where the nation is practically at one in its religious creed, and I do not think that even the most zealous Disestablisher would say that there is anything absolutely incongruous or immoral in the wish of the Spanish nation to give some support to ministers of religion, whom all equally obey. Well, my creed on this point is very simple indeed, and it applies to much more than to Church Establishments.The \u2018Church\u2019 and the \u2018Establishment\u2019To my mind, the Church and the Establishment are two perfectly distinct matters. The Church is too high for me to discuss tonight; the Establishment is not too high. An ecclesiastical establishment, like other establishments, must rest upon the deliberate will of the people, or it rests upon nothing. That I believe to be sound doctrine. That was the doctrine and basis on which the Irish Church was dises­tablished. It was a missionary church that converted nobody. It was an alien church that alienated everybody. It kept for a minority what was meant for the nation. And so, coming as it did as a stranger to Ireland, and repudiated by the mass of the nation, it passed away. You know another Church Establishment which embodies these characteristics - and which in like manner is doomed. I may be asked, in reference to this doctrine, do churches, does religion, does the Christian faith rely upon the chance will and vote of the majority of the people? That is the question I shall be asked by people in whom warmth of heart hardly compensates for confusion of head. My reply is simply, No! The Church does not rely on such a majority - but the Establishment does.The \u2018Church\u2019 and the \u2018State\u2019Now, we hear much in these days about the State. This, that, and the other is to be provided by the State; as if the State were a beneficent fairy with a private gold mine at its disposal. Gentlemen, you know as well as I do that the State for all those purposes is only the nation under another name. If the State, that is the nation, is to provide any of these things, it is the nation, that is the State, which will have to pay for them; and if it is the State, that is the nation, which is to establish and countenance a religion, it is the nation, that is the State, which will have to support it. Well, under these circum­stances, when you consider the matter in this cool and abstract way, when you remember that an establishment can only exist by the will of the State, and that the State only means the nation, the talk of an establishment long continuing against the will of the nation is as if you spoke of water running permanently uphill. There are no doubt temporary circumstances - circumstances temporary in their nature - which enable establishments to exist for a longer time against the will of the nation than they otherwise would; those I will discuss in a moment.The Cry of \u2018Robbery and Sacrilege\u2019Besides these two schools of thought from which Disestablishment is regarded, there is a third, with which you are familiar in the Princi­pality, which regards Disestablishment as robbery and as sacrilege. I have never understood what the application of these words may be. As to robbery, if the State, that is, if the nation, chooses to apply funds for one purpose I suppose it has an equal right to divert and set them apart for another. It is what the State is constantly doing. It is what the Charity Commissioners do, I will not say daily, but certainly monthly and yearly, and have been doing for the last thirty years. What it has done with these endowments the State, I suppose, may do with another. We all remember what the State did once with these endowments. How it took them at the time of the Reformation and banded them from the old Church, not all of them to the Reformed Church, but to the barons, great and small, to the adherents of the Court, to the laity, many of whom are ardent Conservatives now, but who in their blind enthusiasm for Church Establishment have not, so far as I know, proffered any restitution of this alienated money. Gentlemen, the State took them and then assigned them, and that in my phraseology was an act of national option, which may be repeated at any moment. If, therefore, I am correct in my reading of these endowments, and if my statement as to the Reformation is correct, it is not wise for the defenders of the Establishment to rest too much on the rights of property, because if the right of indefeasible property rests with anyone it rests not with the Reformed Church, but with the Roman Catholic Church. But we shall be told that that is a question of robbery, a wrongful diversion from one Church to another, but that if you intend to secularise this property, it is nothing less than sacrilege.Bishop Thirlwall and \u2018Sacrilege\u2019Well, sacrilege is a hard word. I will not attempt to give you my own opinion on the point, but I remember hearing Bishop Thirlwall, one of the greatest bishops of our generation, make a speech in the House of Lords on this subject, and I shall make you no apology for reading an extract from it. \u2018I must own,\u2019 said Bishop Thirlwall, \u2018that in this sense the phrase, "robbery of God," grates upon my ear. It seems to me to correspond to a view of the Deity which is neither Christian nor even Judaical, but heathenish. When I open the Old Testament I find several passages, familiar, I have no doubt, to your lordships, in which the Jewish people are severely reproved for cherish­ing the vain and superstitious notion, common to the heathen nations around them, that material offerings might be accepted by the Most High as supplying some want of the Divine nature. My lords, when I read those passages, when I read others in the New Testament, in which the sacrifices with which God is well pleased are described, together with the nature of a pure religion or worship, I am led to the conclusion that no material offerings are so acceptable to the Almighty as those which are most beneficial to man. Let me suppose a case not wholly imaginary to illustrate my meaning. A wealthy and muni­ficent gentleman builds a magnificent cathedral in Dublin. A wealthy and munificent lady builds a public market in London. My lords, I believe that each of those acts was, in the intention of the donor, an offering to God, and I believe each of them to have been an equally acceptable offering to Him. But let me suppose that a fund had been bequeathed to be appropriated at the discretion of a trustee to one or the other of those purposes, I should like to know on what principle the decision of that trustee - if he were worthy to exercise so important a trust - ought to depend. I think I shall have the assent of your lordships when I say that his decision ought to depend not on the superior sanctity of the destination, but on the local need or the general usefulness. It is not a question between God and man, but between one kind of gift beneficial to society and another. My lords, the word \u201csacrilege\u201d\u2019 has been heard very often of late in this House, and I must say its use reminds me of some instructive pages in the history of the early Christian Church. The cry of \u201csacrilege\u201d was raised against St. Ambrose; and it was raised by a party with which, I am sure, neither any of my right rev. brethren, nor the noble lord the chairman of committees (Lord Redesdale), feel the slightest sympathy - the Arians. And on what ground was this cry raised? Why, be­cause St. Ambrose had sold the sacred vessels of the church of Milan in order to apply the proceeds to the profane purpose of ransoming prisoners who had fallen into the hands of the Goths. My lords, in my opinion, that was not the least meritorious or the least holy act of that holy man\u2019s life. And observe, what does it imply? It implies that - in the opinion of one who was undoubtedly a very sincere Christian, and not at all a Low Churchman - circumstances might arise in which Church property, even while it continued to be capable of serving its original purpose, might be rightly and fitly diverted to another and a wholly different use. I am not saying that in this case such circumstances have arisen, but what I say is that the possibility of such circumstances arising, if that be admitted, at once transfers the question to the broad ground of general expediency and common utility. It shows that such expressions as "sacrilege" and "robbery of God" applied to this subject are as irrelevant and misapplied as they are irritating and offensive.\u2019 I think I need say no more on the question of sacrilege. Ireland and DisestablishmentBut we are also told that Disestablishment unchristianises the State; that it removes the recognition by the State of Christianity in religion, and in that way unchristianises the State. Well, all I can say is this, that if that be true the State must be in a very bad way. If a State is in reality Christian, it certainly does not need the outward symbol of an Establishment to prove it, and if a State is not Christian an Establishment is merely an hypocrisy and a sham. Why, gentle men, how about Ireland? We heard all these prophecies about Ireland and all these statements about Ireland, when the Church was Disestablished. Has Ireland ceased to be Christian? Has Ireland lost the vigour of either of her Churches - the Church to which the mass of the people belong, or the two other Churches, Protestant Churches, which are in the minority? These Churches were never so vigorous. Never did Ireland so richly deserve her old title of the island of saints. And at this moment she is not satisfied with her own development within her own borders, but she has lately sent out, perhaps with more zeal than judgment, one of her Protestant Archbishops to consecrate a Protestant Bishop in Spain. I argue then that a Church which relies on Establishment stands by that confession self-condemned. A Church may very well argue that it is better off for having material and independent sources of revenue at command. No one can blame its champions for defending these revenues as long as they can, so long as their arguments are not carried too far either in scope or in style.The Essence of a ChurchBut though I understand the pain which Disestablishment causes to many excellent and devout people, they must remember this, that no great reform can be carried out without great pangs, and great wrenchings, and great searchings of heart, and great lookings back - aye, and as the result of looking back, as we have experienced in the Liberal Party, a considerable number of pillars of salt. But to contend that these material supplies or the privilege of seats in the House of Lords are necessary to the life and the vigour of a Church is to make a fatal confusion between the essence and the incidents of a Church. The essence of a Church is spiritual; the inspiration, the tradition, the gracious message, the Divine mission, the faith that guides us through the mystery of life to the mystery of death - all these were produced in poverty, in a manger, in the cot of the carpenter. They flourished under persecution. Nothing can be so remote from their essence and their spirit as the wealth, or power, or dignities of this world. Establishment and endowment at most represent the gifts of the laity to the temple - the ornaments, the rich essences, the corn and wine and oil which depend for their merit on the willingness and enthusiasm of the offerers, but which lose all value and all significance when they are wrung out against the will of the people.Is the Welsh Church an Alien Church?Then, gentlemen, the question arises: Is the State Church in Wales an alien Church? I know that some of your pastors and masters are very fond of chopping figures on this question. They spend a good deal of time in that, and their powers of calculation are so marvellous that they seem to be a kind of spiritual Babbages, although I confess I am not always able to follow them in their computations. Every man who is not for us is reckoned against us. Every man who does not vote at a Parliamentary election is reckoned as a zealous, though silent, defender of the Church - as one who in his zeal preferred to remain by his own fireside to encoun­tering the discomforts of the polling-booth. So, also, every per­son, every man, woman, or child, who is not a member of one of the four great Nonconformist bodies in Wales, whether he be a Roman Catholic or belong to some other Dissenting body, is reckoned as a sheep in the fold of the Establishment. Now, these are mysteries to me. I hope they serve the cause of truth, but I, at any rate, shall not discuss them. So far as I am concerned, they do not concern me; they in no wise affect my opinion on this question. For me, I am content to take, as we do in most other cases, the Parliamentary repre­sentation as a test of feeling on this question, and Parliamentary representation, you will remember, elected mainly, or even solely, on this question of Church Disestablishment. Whatever may have been the imperial issues presented to the Welsh people since 1880, no one, I think, will contend that any has taken precedence or even occupied so large a part of the mind of the electors as this question of the con­tinued existence of the State Church in Wales. Then, if we are allowed to take the Parliamentary representation as a test of the real strength of the State Church army in Wales, we come to those remarkable figures - and they are the only figures with which I will trouble you. What is the result of the last four General Elections? In 1880 you had four defenders of the State Establishment. In 1885 you had four. In 1886 they rose to the magnificent total of five. But I am sorry to say that at the last election they had undergone a humiliating reduction to three. Well, gentlemen, I do not know that I am to take these figures as the permanent view of Wales upon this question. (\u2018Yes!\u2019) Oh, you say \u2018Yes,\u2019 but you have to watch the signs of the times.The Methods of Church DefendersYou are not perhaps aware that a great constitutional party, under the guidance of a great constitutional Duke, dealing with a great constitutional question, in a great constitutional way, have met together in a London palace to organise funds and to select candidates for the battle that is about to take place on the question of the Established Church in Wales. A subscription was opened, and while there were some munificent contributions, I will not hurt the feelings of the promoters by hinting at what I am informed was the result of the popular subscription. Now, gentlemen, I agree with you in laughing at all that. It is chiefly remarkable for the light which it throws on the view which a great constitutional party takes of the great constitutional rule - that peers should in no way, direct or indirect, interfere in Parliamentary elections. This at any rate is clear - that a Church Establishment in Wales is an alien Church - and that if you had to deal with that Church Establishment in a National Council of Wales, that Church Establishment would be lost in a week. Well, I contend that a Church in that position is not so placed that it can ever benefit the nation among which it serves or the Church itself, or even the cause of religion itself. It tends to alienate each day the people still further from the Church, and it may even tend, in the heat of party passion, to give some minds a disgust for religion so protected and so endowed. Then there is this further curse upon an Establishment in this position, namely, that those who have to defend it against the nation which repudiate it are forced to impugn the nation itself; they are forced to do that which Mr. Burke with all his genius declared to be impossible for him to do, namely, to draw an indictment against the nation. On the other hand also, they are forced to appear in the invidious and disagreeable light of defending not the spiritual, but the material claims of their Church. And in that way these ministers of a religion which is meant, ordained, to bring peace among nations and goodwill among men, are the unhappy and involuntary, and, I doubt not, the unwilling, agents for bringing, not peace, but strife to the nation in which they live.Why the Church SurvivesBut you may ask how, if the State Church is so alien, does the nation tolerate it; and if the Establishment depends on the will of the nation that surrounds it, how is it that the Establishment manages to survive? I am afraid there are two causes for that. The first is the House of Commons. If your 34 members were left alone to settle this question, as I have already said, you would make short work of the Church Establishment. But unfortunately you have only a small representation in the House of Commons, which comprises 670 members, and therefore your turn for legislation comes but seldom. It is hard for the 34 - and I again appeal to Mr. Thomas - it is hard for the 34 to direct the attention of the other 636 members to what concerns those members in so slight a degree. And it is hard for the representatives of the other 37 millions of population which are com­prised in the United Kingdom to give the first and the foremost place to a measure which affects only a million and a half.The Government\u2019s Welsh RecordI may remark, however, in an aside, \u2018You have not done so badly under a Liberal Government.\u2019 I will only refer, in a word, to the sterling services which Mr. Acland, who, I think, is more than half a Welshman, has rendered to Wales and to Welsh Education. Then you have a Land Commission, which is not merely a pledge of policy, but a good Land Commission in itself. And lastly, you have had the first position given to your Church Bill during the next Session. So, I do not think the Liberal Government has done badly, or your 34 mem­bers either. But what is the result of this calculation? That the Church Establishment which you repudiate is kept in existence, when a Tory Government is in, entirely by English votes. Irishmen vote with you for its Disestablishment; Scotsmen vote with you for its Disestab­lishment, and the maintenance of the Establishment of Wales is con­fided not merely to the three valiant beings of whom I have spoken, but is really supported by English members of the House of Commons, who represent places south of the Humber. And while you are badly placed, my native country of Scotland is worse placed, because you sometimes get a Bill which applies to you in common with Eng­land, but we in Scotland are so situated by law and character, and by language, perhaps, that we invariably require a separate Bill for our­selves. Domestic legislation then bids fair to stand still sometimes, both in Scotland and in Wales.\u2018A Large Measure of Devolution\u2019But this leads me to a point on which I must say a word. I, for my part, would gladly see both these ecclesiastical questions settled in Scotland and in Wales. That would be much more satisfactory to all parties concerned, both to you who are affected by these Establishments, and to those members of the House of Commons who are not directly affected by them. After all, there are no questions which are so local or lie so near to inhabitants as these ecclesiastical questions. If you pass the Tweed northward, you leave Episcopacy and you go into Presbyterianism. If you cross the Marches into Wales you find Epis­copacy indeed in a somewhat frail condition, but you find Nonconfor­mity as a predominant fact, and if you cross the Channel into Ireland you will find largely predominant there the Roman Catholic faith. I think therefore I am justified in saying that in these four kingdoms or princi­palities which constitute the United Kingdom there are no questions so local as these ecclesiastical questions. The more I see of our politi­cal system the more I am convinced of this, that in a large measure of devolution, subject to Imperial control, lies the secret of the future working of our Empire. Daily also, in my opinion, that devolution comes nearer and nearer. For the last few years much of the work of Parliament has consisted in handing over business to local representa­tive institutions. You have now representative bodies as before in towns, in counties, in villages, and in parishes; as the people get more and more familiarised with this idea, the easier you will find its exten­sion; and only in some further devolution, subject as I have said to the Imperial Parliament, will you find it possible to work that vast and com­plicated organisation which is called the British Empire. It has been by such a system of devolution that we have been able to found, out­side these kingdoms, the greatest Empire that the world has ever seen, and we shall find in the same principle the solution of many, if not most, of our difficulties inside. In that respect the cause of Ireland stands first but not last. The Liberal Party, in my opinion, will never find its full strength until it has enlisted all the power and sympathy and freedom which it would gain in every part of the United Kingdom by the systematised devolution of local business to the localities themselves. Well, that is as much as I can say on that head.The House of LordsBut there is another and more permanent barrier which opposes itself to your wishes in respect to Welsh Disestablishment. I need not mention to this assembly the attitude of the House of Lords. You know how it treats Welsh matters; how it treats those Welsh popular schemes of education which have been sent up to it during the past two Sessions. I have no time tonight to deal with the House of Lords - and there really is not the slightest necessity for my doing so. In the first place, I have said freely and frankly in speeches, which you may have read, at Bradford, at Glasgow, and at Devonport, all that is in my mind on that subject; and, in the second place, it is not necessary to say it to you, because it is not necessary to preach to the converted. So long as things are as at present the cause on which you have set your heart has no chance of passing the House of Lords. It would be rejected by the House of Lords by a majority of exactly the same proportion as that by which your Welsh represen­tatives would pass it if it were left to them. Well, gentlemen, the House of Lords is indeed the supreme question of the hour, and all that I will say upon it tonight is this - it is the supreme question of the hour because it covers and underlies simultaneously so many of the ques­tions in which you are interested. All I will say on it to­night is this - that as treated by our opponents it is a mysterious question. When it was first raised the House of Lords was a sacred institution, on behalf of which they were prepared to shed the last drop of their blood. But the gyrations of the Tory Party on that ques­tion have since been very remarkable. The constitution of the House of Lords is now universally allowed to be faulty and defective, while at the same time it is described as a necessary bulwark of property, and the last observation is that it is a necessary bulwark for the de­fence of popular rights. Yes, gentlemen, its latest apologist, and a very intelligent man he is - Professor Albert Dicey - calls it the pro­tector of the rights of the nation. Besides that, its function, as it seems, is to test the mandates that are given to the Liberal Party by the country, and to refer all Liberal Bills, and, if possible, all Liberal mem­bers back to the constituencies that returned them. I have not, I be­lieve, exhausted its functions, but these have become in the course of discussion so multifarious and so remarkable that I am sometimes beginning to wonder where these functions begin and where they end. And - but I must warn you here that I am speaking ironically - I am sometimes led to wonder if it is not the House of Commons that really ought to be done away with. But at any rate you may ask me this: why is it, if this question is so supreme and so important, that you do not submit your resolution at once to the judgment of Parliament, and then to the judgment of the people? I will give you only one reason for that, and that reason is sufficient: because if it is submitted to the judgment of Parliament it must at once be submitted to the judgment of the people, and that its submission to Parliament involves an instant dissolution.\u2018I Want to get Something More Done for the People\u2019But before this good Parliament is sent about its business I want to get something more done for the people. Your Welsh, your Scottish questions - your Welsh, my Scottish questions - even Irish questions only interest, as a rule, a comparatively small section of the community, but there are other and further measures which interest every section of the community and I for one should see with regret the Liberal Party seeking re-election without attempting to deal with them. I put first, not in order, but for convenience, the question of the control of the liquor traffic, which is so burning a question all over the country. Well, then, there is another question. I regard it as a great discredit to Parliament that while we have democratised the suffrage, and while we boast of our anxiety that representatives of the working classes shall be seen in abundance in the House of Commons, we have not made their entry any cheaper or any easier than it was before we made that change. I for one should deeply regret if we met the constituencies again without having made an attempt to deal with that question. And lastly - I do not by any means exhaust the questions, but I take the three that come first to my mind - last of all there is that question which is popularly called \u2018One Man, One Vote,\u2019 without which that democratic suffrage to which I have alluded is in many constituencies little better than a mockery and a sham. Gentlemen, you may ask me how before a dissolution we are to get all these. My reply to that is that your fate is in your own hands. It lies with you to give the force and the impulse, and the propelling power which alone can enable a Liberal Government to pass Liberal measures. I, for my part, do not ask you for enthusiasm. I do not even desire it. Enthusiasm is a quick-burning flame, it is a feverish humour which is apt to die out as quickly as it rose, and leave behind it nothing but ashes and reaction. But what I do ask is this, that, while we do your work inside Parliament, you shall give us your cordial, your hearty, and your strenuous support outside Parliament, that you be not led away by every empty wind of vain doctrine, by every breath of gossip or of doubt, that you do not give yourself over to political sloth or political scepticism, but that you stand by the Government that is willing to stand by you. This support we ask, and indeed claim, at your hands, and I believe in the coming Session, and for the rest of this Parliament, and at the general election when it comes, we shall abundantly receive it.

aVMr. Walker, ladies and gentlemen.  It is very difficult in this great assembly to feel as disheartened as one ought.  And I have not merely the right of a Liberal to feel disheartened, but I feel that I come among you in a somewhat perilous capacity, for I cannot altogether divest myself of the character of an official Liberal.  I have been an official Liberal; and though, as you, sir, justly said, I am not very anxious to be an official Liberal again, yet I fear that the fragrance of that character clings round me still.  Now, we know that that is a position of some suspicion.Questions of OrganisationIt would be affectation to ignore the fact that we have recently had much good advice from unexpected quarters as to the conduct of this National Liberal Federation.  It is said that the serpent of officialdom has crept into the garden of Eden which had been hitherto unsullied by any such reptile. Well, all I can say is, that if the serpent has crept in I suspect he got his head very considerably bruised. My experience of officialdom and of the National Liberal Federation is that it is a relation in which officialdom plays a very subordinate part.  If I had ever expressed a secret hope on the subject, it is that official­dom had sometimes a little more to do with the National Liberal Federation than it has.  At any rate, I have not been often let into its secrets.  I remember two occasions on which the National Liberal Federation took the bit between its teeth and, certainly uninspired by officialdom, took very remarkable action.  The first occasion was when it made at Newcastle a programme, a very celebrated expression of faith which, I confess, was in my opinion too long for practical pur­poses.  I see Dr. Spence Watson sitting there.  I hope he will forgive me for saying so, but it was not the officials who imposed that pro­gramme on the National Liberal Federation - it was the National Liberal Federation who imposed it on the officials with all its con­sequences, good and evil. When I was an official - very much of an official - I woke up one morning and saw in the papers that the National Liberal Federation had decided to hold a conference on the subject of the House of Lords.  I do not believe that a single official of the Government knew of that purpose except through the newspapers, yet it was a very momentous decision.  It gave great impetus to a great cause; yet I am very certain that, if the officials had been consulted, it would not have taken place at that precise moment.  Well, that is all I have to say, about officials and the National Liberal Federation. I have one word to say on your proceedings as far as I know of them. The Federation has not come here, as I understand, to promulgate a policy or a programme, nor have I come here tonight to promulgate a policy or a programme. Nor have I even come to recite the Liberal creed.  There has been a little too much recital of the Liberal creed.  It has this fatal disadvantage, that, supposing there to be thirty-nine articles of the Liberal creed - as there are of other creeds - and you only mention thirty-seven in your recital, you are at once denounced as being un­sound on the other two, and therefore an enumeration of the full Liberal creed has got to be a fatiguing thing for the speaker and the audience.  It is not the time now to tell our political beads.  We have a different course before us from promulgating an active policy.  We have before us a course of opposition, possibly long, which involves intelligent, vigilant, active, honourable, and far-sighted criticism.  I think you, too, will admit the validity of these epithets.  But may I say a word on the last?  I say far-sighted criticism because I want you, when you criticise, to look ahead to the time when you will have to be criticised, and that you shall not adopt in opposition a policy which you will be unable or unwilling to carry out under the responsibility of power.Gentlemen, the last time that I met this Liberal Federation was in the city of Cardiff.  I do not think those of us who were there will ever forget that meeting.  It was harmonious in every sense of the word, but much has happened since the Cardiff meeting.  The Government that existed at Cardiff is dead.  May I say one word of that Government?  It had one great defect.  It was strong in policy, strong in experience, strong in administrative capacity, strong in honesty, but it was weak in one thing - it was weak in Parlia­mentary support.The Government and its MajorityNow, that is a fatal weakness in the long run to a Government, and it may have been that the country, observing that weakness in our Government, determined that there should be no such weakness in the next when it entrusted to the new Government what is practically a dictatorship.  I know that dictatorship is not an accurate expres­sion, because it only speaks of a person and not of a group of persons.  Even then it is not so wholly inappropriate, because when you find that the Prime Minister is also Foreign Secretary, and that during some months of foreign complication no Cabinet is held we may presume, I think, that there is some element of personal dictatorship in this country. But if the Government cannot receive a dictatorship\u000a\u000athey have, at any rate, received as large a measure of absolute power as is possible under our Constitution.  The electorate, you, all of you, when you gave your votes, you knew that the Government possessed the undivided confidence of the House of Lords, and you gave it almost the undivided confidence of the House of Commons.  Out of 567 members that were elected in this land of Great Britain no fewer than 390 were Tories, and 176 were Liberals; that is to say, that you gave the Tories two to one as against the Liberals.  Over and above that two to one, you gave them a further majority exactly as large as the whole majority with which Mr. Gladstone\u2019s Government began in 1892.  I leave out of the calculation the Irish members; they work under different political conditions and act independently of British parties: I speak of the relations of Liberal and Tory as established by the last general election in Great Britain.  I think, then, that I am justified in saying that the electorate of this country gave the Government supreme and absolute power.  No such power has ever been enjoyed by any English Government in constitutional times, and I can well imagine the splendid dreams that may have floated before the people who really love their kind and wish well to humanity when they saw a Government comprised of men of ability and men of high character endowed with such dominion.  In view of such splendid possibilities and such a magnificent majority I think that visions must have floated before all of us, however much we may be opposed to the Government.  It may have seemed impossible for them to evoke a new heaven, but they could almost have made a new earth for us.  They almost promised to make a new earth.  They might have made this country a paradise of equal rights and equal opportunities.  They might have pared and pruned away the anomalies of our Constitution with so wise and timely a hand as to withstand the tempests of time and revolution. They might - but why pursue the subject? They promised a paradise, but it was not a paradise of that kind - ample employ­ment, cheap beer, and a pension in the case of the deserving.  I will not recapitulate their promises - perhaps they have not had time to carry them into effect.  That was at any rate the prospect at home which was held out to us.  What was the prospect abroad?  We were to have a reign of universal peace, in which the voice of Great Britain would be potent, if not supreme.  I am bound to say that so far these visions have not been fulfilled.  I do not utter a word of blame on the Government because they have not been fulfilled, but I do utter a word of regret, and I also utter a word of hope that, taught by experience, at the next general election their language will be some­what less blatant, and that the credulity of the British voters will be something considerably less.  As regards foreign affairs, it is a cause of complaint by the Government that we speak too much about them, and that we are disturbing the continuity which ought to exist in the conduct of foreign affairs.  I can give you two sufficient reasons why we should talk a good deal about foreign affairs.  In the first place, the Government has given us nothing else to talk about, and in the second place there is a real uneasiness felt about them.Government Performances What are the Government measures that have resulted from their long and brilliant programme?  There is the measure of procedure in the House of Commons, which I was rather inclined to welcome, as I welcome anything which seeks to restrict talk in the House of Commons.  But I am told by those who have experience in the matter, that it is an unworkable method of procedure.  There is a London Water Bill, but as it only concerns the metropolitan district I do not think you care to hear much about it, so I will only say this, that in its consistence it is well adapted to its subject.  All this may be very good, but it does occur to the philosophic observer that they might have effected it by a much smaller majority than you gave the Government at the last election.  There was another Bill - the Diseases of Animals Bill.  This is a Bill which has not been held as popular by the agriculturists of my native country of Scotland.  It takes the place of provisional orders which our Government issued for the slaughter of animals at the port of imbarcation, and places a provision on the Statute book which may be right or wrong - I am not offering my opinion on that point - but is at any rate wholly inconsistent with the pledge which was given us the night before last at the Canadian dinner.  At the Canadian dinner we were offered a scheme of Imperial federation.  I will not dis­cuss that subject now.  I have no time, and I would no hastily dismiss any scheme of Imperial federation.  The subject of an Imperial Zoll­verein, of a Customs union between the colonies and ourselves, is one which demands very grave consideration.  But I want to know this: how is it that two or three days before making that proposal, the Government proposed this Diseases of Animals Bill, which, if put on the Statute book, would be a fixed danger to one of the great sources of trade of the Canadian\u000a\u000abreeder with the mother country - that is, the importation of store cattle?  I do not know how they reconcile the two, the suppression of the practical Bill and the promulgation of the Imperial Scheme, but I strongly suspect that the Canadian dealer and the Canadian politician would have preferred not to have the great scheme promulgated if they could by that means have stopped the lesser Bill.  There is one word more to be said about it, and that is this - I do not think the Colonial Secretary at all underestimated the views held in this country and the difficulties that he would have to sur­mount, both with regard to the principles of free trade and also of our foreign trade. It almost seems that you in Huddersfield had some knowledge of what was in the air, because I observed when I arrived at the station yesterday that the statue of the great Sir Robert Peel had been washed and renovated as if in view of some such proposal.Continuity of Foreign PolicyI will give the Government one disinterested hint.  If they want us to give up talking about foreign affairs, let them give us something else to talk about. If they would give us some Bills, that would have a treble advantage: it would distract our attention, it would fulfil their pledges, and it would also be an original departure.  We have often read in history of unscrupulous Governments, in difficulties at home, embarking in foreign complications in order to divert public attention from these domestic difficulties.  There would be something pleasing in the novelty of a Government that embarks in a domestic policy in order to distract attention from their complications abroad.  Now, we are told that our discourses on foreign politics disturb the continuity of foreign policy. That is a grave charge, and if I felt that there was any truth in it I should feel considerable uneasiness.  But what is this continuity of foreign policy?  In my view it is this - that one Govern­ment should, so far as it is practicable without sacrifice of principle, endeavour to interweave its foreign policy with that of the preceding, Government, so as to preserve a consistent attitude abroad and pre­vent foreign Powers from building on our party differences and dis­sensions at home.  This continuity of foreign policy was first laid down as a maxim by Mr. Gladstone\u2019s Government in 1886, and since then it has been on the whole fairly and honourably carried out.  But that definition of mine is not the Tory definition.  The Tory de­fines continuity as something of this kind.  When the Liberal party is in office the Tories are to attack Liberal foreign policy, to describe Liberal ministers as pusillanimous, deplorable, muddle-pated politicians, who bark but do not bite, who cringe before the strong and bully the weak, who are isolated from all sympathy in Europe, and whose course is a series of bounds from the fire into the frying-pan and from the frying-pan into the fire.  When the Tories are in office the definition seems to be something like this - that we are to listen with bowed heads and in a deferential manner to whatever may be said on that subject.  That does not seem to me to be a tenable proposition. We do not want to impair the authority of Great Britain abroad, but we should not be upright citizens if we could timidly and silently watch the ship of State buffeted and storm-tossed about as it has been in the seas of foreign policy during the past six months.  At one moment we seemed to be on the verge of war with the United States; at another moment we seemed to be on the verge of war complications with Germany; and at the present moment we are embarking on war ourselves with no particular enemy that I can discover.  But there is this further question, I think, before a Government asks us to respect the continuity of foreign policy.  They preach the continuity of foreign policy; if they preach they should practise it, if only with themselves.Lord Salisbury\u2019s InconsistenciesWhat I deplore in the conduct of the present Government is a melan­choly want of continuity in foreign policy.  I am not now alluding to that black and bloody page of Armenia - a chapter of our history to which we shall always look back with shame and with remorse.  If I began on that I should be taken too far.  But that is not an instance of what I mean.  That would rather involve the consistency of Lord Salisbury with himself than the consistency of the Government that is now in office.  There is only one thing to be said on that point, and it is this.  You will remember that Lord Salisbury concluded the Cyprus Convention.  He has boasted of it himself that he framed it.  This was to secure, as we were told at the time, good government for the oppressed Christians of the East; and after a year or more of massacres which have scarcely any parallel in the history of mankind, we are now told by the author of the convention that it is only a sort of pious opinion, that it is only a few futile sentences inscribed on a piece of paper, and that we are to pay no more attention to its provisions.  No.  What I wish to allude to now is not the question of Armenia, but the question of the whole subject of our dealing with the delicate relations and grouping of forei\u000a\u000agn powers.  It has always been understood that Lord Salisbury in the past has leaned rather on the Triple Alliance than on France and Russia.  That may be a mistaken opinion - I only state it for what it is worth - but at any rate the island of Heligoland is some pledge of his feelings in the matter.  At the end of last December there came the occurrences in South Africa and the difficulties with Germany.  This continuous Foreign Minister, starting from this point at the end of December, by the middle of January had landed us into the arms and, I trust, the affections of France, for I can at any rate put no other interpretation on the mysterious convention which comprised in three articles the interests of Siam, the Niger, and Tunis, but was made without any quid pro quo which was observable by any political microscope except the recovery of the good graces of France.  That lasted about six weeks, and when we have got that idea fully into our heads, this Ministry of \u2018continuous foreign policy\u2019 embarks into a march upon the Soudan, which at once outrages France, and throws us back again to some degree into the arms of the Triple Alliance.  Where we may be in May under this \u2018continuous foreign policy\u2019 I do not think the most audacious prophet among you will dare to predict.  But I wish you to observe I am not criticising; I am only recording; and I am only recording as an apology for our failing, to follow the \u2018continuous policy\u2019 of this somewhat volatile Govern­ment.  They may be practising the best of all foreign policies.  It may be the best, the most prudent, the most sagacious, the most far­sighted of all foreign policies, but there is one thing it is not, and that is continuous.The Soudan AdvanceI said just now that not merely did the Government give us nothing to divert us from the examination of their foreign policy, but that there was real uneasiness felt on the subject.  Now Egypt is the land of mystery.  It has been the land of mystery through all recorded history, and is no less so now.  From the dimensions of the pyramids we endeavour to ascertain the predictions of prophecy.  You can, if you go to Egypt, still look on the features of the Pharaoh who caused Joseph to be honoured, and there is still in the sands of that country the Sphinx gazing with its sardonic smile on the passage of Kings, races, and empires.  In this land of mystery it is perhaps not surprising that the expedition which we have recently undertaken should be involved in considerable obscurity.  If we could understand what it was all for, what its real cause was, what its real object was, we might be able to approve, but at present the mere want of knowledge on this point is what causes natural and well-founded alarm. I must ask you to consider this subject with me for a moment, and, in doing so, I will at once dismiss three great questions. The first is our occupation of Egypt and its nature; secondly, our responsibilities for the Soudan and for its present condition; and, thirdly, our traditional policy as an anti-slavery Power.  All these questions have been raised in the course of the debate on this subject, but they have only been raised, if I may say so, to discolour and obscure the waters of controversy.  These are vast questions, but they do not bear on the point.  It is not alleged that this expedition has anything to do with our tenure in Egypt.  It is not even alleged that the Egyptian Government had anything to say to it.  We have pressed the Government on that point, and they have never been able to say that they proceed at the request or the instance of the Egyptian Government.  All they said is that they proceed at the instance of the military authorities.  Gentlemen, we come to the facts, and the facts are perfectly simple.  The Italians underwent defeat at Adowa, and immediately the Egyptian army was ordered to march 80 miles into the desert.  That is the problem; and that is the problem for which we have to find a solution.  It is evidently not directly to assist the Italians, because Kassala, the town which is besieged by the Dervishes, and which is garrisoned by\u000a\u000athe Italians, is at least 600 miles from the point to which we are marching; and it is equally obvious that, if we are to assist the Italians, we should do it from our base at Suakin.  That, at any rate, is what the Italians, I venture to say, would in­finitely prefer.  Well, of course, it may be said that we are assisting them by drawing off the Dervishes from Kassala to attack Egypt.  Mr. Walker, I have great sympathy with the Italians.  We have no alliance with any Powers, but we have a disinterested and historical friendship for the Italians.  But if our object in this matter is to draw the full strength of the Dervishes off Kassala to Egypt, I think we are carrying our sympathy with the Italians rather too far.  It is a little difficult to say how the interests of Egypt, which we have mainly in view, can be served by attracting the Dervishes to attack that country when it is not otherwise threatened.  I know that Egypt is benefited by the inundations of the Nile, but it is, I venture to say, a new rendering of the conditions of Egypt that it should be benefited by periodical inundations of Dervishes.  But if it be so, if it be desirable to attract the Dervishes to Egypt, we may at once say this. Why not await the Dervishes at Wady Halfa, the position we have left, which is impregnable, instead of marching, with a chivalry which I think misdirected, to meet the Dervishes in a very unpro­pitious and a weaker position, and apparently to attract them by advancing to meet them?Discordant ExplanationsThen, where is the expedition to go to?  It is evidently not going to march to Kassala, and it is obvious from its scope and the strategy that it is not going to march to Khartoum.  It is apparently going to march to Dongola; but even here the Govern­ment speaks with ambiguous confusion.  The Colonial Secretary told us the other day that the expedition might possibly advance to Dongola.  The Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs, speaking later with the ardour and confidence of youth, said that Dongola was the natural and admitted objective of the expedition.  Now, the two state­ments do not hang together.  The statement of the Under-Secretary outside the Cabinet is much more confident than that of the Colonial Secretary, who is very much inside the Cabinet.  But the Colonial Secretary has two or three other qualifications to put on the expedition.  He says the advance, whatever it may be, will be limited by two considerations.  It will be limited, in the first place, by the security of the communications which we can maintain, and it will be limited, in the second place, by the nature and the extent of the resistance we may find.  He adds another qualification, which I will come to in a moment.  Now, it appears that these two considerations, the consideration of the resistance we shall receive and the security of the communications are both, unfortunately, opposed to each other, because I read in the Standard, which, as you know, is a Government organ, this telegramGreat hopes are entertained that the Dervishes may be drawn into an action and decisively beaten in the neighbourhood of Suarda.  It would simplify matters a good deal, since the prospect of marching through the waste desert as far as Dongola, and at the same time keeping up an immense line of communications to Wady Halfa is viewed in some quarters with apprehension, but it will have to be faced if the enemy avoid a pitched battle and retire on Dongola.  This is considered only too likely to happen if they are not brought to a stand within fifty miles of Akasheh.So it appears that the necessity of keeping up communications demands as an essential condition not a \u2018moderate resistance\u2019 but that we shall engage, as soon as possible, in a pitched and decisive battle, or else it may be impossible to maintain those communi­cations.  Then the third condition which is laid down by the Colonial Secretary is that the expedition must not remain too great a strain on the finances of Egypt.  That is a very easy condition to lay down.  It must not be too costly, then, either in money or in blood.  Why, if words could bind facts, there never was an expedition so safe and so limited as this; but the misfortune is that in this world, as you and I know in our lives, but as we know still more in the trend of our policy, it is not possible for words to bind facts.  Here are the facts of the expedition as far as we have yet been able to obtain them.  The expedition is to assist Kassala, 600 miles off. It is, perhaps, to go to Dongola.  It has certainly to go to Don­gola.  It has to repel the Dervishes, and so we leave an impregnable position to repel the Dervishes elsewhere. On the other hand it is feared that they may not attack us.  For if we cannot find them and defeat them before we get to Dongola we cannot well maintain our communications.  Finally, it must not cost too much money and must not meet with too much resistance.  All these hurried, distracted state­ments, which do not hang together, have tended to cause that wide feeling of uneasiness of which I have spoken. And this want of candour is a great disappointment to me.  I thought that the great merit of the new diplomacy, of which we have heard so much, was that in spite of occasional \u2018hitches\u2019 it consisted in almost breathless candour on every possible subject.  But there is no such candour in this case.  It is not so much because of the expedition itself as because of the explanations that there is so widespread a feeling of uneasiness towards it.  If the Government would take us into their confidence we might be able to support them.  But at present we feel that we are being fooled.  I do not say that there is no good reason for this expedition, but if this good reason does exist it has not been given to us.  And I am afraid not merely that the Government are deceiving us, but that they are deceiving themselves.  Of the two I confess I am much more afraid of the second than I am of the first.  They have not yet succeeded in deceiving us, but I am sadly afraid they have succeeded in deceiving themselves.War by Limited LiabilityWhy, they propose to limit war, first, in the amount of expense, and, secondly, to the material resources of Egypt.  As Mr. Asquith - that brilliant son of Huddersfield - said the other day, with his usual aptness, this is making war on limited liability, limited in cost, limited in bloodshed, and limited in extent.  There never was a wilder idea.  You cannot so limit operations of war.  What the Government actually believes is this - that you should, or they on your behalf, march into the Soudan with this inscribed on their banners, \u2018£500,000 and a moderate resistance.\u2019  If they meet with obstacles incompatible with these two conditions, are we to understand that the expedition will have to be abandoned?  It is true of all warfare, but especially true of all African warfare, that you may see the beginning but you cannot see the end; and is it not childish to pretend the war is limited by the material resources of Egypt when you know that behind Egypt stands Great Britain, and if Egypt is foiled it is Great Britain that will have to come to the front?The Necessity for Concentration in our Foreign PolicyThere is one more point about this expedition that perplexes me.  It is the moment chosen for it.  I do not mean the hot and unhealthy season.  The Under Secretary for Foreign Affairs, by-the-bye, told us the other day that they were going to \u2018watch the effect of summer heat\u2019 before they proceeded with the expedition.  I respected the gravity of the House of Commons when I saw that they received that statement with silent awe.  For I confess that I thought that if we had no other result from our fourteen years in Egypt we did know something of the effects of summer heat there.  But I mean something much higher and graver than that.  What is it that every indication, every omen, point to as the first condition of our policy?  Surely, it is to concentration.  France and Russia are said to be hostile to us in this matter.  I should have thought that any Power which is hostile to us would have egged us on in this campaign, which absorbs Egyptian arms and resources in the first line, and British arms and resources in the second.  What is the situation?  It is quite true that we have, it appears, abandoned the boasts of \u2018splendid isolation\u2019 which were so large a topic of the Government a few weeks ago, and it is said that we have returned to the good graces of the Triple Alliance.  As to that, it may be said that Austria and Italy have always been our warm and disinterested friends; and, as regards Germany, I am glad to hear that we are once more acquiring her friendship, though, if we may judge from the tone of her Press, that friendship is not so intimate and compact as we could have desired.  But have we learned nothing from Armenia?  Do we know nothing of the forces that are engaged against us there, and which compelled us to abandon Armenia and for a time, at any rate, to abdicate our position in the East of Europe?  There are grave issues with the United States - issues which I trust are being smoothed by diplomacy, and which may be further adjusted by appeal to arbitra­tion.  But there still remain unsettled questions which might yet affect an inflammable population and rouse it into dangerous excite­ment.  Is there nothing to make us cautious, to give caution to our enterprises, when we look at the Far East and the condition in which China has been left by the war between China and Japan, and the enterprise of various Powers in the direction of that helpless empire?  Is there nothing to give us disquietude in Africa?  What is the effect of the Italian defeat in Africa?  A great expert on this ques­tion, who was quoted in the Times the other day, told us that the rebuff of the Italians in Africa was a defeat and a disaster to all Europe in Africa, and that, with the celerity with which savage tribes circu­lated the information, that reverse would be known all over Africa and would cause a general rising of barbarism against civilisation.  That may fall on Uganda; that may fall on Egypt; but, wherever it may fall, surely, it teaches Europeans who are engaged in Africa the necessity of concentration and a defensive policy.  Is there nothing in other parts of Africa that may give us uneasiness? The Times, which is an official organ, confirms what comes to us by every post - that the news from South Africa never was more anxious than it is just now; and at this moment, when we are increasing our fleet to an enormous extent - not, we are told, for purposes of offence, but of mere necessary de­fence, is it wise to weaken our voice, to hamper our diplomacy and lock up our resources by sending an expedition into the sands of a desert which has already before now engulfed monarchs, armies, and empires.  And is there no concentration required for Egypt herself?  Egypt has prospered under our rule.  What is the need of Egypt now?  She desires, and has desired for the last three years, to construct a great reservoir at Assuan, which would enable her to enjoy the beneficent operations of the Nile even at the time of \u2018lower Nile\u2019 - in fact, all the year round.  What would be the cost of this great enterprise?  Some four or five millions, while it is estimated that it would at once raise the productiveness of Egypt by the value of seven or eight millions annually, and that the increase of revenue to the Egyptian Government would be not less than £850,000 a year.  It is at this moment, when Egypt wants to concentrate her resources upon this great scheme, that we are going to lock them up in this Soudan expedition. Gentlemen, I declare it solemnly, I would support the foreign policy of the Government if I could.  There is nothing - these friends who are nearest to me will testify to this - that I have more at heart than to see both parties in the State supporting in common the foreign policy of the Government.  I would gladly support the foreign policy of the Government, but they will not give me the chance.Party Promises and PerformancesI am bound to say that in domestic affairs I do not feel the same anxiety to support her Majesty\u2019s Government.  I am, I confess, like most of you suppose, dismayed by the meagreness of their pro­gramme.  It may be that they consider they have received an imperative mandate from the country to do nothing, but that was not what they promised.  Of course, I am far from judging the performance of a Government by its promises, more especially of this Government.  We had a little instructive instance of this in the case of the Pem­broke Dock last night, which would open the eyes of the House of Commons and of the Government\u2019s Welsh supporters - if Welsh sup­porters they have.  But I desire to quote to you a very instructive passage in the speech of one of the supporters of the Government.  I need not mention his name, but I will give you his words.  He asked how it was that the country was listening more and more to the Press and less and less to the House of Commons, and said it was because they were sick of the inconsistencies of politicians - he was speaking of the present Government, which he supported - who vote for things in office which they denounced when in Opposition.  I think, on the whole, that the other process is the most common - to vote for something in Opposition which they repudiate when in office, and that was the case with Pembroke Dock last night.  But you may ask me why I quote this passage from this unknown member on this occasion.  I quote it because I think it has a considerable bearing on the history of this Government and the Government that preceded it.  This Government may fall because of the bad things that are said of them by their supporters; they may fall because they repudiate in office the promises that they made when in Opposition.  The late Government fell for pursuing an exactly opposite course.  Why did it fall?  It fell because, with a chivalrous sense of honour too rare in politics, and with inadequate means, it determined to fulfil all the pledges that it had given in Opposi­tion.  It had, I think, given too many pledges - partly owing to you, Dr. Spence Watson.  It had, I think, assumed too many responsibilities, it had taken a burden too heavy for its back, or the back of any Govern­ment or any Parliament, to bear, but it never shrank, it never blenched.  I believe that Government will have its reward.  Such a record is never forgotten in this country, for Englishmen, whether they disagree with your items of policy or not, can at any rate recog­nise and value honesty of purpose and good faith.  We did not carry many of our measures, because you did not give us the means to carry them, and even if we had been able to get them through the House of Commons we were sure of the certain, impassive, unchangeable opposition of the House of Lords. But, at any rate, we did our best. \u2018\u2019Tis not in mortals to command success, But we\u2019ll do more, Sempronius\u2019 - who, I suppose, is Dr. Spence Watson \u2013 \u2018we\u2019ll deserve it.\u2019IrelandAt any rate, let us compare the late \u2018weak\u2019 Government with the present \u2018strong\u2019 Government.  I will take two test questions - only two - and I will not make them opportunities for a declaration of policy, as you will not get any declaration of policy from me tonight any more than you got one from the Federation today.  The first of these questions is that of Ireland.  With regard to Ireland, we had our principle and we had our plan to embody that principle.  Our idea was, under certain guarantees, to give the Irish the management of distinctively Irish business.  We embodied that idea in a plan.  You know that it was carried through the House of Commons by the supreme, almost immortal, exertions of Mr. Gladstone.  That plan may have been good or it may have been bad, but at any rate our Government, though weak in Parliamentary support, had a principle, and it had a plan on this question.  This Government has neither.  I beg their pardon - they have a principle, but they have forgotten it.  And, after all, it is of some importance to have a policy with regard to Ireland, because, though our Government has gone, the Irish ques­tion remains - a vast and menacing note of interrogation in the midst of the Empire.  Well, I looked forward to the plan of the Government, and I was delighted to read the first declaration of the Chief Secretary. It is so liberal that I trust you will excuse me for reading it to you.  He said:We desire to adapt our remedy to the character of the country\u2019s needs.  Our desire is to hold the scales equally between the various sections into which the people of Ireland are divided without distinction of creed or class.  Our desire is to remedy every grievance from which any section of the Irish people can legitimately be said to suffer.  Our desire is to establish an industrial peasantry on the ownership of the land which they at present cultivate; and in those cases where relation between landlord and tenant is not thus done away with, to do something at least to remove friction, which in many cases make relation between them a misfortune to both.  Lastly, our desire is to be not only just but generous in promoting the industrial and material development of the country, and so to sow the seeds of future prosperity.Brave words!  I read them with admiration and with some degree of hope, because after all, if we could not have our policy, the Tories might have promulgated a policy on this line to which we of the Liberal party might have given a large measure of support.  They might have given, for example, a real measure of local government in Ireland.  They could give, they are about to give, they say, a Land Bill; but all their big Bills, it appears, get squeezed out, and it is only the small Bills that get introduced.  They might have examined the question of Irish finance and endeavoured to ascertain if that country, impoverished as it is and with a rapidly-sinking population, does not bear too great a share of the burden of the Empire.  I only indicate one or two lines on which such a policy might have been carried out, but at last we come to the test of what they were going to do. There was, the other day, a municipal Bill from the city of Belfast.  On that occasion a promising Irish member, Mr. Knox, moved what you would have thought a very innocent instruction to the committee in charge of the Bill.  It was that they should examine into the possibility of establishing cumulative voting in the municipal borough of Belfast.  Now there were no disputes as to the facts.  The facts were that a large proportion of the population of Belfast were Roman Catholics, and, what is considered worse than to be Roman Catholics, Home Rulers, and yet there was not a single member of the town council, and, what is more, not a single officer employed by the town council who was either a Roman Catholic or a Home Ruler.  That motion was seconded in a very able and thoughtful speech, as I con­sidered it, by Mr. Healy, in which, taking a wider view, he said he did not want this for Belfast alone, but he wanted it for towns in which Roman Catholics had equally the predominance, because, he said, there should be no unanimity of religion and creed in these matters, and a little opposition was healthy for everybody.  This was a great opportunity. I rushed to my \u2018Hansard,\u2019 for I remembered \u2018our desire was to hold the scales evenly between the various sections into which the people of Ireland are divided, without distinction of creed or class.\u2019  What was the result?  The facts were admitted by the Government, but they would give no ear to the proposal of Mr. Knox and Mr. Healey. When we were in office we were taunted with being led too much and guided too much by Irish votes.  On this occasion the Conservative Government, great and powerful as it is, was equally guided and dependent on Irish votes.  They went with their 15 or 16 Orange votes which made them give this decision.  I confess that, if I had my ambition realised, I would rather not be dependent upon any one nationality in these three kingdoms unreservedly for my party majority.  Yet, if I had to depend upon the Irish party for my Irish policy, I would rather it were the representative of the vast majority of the people of Ireland than of a narrow minority.The Temperance QuestionNow, the other subject - the other test subject - to which I will call your attention for one moment is this, it is that of temperance.  We could not ignore the question of intemperance in England.  We could not ignore a curse which is the parent of so much crime and so much misery.  We had a simple principle in the matter, and it was this, that, considering the education and the civilisation of our people - I am afraid that Sir Wilfrid Lawson will not agree with that remark - I am told that he bears heavily both on the education and the civilisa­tion of our people; but our view, which I still maintain, is that with the education and civilisation of our people, they were the proper persons to whom the control of this question and this traffic should be unreservedly entrusted.  Well, that was our plan.  If we may judge from the election, the people refused to accept the responsibility which we endeavoured to cast upon them.  Well, whether they did that under­standing accurately what would be the effect of our plan, or whether they were misled by - I must use a good old English word - lies, they declined that responsibility.  They were, misled, I think, by the cry that we wished to deprive the poor man of his beer.  There never was a greater fallacy.  That would not have been by any means the effect of the plan we proposed to Parliament.  I think that some of those who have illusions on that subject carried those illusions too far; but at any rate, that idea was not in the plan of those who pro­posed it.  That plan may have been imperfect - I am not discussing the merits of the plan - but at any rate I believe the principle in it to be incontrovertible, that the people should have the control of itself, the control of its own morals and its own surroundings.  Of course, that principle may be given effect to in other ways, but I say that the principle cannot be barely contradicted by any sensible body of men.  Well, that was the course of the late Government.  What is the course of the present Government, with their great power, in dealing with the question on which, according to their own language, as I can quote from both Mr. Balfour and Lord Salisbury, they feel quite as deeply as we do?  They recoil, as it were, from their great power and majority, and refer the question to a Royal Commission - that it may record all the well-known facts and go over the well-known conclusions.  That is their way of shelving the question.  On that point I will hold no controversy with them, but I observe that last night even the faithful Bishops turned against their policy.  You will remember that the Bishops have not had an altogether easy time of it.  They came to Downing Street proud of the influence they had exercised over the elections; they asked Lord Salisbury a question on the subject; he made them a low bow and left the room.  Even the patience of a Bishop has limits, and last night, when they were told that the Government were going to refer this matter to a Royal Commission, their patience gave way and they murmured with groanings which could not be uttered.  I think, then, that the nation has some right to feel some discouragement as to the exercise of the supreme power which it entrusted to the Government at the last election.  I con­fess that I am disappointed, because, although I am not a sup­porter of the present Government, I welcomed the largeness of this majority, if they were to have a majority, as enabling them to do much good work, and much good work in which both parties might possibly co-operate.  But, if in that respect I am discouraged, as a party man I feel nothing of the kind.  I cannot feign or profess any discouragement at all.Liberal ProspectsWe hear much in these days of the present and of the future of the Liberal party. On that point I believe the truth to be simple enough.  The future of the Liberal party lies in the hands of the Liberal party itself, and your future lies with yourselves.  Its fame, its fortune, its influence are no longer as they were sixty or a hundred years ago, the appanage of a dozen great families.  Those great families have left us and the times are out of joint for anything of that kind.  The fame and the fortunes of the Liberal party lie with the people themselves.  The policy of the Liberal party is no longer what a few dukes may decree, but what the people of this country require.  What is this Liberalism that we talk so much about?  It is not formula, it is not a set creed; it is not a series of fixed propositions; it is a living spirit, the spirit in which great questions are approached, and in which they are treated; broad, unprejudiced and sympa­thetic, as opposed to a spirit which is narrow and selfish and timid.  That spirit cannot lie dormant; it must again arise in our midst, and breathe life into our dormant constituencies, and thrill the intellects and energies of our people.  I would not have you force it, but I would have you favour it; I would have you teach it; I would have you practise it; I would have you test men and measures by it; I would have it inspire your homes, your lives and your neigh­bourhoods.  And, if that be so, we shall not simply be good Liberals, but good patriots too, for it is the essence of an Empire like ours that it shall be maintained with equity and justice, and based upon those eternal principles of self-government which stimulate and develop the resources of our race.

aVMy Lords and Gentlemen, - I will say \u2018My lords,\u2019 too, because there are lords here, a rare commodity in the Liberal party and precious accordingly, and, what is more, there are two Norfolk peers in this assembly, one my friend and my contemporary, the Earl of Kimberley, through life one of the most faithful supporters of the Liberal party. From his youth to his age he has never swerved; among the faithless, he has always been faithful found; and he has spoken to you tonight words of weight and words of wisdom which are deserving to guide the judgment of the Liberal party. There is my friend Lord Battersea, and others are here. You must not expect me tonight to attempt a general review of all the political questions in which the Liberal party is interested. We have upon our hands at present a sufficient task in resisting that policy of reaction which is in full swing under the Tory majority. The general lines of Liberal policy are those with which a gathering like this is familiar, and the principles that have once been proclaimed by the Liberal party are never abandoned. If I were asked to define the great distinction between the Liberal and the Tory party it would be this - that the Liberal party never surrenders the principles that it has espoused, and that the Tory party always in the end adopts those principles. I would draw this distinction between what Lord Kimberley has said and what I am prepared to assert. In the lapse of time there is never a difference between the Liberal party and the Tory party; for it may be for a quarter of a century, it may be for half a century, the Liberal party contends for principles which the Tory party bitterly opposes, but at the end of that time they come together, for the Tory party always adopts the principles which the Liberal party has originated. With that general remark I shall ask you tonight to permit me to restrict the observations that I have to make to the present situation, and that is a sufficiently ample subject, I think, on which I may exhaust your patience. The Condition of the PartyPeople generally prefer, I think, in the first instance to talk about themselves, and therefore I will say a word upon the condition of the Liberal party. Lord Kimberley has referred to it already. It happens to individuals, even of the most robust condition, to suffer sometimes from temporary ailments, and somewhere about a year and a half ago the Liberal party had a severe attack. Well, maladies are always depressing; some patients are apt to be more depressed than others. I have observed that in an illness of that description they become fretful and impatient. They complain of everybody and everything, and particularly of the physician. I do not think myself that I am of a pessimistic temperament, and I have a great faith in the recuperative power of a good constitution. It brings a man through a great many epidemics. Providence has endowed the Liberal party with a good constitution, and therefore it has recovered from the prostration of the political influenza from which it suffered in 1895, and here we are again, and as sound as ever we were. I never think it a good thing, after convalescence, to dwell too much upon the symptoms of the indisposition. It is quite enough for me that I find you here in rude health. When I observe the condition, the clinical condition, of the Liberal party I find the pulse is strong, the tempera­ture is normal, the appetite is good, and the spirits are high. What more do you want? Let us go on our way rejoicing. We are in first-rate training. I am an old political trainer myself, and I reckon myself a good judge of condition. I know when a party is soft and when its condition is hard; and if you will take my word for it the Liberal party were never in finer condition than they are at this moment. They were never more fit. Lord Kimberley has referred to some trials we have had lately, and they are, I think, very promising as to future events. Well then let us go on as we have gone on before; let us go on with a Liberal party conquering and to conquer, a party that has never been beaten in the long run.The Premature Decay of the Unionist MajorityThis is all I want to say about ourselves. We need not trouble ourselves, I think, about the condition of the Liberal party; but, happy as we are ourselves, we are humane men, and we can feel for the misfortunes of others. The poet says, \u2018Teach us to feel another\u2019s woes.\u2019 I can hardly add \u2018To hide the fault I see.\u2019 It is exactly upon that point that I desire to make a few remarks, but he must be a hard-hearted politician indeed who can view without a feeling of compassion the premature decay of the great Unionist majority. Such a promising youth - promising above everything - such great expectations, such a handsome fortune to start with, such a balance in hand at its Parliamentary bankers - and, with all this to the good, what a shocking bad hand it has made of it! They were gifted by the country with a mighty engine with which they were expected to turn out splendid stuff; but there is not a handloom weaver who would not be ashamed of the web of shabby work that they have turned out. See how they started. I have some diffidence in commenting upon dignified officials. It is always said that two of a trade never agree. I certainly should never think of criticising their capacity. No one, I am sure, would say that I have ever failed to do justice to my able successor, the present Chancellor of the Exchequer. I left him a pretty handsome legacy as a token of my confidence and esteem. I cannot say that I think he has spent it to the best advantage; but that was not altogether his fault. My confi­dence in the Chancellor of the Exchequer rests upon the fact that he really is a bulwark against the rubbish of his own party. He has the sense and courage to knock Sir Howard Vincent and the fair trade party on the head, and, sitting between Mr. Balfour and Mr. Harry Chaplin, he holds up the nonsense of the bimetallists to the contempt it deserves. It is a great thing, depend upon it, to have a Second Lord of the Treasury to keep the First Lord of the Treasury in order. That is an office which the present Chancellor of the Exchequer admirably fulfils, but it is a little disappointing to some parties. It is not the millennium of soft money which was promised by the Bryanite candidates in the Lancashire election, and they are not altogether so pleased with it as I am. Well, as to the heads of the rest of the departments, they are very able, but I must say I think they are rather unfortunate men. There is the excellent Home Secretary, and he is denounced by his own party for the manner in which he administers the prerogative of mercy. There is the Secretary for War. He is a rash man. He has meddled with the Household Brigade, he has actually thought of sending the Guards abroad, and he might just as well have attempted to overthrow the Monarchy or the Church. And then there is the President of the Board of Trade. Why, the whole party rose up in a fury against him because in the case of Lord Penrhyn and his quarrymen he offered the good offices which were provided in the Conciliation Act of this great majority in order to settle quarrels between capital and labour. Then there is that great contingent the English garrison in Ireland, the loyal Irish landlords. They are ready to tear the Government to pieces because they have passed what they considered to be, or what the Government intended to be, a fair Bill towards the tenants in Ireland. And there are even men who are profane enough and daring enough to criticise the Colonial Secretary. Fancy a Unionist criticising Mr. Chamberlain because he is suspected - I do not know whether truly or not - to have a prejudice against filibustering. These are not the flouts of a factious Opposition. They are the groans of a disappointed party. They have discovered with disgust that the responsible Government dares not carry into effect their narrow views and their bigoted prejudices; that when it comes to action they are com­pelled perforce to adopt the principles of the Liberal party which they sincerely abhor and which they denounced at the general election. I will say something later on, if you will grant me your patience, upon questions of foreign policy, but I would now turn to the legislative performances of this great majority.The Government\u2019s ProgrammeThey started with a splendid programme - I think the National Liberal Federation might be jealous of it, I mean in its volume, not in its quality. They talked of our having too multifarious a pro­gramme, but look at the illuminated card in Lancashire of the First Lord of the Treasury. I do not remember how many items it comprised; it was a very large card, very closely printed. I forget what the parti­culars were. I may be excused because we have never heard of any of them since. Yes, there is one I recollect. It was that all the School Board rates were to be paid by the Exchequer. That would be a useful thing to bear in mind when we come to discuss the forthcoming Bill of the Government for aiding the Board schools. They produced their Education Bill of last year; that was the first-fruits of the glorious majority. Well, the firstborn died in infancy! They say now, to excuse its fate, that it was too ambitious. It was such a precocious child, it came before its age. I myself, with some Parliamentary experience, have never known a measure of first-class importance produced by a powerful Government which perished under such a chorus of universal disapprobation. They say we destroyed it; they do us too much honour. It destroyed itself. It died after a five days\u2019 debate, and that is the reason why they are taking very good care that their next Education Bill shall not be debated; and so exit the Education Bill of 1896, a perpetual monument of legislative incapacity. Now I will go to their finance. They found themselves in possession of a great sur­plus. The financial measures they had bitterly opposed and done their best to defeat, followed by a great revival of trade, put them in pos­session of a vast sum of money. Under such favourable circumstances it might have been expected that some relief would have been given to the overburdened taxpayers of this country. I doubt whether any instance could be found in which with so large a superabundance of money there has been no reduction of taxation. How did they dispose of that money? They squandered a good deal of it. They always do that; but they did make a special grant to one class of the community, and one class only. They gave two millions to what they are pleased to call the agricultural interest. That is a large mouthful, and it is an ambiguous thing; it is like autonomy - it may mean something or it may mean nothing. It did not mean anything to the agri­cultural labourer; he gets nothing out of it. That is no part of the agricultural interest. The British farmer, they say, would be benefited by it, but they admitted that if the good times come the money would pass from the farmer to the landlord. I am happy to think that in these eastern counties better times have come, and the money will go, as they admitted it would go, to the landlords. They arranged this Bill in such a manner - they always do arrange things in that manner - that the money went to those who wanted it least, and the dwellers in the towns, where the rates are far higher than they are in the country, have got no relief at all. That is Unionist finance. The Chancellor of the Exchequer will have a good surplus this year - I tell you that as a secret, because it is not yet announced - not as big as last year\u2019s, but it will be a good lump sum. What will be done with it? Will there be any relief to the taxpayers of this country? Well, we shall see; but I do not advise you to increase your expenditure in the anticipation of it. That is a hint I will give you. But what we do know is this - that out of it is to be a gift of half-a-million of money to the Church. Their financial policy is always class legislation - legislation exclusively in the interest of the classes they favour. They have given two millions already to the land, and they are now going to give half-a-million to the Church, and if it turns out that after two years\u2019 successive surpluses there is no relief to the general taxpayer of this country, I think that probably the country will come to the conclusion that it is time there was a change. Then there is the social legislation. This was to be a Government above all other things of social legislation. It was Mr Chamberlain\u2019s once valued, now despised, department of parochial legislation. They had a Truck Bill, and a remarkable thing I observe is that at the contested elections the first thing a Tory candidate does is to pledge himself to repeal the Tory Truck Act. There is the Con­ciliation Act, which I have mentioned already. We find to our surprise that the Tory party is down upon the author of the Con­ciliation Act in his first attempt to put it into operation. There was this Session what was called the Safety of Boilers Bill, a thing to which the working classes attach great importance. Mr. Jesse Collings, the great friend of the people, got up, dressed in a little brief authority, and made a speech against the Boilers Bill, and we beat him by a majority of about sixty, principally consisting of those of his own party. That is all I can really remember of the social legislation of this great majority. All this is sinking into the minds of the people of this country. There is a feeling of blank dismay and disappointment among their own supporters at these miserable performances following upon those reckless and bloated professions by which they won the last election. This great majority is being found out. All Governments - and I have had experience of some - in turn fall short of the expectations that were formed of them, but most Governments have a honeymoon when all is mutual love and admiration. But this Govern­ment has had no honeymoon at all. There has been no mutual love and admiration from the beginning. There has been no billing and cooing, the refrigeration is beginning too soon, and the country which has embraced them with ardour is tired of them already. Well, they have had some painful domestic revelations. Lord Kimberley has referred to Walthamstow, Romford, Frome, and Halifax, and other places. I have seen some figures which show the results in fourteen constituencies which have been tested in by-elections, and these are all the constituencies which have been contested in by-elections, and also in 1892 and 1895. In 1892 in these fourteen constituencies there was a Liberal majority of 1,096; in 1895, in the reaction, there was a Conservative majority of 7,092; and in the by-elections since the last General Election there is a Liberal majority again of 1,072, having knocked down the Conservative majority and gone back again to the Liberal majority of 1892. I have spoken of the symptoms of the recovery of the Liberal party, and I think I have given you some evidence of it. Now, I have been amused to see that Mr. Balfour has ascribed these unfortunate miscarriages to the bigness of the Unionist majority to its over-grown size. He says, \u2018Oh, it is so much easier to manage a small majority.\u2019 Well, if that is their complaint, it is one from which they are fast recovering. I cannot help wishing we had a little of their complaint. I think we could have made a better use of it. That is the history of the first year\u2019s performance of the great Unionist majority, a beggarly account of empty dishes; and now we come to this year, and we have got the Education Bill number two.The Second Education BillI am not going to trouble you much with the particulars of that Bill, because it is the peculiarity of the Bill that it has no particulars at all, and it was framed with that particular purpose. It is a grant of public money from the pockets of the taxpayers of this country to private bodies without any reasonable conditions or provisions as to the proper application of that money. I undertake to say that that is an accura\u000a\u000ate description of the Education Bill. We have been endeavouring to put some particulars into the Bill. That they call obstruction. Now, the right of the House of Commons is to demand, and the duty of the Government is to give, full information upon the Bill to the House; and how do they start the debate? The Bill is in charge of two gentlemen of great ability, but with the singular recommendation that they know nothing of the practical subject with which that Bill is dealing; two gentlemen familiar with the Scotch system, which is a system of universal School Boards, but of the voluntary system in England they know nothing whatever. Nobody could have heard the speech of Mr. Balfour in which he opened that Bill without seeing that he was talking about a thing with which he had no acquaintance. We tried to get explanations, he gave us none, and the other night he said that he preferred the fluid method of dealing with the subject - the fluid method of treating the education of the people. It reminds me of what happened once, before I was in Parliament and when I was at the Parliamentary Bar, in a railway case. When you are making a new line you are called upon to deposit plans, and it is upon a certain datum line that the whole work depends. I asked the engineer what his datum line was, and he said, \u2018Oh, I have got a fluctuating datum line.\u2019 I need not say that the Bill was thrown out, as a Bill dependent upon the fluid method ought to be thrown out. We have heard of a house built upon the sand, but to build the education of the country upon a fluid basis is a thing which was left, I think, for Mr. Balfour to discover.A Public and Parliamentary ScandalThe remarkable part of the matter is that upon the Government bench is sitting the man who does know all about it, the Vice-President of the Council on Education, but he has been closured from the very first, and he is not allowed to say a single word upon the subject. Why not? I will tell you why. Because he does know all about it. Now, this thing has been treated as a joke, but it is past a joke. In my opinion it is a public and Parliamentary scandal. It is an insult to the House of Commons, and it is an outrage on the administrative system of this country. There are departments highly paid whose business it is to have a special knowledge of the several subjects entrusted to them. The taxpayers of this country pay large sums of money, and pay them well and wisely, in order that they may have, and Parliament may have, the best information available upon all matters in which the people of this country are interested. And what would you think if the Attorney General was instructed to bring in a fluid Budget? What would be said if the Secretary of State for India introduced the Navy Estimates or Mr. Jesse Collings took charge of the Army?The ClosureThis Bill is drawn up in a manner which no man can understand, and it is put into the hands of people who cannot explain it, and then the Bill is forced through by closure. Now, I spoke last year upon the manner in which the Government had dealt with closure. I told them that they would ruin the Session by it, and they did ruin it. Closure is like dram drinking or morphia; the more you indulge in it the less you can do without it. Last night was a shameful example. At 3 o\u2019clock in the morning they insisted upon discussing whether these voluntary associations should be made compulsory associations, and they settled the matter by closure. You can hardly settle such a thing as making a voluntary association compulsory except by closure. You cannot very well do it by argument. It is said that closure has been only applied to trivial amendments. That is not true. I will give you one example. Perhaps the most important question with regard to these schools is whether there shall or shall not be an element of popular control. The Government excluded that from their Bill; it was necessary to have an instruction to admit the discussion. Speaker after speaker rose from the Tory benches to support our view of that subject, so much so that there was hardly room for us to get in. Mr. John Morley (Loud cheers) - I knew the mention of his name would give me time to breathe - moved the adjournment. I took the liberty to second it. I have not, I think, been intrusive, certainly not obstructive, on this Bill. But I should have liked to make some observations on that subject, and they closured me. (Cries of \u2018Shame.\u2019) Yes, I did not take it as a bad compliment to myself. I knew they were not closuring me - they did not care what I said - they were closuring the men of their own party because they could not stand their opposition. They might have been compelled to make an amendment, and they had resolved to have no amendments, in order that there shall be no report stage, contrary to all the principles of fair legislation, in accordance with which any Government that produces a Bill is always willing to discuss the par­ticulars of that Bill, and to accept amendments which certainly ought to arise, and do arise, in the discussion of such a Bill. I can only describe the treatment of this Bill by the Government as a system of brutalising the House of Commons, and it is such bad management too. That is not the way to get a Bill through the House of Commons. You cannot drive a high-spirited horse in this fashion; you will only irritate it, and in time, you may depend upon it, it will give you a bad fall. We have some right to speak upon that subject. We were in a Government with a small majority. Our friend, Sir Henry Fowler, had the conduct of a Bill - a large Bill. They pre­tended it was unopposed. They did their best to defeat it, though they did not dare to divide against the second reading. And now let me just tell you about the way that Bill was treated. Sir Henry Fowler has been kind enough to give me this note: the Bill occupied forty-seven sittings of the House of Commons; thirty-four sittings were in Committee. The Opposition put down 1,025 amendments. The greater number of those were duplicates and out of order, but they moved 404. The 13th Clause, which simply related to charities, a subordinate clause - not the whole Bill, like the clause that we are now discussing - occupied six sittings. The 19th Clause, which related to the election of guardians, occupied seven sittings, and upon January 9th, 1894, Mr. Balfour wrote a letter to the Times newspaper, so proud of his performance that he said: \u2018It was fought,\u2019 these are his words, \u2018It was fought line by line for seven days, and was finally de­bated and divided against as a whole.\u2019 Now that is his boast of the way in which he treated that Bill, and the Government during these forty-seven days only moved the closure twice. Then there is the Bill I had something to do with - the Budget Bill. Well, that was a complicated Bill. It was a Bill, I suppose, as bitterly opposed as any Bill ever was in the House of Commons, and I passed that Bill through the House of Commons without employing the closure, and that is why that Bill stands and will stand. There is a feeling in the House of Commons, as there is a feeling everywhere amongst Englishmen, when a thing is fairly dealt with, or when it is not fairly dealt with; when opponents have been heard, when their arguments have been considered, when amendments have been accepted which are reasonable, why, then a measure of that kind, though opposed, is finally accepted, and does endure. This Education Bill has not been fairly dealt with and it will not endure.The Voluntary AssociationsWe have endeavoured to obtain securities that this money shall be properly spent. That has been refused. We sought some definition of these voluntary associations which, by closure have been made compulsory. We are told it is an experiment. What an experiment. Conceive 500 necessitous ecclesiastics, suffering under an intolerable strain, raffling for £600,000; yes and compelled to raffle whether they want to raffle or not. Why, it would be like going into a voluntary school and throwing a bag of sugar plums upon the floor, which would very much, I fancy, disturb the denominational teaching of the class. I wonder what will be the favourite text at these diocesan gatherings of voluntary associations. I do not think the text will be, \u2018Silver and gold have I none.\u2019 They say these voluntary associations are intended to advise the Education Department. No; they are intended to coerce the Education Department. They are to be sectarian associations, but there are sects and sects in the Church of England. I suppose the majority will prevail, but the clerical majority, I regret to say, in the Church of England today is not friendly to the principles of the Reformation. We have asked whether there is to be a lay element there. We have endeavoured to secure it; the Government have refused it. We are told this is to be an organisation of the Church party. We know what the Church party is and what it means. It is a sacerdotal party. It is the domination of the priesthood, and it is to endow that, at their discretion, that £600,000, unconditionally, of the taxpayers\u2019 money is to be given out of the surplus of this year. We have asked that there shall be security that the money shall be applied to educational purposes alone; that has been refused. We have asked that subscriptions shall be maintained; that has been refused. Are those trivial amendments which ought to be closured? No, we have persevered, and we shall persevere to the end because, whatever happens in the House of Commons, whatever majority there may be, we are determined that this Bill and its true character shall be understood by the people of this country, and the more they gag, and the more they closure, the more clear will the comprehension of the country be of the motive by which the Government are actuated. Then we are told it is all unnecessary. The thing is to be left to the discretion of the Department. Yet they will not allow the man of the Department who is to exercise that discretion to say a syllable as to how the discretion is to be exercised. Why, Sir John Gorst is the only lay figure in the whole of this clerical scheme. I wish him joy of the position. He might throw some light on the composition of this fluid he is to administer. Just see the danger of this absolute discretion - the removal of all satisfactory securities. They might give you some chance of continuity of administration with Mr. Acland, or I may say that with Sir John Gorst you might look for a reasonable exercise of this uncontrolled discretion; but Mr. Acland is not there, and I am not quite sure that Sir John Gorst will always be there. You might see in his place Lord Cranborne or his distinguished brother, exercising this uncontrolled discretion, the discretion of a gentleman who said the other day that he regarded subscriptions to voluntary schools as blackmail - a remark echoed with the highest approbation by that well-known friend of education, the Bishop of Chester. Well, the Education Bill of this year is more mischievous even than that of last year. It will bring distraction into the whole educational system of this country, which was working admirably, which has answered well not only for the Board schools but for the Voluntary schools; and if the Government had only dealt fairly by both sets of schools together there would never have been any of the bad blood that has been bred. There never would have been any necessity for dealing with the House of Commons and for dealing with the Bill in the manner in which they have now been dealt with.The Cretan QuestionAnd now, if I have not exhausted your patience, I will say some­thing upon the grave, the most grave situation of the foreign affairs of this country. We have asked for an explanation of the policy of the Government. Is there a higher right that belongs to the representa­tives of the people, whether it be in the House of Lords or in the House of Commons, than to ask the responsible Government of the country, who announce that they are going to take measures which amount to a declaration of war, to explain the policy which justifies the course they are about to pursue. But when I asked, a few days ago, in the House of Commons, whether they would state to the House, as the Government of France has stated to their Chamber, the policy and the reasons upon which it was founded, Mr. Balfour, with contempt, said \u2018We are not going to take an example from a foreign country like France.\u2019 That was the answer he gave me amidst the loud applause of his supporters. Well, I asked on Monday night whether the Government, after the French statement, had any announcement to make. Mr. Balfour gave me an answer obviously in the form of a Cabinet decision, that important communications were going on between the Powers, and that it would not be proper or possible to make a statement at that moment. We acquiesced. We were glad to hear that important communications were going on with the Powers, because we hoped and believed that they might lead to an amicable and peaceful solution; but at the same moment my noble friend Lord Kimberley asked the same question in the House of Lords. Was he told that communications were going on? Not at all. He was told that the blockade of Crete had been declared; and then this Government, that despised the notion of giving us the opportunity that was given in France of discussing this matter before the resort to arms was adopted, this Government actually stated to Lord Kimberley that if he wanted to know what the policy of the British Government was he must go and read the speech of the Minister of France. In my opinion no such disgraceful answer was ever before given by a British Minister to a British Parliament. It was a piece of cynical impertinence of which there is no example. In my opinion such an answer as that was an insult to Parliament. I hardly know the word to apply to a Govern­ment who should give such an answer as that. As Lord Kimberley has said, the whole of the policy of the Government of France was founded on the particular circumstances of the French people, of French interests, of French alliances, with which we have nothing in common whatever; and it is perfectly obvious from those speeches that the French people and the French Government did not love the policy, and that they would never have adopted it except on account of those overruling circumstances peculiar to their own country. To be put off, then, with no explanation of the proceedings upon which the English Government is entering, by a reference of that kind, is simply to deduce a policy at second hand. It was not even a policy at second hand, because as the policy of France was second hand also, so the policy of England was a policy at third hand, a policy worthy only of a third rate Power. And the English Parliament was expected to be satisfied with such an explanation as that. If we wanted to call it in question, what would be the form of the resolution I suppose it would be: \u2018That this House disapproves the policy of the British Government as expounded by M. Hanotaux and M. Méline.\u2019 Fancy such a resolution as that on the journals of the British House of Commons. In my opinion such treatment as that of a subject so grave is humiliating to a nation, and it is abject in a British Minister.Lord Salisbury and the European ConcertThis makes it necessary that we should consider what position it is that Lord Salisbury has occupied and does occupy in the concert of Europe. He gave us a pretty fair insight into it when he was obliged to explain his policy not in his own language, but referred us to the speeches of foreign ministers. This I will say, that I have never failed, nor has my friend Lord Kimberley nor any of the party, to give to the Government in office fair play, aye, and more than fair play, in support of their action as the chosen representatives of the nation. That halcyon of peace, the Under-Secretary for Foreign Affairs, after the general election, proclaimed that all the elements of discord abroad would be immediately dispelled, and that at the voice of the Neptune of Downing Street there would be a great calm. Unfortunately since that period we have had nothing but a succession of hurricanes, and then the note was changed. He next said, \u2018Oh yes, there are terrible storms, but the proof of a superb Foreign Minister is the grand way he gets out of them.\u2019 But does he get out of them in a grand way? That is the question. I have given credit always to Lord Salisbury when it seemed that credit was due. (A Voice \u2013 \u2018That is not often.\u2019) Wait a minute. Where we have to condemn let us be just. I have never sought to weaken the hands of the Foreign Minister, to whatever party he belonged, when he was carrying out a policy which was worthy of the nation which he represented. In his dealings with America, in the arbitration treaty and the settlement of the quarrel about Venezuela, Lord Salisbury did well, and we applauded and we supported him in spite of the early errors in his management of the discussion. There he was acting alone, he was not acting under the dictation of foreign Powers. But then we were told that Lord Salisbury dominates the councils of Europe - that the concert waits upon his nod. What a fatal boast! Was the decision of the concert of Europe by which Armenia was abandoned to its fate - when the Christians were sur­rendered to the assassins from whom we had pledged our word to defend them - was that a decision inspired by Lord Salisbury? No, it was not. I do Lord Salisbury the justice to believe that he did what he could to avert this undying shame which has come upon Europe and to Great Britain. If the concert had forbidden those crimes, Armenia would have been saved. If the concert had blockaded Turkey as they are doing Crete those horrors at which, as Lord Salisbury said, the world turned pale, might have been averted. Lord Salisbury says, \u2018I could do nothing because the concert would not have it.\u2019 But that is not dominating the council. Lord Salisbury has apologised for his failure by pleading his impotence, but you cannot rely upon your impotence and at the same time claim your predominance. If Lord Salisbury really did dominate and does dominate the councils of Europe there can be no language too strong to condemn his conduct. If he is to be excused it is on his own allegation that he could not help himself and that he is the victim of an irresistible mandate, and he must get some foreign minister to explain it for him. To my mind this nation has never been exposed to greater humiliation than when it finds itself chained and coerced, by the menace of wars in which it has no concern, to abstain from doing that which it is under the highest obligations of honour to do and is compelled to do the things which its conscience condemns. What a spectacle! The Prime Minister of England sitting in the midst of the concert of Europe like the cat in the adage, \u2018letting I dare not wait upon I would.\u2019 For Heaven\u2019s sake let the friends of Lord Salisbury acquit him of all responsibility for a policy which he does not pretend to defend, and let his supporters rely upon his im­potence and not brag of his predominant power. There was a moment in the concert of Europe when Lord Salisbury stood out last summer against the blockade of Crete; he stood out and prevailed, and if he had stood out now he would have prevailed. Concerts of the Powers of Europe are numerous in the records of history. They may be good things or they may be bad things - that depends on the principles on which they are founded and the objects at which they aim. At the commencement of this century, after the great French war, there was a combination which was called by the title of the Holy Alliance. The principles of the Holy Alliance were these - to maintain peace in Europe and the integrity of all the despotic thrones. That was the basis of the Holy Alliance. The then Tory Government of the Duke of Wellington and Lord Castlereagh declined to enter it or to have anything to do with it. That is exactly the principle which is put for­ward in the forefront of this concert. The Powers then talked of the Holy Alliance and the peace of Europe, but the real object was to guarantee despotism.The Integrity of the Ottoman EmpireYou have heard from the trained experience of my noble friend, who has for so many years served this country in responsible posi­tions, you have heard from him the opinion that he has formed, and which is shared by all his colleagues. I speak for them, too, and I am sure I speak for you all - that we have done with the integrity of the Ottoman Empire; that we will be parties to no policy which takes that principle for its basis. And yet that is the avowed basis of the present concert of Europe. What is it the French Minister, who is our only authority, says on that subject? I will quote you his words. He said \u2018It rests on two essential ideas: the integrity of the Ottoman Empire is the principle, and the concert of the Powers is the means.\u2019 That is sufficiently distinct. He goes on: \u2018This is why Europe in its wisdom refuses the annexation of Crete to Greece - it would be a breach of the Ottoman Empire.\u2019 Lord Salisbury has sent us to Caesar and to Caesar we have gone. There is the exposition of the principle of the concert of Europe. I have no respect for the integrity of the Ottoman Empire, and yet that is the preamble of the Note addressed by Great Britain and the rest of the Powers to Turkey the other day. In my opinion the pursuit of such an object is contrary to the convictions and to the conscience of the British nation. It is not an object for which we are prepared to use the forces of the Crown, either alone or at the bidding of any other Power. It was this principle of the integrity of the Ottoman Empire which was put forward in order to justify the betrayal of the Armenians, by which all the pledges which Europe had given, and England had given in particular, were falsified. Yes, which were falsified, because it was said it would be a breach of the integrity of the Ottoman Empire, a breach far more to be honoured than the observ­ance. That is the first result of this basis of the concert. It is, as I have just read to you from the words of the French Minister, in the name of this same principle that the annexation of Crete to Greece has been prohibited under the threat of universal war. And by whom is it prohibited? As Lord Kimberley has reminded you, by Russia, who took from Turkey more than half her European dominions and a great part of her Asiatic territory; by Austria, who took Herzegovina and Bosnia; by France, who took Tunis; by Germany, who says she has no interest in the matter at all; and by England, who possessed itself of Cyprus and Egypt. These are the Powers who, in the name of the integrity of the Ottoman Empire, have betrayed Armenia, and are about to blockade Crete. The whole thing is a pretence, as my noble friend has said. It is a pretence; yes, it is hypocrisy; it is a sham. No one believes it, no one desires it. They are not thinking of the integrity of the Ottoman Empire at all; they are only thinking of what each of them will get out of its spoils. In my opinion, every breach of that integrity is so much gain for mankind. No one has condemned this policy more loudly than Lord Salisbury. He has said, and said truly, that the policy we have pursued for so many years was an error, a mischievous error, and that we have been putting money on the wrong horse. Well, I hope that form of wager will be pronounced to be internationally illegal. Who is going to war for the integrity of the Ottoman Empire? Certainly not Great Britain. No Government that proposed it would survive for a day. If the Powers are so fearful of war, and so ardent for peace, why do not they keep the peace? It is so easy not to cut one another\u2019s throats. There­fore, why should we be told that if we do what we have undertaken to do for Armenia, if we rejoice that Greece has delivered Crete - why should we be told that the consequence of this is that all these great and peace-loving Powers will instantly set to work to kill one another. That is to me a proposition totally unin­telligible. On the 9th November, 1895, we thought it was all right. Lord Salisbury made a speech at the Guildhall, and declared that the concert of Europe was unanimous in its resolution to enforce reforms in Turkey. He invoked the judgment of Providence against the Sultan. Well, Providence, from Lord Salisbury\u2019s point of view, was not expected, I imagine, to guarantee the integrity of the Ottoman Em­pire. Very much the reverse. He indicated coercive measures against Turkey, and we did believe Lord Salisbury had a potent and beneficial influence in the concert of Europe, and we applauded and supported him then. Then the whole thing was changed in 1896, and he declared his impotence, that he could do nothing because the concert would neither do nor allow anything to be done for Armenia. And Lord Salisbury said he submitted because he had to submit. I do not say he could have done otherwise in the circumstances in which he found himself. The integrity of the Ottoman Empire was too much for him then. Then came the case of Crete. After a brief remonstrance, Lord Salisbury found himself obliged to concur in a pottering scheme, framed on the integrity principle, which ignominiously failed, as it was sure to fail, because it was founded on the notion that Turkey could or would be reformed. The Sultan, whose integrity was guaranteed, laughed at the concert, and he laughs at them still. He laughs with impunity because they proclaim that if anyone meddles with him they will wage a universal war. But if they had ever been as ready, as I said before, to blockade Turkey as they have been to blockade Crete, they might have done something for the good of mankind; but when it becomes a question of coercing the Turks, then they say, \u2018God forbid! We shall all go to war with one another.\u2019 The Action of GreeceBut while the six Ambassadors together at Constantinople and their representatives at Crete were fumbling and pottering and doing nothing there came in another Power - not a great Power, but a small Power, a brave Power, a free Power - which dared everything for the emancipation of its oppressed compatriots, and Greece has achieved the object she had in view, and has rescued the Cretan people from the heel of the Turk, and has dispensed, we hope for ever, with his integrity. And now it is Greece that is to be coerced, and the British Fleet, that Fleet of which we are all so justly proud, is to be an instrument in the coercion of Greece. Well, the Powers may destroy Greece. They have the might, Greece has the right, but her fame and her name and her work will endure. Mark this great difference between the case of Armenia and that of Greece. The case of Armenia was sad enough, but there at least we were only the passive and reluctant accomplices in the fate of that unhappy race. But here we are to be the active agents of a policy which is not ours. In the name of the integrity of the Ottoman Empire we are bidden to crush the champions of an oppressed people. Is it not time that we should take our stand? What, we ask, what are to be the limits of our submis­sion and our co-operation in this anti-crusade? Are we to be ordered by other Powers to take arms and strike down any people who may endanger that precious treasure, the integrity of the Ottoman Empire? If so we shall have enough to do. It will be an honourable task and one worthy of the British nation! It is easy for us to speak, but it is for Greece in this crisis of her fate to decide what she is to do. We ought not to forestall her judgment. We ought to say and do nothing which shall imperil her safety and her fortune. In her last Note, as Lord Kimberley has reminded you, she complied with almost all the demands made upon her. She has suspended her claim for annexation and leaves that to the judgment ultimately of the Cretan people. She has consented to withdraw her fleet. She has offered to place her troops under the control of the Powers. To these offers of accommodation - these fair offers - no reply has been given. (\u2018Shame.\u2019) I say it is a shame. They have not attempted to make terms with Greece. Per­haps no reply was permitted. That, I think, is very probable, and the only answer, as we heard in the House of Lords last night, to these proposals of Greece has been the declaration of blockade. We do not know what a day may bring forth, but we pray that this shame may yet be averted. It is Greece, and Greece alone, that has given freedom to Crete. But at least we can enter our protest in this great represen­tative gathering of the Liberal party, in the name of this great and free nation, against our being made the unwilling partners in a policy of which the sole practical outcome has been the fate of Armenia and the coercion of Greece.

aVSir James Reckitt, ladies and gentlemen, I am deeply moved by the cordial greeting of this magnificent assembly. I accept it as conveying to me who come straight from the House of Commons the recognition by combatant Liberals in all parts of the country of the gallant fight which is being maintained against heavy odds in that House in the defence of the Liberal cause. But I am well aware there is somewhat more. However I may desire - and I am exceedingly and sincerely desirous - to say as little as I can about myself. I cannot be blind to the fact that your cordiality is in some part at least addressed to myself personally, who have been recently invested through the great kindness of my Parliamentary colleagues with the function of speaking for them in the application of our principles to the politics of the day. That is a high and responsible position, the occupier of which is entitled to claim the generous confidence of the party at large, and he will not claim it in vain. Our party is not an inert and mechanical party; it is a party which moves and thinks, and therefore, to speak its mind is not the simple thing altogether that it may appear to be to one man talking with his neighbour at the street corner, or to another lounging in the armchair at a club, or even to a third writing an able article for a newspaper. But, ladies and gentlemen, difficult as it may be, there is a straight and a sure way. Here, as in other places, the highway furnishes the safest travelling; short cuts and devious bypaths, however tempting, may lead astray; and it is in the application of sound Liberal doctrine honestly and straightforwardly to the questions of the day that will be found the truest and at the same time the most convenient and the most expedient course for any one who tries to express the prevalent Liberal opinion of the country.Party \u2018Differences\u2019Acting thus, ladies and gentlemen, there need be no doubt or fear. I have never believed, for my part, in the cleavages and discords of which we have heard so much within our party. Differences there are, and always will be, but they are differences as to methods and opportunities - they very rarely touch principle - and such as they are they can be easily exaggerated. Ardent minds among us, inspired by some deep conviction, are apt to set things out of their true perspective, and in a large party such as ours there cannot fail to exist two or three gentle­men whose love of variety, or shall I say of notoriety, and even of pure, unadulterated mischief, may lead them to make the most of such little differences as they can discover. But those friends of ours who so disport and amuse themselves - we know them, we understand them, and we disregard them. But, for the most part, I observe that it is hostile speakers and writers who are especially exercised and shocked by the divisions they impute to us, and really I think we need not grudge those gentlemen the squalid enjoyment they may derive from the contemplation of that imaginative spectacle. But let me come to close quarters with this matter. Mr. Chairman. What are the main points upon which we are supposed to be at variance among ourselves? They are the question of the government of Ireland and the question of foreign policy. By your leave I will say something of them, the one after the other.The Irish Question Now, what is the position of us Liberals with regard to the government of Ireland I say \u2018of us Liberals\u2019 because we need not concern ourselves as to what the opinions of the Tories may be. On the Irish question we are confronted by the demand for self-government constitutionally put forth by the Irish people in 1885, expressed by a majority of four-fifths of their members in the House of Commons, repeated in 1886, again in 1892, and again in 1895. Never let us lose sight, in this question, of the change that took place in 1885. Down to that date, through all the years of this century, the old-established mode of governing Ireland by an alterna­tion of bribes and coercion Acts - and I do not know which is the more demoralising to a free people - this old system had the support in Parliament of a majority of the members from Ireland. But in 1885, for the first time, the franchise was extended, the people could speak with their full voice, and they immediately demanded the abolition of the old system and the grant of self-government. How can we, how can any man who has imbibed and assimilated true Liberal doctrine, ignore a demand so put forward, provided it be a solid demand, main­tained year after year, and not a mere caprice of the moment; and provided also it be not hurtful to Ireland or dangerous to the Empire? Hurtful to Ireland? That is an allegation of which we can hear no more now, because the Unionist party last year passed a Bill for the better government of Ireland in local affairs which involved and con­ceded the fitness of the Irish people to manage them; and, as for the Empire, no man can deny that it would be a cause of strength rather than of weakness to remove the canker of Irish discontent from its heart. And the supremacy of Parliament we hear talked of? Why, it has been amply secured, and secured with the full consent of the Irish leaders.The Irish Demand On this point I saw the other day a few words from one of those leaders which appeared to me to be so striking that if you will have patience with me I should like to quote them. \u2018You are told that not only the integrity of the Empire, but the supremacy of the Imperial Parliament would be endangered. I shall show you that neither the one nor the other will be harmed. The statutory Legisla­ture which we have accepted is not like Grattan\u2019s Parliament, a supreme, co-ordinate Parliament, but it is a subordinate one. The Legislature that we have accepted will have only power to deal with exclusively domestic Irish business. Grattan\u2019s Parliament had power to deal with Imperial affairs, and it repeatedly exercised that power. It had power to object to foreign wars undertaken by Great Britain. It had separate power to address the Crown against those wars. It had power to refuse supplies for the maintenance of the Army and Navy. The new Legislature will have none of these powers, but we shall have a more valuable power for our own interests, exclusively apart from Imperial affairs, which Grattan\u2019s Parliament had not. We shall have the power of appointing and controlling our own execu­tive government, and no Legislature, no Parliament, is worth a rush, or can secure the respect of those whom it governs, unless it has that power which is proposed to be given to us un\u000a\u000ader Mr. Gladstone\u2019s Bill.\u2019 Ladies and gentlemen, these are the words of Mr. Parnell himself in 1886, in the full plenitude of his power, and is it not surprising that they should be now so completely forgotten by the handful of men who strut and swell under the cover of his name? These being the elements of the case, how do we stand? We have a constitutional demand to which you and I as Democrats cannot refuse to listen. We have a desire for self government which you and I as Liberals must see to be the basis of good order and prosperity. We have a recognition of the patriotic feeling of nationality of which we and those who have gone before us have been the champions again and again. And we see the supremacy of the Imperial power and Parliament fully maintained. Why, gentlemen, how then can we, as long as we use the name of Liberal - how can we abandon, as they invite us to do, our Irish policy? We will remain true to the Irish people as long as the Irish people are true to themselves.The Position of Home RuleTwice we have essayed to embody this policy in a statute, and twice we have been foiled. I am not by any means sure that the next constructive effort will come, or ought to come, from us; but we are invited, nay, we are summoned, to place this in the front, before all other measures, and to promise it precedence whenever we are in a position to initiate great legislative changes. I repudiate the necessity, the expediency, aye, and the possibility, of any such promise. Putting aside the question of what is wise or unwise, I declare it to be impossible. It would be impossible for us to lay down any fixed programme for our action at the time when it becomes again in our power to act. Priority must depend upon the circumstances of the day, upon the feeling of the nation, upon the temper of the party, and, above all things, upon the amount and the quality of the party majority. I remember reading an account of a conference which was held in Constantinople immediately after the battle of Navarino between the Grand Vizier and the allied Ministers. The Ministers were not very sure whether the Turks had heard of the battle having taken place, and therefore to be safe they put their interrogatory in a hypothetical form, and they asked the Turkish Minister, if such a thing had taken place, what view he would take of it. The Turkish states­man\u2019s reply was this. He said, \u2018In my country we never proceed to give a name to a child until its sex has been ascertained.\u2019 Now, Mr. Chairman, that is exactly my view of this question of a programme for the future. Why was it that the two Liberal Governments, which were in power from 1892 to 1895, although they carried some great and notable reforms, yet accomplished very much less than was expected and hoped of them? Why, it was because the instrument with which they had to accomplish their reforms was inadequate for the purpose - that is to say, the majority in the House of Commons was inadequate. Everything - to use the Turk\u2019s most apposite illustration - will depend upon the sex of the majority with which the constituencies furnish us. It may be a masculine majority, great in stature, strong of limb and muscle, fit for a great enterprise; or it may be a feminine majority, equally excellent in heart, clear in mind, and full of generous emotions, but lacking the physical power to move great legislative weights. No, until we know what it is, or what it is likely to be, we cannot definitely assign its duties.The Liberal Party and ImperialismBut now let me pass to the other of those questions on which we are supposed to be divided, namely, foreign affairs. But is it so? Let us see. The greatest of British interests is peace. Yes, but that does not advance us much, for how is peace to be secured? I should say by pursuing a policy towards our neighbours of firmness, of moderation, and of commonsense; I am sure not by either arrogance or weakness, and, least of all, by alternation of the one with the other. We hear a great deal in these days of Imperialism, and there are men who seem to think that by calling themselves Imperialists they have added a cubit to their stature. But the meaning of the word varies indefinitely according to the disposition of the man who uses it. If an Imperialist means a man who would maintain at the highest pitch the power by land and sea of the Empire; who would secure perfect safety for these islands from hostile attack, but who is not content to confine his view to these islands; who would preserve the territorial integrity and interests of the Empire; who would guard our rights of trade either within the Empire or beyond its bounds; and who would strengthen by every means in his power the ties that bind us to our kinsmen in every quarter of the globe - if that is to be an Imperialist, then, ladies and gentlemen, there is not a man here, there is not a man in this great Liberal meeting, who is not as unflinching an Imperialist as those who have the word always on their lips. We are not afraid of the responsibilities of Empire, we are proud to be the guardians of the heritage handed down by our fathers, nay, we do not shrink from adding to it if duty or honour compels us; but we abjure the vulgar and bastard Imperialism of irritation, and provocation, and aggression, of clever tricks and manoeuvres against neighbours, and of grabbing everything, even if we have no use for it ourselves, for the mere pleasure of preventing other people from getting it. Now, I would ask you, are not these sentiments that I have just expressed common to all of us in the party, whatever section of it we may belong to? On what, then, are we to say we are fundamentally divided from each other? Egypt and the Soudan I should be sorry to set any limit to the governing capacity of our people and race, but at the same time it is with no small relief and satisfaction that we must see the gate closed upon one at least of the great spheres of expansionist ambition. We see the partition of Africa pretty well brought to an end. We see the whole of that huge continent, except two small States which possess a certain degree of organised Government, parcelled out among the great European nations, and in this way an end is put to the prospect or temptation of further expansion. I have never been one, for my part, of those who have found fault with our position in Egypt. We are there in fulfilment of a plain duty, of an obligation which in honour we could not refuse to discharge, and our presence in Egypt, and our influence in its government, have been amply justified by the splendid work done during our occupation - work which is admirable in the interest not of any pecuniary advantage to ourselves, nor even of material benefit alone to the country, but in view of the happiness and the moral welfare of the Egyptian people themselves. And while that work is unfinished there we must remain. But when we turn from Egypt to the Soudan we find that for good or for evil we have made ourselves responsible for a vast tropical region in which European health cannot be maintained, and where there are scarcely to be found the elements of civilisation. Step by step the British Government has been led to the assumption of this great duty. The Liberal party has from first to last declined to share the responsibility of recommending it to the country. It has now been assumed, and we have to deal with it. Yet I wonder whether those most exuberant in welcoming with enthusiasm this great enterprise have thoroughly realised what it means and with what resources it is undertaken.Great Britain\u2019s ResponsibilitiesWe have our hands pretty full already in other parts of the world. We had a good deal on hand before, and recently in China indefinite vistas of difficulty have opened before us. We need not, as I have said, be faint-hearted, because of our limitless confidence in the courage and capacity of our countrymen, but what I wish to point out to you is that there are bounds even to our resources for these purposes, and that, at any rate, our resources, if we are to be success­ful in them, will require to be husbanded rather more carefully than they have been in recent years. In the classic words of the music-hall ditty round which so hot a controversy has floated, we are told that \u2018We have the ships, we have the men, and we have the money, too.\u2019 The ships, yes, Sir James Reckitt, we have the ships, and we can add to them as many as our circumstances demand; but, after all, while our strength lies in the command of the sea, and while a strong naval base is essential to us, it is not very easy to discern the immediate benefit and advantage of a sea base for an Empire in Mid Africa. But, leaving the ships, let us come to the men; let us think for a moment about the men. The British Army Our Army, which has more to do in the way of the duty of garrisoning tropical stations than all the other armies of the earth put together, is a voluntary army, and therefore a limited army. Its system of organisation is designed and, in my belief, is well calcu­lated, to meet the duties required of it at the smallest cost, and, what is further, with the smallest withdrawal of useful labour from the service of the country. But by the duties already imposed upon it, it is strained to the utmost. If not at the very limit, we are amazingly near the limit of our recruiting power. The inhabitants of our new Empire are a warlike people divided into different tribes; our manner of upholding our position among them is not unnaturally the process of using one tribe against another, and of taking the assistance of some in order to strike down the resistance of others - a process which sometimes has unpleasant consequences, as we have seen; but a day may come when, either through racial pre­judice, racial sympathies and antipathies, or religious fanaticism, these tribes may combine against us, and, of course, then we must always be ready to fall back upon the British forces. Time only will show what demands these will entail upon our military resources. All I can say is that it constitutes, as you will see, a new and a very important element in the case. But, after all, Sir James Reckitt, it will be said, \u2018What does it matter? We are so rich. We can always pay our way out of any complication of that sort.\u2019 That is our way - when we are not dangling our money-bags in the face of other people we are jingling the coins in our pocket with great self\u2011complacency.The Czar\u2019s ProposalsThe other day, Mr. Chairman, the Emperor of Russia with a courage and a wisdom, and actuated by a generous motive which have won for him the admiration of the world, proposed to the Great Powers that they should confer with him and see whether it was not possible that the condition of warl\u000a\u000aike peace by which the equipoise, the European equipoise, is at present maintained, might not be exchanged for a peace founded upon good will and confidence among the nations. Whether much tangible result comes immediately from the proposal or not, ladies and gentlemen, it marks a new era, at all events, in European history. But at once this announcement was met by the assertion that it was quite natural and proper on the part of the Emperor of Russia, whose Government was supposed to be in financial straits, and it was reasonable and was to be expected that Austria and Italy, so heavily taxed, Germany, with the burden of its huge army, France, with its great national debt - that all these coun­tries should be only too glad if they could to jump at such a proposal, but that we Britishmen were superior to such necessities. We might give a platonic support to the idea, but we might be thankful that we were not practically in need of it, and here, again, we fall to the slapping of our breeches pockets. Public Expenditure Well, but possibly a more sober view will present itself to us if we look to the facts of our public expenditure in recent years, and if we see what the financial position is to which those facts point. Ladies and gentlemen, I leave you to infer with what feeling I say that I have been thirty years in the House of Commons. It is rather a saddening statement, perhaps, for me to make, but it has its advan­tages on this occasion, because thirty years are easily divisible by ten, and from 1868 down to 1898, which is the most recent year of which we have the complete figures, we have exactly thirty years, and therefore we can compare the three decades of time. In those happy days when I was a raw recruit in the House of Commons, the expenditure of the country was 71¼ millions. In 1878 it had risen to 82½ millions, an increase, as you will observe, of 11¼ millions. In 1888 the increase had not been so great, it was then 87½ millions - being an increase in the ten years of five millions. In 1898, having been 87½ millions in 1888, it was 116 millions, thus rising in ten years by 28½ millions. I include in the figures, of course, money spent on local taxation, amounting to 9½ millions; 116 millions was the expenditure in 1898, and therefore in those thirty years the increase had been 44¾ millions, and the increase was on an original expenditure of 71¼ millions. In speaking of these things, both in expenditure and in revenue, we use sometimes the phrase of \u2018leaps and bounds.\u2019 This is not \u2018leaps and bounds.\u2019 There are little ebbings and little flowings, but I think it is better described as a steady and relentless tide of expenditure.The Cost of ToryismThe prosperity of the country has been great, otherwise we could not have endured it at all, but we should long ago have run into a deficit had it not been for the Liberal Budget of 1894. That Budget, Sir Michael Hicks Beach stated last year, would bring in to him, over the sum that was raised on the same head of income before the Budget was introduced, an actual increase of £4,400,000 a year. Well, how have they spent the £4,400,000 a year? Have they used it to mitigate taxation, or to ease the springs of industry? Not at all. Three millions have gone as a gift to the landed and clerical interests, and the rest has been mopped up, together with many other millions, in generally increased expenditure. Out of this last decade of ten years we Liberals are responsible for three years. It will be well to see how we stood in those three years. In our three years there was an increase owing to the addition we made to the strength of the Navy of £2,100,000, but we left the expenditure at the end of our time, when we left office, at £101,740,000. That was in 1895, and last year it was £117,640,000, so that in those three years there was an absolute increase of £15,900,100, or, roughly speaking, 16 millions sterling.This Year\u2019s Balance-Sheet We have not yet the complete figures for the present year, although we are very nearly at the end of the year, and therefore we cannot speak of it, still less of the Budget for next year; but it is safe to say, at all events, that there has been no evidence of any great desire for retrenchment, because since Parliament met we have been presented with Supplementary Estimates. The Supplementary Estimates include all those little unconsidered trifles which, in framing the Estimates of the year, had been omitted accidentally, or any services of an unavoidable or unexpected kind which had arisen during the year. The Supplementary Estimates now on the table of the House of Commons amount to £1,859,914. And as to the new Estimates we have very little information except with regard to the Army Estimates, which have gone up according to one calculation about a million, while we hear of great further charges coming in the distance in the shape of loans for military purposes. I observe that already the friends and counsellors of the Government, in the Press and elsewhere, are divided in their recommendation of the sources from which the void in the revenue can be filled. There are some of these kind friends who think that a penny or two on the income tax would be the best thing to impose. There are others who view with pleasure and satisfaction the prospect of reviving the corn duty, to a reasonable extent to begin with; and there are yet others who think that sugar is a commodity which is too cheap and might be taxed, and its price accordingly raised. Gentlemen, in the middle of all these charming and alluring suggestions, do not you envy the position, the happy position, of the Chancellor of the Exchequer? As I have said, we have not the figures before us by which we can judge of the financial policy of the Govern­ment. We have not got them yet, but we see the drift of their expenditure; and I would say this, we may be a rich country, our resources may be immense, but they are not illimitable. And no treasury, however abounding, would suffice to fulfil demands so merciless as those in the high tide of which we seem now to stand. Liberal Domestic PolicyNow I turn to what are distinctly called domestic topics, although I know nothing in the whole range of politics so immediately and intimately concerning the domestic happiness and prosperity of the mass of the people as these very financial, questions with which I have been dealing. Now, there is no need for us Liberals to make a new profession of faith. We stand upon the old lines. If anybody re­quires to make a profession of faith it must rather be the party, if such party exists, which has no principles that it can avow, and which keeps itself in power merely by picking up here and there a few miscel­laneous projects of legislation, some new and strange, others old and stale by which, peradventure, they think they may capture a few votes. The first and main object of our Liberal reforms is to strengthen the democracy. I can perfectly understand and appreciate the position of those who dislike the extensions that have been given to the suffrage and have resisted them; who regard them not only with regret, but with fear for the future. That I can perfectly understand, but what I cannot understand is what safety or advantage they can see in maintaining - having democratised our system so far as we have gone - what advantage they can see in maintaining small provisions which are anomalies and inequalities, which are of an irritating and unfair character, and in the end lead to disquiet and danger. We wish to make the whole system of Parliamentary representation a system whereby the mind of the country is evoked more completely and more equitably.The House of Lords But, above all, ladies and gentlemen, we desire to limit the power of the Second Chamber of the Legislature to overbear the appointed representatives of the people - that Second Chamber, which has nothing of representation about it, unless, as we were invited to do the other day, you count the Bishops as standing in it for the representative quality. This is the task, ladies and gentlemen, which we have set ourselves to, and neither threats nor sneers shall hinder us in it. We have been told, and we probably shall be told again, that we are wasting on the mere mending of machinery energies which other and wiser men would devote to measures directly profitable and, especially, pecuniarily profitable, to the mass of the people. A most foolish and short-sighted criticism, ladies and gentlemen, and a libel upon the intelligence of our countrymen. If our object is to produce from our legislative factory sterling, solid, social reforms, fraught with lasting benefit to the community, then the surest and shortest way to success is to perfect and strengthen the working machine in order to bring into full play the opinions and the desires of all orders of men among us. But I quite admit that if our object was different it would be com­paratively a waste of time - if our object merely was to produce some showy pinchbeck schemes, made for purposes of advertisement and sale, and not for use. We have not very far to go to find something of that kind. Social QuestionsGentlemen, there is probably no social question at the present day more loudly appealing to our feelings than the condition of the aged poor. Putting aside the higher spiritual sphere with which the great religious communities among us concern themselves, I should say, as it seems to me, the three subjects which most keenly act upon the sympathies of right-thinking men among us are these. There are three of them. The first is temperance, and all that I would say upon that subject is this - that I hope we shall not show ourselves too pedantic, too obstinate, in pursuing some particular method which we may sincerely consider the best, and I earnestly trust that the result of the inquiry and report by Lord Peel\u2019s Commission may be that we shall have strongly supported by the authority of that Commission some provisions at all events which may do much to alleviate the evils which we all of us so greatly deplore. The second subject to which I would refer is the question of the housing of the very poor. I am not speaking of the question which affects what are called artisans\u2019 dwellings, although I do not wish to disparage their importance also. What I think rather has touched the heart of the country is the story we have heard of the effect of overcrowding in our large cities - aye, and in many places which are not large cities - and the earnest desire felt to do something to cure that great evil. Old-Age PensionsAnd the third question is that of poor old age. There are at least two distinct ideas as to the cure or alleviation which may be found for the evils affecting the aged poor. The one turns to a reform, a humanising of the Poor Law system, which would make it at once kinder and less humiliating than the system which is in practice at present; and there is the other idea of annuities or pensions to be secured after a certain age. We have all known for years that there were great difficulties in the way of this last proposal. We have only to think of it for a moment to see how many those difficulties are. There is the question of the source from which money for the purpose is to be obtained. There is the question whether the benefit to be conferred should be given to all or only to a certain number, and whether that number shall be the specially needy or the specially worthy. There is the question whether the beneficiary should be made to contribute. There is the danger of invalidating the sense and practice of prudence and thrift throughout our population, and there is the difficulty of interfering with the friendly societies, which have been established with so much advantage among us. These and other points show us how complicated a question this is, and the consequence has been that most of us, however keenly in favour of some scheme of the kind, have always spoken guardedly because we knew how difficult the question was. But there are, and always have been since the dawn of the world, certain people who are ready to rush in where more prudent intelligences are afraid to tread. The very party whose chief spokesman has now such contempt for our old traditional Liberal method of building up our social reforms upon constitutional support - that very party plunged six years ago into this troubled sea. \u2018Apply to the Nearest Liberal Unionist Agent\u2019They saw no difficulty. They produced a plan which I referred to the other night in the House of Commons, which was Mr. Chamber­lain\u2019s plan. I do not know that I need read it to you, but they gave it in all its details with the figures and the conditions, and we were told that further information would be obtained from any Liberal Unionist agent. So easy was it that any Liberal Unionist agent could give it. Not, be it observed, any Conservative agent, not a Unionist agent, but a Liberal Unionist agent. It is a patent in which all the partners of the concern do not share. It is the peculiar possession of the Liberal Unionist agent and his employer. Well, really it was unnecessary to apply to the Liberal Unionist agent or to anyone else for more information, so explicit was it. All you had to do was to get the latest census return and find the number of people of particular ages, to send out for a boy in the third or fourth standard of arith­metic - you had better take him from the Board school, because in the Church schools they are so much concerned with his doctrines and his ritual that they may neglect such a humdrum subject as arithmetic - then, when the boy has done your subtractions, your addi­tions, and your multiplications, be you away to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, who is full of millions, and the thing is done. Well, yes, but what are we to say of the votes which were obtained at the General Election on the faith of this definite, fraudulent prospectus? When some poor, over-sanguine gentleman obtains money under false pretences we hand him over to the majesty of the law, and he is ministered to according to the rigours of the law, but of how much greater punishment think you are they deserving who by an explicit promise such as this, never yet repudiated, but with no attempt at fulfilment, filch from the honest elector the usufruct of his birthright? We are told that this promise is yet to be fulfilled. We shall believe it when we see it, but I maintain that a plain promise so direct and circumstantial ought not to have been postponed to the end of a Parliament. It ought to have taken pre­cedence even of the claims of the landlord and the Church schools. And, unfortunately, if the claim is recognised in the fading light of an expiring Parliament, it will not find, although it will require, an over­flowing exchequer, for the surplus money will have gone to the parson and the squire. I withdraw one word, which was a slip of the tongue - the surplus money - for it turns out now that there never was any surplus money. There never was this spare cash, and here is a new vice discovered rather late in that system of doles and subsidies, so contrary to good economy and so demoralising, which the Government have indulged in. It is a new vice to find that we had not the money to do it with after all.The Half-timer Question But while it may be difficult, ladies and gentlemen, even for the genius of Liberal Unionist agents to arrange offhand a scheme of old-age pensions, one thing at least they could do. They could secure for as large a number as possible of the population the advantages of a hale and hearty old age; and how can they do that? By applying themselves to the other end of a man\u2019s existence and seeing that he begins with a healthy and invigorated development of mind and body in youth. If that is so, where was this Government - the special patron of the poor and aged and therefore of the young and growing - on Wednesday last? My friend Mr. Robson brought forward an unanswerable case in favour of raising considerably the age of half-timers in order to prevent the children from having a stunted growth and a feeble constitution as well as a starved education, and the case, as I have said, was unanswerable. The Education Minister himself was a partisan of the case, and said it was unanswerable. It is not an ordinary case, ladies and gentlemen, because we sent this very Education Minister to Berlin - the present Government did a few years ago - and authorised him there, in our name, to promise to the Powers of Europe that we should do this thing, and on the faith of that promise they agreed to make other concessions, which they have made, and we have never made ours. It is quite ludicrous. One would have thought the case was strong enough now, but there is something still to be said. What was this Bill that was introduced? Why, it was word for word, letter for letter, a clause out of the Government\u2019s own Education Bill of two years ago, which we intro­duced as a separate Bill, and yet the Government took no part in the division. They were all, with one exception, absent, were the members of the Cabinet, and they allowed it to go past. The House of Commons carried it against their apathy by 319 votes against 61, and now we shall see what they will do as to the future course of this. Bill. They have it in their power to help it, to say that it shall pass, and they have it in their power to prevent it from passing. It lies with the Government, and how can we believe in the genuineness of the Government\u2019s desire to improve the condition of the people if an opportunity so clear, so urgent, as this is flouted - for what purpose? Everybody knows - for the purpose of saving a few Lancashire seats. The Education QuestionLadies and gentlemen, I have detained you too long, but there are two questions on which I should like to say a very few words - two other subjects that have been before Parliament this Session. The first was before the House of Commons last night. Most of us were absent, having been here attending to the proceedings of the Federation. Our friend, Mr. Lloyd George, a fervid apostle of Liberalism, brought forward the case. We are familiar with the case as it stood, but there has been a new feature added to it within the last year. The case, as it seemed to me, had two branches. In the first place there was a very serious fact that in thousands of rural parishes, and it may be in others, the Nonconformist community see their young men and their young women shut out from any share in one of the noblest and best careers open to an intelligent young man or young woman in this country - namely, the teaching profession - unless they are content to stifle their consciences or to alter their opinions and to conform to doctrines in which they had not been brought up. And the second is, of course, that there is a certain actual influence upon the children in the sectarian atmosphere of schools where no popular element exists in the management. What is the new fact that has come out now, to which our eyes have been opened? It is this. We now discover something of the nature of the doctrine which may be taught in these schools that we did not know before, and also we see how little amenable a large number of the clergy of the Church of England are to the law. Let me say that this is a question on which I have the utmost reluctance to touch. I share the mind of very many people on this subject who are of opinion that the clergy must obey the law, and must be made to obey the law, but at the same time whose spirit and conscience revolts from the imposition in matters of doctrine and ritual of the direct interference of such a body as Parliament. We may have to do it, but it is a distasteful thing to do. As long as the Church is established we must insist on the Queen\u2019s supremacy and uphold the authority of the civil Courts and of Parliament. But what we wonder at is how long it will be ere earnest and honest and good men in the Church discover how much better is liberty than privilege, and find the best solution of this great difficulty in the practice of a free Church in a free State.Taxation of Ground ValuesThe other subject to which I would refer only in a word or two is a motion brought forward by my friend, Mr. Morton, who, I think, is here, probably modestly hiding, as his manner is, in some corner of the platform, upon taxation of land values. There is no subject, I believe, on which a stronger feeling prevails in the country. It is an intolerable injustice that an enhanced value should be given to land by the improvement and development of a locality, while the owner of the pro­perty who reaps the benefit contributes nothing to the cost. That is a plain statement of the case. It is not a question of political opinion - it is a question of mere justice, and we need not be surprised, there­fore, that when Mr. Morton brought it forward the towering majority of the Government in the House of Commons fell to the modest figure of thirty-three. Now, gentlemen, these instances will have sufficed to show you how we are doing our duty to the best of our power in the House of Commons. The proceedings of the last few days show that you in your sphere are alive to your duty. Let us confidently labour each in our own way in the good cause, knowing it is not for indi­viduals, it is not even for a party, that we are striving, not for a party as such - it is for the predominance in the public polity of our country of justice and freedom, and of the spirit of righteousness upon which alone the prosperity and welfare of a people can be surely based.

aVI thank you with all my heart for your cordial greeting.  If I sought to discover the ground of your cordiality I think I should say in the first place that I believe it is a burst of honest, earnest, political feeling, too long restrained and pent up, owing to the circumstances of the time we live in, and especially to the dark cloud of war which has hung over the recent history of our country.  In the second place, I believe you have desired to express your recognition of the services of the Liberal Party in the House of Commons, for whom it is my privilege to speak. And, so far as your plaudits are directed to myself personally, I take them as conveying your forgiveness of my misconduct last year in failing to keep my engagement to meet, at Nottingham, this great society of com­batant Liberals.  I was absent on that occasion, much to my regret, from temporary ill-health, and it only makes me more deeply sensible of your kindness tonight.Fourteen Months Afterwards On that occasion the war in South Africa was the subject which engrossed nearly the whole of your attention.  How astonished any man would have been at Nottingham last year if he had been told that four­teen months afterwards the war in South Africa and the events imme­diately arising out of it would still be overwhelming all other topics.  At that time - in March of last year - we had indeed lived through those terrible weeks of national anxiety which marked the commencement of the war.  We were following with the closest interest the advance, step by step, of our forces into the belligerent territories.  There were some of us who entertained the hope that the whole territories would soon be occupied, and that pacification would follow thereupon; but we have it on the authority of the High Commissioner, the principal agent of British authority in South Africa., that from midsummer onwards there was retrogression instead of advance, and now we find that the troops of our country only occupy the lines of communication and one or two isolated places, that over the greater part of the territory we exercise no authority, and we have nearly all of us frankly given up the attempt to follow and understand the perplexing movement of the forces on either side.The Country Longing for PeaceThe press correspondents have vanished from the scene.  The offi­cial information vouchsafed to us is scrappy, and its items are not always reconcilable with each other.  It is not too much to say that general bewilderment characterises the view of most people of the situation, and where bewilderment is not relieved weariness and sickness are apt to follow.  There still remains the resolve of the country, no doubt, to carry the war to a successful conclusion, but the whole country is longing for peace, and I am happy to say that I think it does not require very much special acuteness to discern a strong desire among our fellow countrymen that when the settlement does come there shall be no trace in it of resentment, of vindictiveness, or of anything that will perpetuate animosity.  This I am convinced is the feeling and desire of the great body of our countrymen, but it is not at all a temperament or an idea congenial to the Minister who directs our colonial affairs.The \u2018Hysterical Nonsense as to Conciliation\u2019 You may have remarked that we sometimes obtain a truer view of an object when it is reflected than when we see it by direct vision, and the inner mind of a man may be best ascertained from some third person who is familiar with it.  Such an indicator of the real meaning of the Colonial Secretary we have in Lord Selborne.  Lord Selborne was for many years associated with the Colonial Secretary in his duties, and he was only recently translated, for urgent family reasons, to be First Lord of the Admiralty. He made a speech the other day in which he used these words. He said, \u2018They heard a great deal of hysterical nonsense as to conciliation.  His own opinion of the best course they could pursue was to proceed by gradual growth of mutual self-esteem.\u2019 \u2018Mutual self-esteem!\u2019 \u2013 \u2018Mutual self-esteem\u2019 is a little difficult to understand.  I am neither a philologer nor a philosopher, and one would require to be a little of both to discover the real meaning of it; but this incomprehensible language is extracted from Lord Selborne under the shock with which he starts back in horror from the idea of conciliation.  \u2018Hysterical nonsense as to conciliation!\u2019  What a sentiment to come from a Minister who has been engaged in the conduct of those delicate affairs!  May we not find in it the key-note of much of the policy which has been pursued?  It is as if one would say, \u2018What is the good of having enemies, either in private life or in public life, or as director of Imperial affairs, if you cannot trample upon them?\u2019Mr. Chamberlain\u2019s SpeechWe are not, however, left to the understudy, because the chief actor has recently appeared upon the scene.  On Friday last the Colonial Secretary addressed his nearest friends and neighbours in Birmingham.  So far as that speech related to his political opponents I propose to take little notice of it.  He appears to have on hand a considerable stale stock of the vituperation with which he bespattered us so freely at the general election.  The echoes of the Town Hall of Birmingham rang with \u2018pro-Boer\u2019 and \u2018Little Englander,\u2019 and the notorious and scan­dalous phrase that anyone who voted against him, forsooth, was giving a vote to the enemies of his country was repeated and insisted upon.  For party purposes I would wish, nothing better than that once a week Mr. Chamberlain should make a speech of this kind.  But if one has any regard for the tone of public life, for the character of the politician, and for the authority and dignity of Ministers, it is deplorable to the last degree.Mr. Chamberlain and the Dutch But there is, I am sorry to say, something much worse and more serious.  We here at home understand the Colonial Secretary; we know his style, and we appreciate the value of his floutings and scold­ings.  But one begins to despair of the settlement of this question, one begins to despair for the stability of our South African empire, when we find the responsible Minister making a violent partisan speech, openly taking sides in colonial politics, and launching a tirade of denun­ciation against the Dutch - the Dutch in the old colonies, who, after all, have been perfectly loyal subjects in the past, and are a majority of the population, and the Dutch in the new colonies, who are a still more overwhelming majority of that population, and whom it is the whole object of our policy - and indeed it is essential to the maintenance of our authority - to convert into loyal fellow citizens in the future.  What becomes of all our hopes for the future when at this critical moment we find the man who inspires and controls our policy going out of his way to rouse that very spirit of antipathy and recrimination which it is his prime duty to discourage?  You and I, like others of our countrymen, are more interested in men of our own race than in others.  We know and appreciate the services and sacrifices and the sorrows of the British party - those who constitute what is known as the British party - at the Cape.  We wish to protect their interests; but it is our belief that their permanent interests and prosperity will be best served by conciliatory action towards their neighbours and fellow subjects, and above all by freeing not only the formal act of settlement, whenever that may come, but also the tone and spirit of its negotiation and administration, from every trace of racial ascendancy. The Attitude and Policy of the Liberal PartyHowever, we may leave it to Mr. Chamberlain to reconcile as best he may with his sense of duty the outburst of violent prejudice in which he indulged.  What more concerns you and me, should be the attitude and policy of the Liberal party in regard to this great question, and on that, with your permission, I should like to say a few words.  For many weeks and months we kept urging that while the war should be spiritedly con­ducted, at the same time no opportunity should be lost of negotiation by the offering of generous terms, including especially the promise of full representative institutions.  Your Federation, by its General Com­mittee at Rugby, played a noble part in promoting that view, and every Liberal in this country is grateful to you for it. Since that most useful declaration of your opinion we have had the negotiations with General Botha. These negotiations failed.  Why did they fail?  We do not know.  We have little or no information. There is much that is left completely in the dark. Two Facts causing SurpriseBut the papers presented disclose two facts which cause great sur­prise.  In the first place, they disclose the fact that, after all that had come and gone, after all the weeks and months of anticipation, when the auspicious moment for colloquy arrived our high officials were found to have no determined plan whatever, to have difficulty in answering the questions addressed to them, and, above all, to differ among themselves.  That was the first cause of surprise.  The second was this.  There were three principal officials involved.  There was the General Officer Commanding, who had the reputation of being a stern and somewhat autocratic soldier.  There was the High Commissioner at Cape Town, and there was the Colonial Secretary in London. Which of these three was the most generous?  It was the soldier.  It was the soldier, who had been thwarted through long weeks by the obstinacy and the provoking tactics of the Boers, who might, therefore, be expected to entertain some feeling of resentment against them, and who had been brought closely into contact with them and knew the nature of the men we should have to deal with when peace was restored. He was the man who proposed the most generous terms.  Next to him in point of leniency came the High Commissioner, who, no doubt, was largely in­fluenced by the\u000a\u000aatmosphere of Cape Town.  And, last of all, stiffest and most unyielding, was the high-handed Minister in Downing Street. The Failure of the Negotiations with General BothaAs I have said, we do not know what the impediments to agreement were, but there are two, at all events, that we may speak of as not improbable.  And may I say here that if we have not inquired, if we have not pushed inquiries in the House of Commons, it has been for this reason - that we have always been cherishing the hope that, for­mally or informally, avowedly or without avowal, some sort of negotia­tions and communications were still going on, and perhaps their success might be prejudiced if close inquiry were made?  But there are two grounds which we may conjecture as not improbable.  It may have been on the question of future government, and that question, indeed, these men, who have been accustomed - imperfectly in one State and perfectly in the other - to enjoy representative institutions, may well have considered to be vital.Self-Government What is our Liberal policy in this matter?  Undoubtedly this - that when hostilities cease there must follow an interval of somewhat irregu­lar government in order to maintain order.  It matters not whether it be conducted under a soldier or under a civilian so long as it is tem­porary and provisional.  But as soon as that is over, and as soon as it can possibly be done, full representative government should be granted - the same as our colonies elsewhere enjoy.  We believe in self-govern­ment.  We treat it not as an odious necessity, not as a foolish theory to which unfortunately the British Empire is committed.  We treat it as a blessing and as a healing, a sobering, and a strengthening influence.  The Government, indeed, think it advisable to interpose a period of Crown Colony government for these new colonies - that is to say, a government either wholly destitute of, or only partly provided with, a representative element, a system which in these days we apply to no men of European race, and which, also, would have none of the tem­porary character which we wish to see.  What is the thing - I want to impress this upon you - what is the thing that lies at the root of this particular questtion?  It is often strangely forgotten.  It is this.  When these communities, which are now at war with us, when they are vanquished, when they are, if you like to put it so, chastened for the mis­\u000a\u000a;deeds committed against us, we are not going to brush them away and have done with them, we are going to take them to our bosom, and the very men who are out on the veldt in arms against us must be made contentedly loyal citizens, in order that peace and prosperity may be attained.  You may be sure that they will never become either con­tented or loyal under a system of government which they at least regard as government by red tape, if not government by barbed wire.The Question of AmnestyBut there is another question, the question of amnesty to the inhabi­tants of Cape Colony, who have joined their kinsmen in the field against us, or those who are known as the Cape rebels. What is the latest and highest official proposal as regards them?  It is this - that they should be allowed to remain in the Transvaal State or the Orange River State unmolested by us if they please, but that if they return to their own homes, to their properties, to their families and to their neighbours in the two old colonies, the rigours of the law shall be applied to them. Was ever a more absurd proposal made?  And I must again remind these high officials of their own policy. They make these two States British colonies, and if that is to be their standing can anything more ridiculous be imagined than that a man, on account of an Imperial crime, shall not be punished or molested in one British colony, but shall be punished if he goes into a neighbouring British colony?  Don\u2019t our Ministers see that amnesty is inevitable?  If they don\u2019t see it I admit it is entirely in keeping with what we have seen in the whole of this business from first to last, where, from the Jameson Raid downwards, in every estimate of the position, in every forecast, in every prophecy they have been wrong.  But if peace were made today with­out amnesty, amnesty would have to follow tomorrow.  Why, then, not take advantage of this necessity?  Why not throw some grace into it?  Why not remove this, which must be a material stumbling block to a settlement?  I will tell you why it must be a material stumbling block.  The whole world would condemn the Boer captains if they thought for a moment of making term for themselves and leaving in the lurch the men who have fought with them.The Cost of the WarI have said we are in the dark in these matters, but there is one point upon which we have been informed of one very solid fact, namely, that the war expenditure is being piled up at the rate of a million and a half a week.  If this meeting lasts a couple of hours there will have been taken from the resources of the country while we are in this hall £18,000.  While our people, with wonderful patience, go about asking each other why so little advance is made, and whether some arrangement is not pos­sible, every month in which they are meeting each other, and wonder­ing, and asking, adds six million pounds to the obligations of this country.  We have no control over and no responsibility for the unreasonable stubbornness or infatuation of the Boers, but we have responsibility for what is done on our own side, and if it should turn out - and all this will be known some day - that this long-drawn and costly delay, costly in money and also costly in life and suffering, is due in any measure to pedantic tenacity and narrowness of view on the part of those who are acting as our agents, then I say that there will be a terrible day of reckoning.  I come to the conclusion that if the Cabinet were learning to write, and I was their schoolmaster, there are two maxims that I should set in their copybooks.  One is \u2018Act so that the Boers may become willing citizens,\u2019 and, the other is \u2018Remember that each week costs £1,500,000.\u2019  These are Budget days, and our thoughts naturally turn to finance. The financial outlook is appalling. A Chamberlain \u2018Inaccuracy\u2019I must here repudiate the idea which is sometimes attributed to us that we have asserted that our countrymen would run away from the obligation they have incurred. Mr. Chamberlain, in one of his inaccu­racies the other night, attributed an opinion of the sort to me.  He said, speaking of me: \u2018He says that not one in a thousand would have voted as they did at the last general election if they had known what the war involves.\u2019  I did not say anything of the sort.  There is no foundation whatever for imputing that sentiment, be it a right one or a wrong one, to me. What I said was this - this was on the 24th April - \u2018Not one man in a thousand among us, if he had foreseen all that had happened or the situation that was still before us, would have approved the steps which on April 24, two years ago, were in process of being taken.\u2019 And so I repeat that opinion, that if this country had known two years ago, when the negotiations as to the Outlanders\u2019 grievances and the franchise and so forth were in progress, if this country had known or had had any idea of what were the possibilities of a particular line of conduct, they would not have approved, and if I have said that not one in a thousand among us would do it, I am quite certain that the one\u000a\u000aman would not be any of Mr. Chamberlain\u2019s colleagues, and I doubt very much if he would be Mr. Chamberlain himself.  Our contention is exactly in the opposite direction.  What we find fault with on the part of the Govern­ment is that they are not exacting enough from the present taxpayer, and that they are putting too much over as a burden upon posterity.  But now let us consider this matter.  That the war, which was to have cost ten millions sterling, should have cost 150 millions already is startling enough.The Alarming Advance in Normal ExpenditureBut there is something which to my mind is almost more alarming.  It is that, apart from the war altogether, the present Government have allowed the normal expenditure so largely to increase. War is at all times a hideous thing.  War expenditure is deplorable.  It may be partly pure waste through misconduct; it may be every penny of it pure waste if the object attained could have been secured without it.  But a war ultimately sooner or later does come to an end, and there remains a fixed charge upon the country.  You provide for it.  You know what you have to provide.  We are already charged with interest to the tune of two millions a year.  But there it lies. Annual expenditure, on the other hand, if allowed to mount up by millions, cannot be suddenly stopped or checked or reduced.  It survives.  It is a living expenditure and not a dead expenditure.  How do we stand in regard to this normal expenditure? The Tory HeritageThe Government have not been badly treated by their predecessors. Sir Michael Hicks-Beach himself told us that the taxes as they stood when they (the Conservatives) came into office have increased in their yield by no less than sixteen millions sterling.  The revenue from the taxes that we left them to manipulate has increased on the old basis by sixteen millions sterling!  Such has been the prosperity and the elas­ticity of the revenue.  But this does not represent the whole sum which has been placed at the disposal of the Chancellor of the Exchequer.  There was a surplus in 1855-6 of £4,200,000.  Then he has intercepted out of the death duties £1,500,000, which goes in relief of agricultural rates, and he has appropriated two millions out of the annual sinking fund, so that the total amount of what I may call his Liberal heritage amounts to £23,700,000.  But what have the Government done with the expendi­ture? The increase in civil administration, Post-office, etc., has been £7,150,000.  The increase in armaments has been £22,600,000, and doles to the landlords and the schools, to the tithe-owners and the parson, have amounted to £3,350,000.  So that the additional expendi­ture has amounted to £33,100,000.  That is the first thing we must bear in mind - that the extra normal cost of \u2018the strongest Government of modern times\u2019 to the country is thirty-three millions sterling.  It takes a pretty strong nation to carry it.  Then let us look for a moment at the large increase for armaments - £22,600,000.  I give merely this fact, that whereas in 1881 - that is twenty years ago - the charge per head of the population for the army and navy was 14s., and in 1891-2 it was 17s.; this year it is 30s. per head.  This is often spoken of as the premium of insurance which the country ought to pay.A Peace Budget - A Normal DeficitI believe that insurance companies have certain insurances which they call incendiary insurances, and for these they charge incendiary rates.  I quite admit that if you pursue the fire-eating policy which invites the hatred of other Powers you must pay premiums accordingly; but does the payment of these premiums do much to increase our power?  I mention merely one fact which I think gives ground for reflection.  I take the case of the navy alone.  The combined naval estimates of France, Germany, and the United States, the four great Powers of the world, we may say, between 1892 and 1895 increased at the rate of 6 per cent.  Between 1895 and 1900 they had increased at the rate of 50 per cent.  Fifty per cent against 6 per cent!  Was this in consequence of our extraordinary activity in naval preparation, or was it merely a concomitant fact?  You may take it either way.  At all events, it is shown that our expenditure, which was to make us feared, has not succeeded in making us proportionately strong.  So, although this year new taxa­tion has been imposed to the amount of £11,000,000, we have a deficit on the normal expenditure of peace of £9,400,000.  The conclusion that we are driven to is that this Budget, except for the loan, is not so much a war Budget as a peace Budget, and when we are told that the basis of taxation must be broadened we must not conclude that this is a mere temporary matter. The New Taxes PermanentThere is no secret about it.  The coal tax and the sugar tax have been introduced in order to stay.  They will live, they will increase and multiply, and if they do not replenish the earth they will, at all events, deplenish the pocket of the tax-payer.  The war, in fact, has nothing to do with them.  Under cover of an appeal to patriotism on account of the war, under the plea of making those who approve the war contribute to its cost, new veins of taxation have been opened, as remote as possible from those hated death duties, and from the luxuries and superfluities which form the proper subject of taxation.  I will not rehearse the arguments, which will now be familiar to you, on the coal tax, but I wish to say something about the sugar tax.The Sugar Tax I will say this, that even if I were completely satisfied of the necessity of opening some new source of taxation of this kind, it would be with the utmost reluctance that I should agree to this particular one being chosen.  And for this reason - that it is an impost, almost I would say above all others, which presses upon the poorest and the weakest, upon the women and the children and those who have none to help them.  It has been reckoned that the contribution under this head of the ordinary workman\u2019s family will be about 4½ d. a week.  Now, 4½ d. a week may seem not a very large sum, but if the wages of the head of the family are 15s. it means 6d. in the pound on their income.  If this burden is to be escaped - and this is the pitiable thing - it can only be by stinting the food of the children.  Why should this be done while the well-to-do are called upon only for 2d. in the pound, while the squire and the parson are aided with their rates, and while the value of the public-house goes merrily bounding up, because of the lucrative monopoly which our law almost gratuitously confers upon it? The Government and Social ReformThe Government are apt to boast of their mandate.  At the last elec­tion they managed, by wiles and devices which we easily detected, by a stale register, and by hiding under the glamour of what was alleged to be a successful war - they succeeded, not in any great triumph, but in coming out about as strong as they went in.  But what mandate did they receive?  If we go back to their true genesis, which was in 1895, what mandate did they then receive from the country for all this great expenditure and for their fire-eating policy?  All the talk then was of a great era of social reform.  They are, if we listen to them, the Govern­ment especially of social reform.  But how does this social reform fare with them?  Why, the door of it, as the chairman has said, is barred and double locked, because they have turned their own energies and the energies of the country and our available financial resources into the channel of distant enterprise and there is nothing to spare for domestic needs.The Government and EducationTake the question of education.  What is the greatest need of our country?  What will give the country strength among the nations far exceeding that of a dozen army corps or a perfect legion of Imperial Yeomanry?  Ask the first half-dozen men you meet engaged in any staple trade, and they will say that the great want in this country is education, and better education, and better education still.  We live and thrive by commerce, and we are in danger of falling behind our com­petitors in the markets of the world because we have allowed them to get in advance of us in evoking the intelligence and in instructing the mind of their people.  To correct this neglect is the true national and imperial policy.  But what has been the contribution of the Government to that object?  They have endowed the parsons\u2019 schools and they have snubbed the School Boards, which they look upon as rivals of the par­sons\u2019 schools. As we know, in consequence of a legal decision, leading to a preposterous and mischievous result, the Government have been forced to introduce a Bill.  I must candidly say that I don\u2019t know which astounds me most - the Bill, or the controversies which it has caused.  For I am an outlandish, semi-barbarous Scotchman, who have strayed from my hyperborean solitudes into your rich meadows and fat pastures, and I find you engaged in a desperate fight for popular control of educa­tion and to save your higher grade schools and your continuation classes.  In my poor country we have in every parish a popularly elected School Board, and in every parish school there is no rigid line drawn between elementary education and secondary education, and a child may at his own door, I may say, be carried into the higher learning and up to the very gate of the university.  What we take for granted and possess you, it appears, have still to fight for lest the parson\u2019s domain should be invaded.  I do not understand it, but I begin at least to think that in Scotland we are better fitted than you to face the new century. A Skeleton BillThe Bill that has been introduced is a skeleton Bill.  It wants flesh to be put upon it and blood put into it.  Yes, and this is mainly to be done by the Board of Education. But the worst of it is that a great many of us have desperately little faith in this Board of Education, and we would rather clothe the skeleton ourselves.  But at any rate must see to this.  We must see that there is no attack on School Boards either on the principle of their existence or on their usefulness. Se­condly, we must see that there is no sacrifice of education to sectar­ianism; and, lastly, that there is no placing of fresh difficulties in the way either of the children or of their parents.  I can only trust that in dealing with this singular measure these objects will be kept in view. Temperance LegislationBut our people, if they are to make their way in the world, and if they are to hold their place in the world, must be not only intelligent, but sober.  This year has marked an immense stride forward towards the solution of the temperance question, for nothing could be more full of hope than those remarkable demonstrations, joined in by men of all parties, in favour of taking Lord Peel\u2019s Report as supplying in its main lines the basis of legislation.  But what was the attitude of this strong Government?  To begin with, they are not likely, a priori, to be strong friends of the temperance cause.  As a witty friend of mine said to me the other day, the last man that they want to encourage is \u2018Philip sober.\u2019  But what is their attitude?  Cowering before - or would it be more proper to say cowering behind - their friend the publican, and taking their orders from him. His support is so necessary to them that they dare not thwart him.  Last night a very innocuous Bill was brought into the House of Lords giving a certain elective character to licensing authorities.  The Government refused to touch it on this very ground - that they were not sure that it might not prevent compensa­tion from being given to the public-houses.  Lord Salisbury says that \u2018we have to deal with private interests which on any equitable system require the most careful consideration,\u2019 and then he goes on to make an observation which I am bound to say is astonishing to me. He says also, \u2018We have to deal with that inability which any Government, and especially such a Government as ours, finds in attempting to impose upon the people a matter so entirely within their own judgment and within the guidance of their own knowledge as the course that they should pursue in satisfying their own individual tastes.\u2019  What!  Is Saul also among the prophets?  This is local veto and nothing else.  I think this must have been drawn accidentally from Lord Salisbury, and he cannot have fully realised the gist of the words he was using. The Children\u2019s BillBut there is another Bill before Parliament to which I cannot but refer.  That is the Bill which is known as the Children\u2019s Bill.  At first it was scouted.  Last year it was carried on the second reading, and then the promoters were treated as visionaries and foolish enthusiasts.  This year it has again been carried on the second reading by a large majority.  A great number of the supporters of the Government, I am glad to acknowledge and I am glad to see, supported it. And now it hangs in the balance, and it is for \u2018the strongest Government of modern times\u2019 to say whether they are equal to the task of passing this little Bill.  That the little Bill is needed who can doubt?  A friend sent me the other day particulars of a certain watch which had been kept upon an individual public-house, one public-house in London, on Sunday, the 28th April in this year. It was open for seven hours.  There entered into that public-house in that time 1,792 men, 786 women, 1,365 chil­dren.  I think that if things like this are possible it is not too much to ask the Government that it should assist in passing this Bill.The Lion in the PathAnd then there is the great housing question.  What in all these years have they done for it? They introduced and passed one or two scrappy, pinch-beck measures of no value.  Why is this all they have done after we have read the fine phrases of lofty appreciation that this great want always excites?  Is not the reason perfectly plain?  We all know it.  If only houses could be built on something else than land what a scheme of houses for the poor the Government would give us!  And then I turn to another subject.  They are the farmers\u2019 friends.  They represent the agricultural interest.  Yes, if the interest of the farmer coincides with the interest of the landlord. But if in any case the interest of the owner and the interest of the cultivator differ then they are no longer the farmers\u2019 friends.  We are interested in giving the farmer freedom in the contracts he makes with his landlord, and in encouraging him to make the best use of his land, in order not only to benefit himself, but in order that our country may be made as produc­tive as possible for the general benefit.  The other day our friend, that active Member of Parliament, Mr. Lambert, introduced a bill giving some wider freedom to tenants than at present exists.  It was opposed.  I don\u2019t care for my purpose tonight whether it was a good bill or a bad bill, because the main fact of the whole debate was this - that the Minister of Agriculture slammed the door in the face of the farmer, and declared that, so far as the Government and the Unionist party were concerned, the weak and ineffective measure of last year was their very last word upon this question.  It is the same wherever we turn.  The lion in the path is vested interests, whether of the parson, or the pub­lican, or the landlord, and as it is precisely the vested interests which have put them into rower and maintained them in power, how can you expect them to attack and remove them?The Duty of LiberalsWe are confronted by this great fact in opposing the Government - a Government so powerful for mischief and so impotent for good.  What is the duty of your vigorous organisations throughout the country, and of myself and my colleagues in Parliament? It is to protest and protest, to expose and expose, and, above all, I think I may say, it is to close up our ranks. We are a party of active-minded politicians of many shades of views.  Let us determine to dwell pon the ninety-nine things in which we are agreed rather than the one thing upon which we happen to differ.  But you will say - I can read the thoughts of gentlemen throughout the hall - you will say, \u2018Who is this that is preaching to us, loyal delegates of healthy organisations throughout the country?  Is there no lack of unity in the House of Commons?\u2019  I do not know that there is not some remnant of lack of unity, but there is a strong desire for unity at all events, and what I would ask and call upon you to do is to go home each of you to inculcate the doctrine of unity and loyalty upon your individual representative in Parliament, and I promise you that so far as I am concerned I will forgive you.  It is not I who will find fault with you for using this liberty towards them.  We have faith - the very foundation of our political existence involves and implies that we have faith - in the good sense and right feeling of our country­men. We know that they are awakening in a greater and greater degree to the fact that the full development of their happiness as indi­viduals and of the prosperity of the country to which they belong is hindered by the grasp of monopoly and privilege.  In every assault on these hindrances, in every movement forward in the cause of freedom and equal rights, I know you will be in the van.

aVWe are met tonight at a period which marks high noontide in the Parliamentary session, and although we may not know what the future of that session may bring forth, or what new wonders may be presented to us before we glide into the calm haven of the autumnal recess - if autumnal recess there is to be - we have at least seen enough to pronounce what the character of this Parliamentary year will be. Whatever new aspects it may yet ultimately present, there is no doubt it will be distinguished as having exhibited more surprising instances of vacillation and tergiversation in the policy of a great party than have been recorded since Catholic Emancipation was given and since the Corn Laws were repealed.The Government and the Corn TaxAnd yet - can you believe it? - the Prime Minister the other day went to the annual meeting of the Primrose League in the Albert Hall, in London, and plumed himself especially and above all upon the fact that he and his friends were not as certain other men are, in that their opinions and principles are fixed, ascertained, and immutable. He said - these are his own words: \u2018We at all events are agreed upon the main lines of our policy, on what it is we want to maintain and what it is we want to do.\u2019 One of my own countrymen, not unknown to you - Robert Burns - who in his unlearned and unscholastic way had a marvellous insight into human nature, breaks out with the words:Oh, wad some power the giftie gie usTo see oursels as others see us!If we wanted proof of the wholesomeness of this aspiration Mr. Balfour affords it when he shows himself unable to see himself, even as \u2018in a glass darkly,\u2019 and when he proceeded on the occasion to which I refer to illustrate his devotion to continuity of policy and fixity of opinion by discoursing, of all things in the world, upon the story of the Corn Tax, which has been imposed one year and is to be removed the next by this Ministry of the clear eye and the firm hand and the resolute purpose. We were told last year that it was above all things necessary to \u2018broaden the basis of taxation\u2019 - a blessed phrase, and very convenient on occasion. We were told that that wretched shilling of \u2018registration\u2019 duty had been recklessly abandoned a generation ago by an ill-informed Minister - he was a Liberal Minister, of course - and that it would not be paid by anyone in this country at least, but would be subjected to a course of trituration, like the commodity with which it is concerned, and would disappear on its way from the hand of the man who planted the seed in some distant part of the world to the mouth of the man who eats the loaf in Scarborough.The \u2018Broad Basis of Taxation\u2019 Dropped But now this year the Finance Minister drops the \u2018broad basis of taxation\u2019 altogether. He declares it \u2018quite impossible, if there has been no actual rise, that the tax has had no effect on the price,\u2019 and he goes on \u2018Undoubtedly the price of flour has increased to the amount of the tax, and a good deal more, and as a good many people make their own bread the cost of the latter must have been increased.\u2019 This is the Chancellor of the Exchequer - a sensible man, the Chancellor of the Exchequer - who presents to us the very arguments that we employed last year when we resisted the imposition of the tax. He recognises facts and discards fallacies, and he sees, if I may say so, as far as most people into a millstone.Fiscal \u2018Philosophy\u2019But next arises the Prime Minister among those dames of the Primrose League, and he argues, in his most philosophic and therefore most convincing manner, that this tax neither hurts the consumer nor benefits the farmer. Therefore he says - although you and I may not be able to follow him to the conclusion - but something must be allowed to philosophy - it may safely be taken off, and with advantage to the people. So here we have it, all within twelve months. The first Finance Minister says, \u2018The tax will hurt nobody; put it on.\u2019 The second Finance Minister says, \u2018The tax will hurt a whole lot of people; take it off.\u2019 What, I ask you, is a distracted Prime Minister to say when his Finance Ministers contradict each other? How is he to reconcile the irreconcilable? Happy thought! Philosophy comes to the rescue. He takes the premiss of the one and the conclusion of the other, and he joins them together and tells us, \u2018The tax hurt no one, it could do no harm at all; therefore take it off at once.\u2019A Historic EventIt occurs to me, however, that perhaps I do wrong to dwell on this aspect of the matter, however attractive the picture may be. It may be a mistake to accuse a man of inconsistency when he is in the very act of coming round to your side, and to make sport of the reasons he gives for his conversion. I am disposed to admit it. But if the prodigal son comes home with his head in the air, and vowing that whatever you may have done, he, for his part, has never strayed a hair\u2019s breadth from the path of virtue, what are you to do? What you must do is this. You have got to take his word for it, and look as if you believed his story, to kill the fatted calf all the same, and press him to draw in his chair and partake. This incident easily lends itself to comical treatment, but it is nothing less than a historic event.A Forerunner and a SignalThe shilling duty was intended - not, I presume, by all its authors, but by some of them, and certainly by those who urged it and applauded it and danced a saraband of joy over its birth - to be the forerunner of a great revolution in fiscal policy. The duty would not have stopped at this modest shilling on a single article. It was an era of Protection that was to set in. Now the generation to which we belong - I am not sure that I don\u2019t hover about the past generation myself, but at all events let us say the present generation - has had no experience of the working of a system of Protection, has never seen the pinch of poverty, of distress, and the lawlessness and disorder which accompanied it when it existed before. But it is well that we should renew acquaintance with the facts, and I have some words here to quote which I find appearing in the latest number of a most unimpeach­able Conservative journal, the Quarterly Review - not in one of your Radical subversive magazines. This is what an article in that Review says: \u2018The era of Protection, as we read the history of those times, is inseparably associated with violent fluctuations in prices, widespread suffering, agrarian outrages and discontent, high rents for landlords, huge profits for farmers, starvation wages and pauperism for the labourers. Its record is the praise of hundreds and the curse of millions.\u2019 It is well for us to remember that when we hear Protection glibly talked about. But it was something more. This tax was not merely a bread tax or a subvention to the farmer or the miller; it was a signal held out to the whole Empire to send in its claims for pre­ferential treatment.Mr. Chamberlain and Preferential Tariffs for the ColoniesI have excellent authority for that. Here is what was said by the Colonial Secretary at Birmingham on the 16th May, 1902, almost a year ago to the day. He said: \u2018I must, before sitting down, call your attention to one argument which has been used against this bread tax which I hope this country will note, which I hope the country will remember.\u2019 I hope the country will remember, too - and I will tell you why - because, as you will see in the next line, it is my argume\u000a\u000ant. The Colonial Secretary went on: \u2018On the last day of the discussion in the House of Commons the leader of the Opposition told us that the tax had another and a most dangerous aspect. It was the thin end of the wedge. It was the beginning of a new policy, of which he spoke with bated breath and in tones of horror. And what do you think is the new policy to which he thinks this tax may lead? It is the policy of preferential relations with our colonies. We are not going to adopt his fears. At the present moment the Empire is being attacked on all sides, and in our isolation we must look to ourselves. We must draw closer our internal relations, the ties of sentiment, the ties of sympathy, yes, and the ties of interest. If by adherence to economic pedantry, to old shibboleths, we are to lose opportunities of closer union which are offered to us by our colonies, if we are to put aside occasions now within our grasp\u2019 - mark that! \u2018if we do not take every chance in our power to keep British trade in British hands, I am certain we shall deserve the disasters which will infallibly come upon us.\u2019 First of all there is his prophecy of the dreadful things which will happen if this tax is removed, but also there is the admission of the fact that the tax was imposed in order that it might be taken off again in the case of colonial imports. Canada would expect, no doubt, a tax upon corn, Australia upon wool, New Zealand - I should think we should leave it to Mr. Seddon, but probably it would be mutton. If the self-governing colonies are all to have their claims so listened to, India and the Crown colonies would surely have to be put also on a preferential footing, and we should have a Chinese wall built round the Empire, from the battlements of which we should shout defiance to the world at large. Is this a new doctrine? Is this to be a twentieth-century doctrine? Why, it is as old as the hills. It is the medieval, feudal ideal; it is that old ideal of your border towers and castles on the Rhine, and of each little town having its circumvallation of walls, and at the gate an octroi duty demanded on all that passes in. From this dangerous ideal - dangerous to trade and dangerous to peace and dangerous to the welfare of the people - Mr. Ritchie by his courage has, I hope, saved us.Our \u2018Isolation\u2019But let us look into this a little closely. \u2018In our isolation,\u2019 says Mr. Chamberlain, \u2018we must look to ourselves.\u2019 But what is this but to accept and accentuate a position of isolation, which if it ever existed - I doubt if it has, save in the imagination of those who desired it - can be nothing but a misfortune and a curse to us and to the Empire. Our relations with our colonies are excellent. We are tied to them by the closest bonds of friendship and regard and esteem and common blood and common sentiment. In what respect would this great and memorable and unexampled commonwealth of free nations - because that is what our Empire is - be strengthened by leaguing itself against the other nations of the world? The whole spirit of such a policy is false. Its object is unattainable, and I venture to say that if ever it was brought to practical realisation it would contain in itself the inevitable seeds of dismemberment. No, the security and prosperity of the Empire are to be attained not by great military expenditure, not by treating our neighbours with jealousy and defiance, not by interfering with the natural processes and courses of trade, but by opening the channels of industry, by multiplying the means of com­munication, by promoting the exchange of commodities, and by giving new life and new inspiration to the intelligent energy of our people. Let us be thankful then, alike on domestic and Imperial grounds, that this tax - whose ultimate use and purpose have been so candidly mani­fested to us - is to be summarily abandoned.The King\u2019s TourWill it be out of place for me, while I am speaking on our external relations, if I give a passing expression to the universal feeling of satisfaction with which the whole nation has followed the recent visits of the King to some of the countries of Western Europe? His Majesty, by his kindly and sympathetic attitude, has not only done much to gain for himself and for his subjects the goodwill of the governments and populations, but he has also exhibited to the world the friendly spirit which we wish to subsist between ourselves and neighbouring countries. I venture to say that His Majesty has placed his people under a deep obligation, and I hope that he will soon be able to carry out the intention which is attributed to him of extending his visits to others among the nations of Europe.The Education QuestionNow let me for a change turn to a subject on which the Government has shown an evil persistency instead of that airy opportunism which has characterised their course upon the corn duty. What is this subject upon which they have been so steadfast in wrong-doing? It is no other than perhaps the most sacred of all the functions of the State - the education of the young. The people of this country have so fully understood and appreciated the Act of last year that I shall not dwell upon its inherent vices. These are so great, and so alien from our political principles, and they are so repugnant to the con­science of many men, that we can never admit or tolerate the provisions of the Act as embodying a national system of education. The Govern­ment and their friends have laid the flattering unction to their souls that the heat and storm of last autumn will die down. I see no sign of it. On the contrary it is growing, it seems to me, in intensity. The condemnation of the Act, as ignoring popular rights, as excluding from their proper share of influence the parent and the ratepayer, the two classes most concerned, and as writing upon the door of entry to a great and honourable and beneficent profession a sectarian test - that is a standing condemnation which time can never wither. If any man is cut to the quick by such wounds to conscience as the operation of the Act may inflict, and if he refuses to bear his share, the matter is one of individual conscientious conviction, outside the immediate range of political parties; but no politician, whatever his views may be, can fail to take note of such action and of the deep and heartfelt sentiment which it implies. It was England and Wales last year, and it is London this year.The London Education BillI wish here to express the hope that those of our friends who speak for Yorkshire and other constituencies outside of London will remember how their own withers were wrung last year, and will not fail to come to the aid of the few London members and fight not only their battle but their own battle over again. All the evils of last year\u2019s Bill are incorporated in this one. No further back than the day before yesterday I received a resolution from a body which I think you will listen to with respect, and I quote it because of the source from which it comes. It is a resolution of the Council of the Sunday School Union. Nothing political here; nothing extreme; no rabid feeling either religious or political; it comes from a body of men who are devoting themselves to the very hallowed work of teaching the children in the higher things appertaining to their welfare. And this is what they say: \u2018The Council of the Sunday School Union have observed with the deepest regret the Bill introduced by his Majesty\u2019s Government to supersede the London School Board and in its place to adopt an organisation which will largely encourage and endow denominational teaching, and revive the discredited and unjust system of excluding fully competent teachers from public employment on sectarian grounds.\u2019 The one outstanding fact is that the London School Board, the pioneer of education, perhaps the highest exemplar of popular local government among us, is to be done to death. It is to be despatched without benefit of clergy. No, no; I am not accurate. I should say it is to be despatched for the benefit of the clergy and of the clerical interest.The Government and the MunicipalitiesBut this Government of ours have developed an extreme antipathy to what are called ad hoc bodies. Their idea is to municipalise educa­tion, smothering it up with baths and washhouses and streets and sewers. Why have they this objection to ad hoc bodies? The Secretary of the Board of Education carries his objection even to the words themselves, and he finds them linguistically incorrect. But then he is the Head of an Oxford college, and that must be allowed for. Ad hoc is at all events, however incorrect it may be, a convenient phrase, indicating that a person has been appointed, or body created, or course taken, for a special and particular purpose. But allow me to let you into a secret which can hardly be called a secret, for it is evident to us all - that it is not the ad hoc element, it is not the element of a special function that is distasteful to the Government - it is the direct election, it is the democratic constitution of the ad hoc principle to which they cry \u2018Avaunt!\u2019\u2018Ad Hoc\u2019 Authorities CreatedBut is it not an odd thing in this very promiscuous, but, we are told by the highest authority, consistent Government, that they themselves have been busy creating ad hoc authorities? Why, the water supply of London was in the hands of great companies, who had a statutory monopoly of the supply of water. The most natural thing would have been to have given the supply of water in London, as it is in all other municipalities, as far as I am aware, throughout the kingdom, to the municipality itself - the County Council. But, no, the County Council is directly elected by the people, and they don\u2019t like it; they thwart it in every way possible. And they create a heterogeneous body not one member of which is elected directly, but the members of which are appointed by other bodies, which may or may not be elected by the will of the people. That is what they have done with regard to water. Again, there is the question of the port of London, about which my friend Mr. John Ellis knows as much as, or more than, most people because he has taken a lion\u2019s share of the work on the Royal Commission that investigated it. There, again, they have not handed that subject over to any municipal authority. They have not municipalised that, but they have created - and I think in that case rightly created - an ad hoc body. Yet these are the opponents of the ad hoc body for education.An \u2018Ad Hoc\u2019 GovernmentBut let us look a little closer still. Are you sure that it is not an ad hoc Government? They were elected in 1900, as we all know, not, indeed, to finish the war, because that was finished, but for the express purpose of bringing about a settlement in South Africa and to reform the army, and nothing else. That was the one purpose, because whoever gave a vote against them gave a vote to the enemies of their country; and if they are thus an ad hoc Government they have the very principle and quality which they object to in a public body. But, dear me, I do not know where I shall stop, because if I look at the party which supports them it is itself an ad hoc party, because it is a mixture of men of multifarious views - at least they express their multifarious views in private, and sometimes in speeches, but I never see much multifariousness about their votes - but at any rate, that party was created, and has existed since 1886, for the sole purpose of saving the Empire from the mad incursions of the Irish and all the evils which would follow from trusting those dreadful people. They will often tell you, \u2018We may disband the union of the two parties, but not till the danger from this Irish party is removed.\u2019 So here they are - ad hoc all along the line. Yet these are the men who loudly reject that method. But, as I have already told you, the truth of the matter is, it is not the ad hoc element they object to - it is the direct election which they distrust and avoid. But give them time; they may come round.The Irish QuestionLook what we are seeing with regard to their Irish policy. What are we to say to the extraordinary volte face made by the Government in their relations with Ireland? Their inconsistency over the Corn Tax of which I have spoken is like a puff of vapour compared to the impenetrable fog of inconsistency which hangs over their Irish policy. Six months ago, having suspended the ordinary guarantees of civil liberty, they were busy haling to prison and to hard labour Irish members of Parliament and others, the advocates of the tenants to whom they are now handing over the land of Ireland. The repre­sentatives of Ireland were then rebels and traitors, and even to rub shoulders with them in a Parliamentary lobby was a slur upon the character of any patriotic Englishman.The Blenheim SpeechesWe shall not soon forget the speeches made at Blenheim in August, 1891, again to the Primrose League. It seems to me that the Primrose League dames and harbingers - I hope I am right in my titles - have the effect no one else can have of inspiring the courage and unlocking the heart of the Prime Minister. For what does he say at Blenheim? He is scornful of the Irish. He says that they mean to torment and worry the House of Commons into yielding to their wishes. He exclaims, \u2018They have mistaken their men!\u2019 Then the Colonial Secretary, not to be outdone - he does not say so much about his own courage - is full of regret for the conduct of other people. He says he is distressed \u2018that those who profess to carry forward the traditions of one of the great honourable parties in British life should be mixed up with these men,\u2019 and he goes on, \u2018We still believe that they\u2019 - that is you and I \u2013 \u2018are as willing as before to sell the interests of their country for eighty Irish votes. What is the Irish party? It consists of eighty persons more or less, who have all taken the oath of allegiance, and who openly avow themselves to be enemies of this country. Pretty allies for an English party.\u2019 But these \u2018pretty allies\u2019 have not had their help on an English Education Bill repudiated that I have seen; and now these \u2018pretty allies\u2019 are states­men to be conferred with and to be deferred to. But the violence of last year and all the bad language of Blenheim may have been a mere temporary aberration.Pestilent and Pernicious PrejudicesWhat are we to say, then, if we go further back, deeper down? In 1886 two Bills, which I shall do no more than mention, were intro­duced by Mr. Gladstone. They were both denounced and derided, and this wonderful coalition of two parties was created in order to defeat them, and prevent their ever appearing again. Why? Because the Irish people could not be trusted to be given such powers as were contained in those Bills, which would be fatal to the security of the Empire. I am not going to dwell upon this, because it cannot be denied that it was on the ground that the Irish people could not be trusted that the whole of the opposition was based. But what are we told now? Their present Purchase Bill, devoid of the safeguards of the Purchase Bill of 1886, rests mainly on the \u2018chivalry\u2019 of the Irish people. The Chief Secretary proclaims that his reliance is placed on their self-respect, their probity, and their goodwill. They prove their change of opinion towards the Irish people by handing over the land of Ireland, as they would have said a year or two ago, or even half a year ago, to the men who made the Land League and worked the Plan of Campaign. Well, better a late repentance than never. I rejoice for my part that this party - we can hardly now call it the Unionist party - let us take a convenient phrase - this ad hoc party - has at last purged itself from the pestilent and pernicious prejudices which have for the last few years poisoned its relations with Ireland.The Land Purchase BillLet me say just a word or two upon this Irish Land Purchase Bill, to point out to you, if I can, those matters with regard to it which are most important to you as taxpayers. The first thing I would say is that you cannot remain as you are in this matter. You have entered, under Conservative auspices, on a course of ousting the landlord and installing the tenant, and you cannot stop where you are. Already 80,000 are so installed, scattered over Ireland. You are on an inclined plane: you cannot maintain your equilibrium: you must extend similar advantage to the hundreds of thousands who remain, or you can never secure rest or peace. That is the governing consideration in this matter. It is this which makes us bound to pass some Bill or other having the professed object, and aiming at the promised effect, of the measure now before Parliament. But, accepting such a Bill as inevit­able, what are the main points to be secured I will only mention two.Points to be SecuredThe first is this: For more than two generations in future annual instalments will be paid by the purchasing tenants to the British Treasury, and if we wish to have any chance of avoiding friction and conflict and danger and difficulty we are bound to see that the terms are easy and reasonable, and such as will bear the stress of circumstances. Now remember this. By Mr. Gladstone\u2019s Bill of 1886 the instalments to be paid were to be collected by the Irish State Authority, which secured punctuality in payments, which enforced the payments when they were due, and which was allowed to make a profit. If the whole amount of fifty millions was taken up, then no less a sum than £400,000 a year was left to ease the progress of the transaction. But here is the difficulty. With what face could the present Government set up in Ireland a State authority? Their very reason of existence, as I have said, the vital fluid of the Government, comes from their hostility to any Irish authority. Therefore what stands between you, the taxpayers, for the next seventy years and the danger of losses and difficulties is nothing but the chivalry and the probity and the good feeling of the Irish tenants, so lately discovered by the gentlemen now in power. I don\u2019t underrate the security, although I think it is rather a flaccid and almost fluid security for so mighty a transaction. But I don\u2019t underrate the honesty of the security. Only mark the fact that that is all you have, and on that ground it is peculiarly and super­latively necessary to see that the conditions which underlie the instalments to be paid are generous and easy. One other point only I will allude to. We are going to abolish under this measure estates in Ireland great and small, and set up a number of small individual holdings. But a vast number of holdings in Ireland, as we know - sometimes conglomerated in one locality, but others scattered over the country - are what are called uneconomic; that is to say, they cannot support a man, still less his family. He has to get contributions from his relatives who have gone abroad, or he has to come to this country to work to make a little money. Surely the very worst thing we can do is to stereotype for all time such a condition of things, which would not only be a danger in itself, but probably be the parent of new evils. I hope, therefore, you will support us if in the House of Commons we give our aid to any provision calculated to meet the danger.The Law Affecting Trade UnionsLeaving these Irish questions, there are two subjects which are salient and urgent at the present moment, and on which I should like to say a few words. The first of these is the law affecting labour and the combination of workmen, which is naturally exciting a rather strong feeling throughout the country. Do not mistake me. I have no desire to discuss the niceties of legal language, such as my friend Mr. Birrell and others delight and revel in, or the strange varieties of judicial interpretation of that language. I shall deal only with the broad issue. The other day it was said in the debate in the House of Commons that the workmen were claiming to be in some respects a privileged class. I believe that is an entire misapprehension of their desire. On the contrary, what they ask is that they should not be subjected to restrictions from which others are free; that their freedom of com­bination should not be hampered by such a stretching of the law of conspiracy as to deny to working men rights which belong to any body of citizens taking action for the protection of their legal interests. That being so, I hold this to be a perfectly honest, justifiable, and proper contention on their part. I was in Parliament when the statutes on this subject were passed, and it was certainly then intended that the working man should be freed from the unfair operation of the old conspiracy laws and be placed on a level in this respect with the employers - neither better nor worse, but the same. That I trust and believe is the contention now. If the law does not accomplish this object let it be amended; give us a chance of amending it. The Home Secretary, while he declares that, in his opinion, the law is perfectly clear, is going to institute an inquiry to discover what the law is. It is not an inquiry to discover what the law is; it is to discover a policy on this subject for His Majesty\u2019s Government. Thus a question which is urgent is shelved, and mean while a false situation is stereotyped, to the injury of all those who are concerned.The Licensing Question My second subject, on which I feel bound to say a word or two, is one which has also been before us in the House of Commons, namely, the question of licensing, the most salient point in connection with which at present is the question of the powers of the magistrates and the compensation of the publican. Let us make our position clear. We quite appreciate the hardship which is suffered by a licensee who, through no fault of his own, loses his licence. If this happens it is only in accordance with the conditions under which he holds his licence, and therefore he has no legal claim, and no claim against the public. But I for one should be glad that he should be compensated out of trade funds. That is the first proposition; but the second is that whatever mutual arrangements for in­demnifying themselves or one another the \u2018trade,\u2019 as it is called, may come to, they must be such as to leave the magistrates\u2019 decisions absolutely free, so that they may fairly exercise their discretion. The magistrates must not be hobbled, as they would if Mr. Butcher\u2019s Bill passed into law, which would limit their discre­tion to the amount available for compensation in the district. The trade is highly organised, and I should have thought was well able to look after itself. If there is a difficulty about the minority - I believe in many districts only a very small minority - which are not tied houses, then let a bench of magistrates who find a redundance of houses begin with the tied houses, as to which, not so far as the men manag­ing the houses are concerned, but so far as the proprietors and those who profit by the business are concerned, they are very well able to look after themselves.The Old Liberal Principles We have often been reproached - it has become a habit of the Tory press and the nondescript press in this country to reproach us - that our cause, our theories and doctrines, are old and worn out. They say we are ten years behind the times in talking about religious equality, Free Trade, and licensing reform, and fifty years behind the age in talking of such out-of-date objects as peace and economy. We have been invited to forget that which is behind and to attack larger and newer and more attractive topics, which are not al ways defined so exactly as we should like. I am glad to remember that for the last three or four years I have again and again, from time to time, even when these doctrines may have seemed to many to be dead letters, proclaimed the necessity of keeping them constantly before our minds, of keeping our old armour bright, and the old weapons sharp. How is it now? Are these doctrines, these old obfuscated doctrines of ours, and the subjects with which they are concerned, dead, or are they alive? They are very much alive, and who has enlivened them? (A voice: \u2018The Tories.\u2019) Quite so. It is not you and I. It is the present Government and the foolish electors who put them in power - it is they who have aroused the sleeping issues. Religious equality is brought into question by the Education Act, Free Trade is brought into question not by us but by the taxation of the Government and the sugar convention. Licensing reform, which I have just spoken of, is in question. Freedom of combination is in question; ay, how long may it be before freedom of labour is in question, if things march on their apparent course in South Africa? Peace is always in question when a Tory Government is in power. As to economy, if it is in question, it is because they have cast it to the winds, and its recovery is almost hopeless. We are unexpectedly forced to fight these rearguard actions against the powers of reaction and on behalf of civil and religious liberty. But out of the bitter comes forth sweet, and our success, which is inevitable, in these rearguard actions, can only serve to give training and fresh inspiration to the progressive forces of our country in the onward march which we are determined to pursue towards the development of the welfare of the people.

aVMr. Chairman, Lord Aberdeen, Ladies and Gentlemen, - Never since it came into being has that great political engine, the National Liberal Federation, found itself at its annual meeting in such circumstances as now surround you. I go further, and say that never within the memory of any man among us has the country seen such a political situation. This is a constitu­tional country. (A Voice: It used to be.) Well, we thought it was, but the close observer of recent events may well begin to have his doubts. The form of government under which we live is that of a limited monarchy. The power of the Crown, wisely exercised, cheerfully and loyally obeyed, sincerely respected, and endeared to us by gratitude for faithful practice, is yet subject to restriction.The Will of the PeopleWhat is the power that restricts it? It is the will of the people. It is not the fiat of a Minister, it is not the wishes or ambitions or interests of any junta or coterie of politicians. And how is the will of the people expressed? By the election of representatives to serve in Parliament, whether at a general election or by-elections. There­fore - and this is my point - the authority which places and maintains a Ministry in power is not the House of Commons; it is something behind it and above it. The authority originates with and resides in the popular will, or, in plain language, in public opinion. Yet here we have a Minister declaring that he cares nothing for the opinion of the country; he does not look beyond the actual House of Commons. The House of Commons behind whose support he shelters himself is nearly five years old; it was created amid a war fever which has long since passed away, and the votes which created it were sought and were given on the ground of that war and on that ground alone. So that this five-years-old House of Commons has less authority by far than Parliaments of its age usually have, and every passing election proves indisputably and undeniably that a profound and sweeping change has come over the feeling of the electorate. What is the plain duty of a Minister in such a case? This is not a matter for fine-drawn state­craft. It is a matter of common sense.A Government of Usurpation Let us try it by the rules of everyday life. Suppose that A gives a power of attorney to B to act for him, and that in process of time it becomes apparent to everybody concerned that A has lost his confidence in B, and no longer approves of the way in which B conducts his affairs. A acts through an agent who takes no notice. What, then, will be the duty of B, whom I assume to be a man of probity and honour; what will he do? He will refuse to take advantage of any technical plea, and will renounce duties which he can no longer honestly discharge in accordance with the wishes of his principal. It comes to this, then, that we have in office a Government of usurpation, such as we have not had in any man\u2019s experience before. Is Govern­ment altogether the right word? We are a plain, practical people, and what we mean by a Government is a body of men with a common policy, acting altogether in order to put that policy in practice by the aid of a majority in Parliament.The Government\u2019s PolicyWhat is the present Government\u2019s policy? I take three questions which they themselves have brought to the front. That is treating them fairly, surely. What is their fiscal policy? What is their Irish policy? What is their Army policy? With regard to the Army, we have had an elaborate exposition of and disquisition upon the theories of Imperial defence. But we are just as much in the dark as ever as to the way in which these theories are to be carried out or the require­ments which they impose upon us. Of their fiscal policy we only know this - that it is in a condition which precludes its appearance in public. They cannot state it, they cannot defend it, and they cannot even vote upon it in the House of Commons. They cannot set it on its legs. The Government becomes dissolved whenever the subject is mentioned. As to Ireland, a week ago I ask a few plain questions - not conundrums - mere questions as to matter of fact, and I not only received no answer, but no attempt at an answer. The strange story of Sir Antony MacDonnell remains a mystery. The sudden change from coercion to conciliation, which happened to take place just at the time when the Government required the votes of the Irish members for their educa­tion policy - it was a singular coincidence; - the abrupt abandonment of that policy of conciliation at the first growl of the ascendency party, the marvellous result of Mr. Wyndham out and Mr. Balfour still in - all these are unexplained. The Government commands the confidence of its followers in the House of Commons - which is its only excuse for continued existence - by the consistent concealment of its policy from Parliament and from the country.Mr. Chamberlain's Dark Room You may have observed that some days ago there was a discussion in the House of Commons upon the amount of accommodation provided for members, and the fact was discovered that the member for West Birmingham enjoys the use of a room although he is not at the head of any distinct political party. I do not grudge him that favour; but it was urged in extenuation of his occupation of it that it was a small, dark room, by which I suppose was meant very much what an enterprising and advertising hotel-keeper in a picturesque country by way of attracting the amateur photographer would call a developing-room. The very thing he wants! He is busy developing something. It was also a dark room, and that appears to be suitable also; and - I was forgetting this - it was said to be in a detached part of the building, also a very suitable location. But the House of Commons itself is, on critical occasions, a large, dark room, and the confidence of the supporters of the Government is never so enthusiastically voted as when the gas goes out.The Government\u2019s Reluctance to go to the Country I would ask you, is this what the country has been accustomed to? A feeling of surprise and bewilderment has grown into another feeling, a feeling of irritation and indignation scarcely paralleled in our history. Here is a Ministry for which, as the chairman has reminded you, not a single constituency is safe, and, if they reconstruct themselves, which they do now and then, they have either to go to the House of Lords for a new Minister or they have to sacrifice a Minister in the operation. No wonder then that last Session they put into the King\u2019s Speech a Bill to dispense with the necessity of a newly-appointed Minister seeking re-election. When they talked of that Bill we wondered why they were so full of this novel zeal for liberty. Now we know the reason. Let us give them full credit for this unique instance of foresight on their part. But when, sooner or later, this cryptic Government, with no support except that which it can find in the doomed members of an expiring House of Commons, when they go to the country what will they say? Their reluctance to go we can well understand on three grounds at least. There is their record, which will not bear a moment\u2019s inspection; there are their ranks, which are deeply divided and demoralised; they have no definite policy except a few strings of phrases which can hardly be put seriously before the world. Abuse of the OppositionKnowing, then, defeat to be certain they are clinging to office in the hope that somehow or other they will achieve some degree of union, and that they may develop some sort of a policy, so that defeat may not turn into a catastrophe. But in the meantime the May meetings of the party - I especially refer to the Primrose League meet­ing at the Albert Hall and Mr. Chamberlain\u2019s meeting with his own constituents at Birmingham - show that they are agreed that the best way of keeping up appearances is to denounce the Opposition. To read their speeches one would think that the Union Jack was em­blazoned with the counterfeit presentment of the Prime Minister, and that the Royal Arms contained, instead of a unicorn, an ex-Colonial Secretary rampant. Says Mr. Balfour to his audience and friends, \u2018We are the defenders of the Crown, the Empire, and religion.\u2019 He actually appears to take seriously the comedy of the Primrose League. And the same day Mr. Chamberlain, at Birmingham, rounded it off by remarking, putting all the vinegar - three kinds of vinegar - into one vessel, that the Liberal party was a party of Little Englanders, pro-Boers, and separatists. Have they learned nothing, these men? Has their South African policy commended itself to the country? Are they bent on reviving the passions of 1900? Are their eyes not open to the fact that the great majority of their countrymen condemn that policy? Do they seriously think that abuse of the Irish will be effec­tive Mr. Chamberlain, referring to the Irish Nationalists, said in a casual way, \u2018Mr. Bright called them rebels.\u2019 I do not recall a more ungenerous thing ever said by a public man in this country - dragging in an honoured memory to justify a slander. Why, if Mr. Chamber­lain wishes to abuse his political opponents, let him do it himself in his own words. But how absurd this sort of thing is. The one clear impression left on the public mind by their language and their policy is that the Irish were right in what is called rebellion, in attacking and seeking to deliver themselves from the system of Government under which they live and the unhappy results which have followed from it.Mr. Chamberlain\u2019s MistakeI am inclined to think that Mr. Chamberlain is mistaken in his conception that the records of a Government count for nothing in an appeal to the electors. Political memories are not quite so short as that. The country has an account to settle with him and his friends, and the longer it is deferred the heavier it will be. That he is not without misgivings on this score is evident, because he called attention to the fact that before the fiscal question was introduced their losses at the by-elections were greater than they have been since. Their misdeeds were more vividly before the eyes of the electors. Yes, but as the smoke of this fiscal controversy clears away - and there are a good many people I suspect, even tariff reformers, who would not be unduly distressed if it ended in nothing but smoke - when the smoke clears, so much more plainly will the track of the last ten years appear. I leave the matter there. Let them get what comfort they can and what shelter they can from their denunciation of the iniquities of the Opposition, past, present, and to come.The Agricultural Rates BillBut we received some commendation from the Prime Minister the other day. That is worse; it makes one examine oneself to see what can be wrong. It is true there was a good deal of irony in the way in which he communicated his commendation; but he did commend us because of our not having opposed the second reading of the two great masterpieces of his legislative programme for this Session, the Agricultural Rates Renewal Bill and the Aliens Bill. Let me say, if you will, a few words upon each of those. For our inaction in both of those cases there are excellent reasons. There was nothing incon­sistent in what we did - inconsistent with previous views. Take the Agricultural Rates Bill first. The original Bill was introduced in 1896. We were strongly opposed to it and we strenuously resisted it, and we have not altered by one hair\u2019s breadth our opinion upon the subject. We object to taking agricultural land and conferring benefits upon its owners at the expense of other people; and there was no fact concern­ing it which was more startling and convincing than this - that the City of London - not the little City, I mean the big City, London generally - is out of pocket annually £300,000 by this provision, and receives no benefit or equivalent for it. There had been a general enquiry by a Royal Commission, and there was what they call an interim report, which recommended this special favour to be shown to a particular kind of property, whereas the whole question cries aloud for reform and readjustment. We succeeded in getting a period put to the time when the Bill should last. In 1901 it had to be renewed. We adopted exactly the same position then as we have adopted this year. Procedure by way of repeal or non-renewal is impracticable.The Need of Comprehensive Rating ReformThese doles, as we call them, must be renewed until that can be carried out which the Government have promised, but have failed to execute - namely, a comprehensive measure readjusting the whole system of local taxation, dealing with urban and rural rates alike, and with relations of each to the national Exchequer. However arbitrary, however inequitable and indefensible, in our opinion, the present temporary law is, these doles cannot be removed after all these years by mere surgical excision. It is easier to do mischief of this sort than to remedy it. The only practical way of dealing with the question is to approach it, as we shall be able to do, from a wider standpoint altogether. The task is heavy and complicated, perhaps the heaviest task that lies before any Government, to frame a scheme that shall be fair to the country and fair to the town, fair to agricultural interests and fair to other interests, to the ratepayer and to the taxpayer, out of the bewildering and puzzling mosaic of present rating arrangements; but, whatever its difficulties, it is a branch of reform which no Government, certainly no Government sincerely concerned about trade, about the housing question, and about the land question, can possibly ignore or neglect.The Aliens BillNow I pass to the Aliens Bill, which is a case much simpler. Why did I, who voted for an amendment to the Aliens Bill last year, decline to vote for a similar amendment this year? That you will naturally ask. Because it is a different Bill altogether from last year\u2019s. The Government have taken out of it some of the vices which we detected and denounced in the Bill of last year. I have never objected on principle to regulating the admission into this country of undesirable men, of criminals, of diseased persons, of persons who are diseased morally, physically, or mentally. But there are two important points on which we shall certainly insist - the first that no man shall be excluded on the mere ground of poverty, and the second that there shall always be maintained admission for anyone who seeks an asylum on our shores from persecution, whether political or religious. A breach of these conditions would mean a loss of character not merely to the Government or to the Opposition, but to the nation itself. We can take no narrow view of national hospitality, if for no other reason than that our countrymen make such large use of and so freely benefit by the hospitality of other nations. We shall look for the support of the Prime Minister against t\u000a\u000ahe view of Mr. Chamberlain, who puts aside these excuses of disease and crime, and claims as the chief object, and merit, of this legislation the exclusion of the competitive labour of the poor man. Has not the alien in past years contributed most materially to the prosperity of this country without displacing native labour? The Royal Commission which was appointed on the subject distinctly says that, so far as skilled labour is concerned, there has been no such displacement of labour. I should have had more respect for this view of the question if I had not remembered that those who are so strong against admitting the deserving but poor alien to this country are the men who introduced Chinese into South Africa for the mere sake of cheapness, and also if I saw in that party solicitude for the interests of labour in other respects, and especially for restoring the combination laws to the position in which Parliament originally intended them to be.Two Other Government Bills Well, these are the facts regarding these two Bills; and I do not grudge the Prime Minister any satisfaction he can derive from our attitude upon them. But besides these two in this Session there are only two other Bills in their programme to which I think I need refer. They seem to be in no hurry to carry either of them. There is the need of organised help for the unemployed, urgently required in all industrial centres, and, above all, in the East-end of London, and surely this will not be put off until another winter comes upon us. The second is the question of the deplorable ecclesiastical calamity in my own country across the Tweed, which demands instantly and urgently an equitable settlement. Why are the Government not ready to act? It is no party question; we are all agreed; we have striven and strained ourselves to prevent any element of party feeling in it. It was evident months ago that an Executive Commission would be required; the Commission of inquiry reasonably and properly recommended s\u000a\u000auch an appointment. The recommendation was so obvious that it ought to have been the duty of the Government to prepare a Bill in anticipation of it. Every day\u2019s delay not only continues but aggravates the scandal; and Scotland is grievously afflicted in her highest and dearest and tenderest interest, the spiritual welfare of her people.Liberal PolicyWe are taunted also by the leaders of the Government party with having no policy. We may ask, as I have been asking by way of recrimination, what is their policy? I have already said that their policy is vague and intangible; and I find myself in extremely good company in making an observation to that effect, because what said Mr. Chamberlain the other day \u2018Have they,\u2019 that is the Liberals, \u2018have they a policy? What have we got?\u2019 he said. \u2018Have we any definite, distinct, beneficial policy? Our policy is not so clear as it might be.\u2019 He goes on: \u2018We must have a common object worth fighting for\u2019; and so he casts about to find a common object, and he apparently can think of nothing but the Imperialistic idea; and, find­ing this rather thin and nebulous, he falls to belabouring the Liberals again. Why did he not fall back on his old friend old-age pensions? But would it not be a propos, would it be impertinent, to inquire what has become of the pledges and promises of social constructive reform which ten years ago were paraded as a policy, with great profit to the Unionist party, but with none whatever either to those who in the simplicity of their heart believed in those promises, or to the country which, on the other hand, has been scourged from that day to this with a number of policies that were never heard of either in 1895 or 1900? If these eminent persons, however, took the trouble to read the speeches made by their opponents, they would have seen that our policy, so far from being a policy of negation, as Mr. Balfour said, or a non-existing policy, as Mr. Chamberlain said, is a positive and constructive policy.Undoing the Work of ReactionNo doubt much will have to be done to repair the false steps that have been taken when we have the power to do it. We must try to settle the education question on national and liberal lines; and no one can deny it wants settling, with Wales and East Ham and the West Riding of Yorkshire under our eyes. Then we must restore public control of the liquor traffic. We must do what we can to check the upward movement of the public expenditure; but we shall not be satisfied with these tasks. Still less shall we be satisfied to do what I sometimes see suggested that we should do - namely, to stand still and mark time till the last danger is passed of the revival of Protection. I have already mentioned one great subject, that of rating, which is urgent. In that must be included the taxation of urban site values, a reform for which our great municipalities are agitating and almost clamouring. This principle has been three times affirmed in the House of Commons; and I expect, though I have not received information, it has been affirmed a fourth time today, when a Scotch Bill dealing with the subject was under discussion in the House of Commons; and its effect, we believe, would be not only to place urban rating on a more equitable footing, but greatly to facilitate the solution of the problems of housing and of urban expansion. The Rural Problem No less urgent is the whole range of questions connected with the depopulation of the agricultural districts. To say that the well-being, and, indeed, almost the existence of the nation is endangered, is threatened, by this process of sapping is no exaggeration. We hold that measures are required for extending the facilities for smallholdings and for the erection of cottages, that tenant farmers are entitled to a larger liberty in the cultivation of their farms and greater security in the result. (A voice - \u2018What about civil and religious liberty?\u2019) Well, civil and religious liberty I take for granted; we will not forget the principles and rules of civil and religious liberty when we are dealing with education or any other subject of a cognate type. With regard to cottages and small holdings, which are powerful agents in stemming the current which is carrying men into the towns, I say that should it happen that the local authorities, either through social pressure or from any other cause, are unlikely to take a sufficiently strenuous part in administering such legislation and thereby combating an evil of national gravity, we ought not to shrink from adopting a policy of vigorous stimulation from the centre. We are all for encouraging local administration and responsibility; but whether it be in respect of the acquisition of land for the use of the people or the provision of cottages, or, to turn in another direction, the sanitary condition of cities as disclosed in their death-rates, the duty of proclaiming and enforcing a proper standard of administrative activity and efficiency will have to be undertaken a good deal more energetically by the State than it has been in the past. We must remember that there are interests of a kind so formidable in their social prestige and influence and in their financial power that the citizen may often have to forfeit a good deal of his rights and liberty unless he can count upon the central authority standing up for him.    The Combination LawsAgain, what could be more important to the prosperity and contentment of the people than a revision of the combination laws? You may take a large and favourable view, or a less favourable view of the trade unions as you like - for my part I hold them to be an unqualified good of the country - but whatever view men take of them no one wishes them, surely, to be hustled and harried. Yet witness the deplorable spectacle of the last few weeks, when a Bill, imperfectly reviving the original intention of Parliament in this matter, has been so mauled and maimed in the Committee under the inspiration of the Government, led and represented by their Solicitor-General, that the Labour members and the Liberal members have been obliged to leave the room.Electoral Reform           These are some of the things to be done. I know there are many others of almost equal importance, which I could mention; but I will only refer to one other great class of reforms, perhaps the most essential, because the most elementary of all. I mean those affecting the electoral machinery; reforms for facilitating registration, for making individual right and not property the test and ground of qualification, for cheapening elections, for giving to members of Parliament a modest stipend, so as to enlarge the choice of the electors. Then, when those things have been done, and other reforms which I might mention, a true representative people\u2019s Chamber would be con­stituted, strong enough to join issue with any other Chamber which challenged it. There would be the additional advantage in those things I have named, that it would be healthier for the country and for Parliament itself if elections came oftener than they do, and until you cheapen the cost of elections you can never accomplish that object.History Repeating ItselfThis is no conclusive list; I am not here either to frame or to pro­pound any programme whatever. I have far from exhausted the subjects. How history repeats itself. Could the condition of things at the present time be better described than they were by Mr. Glad­stone when he came here in 1891, and, as we were told yesterday, was entertained by your present mayor in his mayoralty? What was it that he then said? He said: \u2018The first difficulty that encounters me is this - a surfeit; for there is no other word adequate to describe it: it is not the excess merely, it is the absolute surfeit of work that remains to be done: work that accumulates from year to year, and work that is certain to fall more heavily in arrear in proportion to the prolongation of the rule of a Tory Government.\u2019Liberalism and LabourI would have you observe this further thing. Cast your mind back upon what I have been speaking about. Is there one of those things upon which there is any material difference between Liberal ideas and the ideas of those who directly represent labour in Parliament? Not one. Any seeming difference would at once dry up and disappear the moment we came to work together upon them. There is no reason why these two branches of the party of progress should not work har­moniously together. For my part I can honestly say that I have never heard upon any Liberal platform anything but sympathy and welcome expressed towards Labour members. If I have to my regret seen reported unfriendly things as having been said of the party to which I belong by prominent Labour politicians, I am confident that with patience and experience of one another any such feeling will evaporate.The Fiscal QuestionLet me ask you to go with me to the subject which has most occupied public attention for the last two years. How do we stand with regard to the great fiscal question I hold that we may claim to look both forward and back wards with a certain measure of cheerful assurance. The Protectionists have been beaten in argument; they have been routed at the by-elections; in the House of Commons they have been made to commit happy dispatch themselves. But we cannot lay down our arms until the Unionist party has formally separated itself from any schemes which directly or indirectly prejud­ice freedom of trade. They are far from having done this yet. Personally I would welcome a recantation even before a general election came on, because we have plenty of other issues to meet. We cannot for a moment relax our vigilance. Do not be blindly confident; do not be blind to the manoeuvres now going on, or the likelihood that they are leading up to some small and innocent-looking electoral instalment on account. Never mind if we are denounced as bigots and fanatics for insisting that the Free-trade position should be held intact. A general may have been foiled in his frontal attack and yet manage to effect a lodgment by a side way or a back way, and he will then think his foe was a very good sort of fellow and a very open-minded one to oblige him by allowing him to do so. But what comfort will it be, when the citadel has fallen, for the unwary defender to reflect that his defence was conducted in no antiquated spirit of obstinacy or intolerance?Unionist ManoeuvresWhat is the nature of these manoeuvres going on? We can only look from a distance and guess. We all remember the extraordinary campaign started two years ago, when the pioneer went out in advance under the flag of food taxation and preference with the blessing, the best wishes, and the warm sympathy of the commander of the main army, who contented himself with the humbler and less brilliant role of preparing at his leisure to annul, delete, and cancel the established and cardinal principle that taxation should be only for revenue purposes. I am not sure, on the whole, that the noisy and blatant vanguard is so likely to have done so much harm as the quieter and more insidious part of the army that remained. The pioneer included in his operations this very city on Tyneside, and it was to this city, and it may have been in this very house for aught I know - (\u2018No, the one you are going to\u2019) - I am glad that it was not - that he bequeathed the deathless picture of the annihilation of all our industries, the extinction of our fires, the stoppage of all our exports; while, marvellous to say, the imports were to continue coming in just as usual. What an odd thing it is that a clear and level-headed man like Mr. Chamberlain never realises apparently that trade is barter, and that if things go out other things must come in, and if things come in other things must go out. That was an unrivalled picture, but the glamour of it and of the triumph of his progress gradually faded away. Calamity overtook them; and now the chief preoccupa­tion of that army appears to be, not to equip itself with arms of offence, but rather they have been concerned with the exigencies present and prospective of the ambulance department.The Design of the Ambulance Waggon They are too stricken, too prostrate, to go to the country otherwise than in a recumbent position; and the deputation to Downing Street that we heard of, and the apparently incomplete negotiations of which we hear so much from time to time, only betoken some little differences between the authorities as to the design and decoration of the ambulance waggon. Mr. Chamberlain would, no doubt, like to have a fiery cross, Mr. Balfour would prefer a red cross or a cross of some neutral colour, but at any rate something which would appeal to Free-traders not to fire upon it; and the announcement which the country waits for with expectation and some amusement will tell us whether a combination of the two crosses is possible. There is no Geneva Convention for a political campaign. If Mr. Chamberlain\u2019s quick-firing gun and Lord Lansdowne\u2019s big revolver form part of the equipment of this melancholy procession when once it sets out on its way such concealment would be deserving of no greater reprobation than the prolonged policy of evasion and concealment and dissimulation of which the country has grown so heartily sick. If at this time of day you and I are deceived by any new formula, any freshly-discovered device for dressing up Protection in Free-trade garments, we shall have ourselves to blame. I fear little myself from any such concordat that may be devised. Supposing they do come to terms on the basis of the Sheffield and Glasgow programme, a concordat so spectral and unsubstantial will fail to consolidate their party or drive a wedge into the party of Free Trade.Mr. Chamberlain and the Trade Unionists Two nights ago Mr. Chamberlain again appeared, waving the fiery cross. The old fallacies and the old promises were trotted out again. Having secured the gentlemen of the Tariff Reform League, he now addressed himself to the trade unions and the workmen generally. He says to them that a great deal, after all, depends on what you think of the man who is addressing you. That is very true; and those who are asked to consent to dearer food on his pledge that the cost of living will not be increased will not forget the old-age pensions proposals which were \u2018so simple\u2019 that anybody could understand them. This new scheme is also described as simple, but those will be even more simple who are taken in by it. He goes on to say that he has no personal interest to serve. Who ever said he had a personal interest? I am not aware that it has ever been alleged by anyone. And he says he is a mere consumer; but are the people about him mere consumers? Are the members of his tariff commission nothing but consumers? Do none of them stand to gain by the proceedings in which they are engaged?The Colonies and Mr. ChamberlainHaving thus cleared his character from an imputation never made, he appeals to the working man. First, he interlards his appeal with higher and wider themes. He brings up the heavy artillery to which we are so accustomed, but the roar of which has never intimidated us - namely, the grand Imperial idea. \u2018The Colonies,\u2019 he says, \u2018helped us in the war, shall we reject and insult them now?\u2019 I would not reject and insult anybody, much less the Colonies. I give the Colonies credit for good feeling, for loyalty, and for good sense, and for a proper estimate of their own independence. The idea that their own indepen­dence, the idea that their loyalty depends upon trade advantages is the worst of insults. I think I once called it myself \u2018a squalid idea.\u2019 I repeat that it is a squalid idea. It has of ten been flung at my head and they can go on flinging it. What do the Colonies themselves say of this? We hear so much of what Mr. Chamberlain thinks about the Colonies, let us see what the Colonies think about Mr. Chamberlain. Here is a quotation from an article in the Toronto Globe of April 12th, which is the principal Ministerial organ in Ontario:'By what authority does Mr. Chamberlain pose as interpreter of Canadian sentiment and ambition? What has he seen of Canada, and what does he know of Canadian feelings, that he should talk about the endangering of Canadian loyalty? Does he measure Canadian loyalty by an extra five per cent, or ten per cent preference on Canadian wheat, or is he trying to \u201cbunco\u201d the British elector into the adoption of Protection with a bogey game of Colonial dismemberment? A man who visited the United States again and again, but only once, even when Colonial Secretary, deigned to touch Canadian soil, is in no position to estimate either the quality or the strength of Canadian sentiment. It would be well for Mr. Chamberlain were he to base his Protective propaganda on the needs and interests of the British taxpayer, rather than the fickleness of Canadian loyalty. Imperialistic tuft-hunters may submit, but the point will soon be reached when intelligent and self-respecting Canadians will resent the persistent misrepresentation of Canadian sentiment by British politicians. One of our chief humiliations is the tone of men like Mr. Chamberlain, who think we are bound to the Empire by ties of trade preference.'Mr. Chamberlain\u2019s Fallacies and ContradictionsNow, when he turns to his appeal to the workmen, we see instance after instance in his speeches of contradictory statements on the financial question. He praises high tariff countries, and says \u2018the conditions of life in Germany are such that many an English working­man would be glad to change places with some of his German competitors.\u2019 I would interpolate, How does it come to pass that at the last election in Germany there was a huge number - I think some­thing like one-half of the votes - which were given for Socialist candidates on the very ground that the exactions of the rich and of the State made their life almost intolerable? But now I have quoted what he says in commending life in Germany to the British working­man. What does he say himself when he is talking of aliens in that same speech \u2013 \u2018If the aliens were not allowed to come to England they would stop in Germany and the products of their cheap labour would come in their stead.\u2019 Thus Germany is, in the same speech, a workman\u2019s paradise and a country where goods are produced cheaply by sweating and unfair conditions. Surely it cannot be both. Again, he makes his appeal to the workmen by the promises of more employ­ment; but if his ten per cent duty on manufactured goods results in their exclusion, his arguments based on increased revenue - the foreigner paying our taxes and even, as we have now been told, our rates - fall to the ground; if, on the other hand, it does not keep them out, then where is the increased employment to come from? Our position with regard to this - and it is worthwhile to repeat it and revive our apprehension of it - is that any artificial steps taken for increasing the price of commodities is bound in the long run to reduce the opportunities for employment. Here and there it may benefit a single or particular trade by giving it a greater command of the home market. Take pearl buttons, referred to by one in the audience, for instance; or sugar refining - we have not heard so much of sugar refining since the effect of the Sugar Convention made itself felt, and large numbers of operatives in the confectionery trade were added to the ranks of the unemployed. Our contention is that, taking our home produce and our exports together, anything that arbitrarily raises the cost of production must react to the prejudice of the workman, and this for the simple reason, which we can never persuade Mr. Chamberlain to consider, that a diminution of the effective demand for commodities means a restriction of the employment of labour. If a man has to pay more for his boots or clothes, what is the effect upon him? He will economise in boots and clothes, he will not buy so many. How is that going to give more work to the boot-maker or the tailor? This is a plain argument quite apart from all those high-flying economic theories with which - and in this I agree with Mr. Chamberlain - the ordinary mind and the ordinary man might only be confused.The Real Remedies I commend those plain arguments to you who are workmen and to others. The way to improve our trade is by other methods altogether, first, by lightening the burden of taxation through a peaceful and frugal policy; secondly, by better education and more drastic control of the liquor traffic; thirdly, by improving the character and stamina of our people by reform of the deplorable surroundings in which masses of them live; and lastly, by giving agriculture a chance, by giving the farmers security, and offering the labourer a career in his calling. It is in such directions as these that will be found the redemption of our social system, and not by restricting trade and by following the will-o\u2019-the-wisp of baseless fallacies and mischievous and delusive promises.

aVMr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen, - I thank you from the bottom of my heart for your kindly welcome. As Mr. Radford has said, it is not the first time that I have been in Plymouth at a Liberal meeting. I well remember how kindly you received me in those dark days; I thank you for repeating that kindly reception in these brighter times.The Liberal Party in Excellent HealthNow, ladies and gentlemen, we have arrived today at one of the most interesting and, at the same time, the most critical periods in the year\u2019s history of a political party - the moment, that is, when the leader of the party in the House of Commons meets the leading men of the party as it is organised throughout the country, in order to take counsel together and in order that he may render some account of himself to them. It is a testing moment for the health of a party. Ill fares the party when these two elements, those who conduct the warfare in the House of Commons and those who organise and inspire it in the country, show any discrepancy between them either in intention or in temperature. But when I speak of temperature it makes me think of that to which I have been subject myself within the last two or three days. When the doctor makes a diagnosis of his patient, he considers a rise of temperature to be a sign of disease; we in political life consider it a sign of abounding health. Now, I have already discerned, not only from the reports I have received of the proceedings of the Federation yesterday and today, but also from what I can appreciate myself in this great audience, that there is perfect harmony between us at this moment. I go further: never in my experience has that harmony been so great as it is at this moment. I can honestly say so, looking back over the months passed since the General Election, and this may astonish some of our kindly critics in the Press and on the platform, but it is my honest and undoubted conviction. It has never been greater than now. It has gained rather than lost in intensity. In the House of Commons and in the country alike the zeal of our friends is only equalled by their patience. Long may it continue so, for the moving force of their passion is great, but great also is their reasonableness. Without these two conditions it is not possible to do great political work for the country.Not a Single Day Wasted in the CommonsYou will ask me what report I bring from the House of Commons of the position of business there, and if I were to place any faith - and I do not - in what I read in the newspapers I might stand in some degree of trepidation before you. I see charges of flagrant Parliamentary mismanagement, charges of overloading the ship, but especially of forcing on the House of Commons, even under the lightened programme of business announced last Monday, an intolerable and impossible burden. We are attacked for attempt­ing too much, we are attacked for accomplishing too little, and that little bad. One thing that sustains me amidst it all is the know­ledge that since the debate on the Address was finished, largely owing to the good management of Mr. Whiteley, we have not wasted a single day in the House of Commons. Other people may have wasted time possibly, but we are not responsible for that. If we put more into our Sessional programme than we have been able to carry out, at least you cannot blame us for want of energy. If we have been doing mischief, as our opponents suggest - and they would not be proper opponents if they did not suggest it - at any rate, it is not the kind of mischief which we were told in our child­hood days was found for idle hands to do. We have not idle hands; we have been working overtime and at high pressure.The Licensing BillWe have met with two great disappointments, I admit. I wish we could have seen our way to passing a thoroughly good Licensing Bill. That is what I hoped - I, indeed, promised - but it was impossible. I admit we overestimated our powers; but you will, I know, share our disappointment, and let me offer you this consolation, that the Bill which will see the light next year will be a better Bill and a more effectual Bill than we could have submitted this year.The Irish Council BillAgain, I wish I could have reported that the claims of Ireland were to receive an instalment of justice, that her crying need for an opportunity to rally her own people in an effort for her better government was about to be satisfied, at least in part. We made a sincere and honest attempt to provide that opportunity, and I regret that the scheme put forward by his Majesty\u2019s Government, which, in their view, would have gone some way in starting Ireland along a new career, and a career of prosperity, was rejected in haste by the Irish people. But, if this be a subject of regret, ladies and gentlemen, do not think for a moment that I complain of their action. We took what steps we could to ascertain Irish feeling, and we had good reason to believe that our Bill would receive a most favourable reception, but the moment we were undeceived of course it was all over. A measure which was pronounced to be out of accord with the wishes and ideas of the Irish people was not a measure which a Liberal Government could proceed with, and therefore, although with regret and reluctance, we had to abandon it. My own views with regard to Ireland, I need hardly tell you, ladies and gentlemen, are wholly unchanged; I am not sure that they have not even been confirmed by what has happened; but if you ask me how the policy of the Liberal party is affected and what they are prepared to offer Ireland in the near future, I can only reply that you must wait and see. There are times when silence and reflection are better than speech, and I am not sure that this is not one of them. We must give the people of Ireland and the people of England time to take in the situation in all its bearings without bitterness and without passion. But, after all, if we have had to endure these two disappointments, we have no reason to be dissatisfied with the progress we have made.The Budget and Reduction of ExpenditureMr. Asquith\u2019s Budget is well on its way, and a most notable Budget it is. It will be remembered in the years to come as a Budget which began the process of melting down our cast-iron system of Income-tax by discriminating between earned and unearned incomes, and, even more, it will be remembered as the Bud­get which marked the starting-point of old age pensions. But, ladies and gentlemen, do not forget this; if we are to work out anything approaching to an adequate system of old age pensions it is imperative that the Government must insist on cutting down with rigour all superfluous expenditure. We cannot eat our cake and have it too. Let me mention one bright spot at least in this connec­tion; since we took office we have not been called upon to incur any outlay on the head of war expenditure. Long may that happy state of things continue. I hope and believe, too, that, as a result of the Conference at the Hague, fresh guarantees of peace may be secured.The Land Programme of the GovernmentThen we have made considerable progress with our land programme, which we mean to press on with all the energy at our command, because we hold that no problem is more urgent than this of the land, and our belief is that, by offering a better chance of independence, social as well as political, to the rural population who cannot now get land in many parts to cultivate, and by reform­ing the incidence of local taxation, we shall go some way to accom­plishing the end we have set before us, I mean the development of the resources of this country of ours to the best advantage. The Small Holdings Bills for England and Scotland and the Valuation Bills for the two countries may not loom so large in the public eye as certain other measures, but they are of crucial importance to the health, contentment, and well-being of the people, and to the prosperity of our industries.Reform of House of Commons ProcedureBut, ladies and gentlemen, I am not going to detain you with a catalogue of what we have accomplished or have in anticipation, because the subject I specially wish to discuss is the instrument, the political instrument, with which we have to work. This may be the thing we have to do; let us see what it is we have to do it with. Mr. Gladstone once said upon this topic that a man shaving himself in the morning made a judicious use of his time and ener­gies by attending to the edge of his razor before undertaking that operation. Liberals, see to our razor. We have spent a good deal of time in a very difficult task, in endeavouring to get a keener edge on our House of Commons procedure, and I think that time was well spent, and that the additional committees which have been set up will increase the output and quality of our legislation. A step, which remains to be taken, will probably be the establishment of a b\u000a\u000ausiness committee to allocate the time to be given to various measures. The waste of time in the House of Commons is still appalling, and remember that waste of time means the throwing away of national opportunities. It means that the energy and keenness which we cannot do without evaporate and give place to lassitude. Any measures, therefore, we may take with a view to checking this mischief are bound to make the House of Commons a better deliberative Assembly and a more businesslike, because a more concentrated, Assembly.The Lords and the Education BillOh! But that is the House of Commons. There is another House. The House of Commons, ladies and gentlemen, with all its imperfections, would be well enough if we were not exposed to the operations of another Chamber, whose powers of obstruction are often directed to thwarting and neutralising the efforts of the House of Commons, and discrediting any Government with which that second Chamber is not in sympathy. Take the position - and it is a deplorable position - of the education question. You know how it stands. You know how our efforts to bring about a settlement were thwarted, and the principal labours of last Session were thrown to the wind by the action of the Lords, and you remember what was the situation in which this was done. The country had just expressed its mind by sending an overwhelming majority to the House of Commons to see that popular control and manage­ment of the schools of the nation was secured, and to sweep away the sectarian tests imposed upon the teachers. Yes, the country willed it so, but the Lords willed it otherwise, and today you have men who are the salt of the earth suffering imprisonment and the seizure of their goods rather than pay for the teaching of doctrines in which they disbelieve in the public elementary schools. Yes, and meanwhile the administrative machinery, which urgently calls for attention if our schools are to be made efficient and the children to be kept healthy, had to be left to creak and grind along as best it may because the peers had made up their minds in a different way from the country. And what was this principle on which the peers temporal and spiritual, at the instigation of a minority in the House of Commons, were pleased to act? Why, that the interests of national education were secondary and should be made sub­servient to the established Church of England. This was the prin­ciple on which they exercised their revising powers, and this was the principle on which they resisted and defied the will of the people as expressed through their elected representatives. Well, that is how the instrument works, that is why we are in trouble about the education question and compelled to begin all over again next Session.Don\u2019t Play into the Hands of the EnemyNow I am going to venture to give you a piece of advice. Do not forget at whose door the responsibility lies; do not be impatient because we decline to spend our time in sending up little Bills only to have them flung back in our faces. I know how bitterly our friends have been tried by this period of waiting, but I know them, I think, too well, and I have worked with them too long, to believe they will play into the hands of the enemy by any faltering or flagging now that we are about to join issue with the House of Lords.A Silly ChargeNow, having disposed of that piece of advice, I want to say a word about the accusation, and a very silly one it is, that we are raising this question for party or tactical purposes, and in order to get rid of the pledges we gave to the country and to free ourselves from the burden of the legislation which it is our duty and privilege to promote. There could hardly be a more silly charge than that. You have only to look at the circumstances and to remember that in our very first Session two measures of capital im­portance, the Education Bill and the Bill for the abolition of the monstrous and intolerable electoral anomaly and privilege of plural voting, were rejected. You have only to think of that to see that the quarrel was not of our seeking, but was violently forced upon us. And, in the second place, the slightest study of the character and composition of the present Liberal and progressive party in the House of Commons - and for this part of my argument I hope I may be allowed to treat the Liberal and Labour party as one - would suffice to show that never was a party in more deadly earnest abo\u000a\u000aut reform than the party which it is my pride to lead. The quarrel was forced upon us, and it is because we are in earnest about our legislation and intend to find a way of getting it through, and because we do not regard politics as a mere game played for the amusement of two parties in the State, that we propose to bring this matter to a serious and decisive test.A Game to Discredit Liberal Governments and to Restore ProtectionAnd remember another thing. These successive blows at the authority of the House of Commons, directed though they were at particular measures, are part of a general scheme for discrediting - not this Government, that were a small affair - but discrediting any Liberal Government, and impressing the country with the view that a Liberal ministry, be it ever so powerful, ever so united, is impotent to carry its measures. You observe the brilliant idea. They first make our work well-nigh impossible and then hold us up to the contempt of the country as bunglers and impostors. And what is the sequel to that? What are they hoping and praying for in their Primrose lodges and Tariff Reform camp meetings? It is this, that the House of Lords by these tactics will set Protection on its feet again and drive the electors in a fit of disgust back into the fold where for twenty long years they have been shepherded and fleeced.Cleverness: a Game that Does not PayThat is the game, and it may be exceedingly clever; but there is one thing I have learned in my Parliamentary experience - to the length of which my friend in the chair made such an unkindly allusion - I have learned this - it is not cleverness that pays in the long run. The people of this country are a straightforward people. They like honesty and straightforwardness of purpose. They may laugh at it and they may be amused by it, and they may in a sense admire it, but they do not like cleverness. You may be too clever by half.The Existence of Liberalism at StakeSir, they are reckoning without their host. There is one thing they have overlooked. His Majesty\u2019s Government have no inten­tion of playing the part referred to them in this nice little game. And when I hear those gusts of mirthless laughter rising from the Opposition benches whenever this question of the House of Lords is referred to, I feel sorry that the relics of a once great and respectable party, as the Conservative party was, are so en­gulfed in their petty tactics, so deluded by the flippant habit of mind which has become popular among them, as to be totally oblivious to the gravity of the issue which stands at their door. I am addressing you tonight under a deep sense of responsibility; for the very existence of Liberalism as a force in the State and as an instrument of progress in the times to come depends upon the outcome of the struggle upon which we are embarking. If there is to be no place for a self-respecting Liberalism in this country, if Liberalism with the country behind it cannot enforce its policy, then is it not better that we should go down in the assertion of our rights rather than linger on as a shadow of a Government, strong, perhaps, in numbers, strong, perhaps also it may be, in good inten­tions, but withal without authority or power?The Constitutional Issue InvolvedI ask you now to turn to the constitutional issue involved in this controversy. And I will tell you at once that, in my opinion, the Lords have abused their powers within the Constitution, and that in assigning to them their proper place, as it is our purpose to do - and a very good, useful, and honourable place it is - so far from attacking the Constitution or setting up a revolution, it is we who are defending, it is the Lords who are straining, the Constitu­tion. Remember that although we are forced into this struggle by the circumstances which surround and confront us, it is the climax of a series of attacks upon the rights and liberties of the Commons. Therefore, if the immediate causes of the deadlock and confusion were withdrawn, we should none the less be bound to go forward. What is this doctrine of the Constitution? That doctrine is not, as you might infer from the action of the peers, it is not that there are two Chambers exercising co-ordinate authority and equal powers. The peers themselves put forward no such claim. In terms they admit the predominance of the House of Commons, although their practice at times belies their profession. The last word, the ultimate supremacy, rests with the House of Commons. That is the accepted constitutional doctrine, and what we have to do is to see that the relations between the two Houses are so arranged as to define the limits within which the power which the Constitution has conferred upon the Lords may be properly exercised.The Relations between the Houses since the Reform ActNow the history of the relations between the two Houses since the Reform Act shows that the second Chamber has alternated be­tween two courses and policies, neither of which can be squared with the loyal and consistent discharge of their constitutional obligations. The one policy has been to efface itself before the decisions of the House of Commons, and there have been considerable periods dur­ing which that effacement has been almost unbroken by a suggestion of\u000a\u000acriticism or by any sign of corporate life and intelligence. The other policy has been to set up its own views and to push them to extreme lengths against the House of Commons; and, if you pursue your inquiries you will find that these violent oscillations invariably correspond with the political complexion of the majority in the House of Commons, and that the Lords are deferential and obse­quious when the Conservatives are in power and defiant and contemptuous when the Liberals are in power. Their record can be depicted in graphic form by a series of curves such as statisticians and mathematicians love, the depressions marking the time the Tories and Unionists are in office and the lofty, bounding, and swelling curves the time when the Liberals are in office.How the Reform Act changed the SituationNow what we call the House of Lords question is of compara­tively recent origin, dating from the time of the Reform Act. The Reform Act was the first step and the longest in the direction of democratic government. Until then the Members of the British Houses had much affinity with each other, affinity in the class from which they were drawn and in the sympathies and prejudices which swayed them. But besides that general affinity there was a special affinity which greatly affected the case. Up to that period both Houses were united by a common tie, because the elected Chamber was to a large extent in the pocket of the House of Lords. The great peers who owned pocket boroughs pulled the strings and the House of Commons responded; but from the moment the House of Lords was confronted by an independent and representative assembly the complexion of things was fundamentally altered, and you had a new confrontation of the great factors in our Constitu­tion. Yes, and from that moment, as we can see now, looking back over the years that have passed, the Lords were called upon to make their choice between resistance and acquiescence - a choice between, on the one hand, drifting along on the heavy current of class prejudice and privilege, striking for their order and their class as the opportunity arose, and resisting reforms as long as they could safely do so, until the crisis came, or, on the other hand rendering a loyal and consistent acqui­escence in the situation created by the Reform Act. Had they followed the latter course, and accepted the new House of Representatives in no capricious spirit as the governing factor in politics, had they exercised their powers in a judicial and impartial spirit, and as men alive to the requirements of the time, had they opened their doors, as Lord Palmerston wanted them to do, to life peers, we should not be entering upon this crisis today. They met the Reformed Parliament by defeating or mutilating measure after measure, and it was only the influence of the Duke of Wellington that induced them grudgingly and for a time to modify that attitude of defiance. And as the House of Commons became more and more representative of the nation, what happened? Exactly what I have been describing. You had periods of unreflecting and unintelligent subserviency, alternating with periods of obstructive and destructive activity, and with this I ask you to note another characteristic, the gradual conversion, not unnatural in these circumstances, of the peers into a solid party phalanx - an indication not only of atrophy, but of detachment from the world of affairs and the movements of the times.Lord Shaftesbury on the House of LordsI know nothing better worth quoting on this subject than the record which Lord Shaftesbury has left of the feelings which over­came him at the prospect of having to leave the House of Commons and take his place in the House of Lords. You know what a great philanthropist Lord Shaftesbury was. Let me read this extract from Lord Ashley\u2019s - he was Lord Ashley then, in 1842 - diary: \u2018In the course of nature it seems probable that before long I shall be removed to another scene of action - to the House of Lords. If I regard this event as a man only, I must see in it utter annihila­tion of all my schemes for the benefit of the working classes and a total retirement from public life\u2026 The peers act as break­waters and think as such. This is their office and they never rise above it.\u2019 I commend this in passing; I commend this to the ingenuous persons who take us to task and move amendments, as we have seen this Session, to the Address, condemning us for put­ting aside schemes for social reforms in order to deal with the House of Lords.Recent History: The Lords UnteachableThen I come down to more recent times, the twenty years of Unionist Government, during which, except for an interval of three years of activity, we hardly remembered the existence of the second Chamber, and certainly never took it into account as a decisive or influential factor in the course of events. So completely did they efface themselves during those twenty years, with the exception I have just mentioned, that I really believe we went into the last general election under an impression that the break­waters, as Lord Shaftesbury called them, were no longer uprearing themselves. And after the election, was it surprising that we fancied they had been finally submerged? Were we not justified in believing that the significance of the election would not be lost upon the Lords, and that if lost, no words of ours could force it upon their apprehension? In this we were wrong, completely, hopelessly, abjectly wrong. The Lords did hear of the election, and probably they regarded it as a great piece of impertinence. They arose from their slumber, and in the very first Session of the new Parliament they gave us to understand that their authority was greater than ours and that their views of what was just and right and good were not to be deflected by the mighty and unparalleled demonstration of the new year\u2019s victory. I say that never in our history have they ventured so far and so audaciously. Threescore years and ten have been theirs for consideration, reflection, and amendment, and this is the use they have made of it; this is the extent to which they have proved themselves teachable!\u2018The British people must be Master in its own House\u2019The Liberal party cannot take blame to themselves for any lack of forbearance, but really, when you see these legislators, who are where they are from no fault of their own - it may be, although I do not say it, for some merit of their own - so exercising their powers within six months of that unparalleled general election, we really must not be asked to go on kissing the rod and supplying them with material to make or mar, as in their wisdom they think fit. The time for compromisings, and temporisings, and verbal expostulations has gone by; and we must give the House of Lords to understand that, whilst we are perfectly ready to legislate with due deliberation and to give every weight to their representations, the British people must be master in its own house.\u2018Keep the Fighting Line Strong and Unbroken\u2019 I am addressing the organisers and leaders of the Liberal party; I know that on your support, on your confidence, on your enthusiasm, we may safely rely in fair weather and in foul until we have seen this business through. And what I say to you I know applies equally to those you represent. Keep the fighting line strong and unbroken, and if there are times when we at Westminster are not doing quite so well or moving quite as fast as you would wish, be patient with us while you do your best to keep us up to the mark. Above all things, remember, as you go into this struggle, that the greatest instrument of liberty, justice, and progress in this world is in your keeping and that it is yours to see that the efficacy of this great instrument of Parliamentary Government is not soiled and blunted any longer by the misuse to which it has been sub­jected. By the part you play, vindicate the memory of your fathers who, in dark days, shrank from no sacrifice and suffering that they might win for us that goodly heritage which we mean to hand on, enlarged and made secure, to the citizens of the future.

aVI remember very well, almost ten years ago, coming here to speak at a meeting held under the auspices of the National Liberal Federation. We were then on the eve, amid considerable party difficulties, of electing Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman to be our leader in the House of Commons. I find myself tonight once more face to face with a great gathering called under the same auspices, very soon after he has passed to his rest and it is but natural and fitting at such a moment that before we do anything else, we should recall the work that he did, the example that he set, in those intervening years of strenuous and disinterested labour, by which he won for himself not only the attachment of his own party, but the respect and the confidence of the whole nation. Mr. Chairman, as the man who has been chosen to be his immediate successor, I should be failing in my duty if I did not take this opportunity of acknow­ledging that the dislocation and the delays which are inevitable in any transfer of leadership have in this instance been to a large, I believe to an unexampled, degree mitigated and indeed removed by the unselfish loyalty of my colleagues, and the unstinted good will of the party both in the House of Commons and in the country.The Government RecordI have not come here tonight to promulgate any new pro­gramme; the aims which for the last three years we have followed, and the spirit in which we have followed them, continue to be the purposes and the inspiration of our policy. I shall not, Sir, attempt any detailed retrospect of these three years; two or three words, however, I will permit myself to say about them. In the sphere of legislation you have only got to look at the Statute book to see how much has been accomplished of useful and too-long ­delayed reform; but I am sure I need not remind you that, for reasons upon which it is not necessary for the moment to dilate, the Statute book - many and valuable as are the chapters that have been added to it - the Statute book is no adequate or trustworthy measure of that which we have attempted. Gentlemen, it is a commonplace among the less well informed of our Tory critics - and they are very numerous - to say when the Liberal party is in power it devotes all the time and the energy of Parliament to tinkering with constitutional changes to the sacrifice, or at any rate the postponement, of social reform. Well, now, looking back upon those three years, I can only recall one measure introduced by us which could be described fairly or unfairly as coming within that category, and that is a measure of which my colleagues and I are not in the least degree ashamed - or of the time and the labour which were unavailingly expended on the Bill for the abolition of plural voting, which was contemptuously rejected on its second reading by the House of Lords. This was a Bill, I say, embodying a reform in our opinion not only urgent, but indispensable, if the object of our electoral system is, as it ought to be, to provide a true and not a distorted reflection of the genuine opinion of the constituencies of the country.Social ReformBut, ladies and gentlemen, as a matter of fact, as the Statute book shows, and will continue to show, our main energies have been during these three years to measures of social reform. I will give you two or three illustrations. Workmen\u2019s compensation; we have admitted to the benefit of the law millions of workpeople who under the legislation of the late Government were excluded from it. And small-holdings; we have for the first time set up a really practical machinery for bringing within the reach of those who demand it - and there are many in all parts of the country - the opportunity of acquiring and of working small-holdings for them­selves. And criminal appeal; we have obliterated a blot - for it was a blot - upon our judicial system by giving to everyone con­victed of crime the same opportunity which a person mulcted for damages in a civil case has always had of having his case reheard and his sentence reviewed. And this year, in the case of old age pensions, we continue the same work upon the same lines. Why do I mention these things? Ladies and gentlemen, these are all things about which the Tories have been talking, and preaching, and gesticulating, and perorating for years. We have carried them into law.Administration - FinanceAnd if I may say one word about the other sphere, the equally important sphere of administration, I will take only two illustrations. First of all, I will venture to take that with which I myself have been personally associated - the domain of finance. What have we been doing there? Paying off the liabilities incurred by pre­decessors. We have brought back the National Debt to what it was twenty years ago; we have reduced and we are reducing the taxes upon tea and sugar - necessaries of life; we have made the income-tax at the same time more equitable and more productive. In that way I claim for us, that without deviating one hair\u2019s breadth from the principles of Free Trade, we have set free the finances and have re-established the credit of this country to a degree which will make it able to meet any legitimate calls - and such calls will be many - which are made upon it for the exigencies of social reform.South African PolicyThe other illustration I will take is derived from a totally different sphere - I refer to our policy in South Africa. You will remember - well, every politician in this hall remembers - the con­fident predictions made when we came into office, that what with our unhappy pledges on Chinese labour, and what with our rash policy and plea of immediate autonomy, our ship was certain, sooner or later, and sooner rather than later, either to founder among the shoals, or be shot among the rocks of repatriation of the Chinese. It was said to be midsummer madness. It would lead to irreplaceable shortness in the labour needed for the mines, and cause in South Africa financial and industrial collapse, and here in England and in Scotland widespread ruin among innocent widows and orphans - those innocent widows and orphans whose little all at that time was largely invested in the faith of the continuance of Chinese labour, but since that time appears to have been shifted. How arguments repeat themselves! As to self-government, the notion of placing power in the hands of the unreconciled, irreconcilable enemies of this country was only worthy of faddists and fanatics, who were prepared to contemplate the permanent estrangement of the two races and the ultimate loss of South Africa to the Empire. How does it all look after twelve months of actual experience? The Chinese are going, before many months are over the last of them will have re-embarked for his native shore, but the mines are prosperous, the labour supply is abundant and increasing, and the output of gold is larger than it ever was at any time. And as regards the constitutional question in the Transvaal and the Orange River Colony, you have two Ministries in power recruited largely, indeed mainly, from those who only a few years ago were bearing arms against us in the field, and whose loyalty no one now ventures to impeach, under whose wise and statesmanlike rule racial divi­sions are rapidly being obliterated, and a way is being paved for the natural evolution of parties on ordinary lines. Never in the whole history of our Empire has the policy of Liberalism been more rapidly and more completely vindicated by our party.Tariff ReformBut, gentlemen, I am not going to speak of the past, for you will naturally expect me, and it is my duty, to say something both of the present and of the future. Before I sit down I shall say a word or two on the legislation which is now before the House of Commons. But before I do that I want, if I may, to recall you for a few moments to the issue raised here in this city five years ago, which for three years dominated public interest and public controversy, and which some people - I myself was never one - believed to have been settled for a generation by the election of 1906. Gentlemen, what is called Tariff Reform is in these days not much talked about in the House of Commons. We have every Session one full dress debate which, I am afraid, to be absolutely faithful, I must say cuts a very sorry figure. It is not much written about in the Press, but in the constituencies it is the object, never forget, of an unceasing and a ceaseless propaganda. In my opinion, it is every whit as necessary now as it was five or as it was three years ago, that the case for Free Trade should be constantly presented to our fellow countrymen, not only in its broad and general aspects, but in its application to particular industries and particular districts, and with special reference to the chameleon colourings, to the ever-shifting variations of the fallacies which are always at the service of the cause of Tariff Reform. You must have noticed during the last few months considerable change in the temper and spirits of the Tariff Reformers. While our over-sea trade was booming they were, to use a homely expression, down in the dumps. But they are beginning to recover their spirits under the stimulus of a monthly decrease in the Board of Trade returns. It is no wonder that they were a little depressed, for every assumption which they took for granted, every prediction which they hazarded five years ago, has been woefully falsified by the facts.Some Tariff Reform Assumptions   I do not think I am wasting your time if I recall to your recollection one or two of those assumptions. It will not take me very long. In the first place, you will remember well that they told us that one of our greatest dangers as an industrial nation was the appalling rate at which the dumping foreigner was pouring his goods, and particularly his manufactured goods, into our markets and underselling the home producer, driving British labour out of employment. Well, what are the facts? In the extraordinary development, the enormous development, during the four years that followed, of our overseas trade, the one item which showed the least elasticity was the imports into this country of foreign manufactured goods. In 1902, the foreign manufactured goods imported and retained were valued at 115 millions. In 1907, notwithstanding the enormous expansion, as I have said, that had gone on in the interval, they had only risen to 128 millions, or a rise of 11 per cent. Now come to the other - second - danger, and the most interesting and edifying contrast it presents. The second danger alleged was the relative inelasticity of our own export trade, particularly in regard, again, to manufactured goods. What are the facts? There in 1902 we exported of manufactured goods of British produce 227 millions, in 1907, 344 millions, an increase of 50 per cent. The imports of foreign manufactured goods here rose 11 per cent, our exports of British goods rose 50 per cent. Finally, I would give you one other illustration, and one other only. We were told of the growing relative importance of our colonial as compared with our foreign trade. What were the facts about that? In 1902, foreign trade was 61 per cent, in 1907 it had risen to nearly 68 per cent, and the colonial trade, which in 1902 was 38 per cent, had dwindled in 1907 to little more than 32 per cent. That is in regard to the past; but they are now fixing their hopes on the declining trade, which is common to us and to every country in the world. Well, if Free Trade stood, as it has stood, the test of abounding prosperity throughout the whole of the industrial world, still more, I venture to predict, will it stand the test of declining prosperity. For depend upon it, the less prosperous your trade and other people\u2019s trade becomes, the more need you have here in this country for the cheap and unimpeded inflow of all materials for food and industry.\u2018Not a Diamond, but a Formula\u2019I must, before I leave this question, ask again a question. I have often asked it before. What is the remedy which the Tariff Reformers have to offer? Are we any nearer understanding it than we were three years ago? I do not know whether you noticed  some proceedings which have been going on in Paris this week in regard to an alleged invention of a process for producing artificial diamonds. The professed discoverer of this valuable secret was allowed his time to give a concrete demonstration, of its efficacy. The time expired; the appointed hour struck; the discoverer failed to appear, and he seems to have left behind him, not on a half-sheet of notepaper, but in an envelope, not a diamond, but a formula. Yes, and the formula is a delightfully simple one. You are to take some carbon; put it in a crucible; heat it till it crystallises; then apply the requisite pressure, and, as the formula runs, \u2018it remains only to take out the diamond.\u2019 I am not surprised to read in the papers this morning that the experts to whom the practical trial of this process has been referred report that the consequences are not wholly satisfactory. After all, this formula is just as lucid, and I think just as likely to yield the desired result, as is the formula of our friends who propose to give us a sort of scientific tariff.What is the Formula of a Scientific Tariff?What is the formula of a scientific tariff? Take a lot of import duties; make them low enough to bring in an abounding revenue; make them at the same time high enough to exclude the unfair competition of foreign goods, and you have a scientific tariff. That is the formula of what may be called the full-blown and full\u2011blooded Tariff Reform. But so far we have only the formula. When we ask for the diamond - I mean the tariff - they say, as Mr. Bonar Law, one of the cleverest of them, said in the hearing of many of us in the House of Commons the other day, \u2018Oh! wait till I am Chancellor of the Exchequer.\u2019 That is the way in which history repeats itself. But there is another formula, also invented in Birmingham - an older formula, offered, I think, in this very place where we are now, less than a year ago, by Mr. Balfour. (Some cheers.) I am quite prepared to join in that tribute, because I think what has happened in our time, even in Birmingham, has done the Liberal party quite as much good.Mr. Balfour\u2019s Formula Mr. Balfour has not wholly committed himself, apparently to the Protective side of Tariff Reform, but he has a formula of his own, a very simple one, today, a lot of small duties, but they are not to be put on raw material - not, for instance, upon hops - and they are not to increase the burden on the poor, or the cost of the necessaries of life. Gentlemen, this is the mildest, most diluted version of Tariff Reform - the authorised, orthodox version, which affects to regard it as merely an instrument for raising revenue. Is it an easier one to apply in practice than the other? I do not think it is. As a method of raising revenue it is open to a crowd of objections, of which I will mention two. First of all, experience shows, our own experience in this country especially, that a network of small duties is of all fiscal expedients the most costly, the most irritating, the most obstructive to trade, and the most unproductive in the end. That is what the fine phrase of \u2018broadening the basis of taxation\u2019 comes to when you translate it into actual practice. The next objection I make is this. The wit of man has not yet succeeded, and what is more never will succeed, in evolving a workable definition of raw material. For you can never escape from this plain and simple proposition, that which is the finished product of one industry is the raw material of the next.     What About Colonial Preference?Well, gentlemen, there are two questions which I should still like to put to Tariff Reformers who think for the twentieth time that they have captured Mr. Balfour, and are content for the moment to adopt his formula as a shibboleth. The first is: What about Colonial Preference? You are not going to tax raw material, and you are not going to tax food, at any rate in such a way as to increase the cost of the necessaries of living of the working classes in this country. Your Colonies export nothing but raw material, and how, under those governing conditions, are you going to give them a preference? Another question, and it is equally relevant, I ask these Tariff Reformers - Are they content with a tariff such as Mr. Balfour proposes, which is not framed, and avowedly not framed, to increase the employment of labour in this city? But Tariff Reformers are very angry now when you tell them that Tariff Reform is represented as a panacea for unemployment; yet it is not so very long since their vans, and posters, and daily organs in the Press bore that as a conspicuous motto, and I would venture to refer in this connection to Mr. Chamberlain\u2019s own declarations, written, I think, from Birmingham, in September 1905, when he said: \u2018All we want is fair play in foreign trade; to treat our friends and kinsmen across the seas better than the stranger outside the gates. Yes, and then there will be full employment for all, work for all, and with full employment will come a rise in wages and in the standard of living.\u2019 That is the sacred text - are we to understand that it no longer forms part of the economical scriptures?       \u2018Who Fares Better Than We? - Who Suffers Less?\u2019Gentlemen, I have one word more, and only one word more, to say upon this subject, but it is a subject which I entreat you to bear in mind and constantly to impress upon your fellow electors, and on those whom you come across in this country. Put to them this question - with whom would you like the people of England to change places fiscally? With which of the protectionist countries? With the United States of America, which is slowly recovering from a financial and commercial crisis that has inflicted untold loss both upon capital and upon labour? With Germany, which has suspended its sinking fund, which is borrowing enormous sums year after year to defray its annual and normal expenditure - Germany whose statesmen, in the full enjoyment be it remembered of a scientifically broadened basis of taxation, are at this moment at their wits\u2019 end to discover new sources of revenue? No, gentlemen, say to your fellow countrymen what is true, that when the world\u2019s trade is prosperous - ask them this - who fares better than we do? When the world\u2019s trade is slack and depressed, who suffers less? Tell them Free Trade is the open secret and the well-tried safeguard both of your financial and industrial stability.An Education SettlementI must pass from that; and while we ought not to forget - and I have endeavoured in what I have said to impress it upon you \u2011 while we ought not to forget the continued urgency of the call to maintain and defend Free Trade, our main energies are being given this year to pushing forward at Westminster three great measures of social reform. First of all, with regard to education, we have not abandoned, and we do not intend to abandon it. Our two great fundamental unchangeable principles - popular control where public money goes, and in the national system of education at no stage and upon no rung of the ladder - anything in the nature of a denominational test - they have got to be recognised, not in letter but in spirit. In any settlement that may be arrived at of this problem - and that I believe is becoming now a matter of common acknowledgment - subject to that overruling condition, but subject always to that, we can afford to be reasonable in matters of detail. For which of us is there, what man or woman of this great audience whom I am now addressing, which of us is there who does not feel that the time has come in this matter for men of all parties, and women too, to demand that the interest of the children shall dominate, and shall drown the clamour of the section?The Licensing BillLet me say a word now with regard to the Licensing Bill. That certainly is a Bill for which I myself am primarily responsible;  I staked my own political fortunes, and so far as I could I staked the fortunes of the Government and the party upon it. We were told it was a very foolhardy thing to do. We shall see. For my part I believe we never did a wiser thing. Of the Bill I will venture to say two things tonight. In the first place, on the one side it represents the latest phase of the perpetual conflict which, generation after generation, the Liberal party has been waging to assert the paramount supremacy of public over private and of general over particular interests. The second thing which I venture to say to you is this - that upon the other side it is the boldest and the most thorough-going attempt that has yet been made to attack at its very source the most potent of all the causes of poverty and of crime. I do not pretend to forecast either its Parliamentary or its electoral fortune; but whatever course they may take, we shall persevere with it.Old Age PensionsThe last of the three measures to which I am going to refer is that which is at present under discussion in the House of Commons - the Bill for the establishment of a system of old age pensions. Let me, if you will bear with me for two or three minutes, discuss very briefly one or two arguments that are used, not, indeed, in opposition, for there are very few people who have ventured to oppose it, but in criticism and disparagement of our Bill. It is said that such a system of old age pensions as I proposed in my Budget speech will in the long run, if it is not fatal to it, at any rate will discourage the practice of thrift among the working classes of this country. I wish people who use arguments like this would descend from their studies and their lecture-rooms into the  streets and lanes. What do they find? They would find a man - this is a typical and normal case, as I am sure almost every man here would admit - they would find over and over again a man who is receiving a weekly wage in precarious and not settled employment. He has first of all to maintain a home for himself and for his children. Very often he has also to support his parents, who have passed the years of work, or at least to contribute to their support. He has further, if he is a prudent man, to make provision against sickness and against unemployment. And upon the top of that to say that unless thrift is to be discouraged he has further to make provision for old age, and that this comparatively paltry sum of five shillings per week given to people over seventy years of age, will sap at the very sources of prudence, self-reliance, and independence. The argument needs only to be stated in order to refute itself.The Objections to a Contributory SchemeThere is another criticism which you see very much used, and which passed muster, I think, lately, if not entirely, in the same quarter - the criticism that we have adopted what is called the non-contributory plan. What are the objections that to my mind will be absolutely fatal to what is called a contributory scheme of provision for old age? In the first place, it involves delay. It will put outside the beneficent operations of the scheme practically all old people now living in this country. In the second place, if carried out fairly, it requires compulsion, and that the British working man, if I know him, is not prepared to stand. In the next place it would imply uneven discrimination as between different forms of thrift. Are you to give a preference to the man who pays contributions into a friendly society or trade union, over one who bought a house for himself, or helps to build a house for himself, or indulges in any form of investment which thrift can procure? And, last, what condemns it entirely to my mind, and makes it wholly irrelevant, makes it out of place, the need is greatest when opportunity and means of contribution do not exist at all.Essentially a Provisional SchemeI have said, and my colleagues have said, and it cannot be too fully realised by all friends and supporters in the country, that the scheme which we have put forward is in all its aspects in the nature of a provisional scheme. You can get a thousand cases of hardship out of it, I agree. There is the limit of age. It is hard that the man of sixty-nine cannot have a pension. There is the limit of income. It is hard that a man with 1ls. should not get a pension where the man with 10s. a week should. There is the question of the exclusion of paupers. It is very hard that the poor old man of seventy years of age, who has been receiving 2s. or 3s. a week in the shape of out-relief during the last twelve months, should for the moment be shut out from the benefit scheme. They are all cases of hardship. I could multiply them indefinitely, and no one knows better than I do and my colleagues how many, and how severe, they are. But you have to put this thing upon its legs. You must make a beginning. If you wait to evolve a perfect scheme which shall be no hardship to any one, you will have to wait till the day of judgment, if not later, and the net result of this scheme - provisional as I admit it to be, full of neces­sary anomalies as I admit it to be - the net result of the scheme, do not forget that, is that next year there will be over half-a-­million of these old people in receipt of pensions, who will be receiving the provision for old age which the law has never before made for them.The Children and Housing BillsThese three great measures do not stand alone. They are part of a large social programme, with at least two further instalments of which we hope to make progress this Session, though others must be left over to the next and the following years. I refer to the Children Bill, now nearly emerging from the Grand Committee, and the Housing Bill of that wise and strenuous democratic statesman, my friend and colleague John Burns. The object of that measure, as you know, is to secure for our people, both in town and country, decent, healthy, habitable homes, a reform both urgent and beneficent, though I certainly agree with those who think its necessary complement is a reconstruction, a complete reconstruction, of our valua­tion and rating system.The Governing Object of the Government ProgrammeThere is one final question I should like to put to you and to my fellow Liberals everywhere. What is the governing object, what is the ultimate purpose, of this social programme in all its various ramifications and development - improved housing, rating of site values, increased facilities for the acquisition of land both in agricultural and public purposes, the systematised protection, in all its stages, of child life, a genuine national system of education, a more stringent control of the liquor traffic, and a certain and sure pro­vision for old age? Cynics will tell you that this is a mere assort­ment of baits of varying colour and attractiveness with which to carry on the ignoble sport of angling for votes. You know better. The object which runs through them all is this, to diffuse and, so far as may be, to equalise the burdens, to make life brighter, easier, richer, more fruitful for the bulk of our fellow countrymen, to break through and break down the present environment of squalor and temptation, and to banish, if we can, and in so far as we can, the shadow of anxiety for the future which, to so many of them, darkens every stage of the journey from youth to old age. That, as we believe, as we Liberals believe, is the way, and the only way in which to make the best of each in the interests of all - to create and sustain, in the only worthy sense of the word, a community of free men in a free state.

aVI thank you with all my heart for the kindness of your greeting. It is, I think, now something like five years since I last had the opportunity of addressing an audience in Southport. We were then on the eve of what proved to be a momentous and decisive election, and it was a great satisfaction to be able to come here and say a few words in support of the claims upon the confidence of the electors of Southport of my friend Mr. Astbury. No Liberal member returned at that election has more faithfully redeemed his pledges, or better deserved the confidence of his constituents; and it is to us, his friends and colleagues in the House of Commons, as I am sure it must be to you, the electors of Southport, a matter of infinite regret that considerations of health, and of health alone, require him to retire for a time, and we hope only for a time, from the active discharge of the duties of public life. I am glad to recog­nise that I am confronted tonight by an audience which is not drawn only from Southport, but from all parts of the United Kingdom. There can be no greater pleasure for those of us whose working days and nights are spent at Westminster than from time to time to meet the men and women who in the different constituencies of the country are doing the hard everyday work of Liberalism - if I may venture to adopt the current phraseology of the hour, those who are ripening undeveloped opinion, those who are winning un-gotten votes to add to, as we hope and believe, and to enlarge the patrimony of our party.The Assassination of Sir Curzon WyllieNow, before I get to controversial topics, I think I should only be doing justice to your feelings and my own if in a sentence I give expression to the horror felt everywhere in this country at a detestable crime which was yesterday committed in London. A distinguished officer of the State, a man of blameless character, after a long record of eminent service, was struck down by the hand of an assassin. We mourn his loss, and we give our sympathy, our heartfelt sympathy, to those whom he has left behind. And I will only add this, that you have here a startling and emphatic piece of evidence as to the character and the methods of the conspiracy, happily confined to a small number of people, but desperate and determined in its methods, which I felt it my duty a few days ago to describe in the House of Commons.South African UnionOn an occasion like this, when we have more or less to take stock at the end of twelve months of the political situation, we naturally and appropriately extend our vision in the first instance beyond the limits of our own purely domestic concerns. I am not going to say anything to you tonight about what are called foreign politics; but in such a survey there are, I think we shall agree, two outstanding points. In the first place - and the chair­man has already referred to it - there is the accomplishment of the Union of South Africa. The statesmen of the different communities who have become parties to the great and memorable compact are now on their way to this country with Lord Selborne as their pioneer - Lord Selborne, whose invaluable services at every stage of this momentous enterprise I highly appraise, and am glad to have the opportunity of warmly acknowledging. But what is the lesson which we, and we Liberals in particular, have to draw from this great event? What is it that has made union in South Africa possible? Why is it that that which a generation ago seemed to be a generous but impracticable aspiration, that which only five years ago seemed to have been indefinitely postponed, if not irretrievably lost - why is it that it has now passed not only into the domain of the possible but of the real? The answer is a very simple one; it is because we have applied in South Africa that which is the saving and sovereign principle of British rule - the union of freedom with responsibility. We had the same problem, in conditions which were almost equally arduous and difficult, in Canada as we are in the way of solving now in South Africa. That long racial conflict, with its chequered annals of ascendancy and humiliation, within recent days its memories of rival heroism on the stricken field - that controversy has been appeased and, as we hope and believe, put for ever to an end by applying there, as I trust and hope we shall apply everywhere where similar conditions and difficulties arise, the doctrine - it is more than a doctrine, it is a rule of action with us British Liberals - the doctrine that you trust the people to govern themselves according to their own ideas.Imperial DefenceAnother matter of a not purely domestic kind to which I should like to make one moment\u2019s allusion is the forthcoming Conference on Imperial Defence. I am told, gentlemen, that in your interest­ing, stimulating, and thoroughly harmonious proceedings in the course of the last two days you have had a speech from an hon. friend of mine which stirred your emotions, and, I think, appealed to the general assent in favour of disarmament. Yes, there is no body of men in this world who have more reason to desire disarma­ment - a cessation of this miserable, this heartbreaking, competition between the different so-called civilisations of the world - than those who are for the time responsible for the conduct of the Government. But in the meantime we here, whether we look at our extraneous or our domestic Imperial conditions, cannot afford to depart from the command of the sea. In these islands, as time goes on, our waste places have been more and more filled up by an industrial and enterprising population, transformed by a course of events from an almost purely agricultural to a mainly urban and manu­facturing community, dependent therefore every year more and more not only for its material prosperity but for its national life itself upon the free influx of food and of materials from across the seas. But simultaneously we have been extending our borders, building up an Empire which, unlike almost every other Empire recorded in the annals of history, is not confined within the boundaries of its territorial area but is scattered over the length and breadth of the globe. To secure a continuance of such a union naval strength and union is as the essence of life. That security is being exposed now, not necessarily from deliberate hostility, but from the natural development of other nations. This has been the more striking during the course of the last few months; and we have received manifestations from fellow subjects in almost every part of the globe that they are conscious of the common end, and are not only pre­pared but willing and eager to share its difficulties and its burdens. In these circumstances it appeared to his Majesty\u2019s Government that the time was ripe to bring all the great communities that con­stitute our self-governing Empire together to consider their relative responsibility. They have cordially responded to our invitation, and we look forward with hope and with confidence to the result of those common deliberations.The Old Age Pensions Act and the Licensing BillBut now I come a little nearer home and look at our domestic history during the same time. It seems to me again that there are two events which not only strike the imagination but which will be graven indelibly on the pages of history. The first is the passing into law of the Old Age Pensions Act - the most conspicuous land­mark, I do not hesitate to say, on the road of social progress since another Liberal Government forty years ago passed the Education Act of 1870; the second is the history, which has not such a happy termination, of the Licensing Bill. That was a Bill, as you know, which was debated for weeks and for months and passed through the House of Commons with sustained and unexampled majorities. When it reached \u2018another place,\u2019 what was its fate? It was re­jected without even any pretence of consideration of its details, it was rejected in pursuance of a pre-concerted party resolution, it was rejected with every circumstance of contumely and contempt. I will not pause to dwell upon, certainly not to praise, the provisions of the Licensing Bill, which, I may say, was to some extent my own handiwork. But in regard to its rejection I will say that it has made two things - that rejection and the circumstances preceding, following, and attending it have made two things - abundantly plain. The first is that it has ruined the prospects of any really effective temperance reform on anything like a large and comprehen­sive scale during the lifetime of the present Parliament. I will say next the circumstances of that rejection have brought into greater prominence than ever before the fact that our constitutional system is, or at least that it can be made to be, not the embodiment, but the caricature of a representative and responsible Government. And the question of the relations between the two Houses of Parliament must be, for us Liberals at any rate, as I described it at the time, the dominant issue in our programme.An Unusual BudgetBut for the moment our attention is concentrated, and naturally and necessarily concentrated, neither upon the past nor upon the future, but upon the great struggle which is being waged in regard to the Budget. Now I do not quarrel with those who say that this is a very unusual Budget - so unusual that it may possibly require a more than ordinary expenditure of time and consideration before it passes into law. Parenthetically I may say that, so far, it is re­ceiving, and receiving in full measure, very full tribute. The dis­cussion so far as the first clause was concerned in Committee occupied no less than five-and-a-half days before this tyrannical Government, the well-known enemy of free speech, ventured to apply the closure. A more ridiculous contention than that there has been anything like suppression or curtailment of debate with re­gard to the Budget has never been put forward by any sane poli­tician.New Fiscal GroundI said the Budget was unusual; and by that I mean it has two special and exceptional features. The first is in the amount for which it has to make provision, and which everybody agrees to be necessary and which has to be provided somewhere and somehow. Its second exceptional feature is in certain of the applications - I mean what are called the taxes on land, in regard to which I admit, and I not only admit, but I claim, it strikes new fiscal ground. It is not as if the principle upon which these taxes are based is in any sense a novel principle. On the contrary, it has been perfectly familiar to instructed politicians for many years past; it has been discussed and debated and approved by all the greatest economists during the last 50 or 100 years; it has been put, as you all know by this time, in one form or another, into practical operation, not only on the Continent of Europe but in several of our own Colonies. What is new is this - it is the applica­tion of a well-understood and thoroughly-sifted problem, as an instrument of Imperial taxation, to a land system and to economic conditions such as are to be found in this country.What the Land Values Taxes Really AreNow, as I observe that the attacks upon the Budget are mainly, if not exclusively, confined to these taxes, I think you will perhaps bear with me if for a few moments I seek to direct your attention and that of others to what they really mean. In the first place, let me repeat an observation which I made a week ago at the Holborn Restaurant - that these taxes, though popularly and con­veniently described as taxes upon land, are not in the strict sense of the term taxes upon land at all. What are they? A very dis­tinguished economist, a professor of political economy at Cambridge, writing in the Times today, says that the proper description of them would be taxes upon windfalls, and that is really what they are. That is to say, what the State is doing is not putting a tax upon land as such - nothing of the kind. What it is doing is this: it is saying to the landowner, the owners of certain classes or cate­gories of land, \u2018When your land acquires through causes for which you are not responsible, and to which you have not contributed, but which result from the growth of the community and the action of the community - when your land under these conditions, and these conditions only, acquires an increment of value either actually realised or conveniently realisable, the State will step in and exact a toll.\u2019Revenue Small, but ProgressiveThe next observation of a general kind which I should like to make on these taxes is that their primary object is to raise revenue, which ought, I think, to be the primary object of every tax that any Chancellor of the Exchequer proposes for the accept­ance of the House of Commons. From the very nature of the case - as any one will see who has even an elementary acquaintance with the facts - from the very nature of the case the revenue so raised from taxes of this description cannot be very large in the first year, or even in the first few years. Take the taxation upon increment and upon reversions. With those taxes the yield will only be realised when the increment comes to hand or the reversion falls in. But in either case the revenue will be but a small fraction of the fiscal system of the country. It will be progressive in its operations. It was precisely the same with the succession duties proposed by Mr. Gladstone in his great Budget of 1853 with a complexity of machinery and detail to which nothing in this Budget affords any parallel at all - those succession duties, which in course of time, amplified and developed as they were by Sir William Harcourt, now form, not only one of the most productive sources of our Imperial revenue, but, be it observed, an instrument for raising revenue which no Tory Chancellor of the Exchequer has for a moment ventured to tamper with.\u2018Where the Shoe Pinches\u2019 \u2013 ValuationMy third and my last general observation in regard to these taxes is this - that they are taxes none of which can be justly or even practically levied without some preliminary valuation. It is impossible - as my hon. friends will agree with me who sit in the House of Commons - it is impossible to have followed these debates without seeing that this is where the shoe pinches. There has been an astonishing indisposition on the part of many - I am glad to say not of all - of those who profess to speak in the name of the landed interest in this country to have the land valued by some indepen­dent and competent authority. All this random talk that you hear upon the platform or read in the newspapers about their being at the tender mercies of a despotic department - all this random talk betrays to my mind an uneasy consciousness and an uncomfortable apprehension: an uneasy consciousness that this class of land is at the present moment very much under-valued and an uncomfortable apprehension that if it ever comes to be valued for these taxes at its true market value that valuation may possibly be taken advantage of for some other purpose.The Increment TaxNow, I should like to deal a little more closely with these taxes in detail. It is a dull subject, but it is very important. I am sure you will bear with me if I have to descend or ascend to technicalities. I will take first of all the increment tax. As I said a few moments ago, this is a duty imposed not upon land, but upon the added value which accrues to land, not from the efforts of its owner or from those interested, but from social causes. Now, no one, so far as I know, out of a lunatic asylum has ever contended that land in this country steadily and normally increases in value. I have seen the statement attributed to myself. I need hardly say I never made it. What I have said, and what I believe to be perfectly true, though there is an exception here and there, is that there is such an increase in this class of land on which these particular taxes, this increment tax, will fall.Agricultural LandIt is not true, I quite agree, for instance, to make the thing clear, it is not true of agricultural land as a whole; but what do you mean by agricultural land? I mean by agricultural land not land which is locally situated in what is technically called a rural area, but I mean by agricultural land - land which is actually and at the same time properly and economically applied to agricultural purposes. Land of that kind may rise in value from a variety of causes - it may rise in value, for instance, from the enterprise and expenditure of landlord and tenant, either or both. It may rise in value from causes which are common to the agriculture of the country and to a large extent of the world. No rise of that kind falls or was intended to fall within the increment taxation.Land and PopulationLet me contrast the land which lies within the fringe of a growing and naturally created population - I do not care whether it is a rural or an urban area - take land of that kind which in virtue of that population, its expanse, and its growth, even in virtue of the expenditure made for communal purposes for that population, increases in value steadily, regularly, continuously, and acquires a special market price. That is the windfall of the Cambridge pro­fessor; and I ask this question, and I will ask it of any audience of my fellow countrymen, I do not care whether they are Liberals or Conservatives as long as they are fair-minded and just men and women - I ask, \u2018Is it unfair or impolitic that the State should have a share of the increase so produced?\u2019Increment on Other Kinds of PropertyAs I have said before, no answer has ever been given to the question. The only answer which has been made is one which the lawyers call the answer by way of confession and avoidance. It is this - it may be true, it may be right - but, they say, there are other forms of property in which you may discern the same increment due to the same or to similar causes, and you don\u2019t propose to tax them. I have never denied that there may be and there are occasional cases apart from land in which an added value is given to property by social causes, but they are very rare and exceptional, and I believe some of them are taxed already through the income tax or some other tax of our fiscal arrangement. This does not fall in the same category as land, for the reason that land is limited in quantity, and its use in the interests of the community is a matter of vital moment to every man, woman, and child in this country. How can you put into the same category as that the fact that a doctor\u2019s practice may have risen because a colliery village has suddenly grown up in what was previously a rural district, or the fact that a Holbein or Velasquez has risen in market value at Christie\u2019s in consequence of the scarcity of the supply and of the growth of taste? The doctor pays his income tax on the increased sum which he makes out of his new patients, and as to the Holbein and Velasquez we may leave them to themselves. It is a matter of very little moment after all; and anxious as I am myself, as all of us are, to retain them in this country, it is a matter of very little importance whether they belong to this man or that.The Case of Land Altogether ExceptionalBut when you come to land, land on the outskirts of a growing community, land the holding up of which may throttle and cripple the development of its industries, may destroy the health and even the long life of its population, it is mere trifling, unworthy even of an academic dialectician, to speak of land as though in these vital respects it stood upon the same footing as other forms of property; and let me add that it is no answer to say to a dweller on the out­skirts of London, for instance, there is plenty of land in the Hebrides. What London needs and every other community, every growing community, needs, is not to know that somewhere or other on the face of the globe or within the ambit of this United Kingdom there is land available. What they want is land in their own neighbourhood, land upon which they can ex­pand and extend themselves and carry on their industries and their local and their social life. Yes, and for the purpose of this tax, remember, it is the owner of the land, the man who finds himself happily circumstanced in the possession of land where it is wanted and not where it is not wanted, he is the person, we say, who in policy and justice ought to contribute to the State.What the Tax on Undeveloped Land MeansLet me pass now in a few words to the other tax, the tax on undeveloped land. There is much misapprehension on this subject, and as it is some time before we can possibly reach it in Committee upon the Bill, I do not think I shall be wasting a few moments of your time if I endeavour to state clearly and distinctly what this tax really means. This is a tax of a halfpenny in the pound on the capital value of undeveloped land. It applies only to unbuilt-on land which is not being bona fide used for any business, trade, or industry other than agriculture.Agricultural Land and Other ExemptionsLet us see how it affects agricultural land. All land the site value of which does not exceed £50 an acre is exempt, and that will exclude a great part of the agricultural land of this country. And with regard to land, and there is some purely agricultural land the site value of which exceeds £50 - even in regard to that the tax is only to be charged on the amount by which the building value exceeds the agricultural value. Let me further point out to you, because there are perpetual mistakes on these points, that there are exempted altogether from the operation of the tax lands owned by municipalities and other rating authorities; land occupied and used for public or charitable purposes, parks, gardens, or open spaces to which reasonable access is given to the public, when such access contributes, as it almost always does, to the amenity of the locality; land let under an agreement of not less than five years - we are obliged to put in some safeguard - for games or for recreation; private gardens up to an acre (private gardens between one and two acres being allowed one acre duty free); and, lastly, land held on agricultural leases of not more than twenty-one years entered into before the Budget statement. Well, of course, we are open to argument, but have we not there shown a disposition to exclude from the operation of this duty all land in which under present conditions of user it may be said the public has really an interest of its own? If any other such purposes can be suggested, if any reasonable extension of these exemptions consistent with the principle of the tax can be made good, I can assure you the Government and the majority in the House of Commons are perfectly prepared to entertain them. That is the scope of the tax and its general effect.Land that is Being Held UpLet me point out to you that, like the increment duty, with which I have already dealt, it is in its intention, and it will be in its effect, primarily a fiscal instrument - namely, a means of raising revenue for the Exchequer. It merely says - and here again I think we come down to an almost elementary principle of social justice - it merely says that those classes of land shall be taxed now on the basis of real as distinguished from a perfectly fictitious value. Such land is under-rented - that is to say, for a number of reasons, reasons which are satisfactory to the owner, it is bringing a lower yield than it would, if put into the market, bring in and ought to bring in. Take the case of land which can be sold for immediate development, but which is being held up, and legitimately held up, in the hope of getting a higher price in the future. Such land can command a definite economic rent, and is capable of producing an income. That land ought to form part of the taxable income of the country. The landowner does not take the rent, but chooses to forgo it, and the source of revenue is reduced pro tanto, and the national income reduced so much. He does this for his own purpose, and with the hope of future profit, and it is clearly fair and just that the State should apply to him rather than to other taxpayers to make up the deficiency.The Undeveloped Land Duty and the Sale of LandNow it is said that one of the effects of this undeveloped land duty will be to put pressure on landowners to sell their land. Perhaps it will. Is that a calamity to the community? Is that a contingency which we ought to regard with horror and aversion, and against which we ought to take all possible precautions and safeguards? Remember this - we hear a great deal about the with­drawal of capital from this country. It is quite true that capital can be withdrawn from one area to another, and sometimes that transference is beneficial to the other area; but land cannot be removed, and even if this terrible calamity should happen, and there should be a transference of ownership, the land is there, and the community will continue to enjoy it.The Duties Economically Sound and Socially JustThe truth is, and I may sum up what I have been saying as regards the increment tax, and the same thing is true of rever­sions, it only takes part of the windfall, as and when it falls. In regard to the tax on undeveloped land, it only taxes a man on an income which he might enjoy, but chooses for the time being, for purposes of his own, to forgo. I maintain that taxation which seeks these ends by these means is taxation which is not only sound in economic principle, but which conforms to the eternal and immutable principles of social justice. I am afraid I have dealt at great length with these technical matters, but I have tried to present clearly what is the scope and purpose of this new form of taxation.What is the Alternative?Now let me, before I come to a close, ask once more the question with which I mean to conclude every speech I make upon this sub­ject until I get a satisfactory answer to it. The question is: You have got to provide this money; the purposes for which it is to be provided are purposes of importance and urgency, and the necessity of which no party in the State disputes - how otherwise are you going to provide it? I put that question a week ago in the Holborn Restaurant, after a very menacing demonstration on the previous day, when the bankers of the City of London met; I put that ques­tion to the Free Traders among the protesters, and particularly Lord Avebury, an eminent man, who has rendered great service to the cause of Free Trade.Lord Avebury\u2019s Alternative BudgetWhat is Lord Avebury\u2019s reply? He has produced, perhaps, the most marvellous exercise in fiscal arithmetic which has yet entered into the mind or wit of man, either to talk about, or to put upon paper. He squared Mr. Lloyd George\u2019s Budget for him, leaving out the land taxes and other objectionable schemes - what he con­sidered to be Socialism - by a simple process of attributing to this year\u2019s income the yield from the income tax and indirect taxes which cannot possibly be received until the year after. Thus, when the matter comes to be examined you will find there is no escape from the conclusion that under Lord Avebury\u2019s Free Trade alternative Budget we should be landed on March 31st next year with a deficit of no less than three million sterling. That is not a very hopeful alternative.Lord Cromer\u2019s Alternative BudgetThen there is Lord Cromer, another very eminent man and also a strong Free Trader whose service to that cause is well known. What has Lord Cromer to say? Lord Cromer says he would get out of the difficulty first of all by re-imposing what I believe to be the most objectionable tax we have had in this country for many years - the sugar duty, which I reduced last year because it presses so heavily, not only upon the food of the people, but upon the raw material of some of our industries. He would re-impose that most objectionable tax, and the balance for naval expenditure he would meet by a most improvident addition to the National Debt. I am afraid that we must admit that our Free Trade friends have broken down in their attempts to provide an alternative Budget.What Has Become of Tariff Reform?And what of the other? What has become of Tariff Reform? I scarcely ever hear it mentioned. Only a few months ago those gentlemen were so vocal upon all the platforms of the country, but now their tongues are tied in what looks like a concerted unanimity of silence. The truth is they don\u2019t wish, at this moment it would not be convenient, that the country should realise what is the choice that actually lies before it.The Choice a Very Simple OneThe choice is a very simple one - here you have, in addition to taxes to which I have referred to, the indirect taxation of spirits and tobacco, the income taxes, the death duties, and the tax for the first time imposed upon that great monopoly, the tax on liquor licences. You have, in addition to those, the additional tax on land, the equity, fairness, and justice of which I have, I hope, demonstrated tonight. We know we are directly within the limits of Free Trade, we are imposing no additional burdens on the neces­saries of life. What is the choice the other way? They are very quiet about it, but we know what it is. It means the introduction under the guise of Colonial preference of a tariff upon foreign goods. It means the introduction of taxes upon the simplest necessaries of life, upon your bread and your butter and your cheese, and the ordinary commodities which enter into the everyday consumption of the working classes of this country, and thus an enhancement of price to be cast upon the shoulders of those who are least able to bear the burden. That is the alternative which really lies before the electors of the country.Why the Budget should be SupportedAnd I ask you and my fellow countrymen who are Liberals to support this Budget both for what it does and what it does not do, both for the taxes which it imposes and for the tariff which it avoids. I say to them, support it because for the first time it is making some of the richest monopolists in this country contribute their fair share to the common weal; support it because it calls upon all classes, rich and poor alike, to join in making provision for our national necessities; I say support it, last and most of all, because it opens the gate and paves the road to social reform.

aVLadies and Gentlemen, - It is a great pleasure and privilege to me to find myself at such a moment face to face with so large and representative a gathering not only of the Liberals of Hull and the East Riding, but of the delegates from the National Liberal Federation who throughout the length and breadth of England and Wales are the staff officers of the Liberal army. For some months you have been condemned, for what I believe to be good reasons, to enforced inaction, but the time for truce and parleying is over. Within three days Parliament will be dissolved, and by the end of next week you will find yourselves in one of the most momentous political struggles in the annals of British history. I rejoice to know from the reports that reach me from all quarters that whatever may be the case elsewhere, our party is in good heart. There is no division of aim, there is no competition between sections, there is no rivalry of persons. There is everywhere unity, discipline, loyalty, and faith.A Tory FictionWe are told that this Dissolution is the wanton and unscrupulous manoeuvre of a desperate and discredited Government, that we are springing it upon the country in order that we may extort, without adequate discussion, from a dazed and bewildered electorate a pre­cipitate assent to a revolutionary scheme for setting up Single-Chamber government. That is a fiction which is widely current and seems to have played a conspicuous part in the recent debate in the House of Lords. Let us just for a moment or two see how the matter really stands, and how far we can be justly charged with rushing a Dissolution upon an unprepared and uninformed nation.The Issue at last General ElectionIt is barely a year ago since the last Parliament was dissolved. What was the cause of the Dissolution? The rejection, for the first time in our history, of the Budget by the House of Lords, and I speak within the recollection of all of you when I say that, not indeed the sole issue, but the main and dominating issue at that election was upon these two points - first, Shall the veto of the Lords in regard to finance be altogether put an end to; and, next, Shall the veto of the Lords in regard to our legislation be limited and cut down? That was the issue which was debated upon a thousand platforms throughout the length and breadth or the United Kingdom for more than six weeks.The Result of last General ElectionWhat was the result? You had a House of Commons returned to Westminster in which there was a majority against the continuance of the Veto of the Lords of something like 120. And if you look to Great Britain alone a majority against the continuance of the Veto of over 60. We are told that we are trying, by means of Irish votes, to thrust our policy down the reluctant throats of the British electorate, and I see the Tories have now got a new motto or war-cry from Mr. Balfour, \u2018Great Britain shall manage the affairs of Great Britain.\u2019 I have always thought, being a better Unionist than many who call themselves by that title, that the Budget was not an affair that concerned Great Britain alone. I have always thought that the Constitution was not an affair that concerned Great Britain alone, and that we are living now in a United Kingdom. But if we are to look to Great Britain alone, the result of the last election was that by an emphatic and decisive majority of over 60 the electorate of Great Britain declared itself in favour of the Budget and against the Veto of the House of Lords.Why the Tories had no Alternative PolicyBut we are told there was then no alternative policy before the country. Whose fault was that? It was hardly our business to produce an alternative policy, and the reason why there was no alternative policy was this, that at the time the discovery had not been made by our Tory friends that the House of Lords, as it exists, is a decayed and crumbling structure which has got to be rebuilt from its very basement to its roof. No, that was the heyday of those peers, who went by the name - poor innocent men - of the Backwoodsmen, who must now in their remote retreats be rubbing incredulous eyes when they read every morning of what is going on at Westminster. I must not be tempted into unbecoming flippancy. I have been rebuked, urbi et orbi, by no less a personage than the Archbishop of Canterbury, because I ventured, by the citation of an almost classical passage from one of the most classical of English works, Boswell\u2019s Life of Johnson, to import levity into the discussion of so sacred a theme as the House of Lords. Indeed my case is even worse. I have got into trouble with both the Archbishops. The one complains of my pleasantries and the other of my metaphors, so I am going to be careful and try to mend my ways, but at the same time, respectfully observing that it is not I and my friends, but Lord Rosebery and his associates, who, within the last fortnight, have pronounced sentence of death upon the House of Lords, and are now casting about to see if they can find somebody who can take up the succession. But a year ago, ignorant of what was in store for them, the rank and file of the House of Lords, who, after all, constitute a very large numerical majority in the body, were, with the benediction of their leaders, going about from platform to platform trumpeting its virtues and relying, above all, upon its last and supreme achievement - the salvation of the country from the iniquities of a Socialistic Budget.Misrepresentation of the Government\u2019s PolicyThere was no alternative policy then. But let me follow the matter out through its later stages. The new House of Commons met, and there has been so much misunderstanding and so much misrepresenta­tion of the declared policy of the Government that I will venture to read to you what I said within a week or ten days after the meeting of the House of Commons on February 28 last. This is what I then said. I said on behalf of the Government in the new Parliament: \u2018If the House should assent to our Veto proposals, a Bill to give effect to them will, without delay, be introduced. The Bill will give effect to the operative part of the Resolutions, but\u2019 - and observe these words - \u2018but without waiting for the Bill to pass through all its stages in this House we have come to the conclusion that, in order to avoid waste of time and labour and to bring the main issue to trial and con­clusion at the earliest possible moment, the resolutions so assented to by this House shall be submitted to the House of Lords.\u2019 We refused, we deliberately refused, and I think we rightly refused, to go on with an operation which used to be known by the name of ploughing the sands to pass a Bill through all its stages in the House of Commons - First Reading, Second Reading, Committee Stage, and Third Reading - involving an infinite waste of time and labour when, during the whole process, perfectly aware that at the moment it reached another place it would be ignominiously repelled and rejected.The Conference and AfterThose resolutions received the assent of the House of Commons after an exhaustive discussion on April 14 last, and in due course of time and but for unforeseen events they would, with as little delay as possible, have been submitted to the House of Lords. There intervened that most lamentable event, the death of our beloved Monarch. It was followed, as was natural, by something in the nature of a political truce and by an experiment which was new in our political history but which, I think, though it has for the moment failed, was well worth trying. We sought to discover by Conference between representative leaders of both great parties in the State if it were possible to find some common basis of agreement for settlement by consent. Those efforts having failed, I would like to know who would suggest that we might have done or ought to have done other than that we are doing. Ought we to have prorogued Parliament? Ought we to have reintroduced in another Session our Resolutions and our Bill? Ought we to have wasted another twelve months of the time of the country over a futile and impossible enterprise? Why, we should have lost, and deservedly lost, the confidence of our friends and the respect of the country.\u2018Dissolution was necessary\u2019Dissolution was necessary, and I cite and commend to the attention of the Tory platform orators, the Tory writers in the Press - I commend words their own leader used in the House of Commons in the hearing of many of us only a week ago when he said in reply to me - I quote his exact words - \u2018I agree it is almost certain that a General Election could not be deferred for more than a relatively small number of weeks or months. That I grant.\u2019 Well, if Mr. Balfour thinks so, if he agrees with us that a situation had been arrived at from which the only outlet was to be found in an immediate, or at any rate a near, General Election, what becomes of all this hollow cry against the Government for having rushed upon the country wantonly and unscrupulously an election which it did not require?Another Tory FictionThen there comes the other fiction - namely, that we are rushing a Dissolution in order that the Lords might have no opportunity of pre­senting their case and that, at the same time, we might avoid submitting our Budget to the House of Commons. And this nefarious stratagem is supposed to have been defeated by Lord Lansdowne\u2019s masterly and patriotic counter-stroke of asking that the Parliament Bill should be introduced into the House of Lords. There is no word of truth in the story. The Government never had any such intention. They had made up their minds before Parliament reassembled that they would present their Budget in all its essential features for the assent of the House of Commons and that the House of Lords should have any opportunity they desired, either of criticising our Veto proposals or of putting forward proposals of their own. That intention never varied for a moment, and it was literally carried into effect. I do not think anybody will dispute that the case for the House of Lords, such as it is, has been presented in the course of the last ten days with adequate fullness of exposition and argument to the country.\u2018Afraid of the People\u2019 Yet DissolvingThey are always telling us we are afraid of the people. The motive of our scheme is supposed to be to enable the House of Commons to steal a march on its constituents and to carry out revolutionary measures in the teeth of those who elected them. Well, it is curious if that is so we should be dissolving now. We have got an ample majority in the present House of Commons for all the ordinary purposes of government and legislation, and yet we, who were supposed to be so afraid of the people, supposed to cling to office by any desperate device that imagination can conceive, I say, we who were supposed to be so afraid of the people, are dissolving - and why? Because we are pledged to get this question out of the way before we proceed with Liberal legislation, which, under existing conditions, is a perfectly hopeless task. The only and, at the same time, the effectual method of getting it out of the way is to ask and to obtain the judgment of the country.The Question for the ElectorsSo much for that; but what is the question which the electors have to put to themselves and to answer in the course of the next fortnight or three weeks? They have to determine whether we are to continue to carry on the King\u2019s Government, or to hand over the duty to our opponents. It is hardly necessary to say that the electors, at any rate, are free agents; they are not under the domination of Mr. John Redmond. They are not compelled to toe any particular line. There is another thing to be observed about the electors - they know precisely what the consequences of giving us a majority will be. There is our plan in black and white, and everyone can understand it. The question for them simply is, Do they, or do they not, authorise us to carry it into law? I believe they will.If the Tories WonBut, as it is above all things desirable that they should come to their decision, whatever it is, with their eyes open, let me try for a few moments, if you will bear with me, to trace the consequences of a vote adverse to the present Government and putting the Tory Party into power. In imagination, at any rate, we can try and trace it out. I say nothing tonight, or nothing in detail, though I shall in course of the election, of the effect of such a change on the general policy of the country, on its administration, on its finance. I say nothing, or I only mention it in passing, of the certainty that such a change would bring sooner or later in its train under the guise of Tariff Reform a return to that system of Protection which less than a year ago was emphatically and decisively repudiated by all our great industrial districts. But the sole point to which I want to direct your attention is the effect that such a change would have on the settlement of the Constitutional question; and this brings me to examine - it is time that it should be done - examine at rather close quarters what we now know to be the alternative policy. It is well worthy of examination.What about the Backwoodsmen?Let me first point out without any imputation upon anybody\u2019s good faith that it is at least doubtful how much of the crude and complex scheme - for it is both crude and complex - which has been so pre­cipitately put together during the last week will ever travel even within measurable distance towards the Statute Book. The House of Lords, I know, has carried all these proposals without a division in hot haste, and on the eve of a Dissolution, but if and when it should come to real business, I am not sure that those backwoodsmen, of whom I spoke a moment ago and who, I have said, are a majority of the House of Lords, will be found to be such a negligible and moribund factor as they have been made to appear during all the discussions of the last week.     The Country would be Worse Off under the Lords\u2019 SchemeNor is it easy to believe that a House of Commons with a real Tory majority, if you can conceive such a thing, would let this scheme through without large and even vital modifications. Indeed, Lord Rosebery has already, I see, last night put in a caveat that they must only be taken to have associated themselves with the general spirit and trend of the vote. There is much virtue in the word \u2018trend,\u2019 but let us take the scheme as now presented to the country as illustrative of their policy and assume that it is going to be carried into law. The proposition which I lay before you and which I lay tonight before my fellow countrymen is this - that the country would be no better off, that in some respects it would be materially worse off, than under the existing system, which every one now admits to be utterly intolerable. The New Second Chamber   What is this plan or scheme which is now presented to the country as the solution of the Constitutional problem? In the first place, what is the new Second Chamber which is to be substituted for our ancient, venerable, and historic House of Lords? In the Second Chamber of the future there are to be three classes of peers, hereditary peers, official or qualified peers, and peers who are chosen - nobody knows by whom, nobody knows from whom, but peers who are chosen. What is to be the size? What is to be the proportion between these different elements, or factors, which make it up? How and by whom and by what process are the chosen ones to be admitted? All these so-called details are left open for future manipulation. But I think we can easily foresee the general result if the process of adjustment is to be in the hands - as, upon the assumption I am now making, it would be - of a Tory House of Commons, with the supervising counsel and judgment of a Tory House of Lords. In the present House of Lords the proportion of Tory to Liberal is something like twelve to one. For effective voting purposes it is about five or six to one. The party predominance in the new Second Chamber may be less odiously and offensively marked, but with such an absurdly wide margin of superiority you can afford to be generous and to give away a good deal - but does any rational man doubt that, on the basis of this scheme of Lord Rosebery\u2019s, according to the views of a Tory House of Commons and House of Lords, you will have a Second Chamber which will be overwhelmingly and permanently Conservative? And, in the meantime - for this is the very essence of the scheme - you will have sacrificed the Royal prerogative of the creation of peers. In a word, you will be confronted once more with the old problem, the problem of chronic or recurring deadlocks between the two Chambers, the one Chamber responsible to the people and the other Chamber composed of - Heaven knows what elements - and the knowledge that a possible outlet for such deadlocks will be permanently blocked.The Proposed Joint SessionLet us come to another point. Let us examine this alternative proposal in all its aspects. These deadlocks, we are told, between the reconstituted House of Lords and the representative House of Commons, are to be solved by a Joint Session. Speaking for myself, I have always thought, and have more than once said, that, given a Second Chamber moderate in size and constituted on popular lines - that is a very important qualification - I would not exclude, certainly would not brush aside, procedure by conference and Joint Session as a possible and even hopeful expedient for the avoidance of deadlocks. But the crucial question here is left entirely and purposely untouched in Lord Lansdowne\u2019s proposals. Under what conditions is this Joint Session going to take place? In what relative proportions are the two Houses going to sit in it? - and remember the whole thing only comes into operation when you have a Liberal majority in the House of Commons. When a Tory majority is there the whole machinery falls into abeyance. The question is this, it goes to the very root foundation of the whole scheme - the question I ask is, What kind and what size of Liberal majority in your scheme is to have an effective voice in legislation? Is it to be 50? or must it be 100? or must it be so? Until this is settled the proposal for a Joint Session from our point of view is wholly meaningless and nugatory. It is, in effect, nothing more than an invitation to substitute one set of shackles for another, when the nation has deliberately decided at the polls to entrust its fortunes and the shaping of its legislation to the party of progress.What are Measures of \u2018Great Gravity\u2019?But one step forward still. There comes in here a doubt - it is more than a doubt - what is meant by the exception from the operation of Joint Sessions of questions of \u2018great gravity\u2019? They are not to be decided by a Joint Session, but they are to be submitted by Referen­dum to the people. What are questions of great gravity? Who is going to decide? Obviously neither one House nor the other. What may seem to be grave to the House of Commons may seem to be trivial to the House of Lords, and vice versa. Are you going to call in a judicial tribunal? Are you going to bring in the Courts of Law? I earnestly trust no one will suggest that. And, if not, you must condescend to particulars and you must tell us what is the criterion and what are the categories of questions of great gravity. I presume Home Rule is a question of great gravity. Is Disestablishment? Well, I do not know - I mean in the opinion of Lord Lansdowne and his friends. Is the abolition of plural voting? Above all and most important of all is the question of a Tariff?The Tories and the ReferendumWhat are the subjects - surely we are entitled to ask - in regard to which Parliament is to be deprived of its omnipotence and compelled to resort to a plebiscite? Since when and why have the Tories become converts to the principle of a Referendum? It is one of the most remarkable and one of the most rapid instances of conversion in the whole of political history. I have never denied that there were rare but quite conceivable cases in which some such proceeding must be resorted to. Here we have the Conservative, the Unionist, the Constitutional Party advocating that a device that has been adopted with disappointing results in some of the modern States of the world shall become an integral part of the British Constitution.The Referendum and DissolutionAs such I protest against it, and I hope you will resist it, and I will tell you briefly the grounds. There are three on which I base my protest. In the first place, in effect it would, as regards all important legislation - these questions of \u2018great gravity\u2019 - by statute give to the House of Lords the power, which it already claims, and which we strenuously deny to it, to compel, when it differs from the popular House, what would be to all intents and purposes a Dissolution and a General Election. Of course, on trivial matters, if you had a Referen­dum, as has been found in America, in Canada, and in Australia, people would not take the trouble to vote, and the result of such an appeal would be no index to the true state of popular opinion. If you come to really great questions, questions like Home Rule or the Tariff, does anyone suppose that such an appeal would not be attended by all the tumult of a General Election? The Parliamentary machine would be set at work, members and intending candidates would come down to their constituencies to address meetings, canvassing, placarding, the circulation of literature, all the operations of an electoral campaign such as we are contemplating, some of us with mixed feelings, would be in full swing, and the country would be to all intents and purposes involved in all the expense and turmoil of a General Election. And then suppose on a vital question like that the decision went against the Government of the day. Could the Government continue in office? Clearly not. They must either resign or dissolve. If they resigned and their opponents came into power they would have to dissolve, and you would have two Dissolutions, two General Elections, two appeals to the electorate in regard to every vital question of national policy and legislation.The Referendum and Parliamentary ResponsibilityBut I have an even stronger objection to the use of the Referendum as a part of the Constitution - that it would impair, if it would not entirely destroy, the sense of Parliamentary responsibility. You send your Members to the House of Commons to give there the best of their judgment and the best of their ability to the transaction of the affairs of the nation on the lines and within the limits of the princi­ples and pledges which they have professed to you, and on which they sought your confidence. You do not want a Member of Parlia­ment to go there an irresponsible item, to say, \u2018I will vote against this or for that, because my vote does not matter, because the thing has got to go back to the electorate, and I am here as an irresponsible delegate and not here to represent, to the best what I believe to be, the con­sidered judgment of the nation.\u2019 You are sterilising the sense of responsibility, which is the very soul of Parliamentary Government.The Referendum and Representative GovernmentAt the same time - and this is the third point - you are really destroying the principle of government by representation, which is the great invention of the modern world. Democracy without represen­tation very soon degenerates into anarchy or Caesarism - one or the other. The only machinery which the genius of man has yet discovered which will enable democratic government to be made into a working concern is the adoption, the amplification, the development of that principle of representation. I speak not as a party man for a moment, but as a convinced democrat and one who wishes to see democratic government made increasingly efficient and capable. When the Tory Party are tumbling over one another helter-skelter, pell-mell, in their zeal and affection for this new-fangled discovery of the Referendum, I ask my fellow countrymen, in the interests not of one party or another, but in the interests of those larger and more permanent concerns which are the common property of us all, to hesitate before, in order to find a plausible way to escape from difficulties which can be otherwise solved, they strike a deadly blow at the very foundation of representative government in this country.The Two Alternative PoliciesI am sorry to have kept you so long with these, though they are not minor points, but I want at the outset of the coming struggle the country to realise clearly what are the two alternative policies placed before them. I can sum them up in a couple of sentences. How shall we stand if this alternative policy now put forward by the House of Lords is approved by the country and its legislative definition and embodiment entrusted to the Tory majority in the new House of Commons? In the first place, you will have a Second Chamber which, from its composition and character, gives us at any rate no greater security against a deadlock than we already possess. In the second place, when deadlocks occur, you will have no greater security than now that the will of the popular Chamber will be predominant, or that its will may not be over and over again, frustrated and delayed by the Second and nominally subordinate Chamber, compelling the country to pronounce a second verdict in addition to the first. That is all they have to offer on the other side, and I venture to say our plan holds the field. Ours is not a plan for Single-Chamber Government. It is not put forward, as is sometimes represented, as though verbally inspired. It is not presented - as I said myself in the House of Commons in moving the Veto Resolutions - as a final solution of all our Constitutional problems. But it is submitted to the country as what is necessary, as the least that is necessary here and now, if we are to make real progress with any of the great enterprises, whether of social or political change, to which the Liberal Party stands committed.\u2018American Dollars\u2019 and Home RuleIn a speech I made at the Albert Hall nearly a year ago I dwelt on some of the causes that we believe are in our keeping. I adhere to everything which I said then. I spoke of Welsh disestablishment, the abolition of plural voting, of a better licensing system, of a truly national education. I spoke, and - in view of the shameful things which are being said, I feel bound to emphasise that point - I spoke of our views of the proper solution of the problem of Irish self-government. What I then said I repeat; to it I adhere, and I believe the Liberal Party adheres. I do not in the least grudge the Tory Party any electioneering capital that they can extract from Mr. Redmond\u2019s American dollars. The American dollars would seem to be, in a substantial pro­portion at any rate, contributed by our Canadian fellow subjects. But whether they are subscribed by that great Imperial statesman, Sir Wilfrid Laurier, or by the poorest Irish exile in Chicago or Milwaukee, I see no cause for shame either in those who give or those who take. There is, indeed, a great deal of significance in it. In our efforts to secure self-government for Ireland in the future - efforts which I hope will be followed by further efforts to set free the Imperial Parliament from much of the local work which congests its machinery and which of necessity it does so ill - we shall have with us I believe the sympathy of the overwhelming majority of the great Dominions overseas, who have learned how easy it is to combine local autonomy with Imperial loyalty. But for the moment, and this shall be the last thing I say to you, let us concentrate on the first and the greatest task, the task that lies right to our hands, the task that we are pledged to perform, the task of winning fair play for Liberal legislation and of securing for our people through their own chosen representatives the power of making and of moulding the laws under which they live.

aVBefore I enter, as I shall in a moment, the controversial arena of domestic politics, I think it right to say a word in regard to the international situation. It is a fortnight since, at the Guildhall, I endeavoured to define in clear and precise terms the attitude of this country and, as I then believed and still believe, that of the other Great Powers, in face of the war which is unhappily still raging in Eastern Europe. That attitude has not, so far as I know, been in any way changed or modified. We are all anxious to stop the further effusion of blood between the actual combatants. We are even more anxious to limit and circumscribe the field of possible conflict. The Powers are working together to that end, and I repeat today, and I am glad to be able to do so, that while we and others retain with unabated constancy our friendships and understandings, we are satisfied that there is no division of wish or purpose in the co-operative policy of all; and that it is in the best interests of peace and of ultimate stability that special and particular questions should, as far as possible, be reserved to be dealt with when the time comes, as part of the general and definitive settlement.Tory Attitude Towards Past and Present Liberal LeadersIt is twenty-five years exactly since, as one of the rank and file of the Liberal party, I addressed a meeting of the National Liberal Federation here in Nottingham. Mr. Gladstone, our then illustrious leader, was present, and we were in the first stage of the campaign which we are today bringing to a close. I feel that I do not deserve many of the kind things that you were good enough to say of me, but they are a welcome change from much of the language which I am accustomed both to hear and to read. So long as I possess the confidence of my friends, I am indifferent to what is said on the other side. I am constantly told - indeed, it is one of the platitudes of Tory invective - that I am a past master in the art of political chicanery. I remember well that, at the time to which I have just referred, exactly the same thing used to be said, from exactly the same quarters, of Mr. Gladstone. Now, in these days, if Mr. Gladstone is not actually canonised in the Tory calendar, his name is rarely invoked except to contrast his patriotism and straight­forwardness with the partisanship and the obliquities of his decadent and degenerate successors. I do not presume, and never shall, to measure myself with that great man, but I am not without hope that, when the time comes for me to seek and to obtain repose, and to hand over the leadership of the Liberal party to still darker and more dangerous spirits, as the years roll by, and the past recedes, and the mists accumulate, I may soften into a gracious legendary figure, and some Tory orator of the future, some yet unborn Carson, will be found laying a belated wreath of rhetorical immortelles upon my humble tomb.The Presence of Mr. RedmondI am quite sure of this, that if the cup of my offences was not already full to overflowing, the last necessary drop will be supplied by the presence tonight on this platform of Mr. John Redmond. Whether our appearance here tonight is to be represented as an act of subservience on my part or an act of subservience on Mr. Redmond\u2019s part depends entirely on whether the picture is intended to be exhibited in Great Britain or in Ireland. We Liberals - and I am sure I am speaking in your name - are heartily glad to see him here, and we perceive nothing unnatural, nothing derogatory to the best traditions of our political life, in the fact that there should be co-operation on the platform as well as in the House of Commons between those who are carrying on in concert, and without the sacrifice of conviction or principle, either on the one side or on the other, a common campaign for a great and a worthy cause.The Finance of the Home Rule BillIf you ask me how that cause is faring at Westminster, my answer is, \u2018Very well.\u2019 We are now in the midst of what is in some ways the most intricate and difficult part of the Home Rule Bill, the financial clauses, the active supervision of which I have largely delegated to the most capable hands of the Chancellor of the Exchequer and Mr. Herbert Samuel, with the ever ready help of our two brilliant Law Officers, and with, as always - and perhaps in this controversy it is our most invaluable personal asset - the genial and unfailing sagacity of Mr. Birrell. In all its essential features, and I am sure Mr. Redmond will agree with me here, our financial scheme is weathering the storm of criticism. It becomes more and more apparent, in fact, as discussion proceeds, that the only real alternative to it is the continuance and development of the present vicious system of giving Ireland, year by year, a constantly swelling stream of doles and gifts from the British Exchequer, while leaving untouched, without any motive or incentive to retrenchment, the extravagant costliness of Irish administration.A \u2018Momentary and Accidental Reverse\u2019It is true that last week in this matter of Irish finance we suffered a momentary and accidental reverse, which involved the loss of valuable time. So much nonsense has been talked and written with regard to this incident and our method of dealing with it that I must once more, in as few words as possible, state the plain facts. On Thursday in the previous week our financial resolution was carried in Committee, after a full debate, by a majority of no fewer than 121. On the following Monday, after a perfunctory discussion of less than half an hour on an amendment of which no notice had ever been given, that amendment, which made the whole resolution futile and unworkable, was carried by a majority of 21. It was obvious that the two decisions could not be reconciled, and it was plainly necessary, unless the Government thought fit, as they did not, to abandon the Bill and resign office, that steps should be taken without delay to ascertain which of the two contradictory votes represented the considered judgment of the House of Commons.The Government\u2019s \u2018Simple and Direct\u2019 ProposalThe case was a wholly exceptional one; conflicting and opposite decisions had been given on the same point in the course of a single week. It seemed to us, and I think we were perfectly right, that the simple and direct course, well warranted by Parliamentary precedent, a course which would have been adopted in any other assembly of business men, was to ask the House to cancel the second vote and to restore the first. We hear a great deal about the sacro-sanctity of our Parliamentary forms and the procedure which has been consecrated by the usages of 300 years. It is curious to recall that only ten years ago Mr. Balfour, the Leader of the Tory party, pro­posed to abolish all discussion on these money resolutions - they were to be decided upon without amendment or debate. If that plan had been adopted there could have been no Banbury amendment at all. So you see there is nothing so very sacrosanct after all about these Parliamentary forms.A \u2018Scene of Disorder and Violence\u2019But what was the result? The result was a scene of disorder and violence which happily has few parallels in the history of the House of Commons. The Speaker made an appeal, and in response to his appeal we adopted a more circuitous method of obtaining precisely the same result. That result has been obtained, the obnoxious amendment has been wiped out, the original resolution has been restored in all its essential details by practically the same majority by which it was in the first instance passed. In other words, the second division in the House has proved to be wholly misleading, and the first to represent the true judgment of an overwhelming majority. I see that in some quarters this result is represented as a triumph for the Opposition and a humiliation for the Government - a triumph for them, when we accomplished our purpose; a humilia­tion for us, when its accomplishment was not prevented but delayed by the degradation of the House of Commons! I gladly make them a present of the only triumph they can claim - namely, the consump­tion and loss of four or five days of Parliamentary time.The Price of this \u2018Barren Victory\u2019But there is something much more serious than that. Have they reflected, do they reflect, at what a price this barren victory has been purchased? I deprecate disorder, either outside or inside the House of Commons, by whomsoever it is originated, because I believe it to be fatal to the first principles of Parliamentary and Constitutional Government. I warned the Tory party six weeks ago that their Blenheim and Ulster performances earlier in the autumn would leave them without one shred of moral title to resist any course the majority of the Irish people might take in the event - happily in the highest degree improbable - of a denial of Home Rule. Now, this demonstration, conceived upon the same lines and in the same spirit, that a minority can, by shouting and tumult, bring the Parliamentary machine to a standstill, will not fail to be remembered and cited in the future if, when the Tory party is in power with a majority, not subject, as we are, to the restrictions of the Parliament Act, but capable of registering upon the Statute book any of its decrees at will through the automatic compliance of a partisan House of Lords - if, I say, with such a majority in power, the minority should be so ill-advised as to follow their example. That is the strange pass to which the party of law and order has been reduced.The Tory Theory of the Parliament ActThe whole theory upon which the Opposition, not only to the Home Rule Bill, but to all our measures, has been conducted rests upon this assumption - the assumption that, having passed the Parliament Act after strenuous controversy and after a General Election it had been approved by a large majority of the electorate, we are constitutionally debarred, after all we have said and done, from making any effective use of it. That is a very peculiar position, when you come to examine it, to take up. All this time, all this labour, all this controversy has been expended for absolutely nothing. The latter-day Tory seems to spend a large part of his working hours in hunting for our broken pledges. It is becoming an obsession with him, and the results are sometimes pathetic, but more frequently grotesque. I shall have to consider later, in view of their own promises, what are the moral qualifications of these gentlemen to complain of broken pledges.The Charge of \u2018Election Trickery\u2019First, you will allow me to examine very briefly and dispose of - not for the first time - the charges they bring against us, which by frequent repetition may obtain credence in the minds of people of short memory. The first is - I am almost ashamed to go back upon it, but I am obliged to - the charge of what is called \u2018election trickery\u2019; in other words, that we carefully concealed from the electors in November and December, 1910, that Home Rule was an issue, and, consequently, that our introduction of the Home Rule Bill was a fraud upon the constituencies. I should like on that point before I say a word about the actual facts, to quote a rather remarkable passage from a speech made by Mr. Balfour at Manchester towards the end of his term of office in January, 1905. He used some very striking words. He said: \u2018What is the charge? It is that the present Government are in office immorally and illegitimately, that the election was taken upon a particular issue\u2019 - that was the war, you will remember - \u2018that one question was before the country at the time and absorbed men\u2019s attention, and that consequently all legislation outside that one issue is legislation for which\u2026 we are without a mandate.\u2019 What did Mr. Balfour say about that? \u2018That is an entirely new constitutional theory; and it is not only new, but it is fundamentally, essentially, a vicious theory; and, much more than that, it is a theory invented by the Opposition quite late in the day when they began to think it would be convenient to get rid of the present Government.\u2019 That is what Mr. Balfour said in 1905. Even if we had said nothing at the Election about our intentions as to Home Rule, we should have been doing, after all, no worse than the Government which, after the khaki election, introduced the Education Bill; and we should be well within the shelter of Mr. Balfour\u2019s constitutional principle.Lord Lansdowne\u2019s EvidenceAs a matter of fact, we did nothing of the kind. We gave the fullest and most explicit notice; and the evidence is overwhelming that at the General Election of 1910 it was universally recognised and understood. I made it perfectly plain the year before - in my speech at the Albert Hall in December, 1909 - and whatever may be said of us now, we were certainly not dependent on the Irish vote then. I repeated it in the clearest and plainest terms at the commencement of the Election of 1910, addressing the delegates of this Federation at Hull. It is just as well in these matters to take unimpeachable testimony, and I will not go to any partisan authority. On November 30th, before a vote had been given in the Election of 1910, Lord Lansdowne, the Leader then as now of the Tory Party in the House of Lords, speaking at Portsmouth, said: \u2018Mr. Asquith\u2019 - that is me - \u2018to my mind has made it perfectly clear\u2019 - not a matter of inference, to be drawn from circum­stances, but that I, the Leader of the Liberal Party, then as now the Prime Minister of the country, had made it clear - what? \u2018That the first step that will be taken will be to deal with the question of Home Rule.\u2019 I am quite content with that testimony; it remains on record, and it cannot be contradicted. It is impossible to explain it away.The Allegation as to Immediate Reform of the House of LordsNow let us come to the second charge. It is this - that we have failed to perform what is, I think, properly described as a debt of honour - the carrying out of the intention declared in the preamble of the Parliament Act. In other words, that if we kept faith with the electors we ought to be devoting this Session to a scheme for the reconstruction of the House of Lords. I undertake to say that if you look at the records of the General Election of December, 1910, there was not a single speaker on either side who ever said or suggested anything of the kind, nor was there a single elector who gave his vote either on one side or the other upon that hypothesis I said in the House of Commons, when this ridiculous charge was first put forward at the beginning of the present Session, speaking on February 20th, \u2018I want to know by whom, when, and where was any promise ever given that in the next Session after the passing of the Parliament Act the Government would proceed with proposals for the reconstitution of the Second Chamber.\u2019 \u2018That,\u2019 I said, \u2018is a very specific question and it demands a specific answer, and the answer is - Nowhere, at no time, and by nobody.\u2019What the Preamble of the Parliament Act SaysIndeed, these people have not read the preamble of the Parliament Act. What does it say? It recites an intention to substitute for the present House of Lords a new Second Chamber, and it goes on to say that such substitution cannot be immediately brought into operation. Further, it says, \u2018And whereas pro­vision will require hereafter to be made by Parliament in a measure effecting such substitution for limiting and defining the powers of the new Second Chamber, but it is expedient to make such pro­vision as in this Act appears for restricting the existing powers of the House of Lords.\u2019 Could anything more clearly indicate an intervening period between the passing of the Act and the re­constitution of the Second Chamber? And it provides what in the interval is to be done to restrict the existing powers of the present House of Lords. I may tell those gentlemen who are so solicitous about the redemption of our debt of honour that the Government is engaged in the careful consideration of the reconstruction promised in the preamble, and in due course our proposals will be submitted for Parliamentary discussion.The \u2018Suspension\u2019 of the ConstitutionThey talk about the suspension of the Constitution! The Constitution is much more rational now than it has ever been within the lifetime of any one of us, more rational in the sense that it is less uneven between the two parties in the State, but it still leaves a great deal to be desired. We are still handicapped, we are still under this disability - we cannot pass a Liberal measure into law of a controversial kind, and of the first importance, if it has not been through three Sessions of the House of Commons and been two years before Parliament; and in the meantime we are absolutely at the mercy of an irresponsible and partisan assembly. If the Tories come into power tomorrow the Parliament Act dis­appears completely. They can pass any measure they please in the course of a single Session. Therefore, if ever there was a party which had a direct interest in putting an end to that state of things, and in bringing the Second Chamber into something like harmony with the principles of justice and equity, it is the Liberal Party.Not More Than One Controversial Bill a SessionI am sorry to keep you so long, but it is necessary to run these things to earth. The Opposition has recently discovered, or professes to have discovered, that I gave something in the nature of a pledge that we would not introduce more than one Bill, or more than one controversial Bill, in one Session. That suggestion was never dreamt of in the earlier months of the year, never even hinted when we introduced into the House of Commons, in the spring and the summer, first the Home Rule Bill, then the Welsh Church Bill, and then the Franchise Bill. It has been unearthed by what I cannot help thinking a very misplaced industry in the course of the Autumn Sitting, and unearthed for the purpose of prejudicing the Welsh Church Bill. Let us examine it for a moment, though really it is a mare\u2019s nest of a most absurd and grotesque kind.Lack of Foundation for this AllegationWhat really happened was this. In the course of the discussion last year, when the Parliament Bill was in Committee, Mr. Peel, as he was then, moved an amendment providing that the provisions of the Parliament Act should only apply to one Bill in a Session - the very thing to which I am now supposed to have pledged myself. I was representing the Government; I got up and opposed the amendment, and it was rejected by a majority of 83. The imaginary picture the mover of the amendment drew was that we or some other Government might \u2018pile up\u2019 a great number of Bills, \u2018deluge\u2019 the country, and overwork the House of Commons. I said that was an alarming but a perfectly unfounded representation of what was likely to happen. I said the limits to the power of human and Parlia­mentary endurance afforded adequate safeguards, and I said we could not accept any artificial limit to the right of the House of Commons to pass more than one Bill in one Session. See how it was interpreted at the time. Mr. Long said he was not surprised at what I said, because it was quite obvious that three measures in one Session would be the minimum to meet the requirements of the Government in order to give satisfaction to the different sections which supported them. Another, unofficial, Tory member, in order to clinch the matter got up and said, \u2018I presume the Prime Minister will not deny that next Session the Government will introduce a Home Rule Bill, a Scottish Land Bill, and a Welsh Disestablishment Bill. He has got to do so.\u2019The Tories and Their Referendum PledgeBut let us turn from our own misdeeds and make a short incur­sion into the enemy\u2019s territory. I am going to ask you to consider a very serious matter. What, in this matter of the redemption of electoral pledges, is the record of those gentlemen who are day and night bringing charges against us? You will remember the con­troversy which raged at the time of the last election in regard to what was called the Referendum. In 1907, when Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman\u2019s resolution was before the House of Commons, Mr. Balfour said the Referendum was alien to our traditions. But before long he gave, as you know, a rapid and complete consent to the greatest innovation that has been proposed in our time in our Parliamentary and constitutional system. The Referendum began by being commended as a solvent for disputes between the Houses, but it was soon found to be capable of, as it was then thought, other and more convenient applications.Mr. Balfour\u2019s Albert Hall PledgesAt the General Election of December, 1910, it was all-important for the Tory party to secure the Unionist Free Trade vote, and, accordingly, at the very beginning of the election, on November 29th, in the Albert Hall, Mr. Balfour used these remarkable words: \u2018I frankly say that without any question Tariff Reform is a great change. I admit that this election - or any election perhaps, cer­tainly this election - cannot be described as taken upon Tariff Reform simply, but I have not the least objection to submit the principles of Tariff Reform to a Referendum.\u2019 You will remember the enthusiasm in the Tory ranks - broken, I admit, by a few dissentient murmurs - following that memorable declaration. The audience said almost to a man: \u2018This has won the election for us.\u2019 The very same day, or the next day, Lord Lansdowne used words to the same effect; and Mr. Bonar Law, who was not then the Leader of the Unionist party, and who was fighting a very hard fight in Manchester, where the Unionist Free Traders are an im­portant element, said early in December that their leader had given a pledge that Unionists would not pass a Tariff Reform measure until the people were given an opportunity of saying whether they desired it. Much as he believed in Tariff Reform, if they found by a Referendum that the people did not want it, then he would not wish to force it upon them. Lord Milner the same day, with the air of moral superiority which our opponents so commonly assume, said: \u2018He (Mr. Balfour) is not going to carry it by a side-wind. There is something which comes even before Tariff Reform, and that is straight dealing in public life.\u2019 This was followed - and it is interesting in another connection - by the assurance of Mr. Balfour and Lord Lansdowne that not only was there to be a Referendum, but a Referendum from which plural voting was to be entirely absent. \u2018Each voter,\u2019 said Mr. Balfour, \u2018will have a right to give one vote and no more. There is no plural voting, and the gross inequalities in the size of constituencies will be avoided.\u2019This Pledge Remained After the ElectionThe election took place, the majority was not secured, but the pledge remained. I say that not on my own authority, and not merely as a matter of inference, but I say it by virtue of the declara­tion of Lord Lansdowne himself. Lord Lansdowne, speaking in the House of Lords after the election, in March, 1911, made a special reference to this case and said, speaking of Mr. Balfour\u2019s memorable announcement at the Albert Hall, \u2018That pledge will, of course, be fulfilled whenever we have an opportunity of fulfilling it.\u2019This Pledge Now WithdrawnYes, but how do we stand today? These are the people who talk about broken pledges. Why, just a week ago, in the Albert Hall, we have this very same Lord Lansdowne, with the assent of Mr. Bonar Law - the presumed assent - saying: \u2018We pro­posed a Referendum as a means of settling the differences between the two Houses. Our scheme was not accepted at the polls. I suggest to you that from that moment we regained our freedom. To apply it any longer to Tariff Reform is not a business proposi­tion.\u2019 It is not a business proposition to keep a pledge, deliberately given, which, as Lord Milner said, was essential to straight dealing in public life, and which, after the election was over, Lord Lans­downe had recognised as a matter of course as a pledge which would be fulfilled whenever they had any opportunity of fulfilling it. I think the less they say about broken faith, the better for their reputation - for anything but hypocrisy.The Tories and Tariff ReformNow that brings me to say - if you will bear with me - two or three words upon this very matter of Tariff Reform. It has been carefully kept in the background in the by-elections in great indus­trial constituencies such as Manchester and Mid Lothian, and today at Bolton, but nevertheless, as is clear from what Lord Lansdowne and his colleagues said in the Albert Hall, it is the intention of the leaders of the Tory party, if they can obtain a majority in the next General Election, without any Referendum or anything of the kind, to incorporate Tariff Reform as part of the fiscal system in the Statute book of this country. They have tried to minimise its effects; they have told you that the increases will be small, and that, as Mr. Balfour said in 1910, and as they repeat today, there shall be no increase in the cost of living, due to any change in these taxes on consumption, which shall fall on the working man\u2019s budget with increased severity, because, as he said, we have the power, and the power will be exercised, of reducing other indirect taxes - the taxes, for example, on tea and sugar; at all events, the taxes on the consumption of the working man.The Consumers and the Tariff Reform TaxesThat is the statement which is presented, and upon the strength of which the votes of the constituencies are going to be invited. That brings us to very familiar ground. Let us see what it really comes to. First, it is an admission that the results of the new taxation - taxation upon corn, meat, upon dairy produce - will, or at any rate may, fall upon the consumer. I need not point out to any body of intelligent men, that if a tax is paid by the foreign producer or importer no assurance for the readjustment of the burden on the shoulders of the working classes is in the least degree necessary. That is the first point.The Exchequer and the Tariff Reform TaxesThe second is this, and I cannot state it better than by quoting the language used by Mr. Chamberlain himself when he opened his fiscal campaign in Glasgow nine years ago. He said this, and it is perfectly true: \u2018The Exchequer, when it reduces tea or sugar, loses the amount of the tax on the whole consumption\u2019 - that is perfectly clear \u2013 \u2018but when it imposes a tax on corn or upon meat it only gains the duty on a part of the consumption, since it does not collect it either upon the Colonial or upon the home production.\u2019 So that - assuming Colonial corn came in free, which is no longer to be the case - the taxes you are invited to remit are taxes the whole benefit of which goes into the Exchequer, but the new burdens, as com­pensation for which the remission is to take place, are burdens not measured by that amount of the tax that is going into the Ex­chequer, but measured by the increased price of the whole supply.How the Tariff Reform Scheme Works OutYou see how that works out in practice. It is very important to bring these things clearly home to the minds of the people. We have no greater, or I think more trustworthy, authority in the actual working out of these problems than my honourable friend, Mr. Chiozza Money. I see that he has actually worked out a sum - I do not, of course, though I have the greatest respect for his judg­ment and his accuracy, commit myself to his precise figures - you cannot predict with anything approaching accurate precision what will be the exact effect in pounds, shillings, and pence, or any other form of numbers, of any fiscal change. He says that if you take the import duties proposed by Mr. Chamberlain\u2019s friends upon cereals and upon meat and dairy produce, taking the higher duty upon the foreign supply and the lower duty upon the colonial supply - he calculates that in 1912 the duty received by the Exchequer would not be more than eight millions, whereas the cost to the consumer in the increased price of the whole supply would be no less than eighteen millions. If you look at the duties, the whole benefit of which flow directly into the Exchequer, the duties on tea, sugar, cocoa, and coffee - they come in all to about 10½ millions - by a very simple calculation you will see that if the time should ever come for the redemption of this pledge that the burden to be imposed upon the consumer by the new taxes upon imported food is to be met by a diminution or some readjustment of existing taxation on food which we now consume - that it is a pledge which it is abso­lutely impossible for any Government or any party to fulfil.On What Would the Tories Fight an Immediate General Election?If we were to have a dissolution of Parliament tomorrow, what is the topic to which two-thirds of the Tory orators would devote themselves? Would it be Home Rule? No. Would it be Welsh Disestablishment? No. Would it even be Tariff Reform? That perhaps the least of any of the three. No; it would be an appeal dilating upon the hardships and grievances of the Insurance Act; and a majority so obtained, acting on the principle so clearly laid down by Mr. Balfour in the speech I quoted, would be used to carry Tariff Reform, with its burden of infinite suffering and loss on the working classes and upon the industries of this country, in defiance, as I still believe, of the opinion of the vast majority of the electors. I am giving my own deliberate judgment when I say to you that I think that is the greatest danger that threatens this country at the present moment.The Threefold Duty of the Liberal PartyI have thought it necessary to go in some detail and at some length into this, and I hope you will agree it is not inappropriate that I should come back before I finish to the point at which I began. What is the duty of the Liberal party at this moment in the House of Commons and outside? On that question my answer is threefold. It is to persist without haste, but without rest, in the programme which we have laid down; to obtain all those great measures of reform upon which for a generation past the aspirations and the hopes of the progressive party in this country and in Ireland have been fixed; and to claim for those measures what they have never had before, fair play and the possibility of passing into law. We are not going to lay aside any part of the programme. We are not going to desert the cause either of Ireland or of Wales. We are going to do our best, and I believe our best will be a successful best, to secure such reform in our franchise law as will make the House of Commons a truer and more accurate reflection of the mind and will of the people. If those tasks are to be accomplished they will involve undoubtedly a long and ex­hausting Session, great effort, and much sacrifice on the part particularly of members of Parliament, and we have good reason to recognise not only with appreciation but with the warmest gratitude the splendid constancy with which all the ranks of the Progressive Party, without distinction, have, amidst almost un­exampled exigencies, responded to the exceptional calls that have been made upon them.We Shall Persist to the EndOur divisions during this Autumn Sitting have, as a whole, surpassed anything during the present Parliament, and I believe it will be generally agreed that there never was a time in our political and Parliamentary history when there was such a good spirit, such strong, I might say sturdy, determination of the rank-and-file, of all those who support us, that these sacrifices shall not be thrown away. No great campaign was ever carried on without occasional checks and delays. It is part of the fortune of war, and we are not discouraged by the passing incidents which come today and which are forgotten tomorrow. As far as we at Westminster are con­cerned, we mean to persist to the end, and we rely upon you, whom, I believe, we represent in this matter, to give us the sympathy, support, and loyalty which has never yet failed us. If we have - and I believe you will see that we have - concentration of purpose, unity of spirit, and unshaken firmness of resolve, then, long and stormy though the voyage may have been before it comes to an end, the ship will find her way with a full cargo into the desired haven.

aVIt is a great pleasure to me to find myself amongst so many old and tried friends, and to learn that, both as regards the number of the delegates and the spirit which has animated their proceedings from first to last, this has been one of the record gatherings of the National Liberal Federation. Let me thank you, in the name of the Government, for your general verdict of approval of a legislative and administrative record which, as the Chairman has said, now goes back for eight years. I am quite content to put it side by side with that of any Govern­ment that has held office for anything like the same space of time in this country within the memory of man.We have, by universal admission, contributed at least our share to the maintenance of the peace of the world. We have drawn more closely than they were ever drawn before, and by measures consonant with the best traditions of Liberal policy in the past, the ties which unite us to our great self-governing Dominions. We have dealt with two of the greatest and most urgent of our social problems - the provision for old age and insurance against sickness and infirmity. We are about to take in hand on the same broad and generous lines a third - I mean the whole group of grievances, urban and rural, which are connected with the ownership and use of land. It is true that we were thwarted in our efforts to deal with such matters as education and licensing questions, the urgency of which I need not tell you we have not forgotten. But the obstacle which confronted us in the early days of our Ministerial life has now, happily, been removed, and we have succeeded in carrying into effect that which, for the lifetime of a whole generation, has been the aspiration of the Liberal Party - the establishment of the constitutional authority of the representative House of the Legislature.Expenditure on ArmamentsThere is, so far as I know, only one aspect of our administrative work which chequers your satisfaction as you survey the past. It is your disquietude at the growth of the national expenditure, and in particular of that part of it which is devoted to the fighting services. Do not suppose that I do not share that disquietude. If I cite one or two figures it may, I think, help to put the position of this country in its true perspective. In the first place, let me remind you, as the Chairman has already done, that since we have been responsible for the national finances we have reduced the indebtedness of the State by an amount which at the close of the present financial year we hope will not fall far short, if, indeed, it falls short at all, of one hundred millions sterling. The great bulk of the debt which has been so redeemed, as I need hardly remind you, was incurred for war expenditure in the past. We have been meeting the bill which our ancestors drew upon posterity, and at the same time we have been endeavouring to avoid their bad example by paying our own way and curtailing, within the narrowest possible limits, borrowing for such purposes.Roughly speaking, the expenditure on the Army during the last eight years has been fairly constant. It has neither risen nor fallen, while that on the Navy has risen something like fourteen millions. But what has been happening at the same time on the Continent of Europe? If you take the five great Continental Powers, and make the reservation one must for the difficulty of precise comparison owing to the different methods in which the accounts are kept, I estimate that in the five years - I do not go further back than five years - in the five years from 1908-9 to 1913-14 their military expenditure has risen by at least eighty millions, and their naval expenditure by at least thirty-five. Those are figures which should be borne in mind when you are estimating the relative proportion of the additional burden which this kind of expenditure has caused the several nations of the world. And there is another basis of comparison which in fairness ought not to he left out of sight - I mean the relative share which our expen­diture on armaments bears to the rest of our expenditure here at home in the present and in past years. I have had the figures carefully taken out, and I will give you just two or three. I am excluding from both sides of the account debt charges, on the one side, debt incurred for the Army and Navy; and, on the other side, debt incurred for civil expenditure and payments for the National Debt; and I include in the civil expenditure the expen­diture on the Post Office. Thirty years ago the Army and Navy, or, as I call it, armament expenditure, was 49.4% of the whole, and civil expenditure 50.6%. That was in 1883. In 1906-7, the first year that we were in office, the two were exactly, or almost exactly, equal - 50 per cent upon each. For the current year, 1913-14, the percentage of expenditure upon armaments has fallen to 42.7, and the civil expenditure has risen to 57.3.A Drain on the Resources for Social ProgressThose figures are worth bearing in mind, and you will see that great and lamentable - no one would, if he were at liberty, use stronger language than I could - great and lamentable as has been the increase in our own and other nations\u2019 expenditure for the purpose of armament, yet the percentage of the expenditure to the rest is substantially less in this country than it was thirty years ago. We - and when I say we I mean my colleagues in the Government and myself, every one of them, without exception - we lament as much as any man in this hall this huge diversion all over the world of national wealth into non-productive channels. A Ministry of this country which, out of wantonness or levity, in a spirit of vainglorious rivalry, or of reckless provocation, added as much as a pound to our expenditure upon these purposes would commit a national crime. We cannot plead guilty to that reproach. We are charged with a solemn trust, and in its perform­ance it is our duty to maintain a vigilant watch on what the rest of the nations are doing, and to have always steadily and constantly in view the worldwide interests of which, for the time being, we are the stewards. But you may ask, and ask it rightly - Are these things to go on for ever until by this ever-increasing leakage - for such it is - the material resources for social progress are drained ever drier and more dry?I took the opportunity a fortnight ago, at the Lord Mayor\u2019s banquet, to address a warning and an appeal both to the statesmen and business men of the world. But you may say to me, \u2018Words are well enough, but what is to be done?\u2019 My answer is - and I am neither a rhetorician, as you know, nor a sentimentalist, so I am told, and I am afraid it is true - that nothing can really effectually be done without the co-operation of the Great Powers of the world, brought about by the demands of their peoples. I believe myself that every growing stress and strain of new taxation and of swelling indebtedness may accomplish, may succeed in accomplishing, what philanthropists and idealists have so far failed to do. Speaking for my colleagues and myself, what I say to you is that you may rest assured that we shall seize eagerly every opportunity that we can discover or create to promote a concerted alleviation of the burden and waste which press upon the hopes and aspirations of mankind.The Opposition and Home RuleGentlemen, if you survey our domestic political situation, perhaps its most striking feature at this moment is the unanimity with which our political opponents are pressing for an immediate General Election. For the case which they put forward - I will try to state it fairly - is this: They tell us that a Home Rule Bill, which may and probably will lead to a civil war, is about to be carried, through the automatic operation of the Parliament Act, behind the backs of the British people. \u2018So long,\u2019 they say to us, \u2018as you had a majority independent of the Irish you never took up Home Rule seriously. You deliberately burked it during the whole Parliament of 1906, you only brought it back into your pro­gramme when you needed the Irish vote, and even so when you had made your compact with the Irish you successfully hoodwinked the British electorate and kept them in the dark. Let them now pronounce upon it, and if they are in your favour, we\u2019 - and this is a great concession \u2013 \u2018we will withdraw the countenance which we are now giving the contingent armed rebellion, and if Ulster fights, Ulster will have to fight alone.\u2019 Now, gentlemen, that is the legend which is current. It is seriously put forward, as lately as last week, by speakers of the authority of Lord Lansdowne, and by dint of constant reiteration and industrious circulation, it is probably by this time widely believed. I am, therefore, under the painful necessity of occupying your time for a few moments with a short historical recital of facts which are perfectly familiar to you, and which ought to be equally familiar - and I hope will be tomorrow - to the authors of this singularly audacious myth.Let us go back for a moment to the General Election of 1906. At that time, as we all remember, there was one great dominant issue before the electorate - the issue of Free Trade. The leaders of the Liberal Party, and of all sections of the Liberal Party - feeling that we were standing at a crisis in our national history, when, if the verdict of the electorate went wrong, it was, I won\u2019t say the end, but the most serious menace to our industrial supremacy, and even of our national existence - urged upon the electorate to concentrate entirely upon that point. And we solemnly pledged ourselves before the country that if we obtained a majority in that Parliament, we would not use it for the purpose of carrying Home Rule. That is a simple historical fact. We got a majority, and we are now taunted for not having violated our pledges, and used it for the very purpose which in advance we repudiated. We should have had very good precedent for doing so. Most people here, I suppose, remember the election of 1900, and the patriotic appeals which were then made to Nonconformists and others to sink everything in their determination to present a united front to the enemies of their country and bring the war in South Africa to a successful determination. And what followed? Within two years a Bill was introduced, passed through the House of Commons, passed into law with the connivance, the dumb connivance, of the House of Lords, behind the backs, as we now know, against the will of the vast majority of the electorate of England, completely revolutionising the foundations of our system of national education.When the Referendum was Undreamed ofWe did not use to hear much in those days of the Referendum. I will undertake to say that the average Conservative citizen in 1902 would have been more than surprised if he had been told that this - which he no doubt then regarded as a new-fangled ultra-demo­cratic expedient with a barbarous foreign name - that this in the course of ten years was to become one of the principal arrows in the party quiver of his Tory associates. The Referendum was never dreamed of so long as the House of Lords had its old power unchecked. All Tory legislation could go through, while Liberal legislation could not without any fresh appeal to the people. The result was that, considering ourselves bound in honour to fulfil the pledges we had given, we, in the Parliament of 1906, proposed, as our only legislative measure dealing with the government of Ireland, the Irish Councils Bill - a Bill, in my opinion, of administrative importance, but a Bill which had by the admission alike of friends and opponents left untouched the fundamental underlying problems of Irish government. But we were not content with that. In March, 1908, when that Parliament had been in existence only two years, Mr. Redmond brought forward a motion in the House of Commons to the effect that the solution of the problem of Irish Government could only be attained by giving to the Irish people legislative and executive control of purely Irish affairs, and there was added to it, at the instance of my friend the present Attorney-General, \u2018sub­ject to the supreme authority of the Imperial Parliament.\u2019 That was on the 30th of March, 1908, and this was in the Parliament in which we were supposed to have burked Home Rule, because we were not then dependent upon the Irish vote.A Home Rule Declaration in 1908I spoke on behalf of the Government on that motion. It was almost within a week, certainly within a fortnight of my becoming Prime Minister, but I was speaking in the regrettable absence, through illness, of Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman. I was speaking on behalf of the Cabinet and of the Liberal Party. And I should just like to quote to you two sentences from what I then said. They tell us that we never took up Home Rule until we had become dependent on the Irish vote. We had then a majority of about 200 over any possible combination of all the parties there. This is what I said:'For twenty years, and more than twenty years, I and many of my colleagues have steadily and consistently voted for propositions which, while explicitly safeguarding the supreme authority of the Imperial Parliament, declared that the ultimate solution of the Irish problem could only be found in a system of self-government in regard to local affairs.'From that opinion I have never receded, and I hold it just as strongly tonight as ever I did. And I went on to say, if you will forgive me quoting one more sentence - because these are not my words only, they are the words of the Government - I said:'I have always regarded what is called Home Rule in Ireland as part and parcel - a most urgent part, I agree, in point both of policy and time - of a more comprehensive change. The Constitutional problem is to set free the Imperial Parliament for Imperial affairs, and in matters purely local to rely more and more on local option and local machinery.'\u2018Ireland,\u2019 I added, \u2018is by far the most urgent case because it is the one undeniable failure of British statesmanship.\u2019 Well, gentlemen, that is the kind of language we are using today, and I challenge any critic to discover one hair\u2019s breadth of difference from the policy which, speaking on behalf of my colleagues and the Party, I then declared to be the settled policy of Liberalism, when we were in a majority transcending all parties in the State - to discover one hair\u2019s breadth of difference between the policy then enunciated and the policy we are now seeking to carry into law.Another Declaration in 1910A year afterwards, when the House of Lords had rejected the Budget, we advised the King to dissolve Parliament, and, as you know, another General Election took place in January 1910. I was then leader of the Party and Prime Minister, and I went to the Albert Hall, and at a representative meeting pointed out to them and to my fellow Liberals throughout the country that the Parlia­ment Bill - for it was then only a Bill - was regarded by us, not as an end, but as a means to an end. To what end? The attainment of long-delayed Liberal reforms. I enumerated what seemed to me, and seem to us, to be the principal of those reforms, and, coming to the Irish question, I referred to the speech I have already quoted, and I used these words - \u2018I repeat here tonight\u2019 - it was before the General Election; we still had the unimpaired integrity of the then existing House of Commons and a majority over all the other parties in the State - \u2018I repeat here tonight that the solution of the problem is to be found only in one way - by a policy which, while explicitly safeguarding the supreme authority of the Imperial Parliament, will set up in Ireland a system of full self-government in regard to purely Irish affairs.\u2019 And I added, to make the matter perfectly clear: \u2018For reasons which I believe to be adequate the present Parliament was disabled in advance from proposing any such solution, but in the new House of Commons the hands of the Liberal Government, and of the Liberal majority, will in this matter be entirely free.\u2019 Now, in view of these declarations, is it con­ceivable that anyone who voted even in the General Election of 1910 for the Liberal party, and for the passing of the Parliament Bill, did not do so with a full knowledge that it was our intention to make use of the power which the House of Commons had obtained to grant self-government to Ireland?We had another election in December of the same year. What happened then? I will not go through the familiar tale, but I will just recall to your recollection what was said at the time by Lord Lansdowne. In the course of the strain of that election, Lord Lansdowne, referring to myself, said to a great public meeting: \u2018Mr. Asquith has made it perfectly clear that if the Parliament Bill is carried, the first use of it will be applied in the carrying of Home Rule.\u2019 I wonder what they think the electors were really voting for in 1910? Apparently for a series of referenda or, alter­natively, for a series of general elections. No Ground for Demanding a General ElectionThe facts which I have recited, and which are absolutely beyond the reach of contradiction and dispute, are quite sufficient for my purpose to show that this demand for a General Election, in so far as it is based upon the hypothesis that the electors did not give their votes with a full and complete knowledge that the Home Rule Bill would be introduced upon the lines I then laid down, is one of the idlest demands that was ever put forward. No; there is no ground for demanding a General Election. And if a General Election were held, how much further would it advance matters? Is there anyone in this room or outside it credulous enough and ignorant enough to suppose that that election would be fought or could be fought upon the single issue of Home Rule? What about the Welsh Church? They want a Referendum or a General Election all to itself upon that, for it is perfectly certain that the Welsh Church would be brought into the controversy, and would play as conspicuous a part as the indefatigable advocates of the Welsh Church could persuade the English electors to allow it to do - not perhaps a very serious one.What about Tariff Reform? We have just been told in the most explicit terms by Mr. Bonar Law that if he and his friends are returned to power, although they are precluded for the moment from what is called the full-blown policy, yet they are going to start with a 10 per cent import duty - an average 10 per cent, remember that - upon manufactured goods, the proceeds of which, or some part of the proceeds, are going to be handed over to the farmers to compensate them for not getting their food taxes. Do you suppose you and I are going to allow a General Election to be fought without bringing that up, that we are going to have Tariff Reform or the first stage of Tariff Reform smuggled upon the Statute Book under the disguise of a Home Rule election? It is the right and bounden duty of every elector to take all these things into account, and to remember that under the Constitution in this country - which in this respect I trust will remain unchanged - and of every country which acknowledges the principles of represen­tative government, you send a House of Commons, you send a People\u2019s Chamber, for a term of years to represent you, and make laws for you, and not to be perpetually going back like agents with a limited authority to ask whether or not they may pass these par­ticular laws. I see, then, no ground whatever for this demand for a General Election, and, so far as I am concerned, you may take it from me I shall not advise any such course.The Irish Problem and \u2018Settlement by Consent\u2019Setting aside this plea for a General Election, as neither consti­tutionally necessary nor practically expedient, let me for a few moments approach the much-debated problem, of which you read a great deal in the newspapers, of the possibility of a settlement of the Irish question by consent. There are two points in this con­nection which I wish, in view of constantly recurring misconstructions or misunderstandings, to make perfectly clear. I am sup­posed, as you know, to have had a recent lapse into ambiguity or obscurity of statement. In the first place, if, as is the case, we have shown ourselves ready to consider the possibility of settlement by consent, it is not because we are in any way whatsoever dis­satisfied with the Government of Ireland Bill as it stands. Mr. Birrell said very truly, in a speech I think he made this week, that we do not claim for it verbal inspiration. Like all or most of the products of human intelligence or human energy, it is no doubt susceptible to improvement. If the House of Lords, instead of twice in succession curtly rejecting it on Second Reading, had con­descended to exercise in regard to it the appropriate functions of a Second Chamber in a democratic country - the function, I mean, of revision, of amendment, or of suggestion - it may very well be quite possible that some of the problems which are now exercising men\u2019s minds would by this time have been cleared out of the way.But I am bound to say to you, in view of the things that are said, and apparently believed, that we consider the Government of Ireland Bill to be a well-conceived and carefully constructed measure, with adequate safeguards against anything in the nature of either religious or political persecution. It is specially designed to meet the exceptional historic and economic conditions of Ireland, and we do not say, and we have never contended - I have con­stantly disavowed any such position - that the system which it sets up in Ireland could be applied without substantial modifications to other parts of the United Kingdom. We look upon it as the first and the most urgent step in a process of devolution which will in time set free the Imperial Parliament for purely Imperial concerns, but in each successive step that is taken a similar regard must be paid to the special conditions of the particular constituent part of the United Kingdom with which you are dealing. Devolution is not a merely mechanical problem, and in a country so complex and so varied as ours, if I may use the expression, you cannot standardise Home Rule. That is my first observation.The \u2018Gospel of Anarchy\u2019The next is this: We are not going - I am sure you do not need the assurance - but we are not going to be frightened, or arrested, or deflected in the pursuit of that which we believe to be right and politic by the menace of civil war. It is threats of this kind - I am speaking in all sobriety and seriousness when I say so - coupled and reinforced by hints such as even Lord Lansdowne thought it proper to give the other day of their possible effect on the British Army, which are in my deliberate opinion the most formidable obstacle at this moment to anything in the nature of an agreed settlement. In many of the recent utterances, even of responsible statesmen like Lord Lansdowne, there is expressed or implied what I described some time ago as the whole gospel of anarchy. If, gentlemen, you once lay down that the individual citizen has in his own bosom a dispensing authority which entitles him to offer armed resistance to the law of the land, and, further, that the servants of the State - be they soldiers or police, be they officers or men - may discriminate at will between the binding force of the various orders which from time to time they receive from those above them - I say, and I say it with all solemnity, once accept such a doctrine as that, do not be blind enough to suppose that its application will be confined to a particular case. I hope it is not necessary, and I won\u2019t give possible illustrations which will occur to every one, but I say, by such a doctrine as that, deli­berately put forward by men of responsible authority, you are undermining, both by your arguments and by your example, the very foundations of democratic government and of civil society.And let me add that, great as my respect is for Sir Edward Carson - and I say quite unfeignedly that I believe him to be an absolutely single-minded man - great as my respect is for him, I think I know the British people better than he does. And I say to him, and others who act with him, that such an attitude as I have described is not in the least degree in the long run likely to impress either the imagination or the judgment of my fellow countrymen. You can appeal with confidence to their sense of justice, and with equal confidence to their generosity. You can appeal without hesitation to their common sense, to their hatred of extremes, and to their ingrained political wisdom. But the one appeal to them that is sure to fail is an appeal to their fears. I say once more, as I said the other day at Ladybank, and I repeat it here today in the plainest possible terms, that our attitude - and when I say ours I mean that of the Government, and I believe I may speak for my friends and followers in the party - our attitude in this matter now or hereafter has not been, and will not be affected by a moment\u2019s doubt either as to the duty or as to the power of the State to ensure obedience to the law of the land.The First Essential of a SettlementNow, gentlemen, those two misapprehensions being cleared once and for all, I repeat another thing which I said to my constitu­ents the other day - that in my opinion, which is also that of my colleagues, it is from the point of view both of Ireland and of Great Britain of high importance if such a result can be secured that the new system in Ireland should not start upon the basis of civil strife, with the apparent victory of one section or the apparent defeat of another. It is equally important, again, if it is possible without the sacrifice or surrender of some essential principle, that the de­cision come to should be not, indeed, beyond the reach of amend­ment which subsequent working experience may show to be neces­sary, but it should be regarded, if it be possible, by both sides, and in all quarters, as in substance a settlement, and to repeat the words I used the other day, beyond the risks of electoral and Parliamentary vicissitudes. Otherwise, the Irish question will continue to be the football of our party politics to the infinite injury of both Ireland herself and of the United Kingdom as a whole. It was in that spirit, from a sense of the weight of these considera­tions, that I invited, that I took upon myself to invite, not a con­ference of party leaders nor anything in the nature of formal nego­tiations, but a free and unprejudiced interchange, from all sides, of views and suggestions.The Door Still OpenI have no reason to complain of the spirit in which that invitation was received by, amongst others, the responsible leaders of the Opposition. Suggestive considerations have already come forward from many quarters; though I should be deceiving you, and deceiv­ing myself, if I were to say that I saw at this moment a prospect of agreement. But I cannot at all concur with some of our impatient critics who say that time has been, and is being, wasted. I must, however, take serious exception to such phrases as were used the other night by Mr. Austen Chamberlain in a speech, to the general moderation of which I am anxious to, and do, bear most willing testimony. He is reported to have said that it is not for the Oppo­sition to solve difficulties created by the Government, or to help them out of the dangers they have provoked. Difficulties created and dangers provoked by the Government! Does anyone suppose that if the Government and their plan had never come into existence, or were wiped out of existence tomorrow, the diffi­culties and dangers would not have arisen or would disappear? They are not of our creation. They are the legacy of centuries of misunderstanding and mismanagement. They are the biggest blot on the scutcheon of the British Empire, and until they are met in a large and liberal spirit, Ireland will remain the one hiatus in our Imperial unity - a reproach to our political genius, the unsolved riddle of British statesmanship. We are constantly being pressed by the case of the minority, a case which I have never denied deserves the most careful and sympathetic consideration. But what of the majority? Do you suppose, can anyone suppose, that if their hopes were to be, which God forbid, frustrated on the eve of fruition, if their Constitutional demand were to he indefinitely postponed or mocked by some half-hearted and unsatisfying com­promise, does anyone suppose you would have got rid of the Irish difficulty? But there would remain the difficulty in a form far more menacing and formidable than ever.I entirely agree with one observation that fell the other night from Mr. Bonar Law - that no good could possibly result from any party leaders shouting alternative suggestions from rival platforms. Such a method of procedure is doomed to sterility and failure, and I certainly am not going to take part in anything of the kind. But you will understand, from what I have said, that it shall not be said with truth, either now or hereafter, that my hand has closed any door which opens upon a reasonable and an honour­able way of peace.A Cabinet United and of Fixed PurposeAnd now, gentlemen, before I sit down you will allow me to make a few final observations. The first is this: There is not a shadow of foundation for the statements which have been brought to my notice that in this matter, or indeed in any other, we are a divided Cabinet. The stories which you read do much more credit to the imaginations of those who invent them than to the judgment of those who accept them. We have had a free and frank inter­change of opinions, conducted under the most favourable con­ditions. That is the function of a Cabinet, and in my opinion a function of the highest utility. But there is no difference of opinion among us whatsoever, either as to the present or as to the future. The last thing I wish to say is this - I said it at Ladybank, and I must say it again - we are not going to make, either upon our own initiative or at the suggestion of others, any surrender of principle. We mean to see this thing through. We took up the Irish cause from a conviction which time has strengthened and deepened, that as a matter of right Home Rule was due to Ireland, and as a matter of policy it was sanctioned by the highest interests of our Parliament and our Imperial development. The Irish members, representing the vast majority of the Irish people, have trusted us with a loyalty that has never wavered. For that loyalty we hope to show a worthy counterpart, and that trust we shall most certainly not betray.

aVI am much touched by the warmth of your welcome, and I can assure you that no pleasure could be greater to me than to find myself once more standing on the platform of the National Liberal Feder­ation, and face to face with the men and women who, through good report and through evil report, have for a generation past maintained and upheld the Liberal cause.It is exactly ten years this spring since the Liberal Party did me the honour to elect me to be their leader. During those ten years we have done a great deal of hard fighting for good causes. And whether in the field of administration or of legislation I am quite prepared to challenge a comparison with any other decade in our modern history. During the whole of that time our relations of mutual confidence and loyalty have never for a moment been strained or even clouded. And as it has been in the past so I trust, and so I believe, it will continue to the end.The Nation\u2019s One PurposeYou have naturally and rightly given the first place among your resolutions to the affirmation, that all other purposes must be subordinated to the effective prosecu­tion of the war, till a just peace is secured, and the establishment of a League of Nations to prevent war is recognised as the most urgent duty of international statesmanship.I heartily endorse that resolution; and if I thought that our meeting together, to discuss and to form conclu­sions on some aspects of the work of reconstruction which must follow the war, was in any way calculated to divert our interests and energies from that paramount object, I should not - and I am certain that you would not - be found in this hall today.The Military SituationThe development of the military situation during the last two months, both in the West and the East, has been in a high degree favourable to the Allied cause. The German Chancellor, Count Hertling, has admitted only this week to the Reichstag that the great German offensive in France and Flanders, upon which such high hopes were fixed, has completely failed.It is precisely six months since that offensive was launched under the most promising auspices, and no one would have been more surprised or incredulous than General Ludendorff, if he had been told at the end of last March - when the only question with him was whether he should take Paris, or the Channel ports, or both - that by the end of September he would be fighting his hardest, and with trembling hopes, to retain his hold on the old Hindenburg line.In two at least of the Eastern theatres - Palestine and Macedonia - our progress after a long pause is marked and significant. Indeed, there has been in the war no campaign more skilfully conceived, or more brilliantly carried out, than that by which General Allenby has already captured the best part of two armies and cleared the Turk out of the Holy Land.Homage to British TroopsLet us not forget, with all our well-deserved gratitude to our gallant Allies, the conspicuous and in many in­stances the decisive part in all these operations which has been played by our own British troops. Few indeed are now left of the original Expeditionary Force who left these shores in August, 1914, a body of men, in all the essentials of soldiership, with no superiors in military history. But the men who have taken their places - most of them, be it remembered, civilians who recruited - of their own free will - have rivalled even that heroic example. They have earned the undying homage of their own countrymen and of all friends of freedom everywhere, and not least among them that gallant and illustrious leader, himself one of the chiefs of the original Expeditionary Force, tenacious, modest, resourceful, indomitable, Field-Marshal Sir Douglas Haig.The Navy\u2019s PartNor should we fail to remember, as perhaps when our eyes are fixed on more dramatic military exploits we are sometimes tempted to do, the vital contribution which today, as throughout the war, is being made to the Allied success by our British Navy. We are told, sometimes by way of reproach, sometimes by way of commendation, that we were unprepared for the war. Unprepared to take the offensive in a war of aggression, we certainly were. Unprepared we were also to take a leading part in a European land campaign in competition with the gigantic armies of the Continental Powers. But we were not unprepared for our own defence or for rendering, as events have proved, invaluable help to an Ally.At no time in our history was the British Navy better equipped in ships, in armament, in personnel. During long years of peace we spared no care and no money in maintaining, against all possible rivalry, the naval supremacy, which is essential to the safety of these islands and to the unity of our Empire. Few indeed could have dreamt of the part, the controlling part, for such it is, which the Navy could play in a worldwide war.What have we seen during these last four years? The great German fleet, on which so many millions had been spent and such vast ambitions and hopes were centred, is sealed up in impotence in its home waters. The German flag is not to be seen on cruiser or on merchantman in any of the highways of the ocean. The whole naval activities of the enemy are confined to the piratical adventures of his submarines, which prowl beneath the surface seeking, and too often finding, their prey, in defiance alike of law and of humanity, among innocent passengers, or among the sick and wounded and the nurses devoted to their care.The safe and rapid transport of troops, the supply of food and of the sinews of industry both to these islands and to the Allies, the progressive and effective constriction with an ever-tightening grip of the outside resources of the enemy - these are the things which have enabled us and the Allies for four years to carry on the war, and which in any event must bring us victory.Confidence in the ResultI have never doubted - even in the darkest moments I have never doubted - that the continued pressure of the Allied resources - naval, military, and economic - would prove in the long run to be irresistible. It is true that we have lost the help of Russia. But the New World has stepped in to uphold the cause of freedom in the Old; and it was undoubtedly the need for striking a decisive blow, before America could cast her full weight upon the side of the Allies, that led the German High Command to undertake that grandiose and ill-starred offensive of which Count Hertling admits the defeat.But the more confident our faith in ultimate victory the more it behoves us to be on our guard that the unexampled sacrifices we have made are not wasted or frittered away. They will be wasted - I say it advisedly - unless we can secure what I called a year ago a Clean Peace, and the setting up of a new International Polity which will chain up for ever the Furies of War. I will say a few words, if you will allow me, on each of these two points.A Clean PeaceFirst, what do we mean by a clean peace? We mean - I at any rate mean - a peace which attains for the world the objects for which we have been fighting which is clean in the sense that it cleans the slate, but clean also in another and a higher sense: that (as was wisely said here in Manchester the other day) it does not offend the conscience either of the victor or of mankind. You can have no clean peace if you have a continuance of veiled war. A peace which is designed to inflict permanent humiliation, to dismember what is by nature and by affinity united, to leave open wounds - such a peace, as all history shows, is at best but a precarious armistice, and is not worth the parchment on which it is engrossed. The Germans have given us an object-lesson at Brest-Litovsk of what a peace should not be.The Austrian NoteWe have quite recently had a peace overture from the Austrian Foreign Minister, Count Burian. There has been much, as I think, rather futile speculation as to what were his motives: whether his proceedings were a manoeuvre or a genuine advance? How far he was the conduit-pipe or the cat\u2019s-paw of Germany? I am quite sure that Count Burian wants peace. No man in Europe has more reason for seeking it and ensuing it; for among all our enemies, not even excluding Turkey, the plight of Austria is the most pitiful - Austria politically disintegrated, economically on the verge of ruin, and yet tied, with or against her will, to the chariot-wheels of a losing cause.I am bound to say, whatever its motives, that Count Burian\u2019s present suggestion does not commend itself to me as a practical proposition. For what does it come to? The representatives of the various belligerents are to hold a secret confabulation behind closed doors to discuss what are called \u2018basic principles.\u2019 I have not - perhaps because I was trained in the old bad school - quite such a horror of what is called \u2018secret diplomacy\u2019 as some of my friends. I am prepared, as I think all those who conduct the policy of the Allies are, to explore any and every avenue of peace, but I do not want to find myself or my country bogged and befogged in a jungle. Count Burian has, perhaps, not yet said his last word.Peace, a real peace, is so immeasurably the greatest blessing that could befall humanity, that neither honest misunderstanding, nor deliberate misrepresentation and concealment, should be allowed to stand in its way. I suspect there is abroad at this moment a great deal of both. Our objects have, as we think, been plainly stated both here and in America, and the oftener, the more clearly, and the more authoritatively they are restated the better.         Count Hertling and Belgium But let me, without reiterating all the points, take two test cases, the one from the West and the other from the East. Take first the familiar but crucial case of Belgium. Count Hertling, as we know from the speech which he has delivered this week, is quite impenitent about Belgium. \u2018Only to defend ourselves,\u2019 he declared, \u2018did we invade Belgium\u2019; violating, as he admits - he says so in terms - the most solemn written obligations, in deference to what this pupil of St. Augustine considers the higher law of self-defence.        The repetition of this monstrous and threadbare fiction - for such it is - is accompanied, not for the first time, by the avowal, at once naïf and cynical, that Belgium was offered peace and compensation for damage, if she would only give a right of way through her territory, and a jumping-off ground, for the German Army, which, in obedience to the sacred duty of self-defence, was about to make, by the shortest route, a spring upon Paris. The inference, of course, is that for all that followed - the ghastly series of outrage and devastation which has stamped the history of the German invasion of Belgium with undying infamy - Belgium alone is to blame, and Belgium must bear the consequences. There is no case here at all, Count Hertling implies, for indemnity or reparation. And this comes from the mouth of the statesman who is at this moment engaged, with the connivance of the Bolshevik Government, in extorting £300,000,000 from Russia on, as one of his colleagues calls it, \u2018a carefully adjusted calculation of German claims.\u2019The Plight of RussiaBelgium, you may say, is an old story; so let me for a moment go farther east - to Russia. That great country, which has contributed so much to the intellectual and spiritual wealth of mankind, and which in the first two years of the war was a bulwark of strength to the Allied cause, exhibits at this moment one of the most tragic spectacles in history.Its stupendous unity, which in the past has weathered so many storms, is for the moment torn and riven into discordant fragments. Moscow and Petrograd, the ancient and the modern capitals, are dominated and ravaged by cutthroats and criminals. The Autocracy is dead; the Duma is no longer alive; Bolshevism is tot­tering into a dishonoured grave. Germany, naturally enough, is making the most of the opportunity to exact so-called indemnities, and to develop disintegration, in order that she may find political and economic com­pensations in the East for the failure of her attack on the liberties of the West.There are in Russia itself some sporadic centres and rallying-points. The Czecho-Slovaks are waging a gallant fight against the hordes of German and Austrian prisoners; and there has been of late at Murman, at Archangel, and in Eastern Siberia, a tardy - perhaps a necessarily tardy - intervention of the Allies. That in­tervention, I wish to say clearly, is justified, and can only be justified, by a purpose which is conformable with their settled policy in the war - not to dictate to Russia how she shall be governed, not, as the Germans aim at doing, to exploit her for the profit of others; but to give her a free chance, when her internal fever has run its course, to become the mistress of her own future, and, under whatever form of government she pleases, to resume her place and her authority among the great Powers of the world.Lesson of the Two ExamplesI have taken those two examples to show to Count Burian and his Allies that the only peace which we can accept is one that guarantees to nations, small or great, security against sinister and predatory ambitions, and the full right of self-determination. And, let me add - and it shall be the last thing I shall say on that part of the subject - that in the official statements made to the Reichstag this week the Vice-Chancellor, Herr von Payer, not only adheres to the Brest-Litovsk and supplementary Treaties, but expressly refuses to submit them to the Peace Conference. In this connection he advises his countrymen - I quote his own words - not entirely to forget the old saying, \u2018Try to hold what you have.\u2019 If this were to be regarded as the last word of Germany it might well fill those who hope, as we all do, for peace, with despair. Let us trust that it is the last word, not of Germany, but of a dying era of military and bureaucratic dominance.A New International Polity   I come now, before I pass to matters of domestic concern, to the other point I mentioned as with us the governing object - the creation of a new International Polity. A great deal has already been said and written about what is called the League of Nations. There has recently been formed among us a \u2018League of Free Nations Association,\u2019 which is promoted, I am glad to say, by men of all political parties. And I should like here to repeat one or two points which I have already brought before them. They are both negative and positive. Let me briefly recapitulate them.Negatively, in the first place, the proposed League does not aim at or involve the separation or curtailment of the political independence of the constituent States. Secondly, still less does it seek to obliterate or fuse the national individualities of the peoples who compose those States. Each will continue to pursue its own lines of self-development, and to contribute its special gifts or faculties or services to the common stock of mankind. Those are negative points.What ought it to aim at on the positive side?First it seeks to do for the community of nations what the law and opinion have already done for civilised society - to abolish war as a mode of settling disputes. Next, for this purpose it must equip itself with machinery for intervention and conciliation and judicial arbitrament in all international differences. Thirdly, in the last resort, its decisions must be armed with the sanction of the common will, and if need be of joint coercive action. Further, it will become in time - and I attach great importance to this - the clearing-house of dis­cussion and negotiation between States through which - and this ought to give satisfaction to those who are suspicious of secret diplomacy - covenants and treaties will pass before they take their place upon the international statute book.Again, it will open its doors, and offer a seat at its council table, from time to time, to all States without exception who can give an earnest of their loyalty to its purpose and its spirit. It will take under its protection, and secure against aggression and selfish exploitation, the smaller States, and the backward and unorganised races and territories of the world. And, lastly, it will seek by all legitimate and pacific methods to extend both the area and the effectiveness of its operations, and will be free to treat as outside the comity of nations such States as still adhere to militarism and the rule of force.Revelations of the WarI agree with the Chairman that this is a scheme not so Utopian as it still sounds to many people. The war has been in more ways than one, if I may adapt an old phrase, an Evangelic Preparation for such a League. In the first place, by its revelation of the infinite and still not fully developed potentialities of the application of science to the machinery of destruc­tion, it has already gone a long way to convince the world that war under modern conditions has become a form of insanity and suicide. Nothing is more certain than that, if the competition in armaments is allowed to continue for the lifetime of another generation, the next great war will bring about the practical extinction of civilisation, and the permanent crippling of the human race.But, further, the war has also shown, and I speak here more particularly of the experience of ourselves and of our Allies, the practical possibilities of co-operation and of joint counsel and action, between nations as diverse as any in the world in their traditions, their methods, and their habits. The inter-Allied pooling of resources in money and credit, in men and materials, in strategy and policy, which has been progressively de­veloped since the beginning of the war, has submerged, if it has not effaced, many old national and racial barriers. True, this has been brought about, and is being carried on, under the driving stress of a supreme emergency. But the effect will remain. Insularity, particularism - call it by whatever name you please - will be found to have lost its edge, and unity of counsel and action, co-operation of each in the common purposes of all, will be felt to be not only a rational but a natural scheme of inter­national relationship.Its embodiment in a working constitution will, I agree, tax to the uttermost the statesmanship of the world. It is a matter for hard, clear, co-operative thinking. I cannot but think myself - and I throw out the suggestion for what it is worth - that the time has come when the best heads among the Allies, who can be spared from combatant and administrative work, might be assembled in conference to attack the practical sides of the problem, upon the solution of which the future of mankind so largely depends.The General ElectionTo turn now to our domestic problems. One question is uppermost in the thoughts and perhaps on the lips of all practical politicians like ourselves. Is there or is there not going to be a general election? This Parlia­ment, elected for a maximum term of seven years, came into existence in January 1911. In that same year, by the Parliament Act, it voluntarily curtailed its own term and that of its successors to five years, which would have brought it to an end in January 1916 - nearly three years ago. Since then it has five times extended its own life. I was myself responsible for several of those extensions, and I have supported them all. On what ground? Simply that it was in the highest degree undesirable to have a General Election during the war; and with each fresh extension we have enter­tained, I won\u2019t say an expectation, but a hope, that the additional term might carry us over the duration of hostilities.The result, it is not to be denied, has been a very anomalous Parliamentary situation. Those who were elected in 1911 and still remain, have an ever-waning title to act as the living mouthpieces of the constituencies which they ostensibly represent; those who have been returned at by-elections have come in under a party truce, which binds them above and before all things to support the Government of the day in the prosecution of the war.The consequence is - I admit that fully - that we have a House of Commons in whose arteries and veins the old blood is drying up, and the new blood is not free to flow. It is, through no fault of its own, a growingly impotent body, in which even criticism is severely restrained, and there is no place for constructive power. The passing of the Reform Act, with its new electorate and its new constituencies, is, of course, also a very material fact. I have put the case strongly, as strongly as I can, but not, I think, more strongly than it deserves.A Conclusive Reason against itBut there is one dominating reason which seems to me to be conclusive against holding a General Election at the present time, or until we have reached, or at any rate are within sight of, the end of the war - the very same reason which, as I have said, has induced the House of Commons on five occasions artificially to prolong its life. That reason is in as full operation today as it has ever been. What is that reason? It is founded upon an absolutely certain forecast of what a General Election under such conditions would really mean. It would mean the distraction of interest and the dissipation of energy. It would show the impossibility of concentrating attention on the future while the present, with its daily vicissitudes of fortune, absorbs our attention and anxiety. It would be embarrassed by the insuperable difficulty of presenting clean-cut issues. And more than all, it would mean the certainty that in appearance, at any rate, and perhaps in reality, national unity would be broken, just at the time and in the circumstances when it is of paramount urgency that it should be preserved.     That unity from the first day of the war has been our sovereign asset. To it has been largely due the weight and volume, moral and material, which we have contributed to the struggle, and which in no vainglorious spirit we may say saved the Allied cause and, in the most critical hour of their fortunes, the liberties of Europe and the world. In my judgment a General Election under such conditions would be inconsistent with the best interests of this nation and of the Allied cause.The Liberal ProgrammeWhy then, it may be asked, are we here today? The answer is that, whenever an election is to take place, it is high time to think out our views, and to state them explicitly, as to the problems which will confront us when victory is attained. I am almost afraid to use the word \u2018programme.\u2019 In these days we have got into the habit of thinking and of talking in terms of khaki, and I ought perhaps to speak of \u2018a series of objectives.\u2019You may call a particular plant a rose, or, if you please and are anxious to avoid old associations, you may call it an odoriferous vegetable. It is a matter of taste. It is a matter of nomenclature. The thing will smell the same, and will be the same, and therefore I do not think we need apologise in the least for discussing what used to be called the programme - except perhaps to those people who think that, when the waters of the war subside, all the old party distinctions, which have been temporarily submerged, will prove to have been per­manently obliterated. Some of them even go so far as to discern in imagination a new earth, with a new set of commandments, and with new rules both of logic and of arithmetic. Our old Liberal convictions, derived from reflection and experience, from the teaching of history, above all from those momentous controversies of which our own country, with its free public life, has been the secular ­arena - all these, according to some people, are to be reviewed and revised with the presumption, apparently, that the bulk of them have become outworn and out of date. Some, at any rate, we know are to be regarded as tunes which have had their day, and which are now only fit to be played upon a hurdy-gurdy at some rustic fair. I do not hold these views, though I hope I am not blind to the lessons of the war. I make no apology for meet­ing you as an organisation of Liberals; for addressing you as an unrepentant fellow Liberal; and for congratu­lating you on the Resolutions of your Conference, which seem to me instinct with the old and undecayed spirit of Liberalism.Policy after the WarI cannot, of course, in the compass of a single speech, attempt in the time which is open to me to cover the whole ground, and if I leave, as I must leave, a number of topics untouched, it is not from indifference to their urgency, still less through dissent, so far as I have been able to get possession of them, from your conclusions. So throughout what I am going to say let it be clearly understood that I am dealing with matters which will call for treatment, when, and not until, the war comes to an end.Ireland: An Urgent MatterI must, however, on the threshold, make one exception in regard to which the need for action is, in my judgment, immediate from the point of view alike of policy and of old honour. I refer, of course, to Ireland, where the situation - already delicate, but, after the labours of the Convention, not without hope - has been entangled by gratuitous difficulties. We are witnessing the easily foreseeable, and indeed predicted, consequences of the crude mishandling this last spring of the Irish problem of military service. I purposely do not go further into that aspect of the case, except to express the hope that Ireland, including Ulster, will, of her own free will, make good the quota which she owes to the defence of world-wide freedom. I desire rather to insist upon that which is fundamental and involves, as I have said, both the honour of our statesmen and, what is equally important, the moral authority of this country as a partner in the Allied cause. We are pledged all of us without slackness and without delay, to arrive at a solution of the secular problem of the relations of these two islands. There is nothing in the whole sphere of our Imperial and domestic policy so immediate in its urgency, or so far-reaching in its consequences, as that, when we meet in the council chamber of peace, we should do so free from the reproach that the only part of our Empire to which we are afraid or unable to grant self-government is that which lies nearest to our own shores.Provision for the Fighting MenMy next topic is one which belongs to the inter­mediate stage between the cessation of hostilities and the actual settlement of peace. I refer to a Resolution, which I see you have put in the forefront of your domestic programme, dealing with the rights of Soldiers and Sailors after the war. We agree that the first charge, not on the compassion and sympathy only, but on the sense of justice of the community, is an adequate provision for our sailors, soldiers, and airmen who have come back from serving at the front. And that obligation comes under three heads. First, we have to find employment for those who are able to work. Secondly, we have to provide training for those who are incapacitated for their old occupations in new employments, and assistance in giving them a start. And, thirdly, we must secure for those who are wholly disabled pensions adequate for comfort, and, what is hardly less important, administered with elasticity and expedition.Back to LibertyThe first result of peace, to which we must look and for which we must work, is the restoration of domestic Liberty. The people have submitted, and on the whole have submitted uncomplainingly, for the sake of the war, to many fetters on their habitual and traditional freedom. The ordinary rights of free expression have been curtailed, and in some cases altogether abrogated, and we have been taught what it is to live under the regime of a censored and controlled Press. This is a price, high as it is, which most of us think was worth paying, and which all of us at any rate have been willing to pay, to prosecute and to win the war. But limita­tions such as these ought not to last an hour longer than the necessity which led to their being imposed and endured.Two Liberal PrinciplesAnd this suggests to me some considerations of a general character, which, as Liberals, we ought to keep steadily in view in all the processes of after-war reconstruction. There are two principles for which Liberals have always fought, and which will be just as vital to the healthy development of the nation in the future as they have been in the past. The first is that Liberty is a good thing in itself and for itself. Without it, you can never provide that equality of opportunity, which is the foundation of social justice, and the only means by which a nation can make the best use, in the interests of all, of its human resources. Without it, you will never secure the free scope of personal initiative and self-development, which we Liberals believe to be just as essential in the domestic life of the country as, in this war, we have declared it to be in the international domain. The restoration of liberty, complete, unfettered, and at the earliest possible moment, is, in our view, the gateway of the future.There is a second principle which runs through and connects a hundred Liberal causes, on which I have often insisted as your leader in days gone by - the subordination of special interests and the privileges of particular classes to the general good. You will find that that, too, has practical applications in the work of reconstruction. Negatively, it rules out all attempts at setting up the ascendancy - even though draped under democratic disguises - of any new class with special rights and claims of its own. Positively, it indicates the expediency, not indeed of anything in the nature of a centralised direction of industry - we have before our eyes beacons which ought to warn us off that track - but of keeping under control in the common interest, to avoid the risks of monopoly, and to safeguard social exigencies, such enter­prises (I give them only as samples) as those which deal with transit, the supply of light and power, and the production and consumption of intoxicating drink. The principle is plain, though there will always be room in a party of free thought like our own for divergence as to, the limits at any given time of its application.Free Trade in the WarThere is another domain in which both these prin­ciples come into play and in which there are abundant signs that we may have to defend them against invasion and attack. I refer to International Trade. I have read with satisfaction and with complete agreement your Resolution on Free Trade. Talk of preparation for war! Under our system of Free Trade, which secured for us a constant influx of the food and raw material we needed, we had become the carriers and bankers, the clearing\u2011house and the financial centre of the whole world. I spoke a few moments ago of the supreme services rendered by the Navy. But where would the Allied cause have been without our merchant ships? How, without those ships, could even the resources of America in men and material have been made, as they have been this year, effectively available? And, as every one knows who has studied the facts, it is no exaggeration to say that, but for the stability and resourcefulness of our financial system, our Allies could not possibly have been equipped to supply their own needs, and to sustain the unexampled strain of the conflict. Free Trade has enabled us to play a dominating part in the whole course of this war.We are told, I know, that the war has shown that in these matters we have much to learn and still more to unlearn. Some of our would-be instructors seem to think that the best way of keeping us up to date is by the reproduction of arguments that were obsolete and fallacies that were exploded, more than fifty years ago. We have never preached - I never have, and I have stood on as many Free Trade platforms as probably any man in this country - Free Trade as an abstract or absolute doctrine. We have always been content with the more modest and more relevant proposition that, for a country in the geographical and economic situation of our own, it is a demonstrable necessity. And there is nothing whatever in the experience of the war that tends in any way to the conclusion that, after peace, we shall be better off by any system of Tariffs, preferential or differential, punitive or prohibitive.Liberals and Imperial UnityWe Liberals are as much concerned as any body of men or women can be to strengthen the ties which unite our Empire, an Empire unique in history, existing and held together because, alone among empires, it combines a common loyalty and fraternity with complete local au­tonomy. We should never dream, not a man among us, of seeking to enforce upon any of our great Dominions fiscal arrangements which were felt by its people to be inconsistent with their own richest and fullest economic development. And the Dominions in turn, as we know from declarations of their responsible statesmen, would never dream of interfering, directly or indirectly, with the fiscal policy of the Mother Country. There are many ways - as is shown in the admirable Report of the Royal Commission on Dominions Trade - in which the aspirations felt throughout the Empire for closer indus­trial relations, and for a better and fuller organisation of its vast and varied resources, could be given concrete shape with practically universal consent. For that pur­pose, among many others, we ought to welcome the more frequent and intimate interchange of counsel between statesmen of the Dominions and our own.Key IndustriesNor, again, in this connection are we, as your Reso­lutions show, insensible to the risks, the possible risks, to national security of dependence for some essential industries upon foreign sources of supply. But the proper way of providing the required safeguards is not by tariffs, which are the simplest and surest road to private profiteering, but by the State giving direct help and encouragement, in such a form, and upon such terms, that, while the necessary quantum of production at home is secured, the resulting gain goes not into the pockets of individuals but into the coffers of the community.The Economic BoycottA great deal of loose language is used in regard to what is called \u2018the economic boycott,\u2019 and the so-called Paris Resolutions are sometimes twisted to a purpose for which they were never intended. An economic boycott is a perfectly legitimate, and may be the most effective available weapon, whether of offence or defence, for a belligerent State. It may be expedient and even neces­sary to employ it - I should certainly not hesitate to see it employed - for the purpose of obtaining just terms and a lasting peace. It may well, too, form a part of the armoury by which a League of Nations can enforce the common will against some refractory or aggressive State or group of States. But to use it as a method of con­ducting guerrilla operations, after war is over, would be wholly inconsistent with what I have said about the requisites of a clean peace.Finance: The War DebtI will say a word, and only a word - I don\u2019t want unduly to tax your patience - on one particular aspect of the post-war problem which in a sense overshadows all the others. I mean National Finance. I dealt with the matter at some length when addressing your Council at Derby last March. Let us see what the situation will be.Even if the war comes to an end in the current financial year, our gross debt will amount to little less than 8,000 millions. If you add to the charge, for interest alone on that colossal sum, the pre-war expenditure of about 200 millions, the new items, the necessity of which we all acknowledge - pensions and allowances, education, health, housing, and other indispensable social services - you will reach a total annual burden surpassing our power of apprehension and almost of imagination.The first duty of the country will be to lighten as rapidly as may be the load of the deadweight debt. We here have not a bad record in that matter. When I took office in Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman\u2019s Government in December 1905, I had to face what in those Lilliputian days seemed the vast addition to the National Debt result­ing from the Boer War. During the three years or thereabouts that I was Chancellor of the Exchequer I paid off, out of taxation and savings, the sum of 41 millions, or at a rate on the total capital of the then National Debt of 22 per cent per annum. What was important then is not only important but essential now.Two Ways Only of Meeting ItThere are two ways, and two ways only, in which it can be done: in the first place, by adding to the national production of wealth through increased efficiency in the application of capital and labour; and secondly, by a more equitable adjustment of the burden of taxation on the basis of relative ability to bear it.Health and Well-being of the PeopleTwo subjects or groups of subjects, both vital to reconstruction, still remain. There is one group, a most important one, which concerns the health and the homes of the nation, the care and education of children and young people, and the provision for those who, through disability or old age, have fallen out of the ranks of industry. I do not agree with the statement that in regard to these matters, particularly as to housing and to public health, we are behind the other great countries of Europe. On the contrary, I believe that we are still well ahead of them, thanks to the sustained efforts of Parliament for nearly fifty years and the ever-growing energy and sympathy both of local authorities and private philanthropy. Diseases which were the scourge of the population have been almost stamped out; sanitation in all its forms has advanced in a degree that can be hardly measured; and our educational system, improved and supplemented, as I am glad to think it will be under Mr. Fisher\u2019s Act of the present year, would have seemed to our grandfathers the wildest and most extravagant of Socialistic experiments.Housing and Old-age PensionsBut though we may be ahead of others, we are by no means abreast of our own duties and responsibilities. I take Housing. It is estimated that when the war is over something like 400,000 new houses ought to be built, without taking into account the heavy arrears in repairing those which exist, and in demolishing and clearing away both urban and rural slums. All this has got to he made good, and without delay, by the co-operation of central and local activity. And when we remember the rise produced by war conditions both in cost of building and in rate of interest, we have here a new head of expenditure, which, heavy as it promises to be, we are bound to undertake as the best form of national insurance.Let me add in regard to Old-age Pensions, which I had the honour and the privilege of incorporating as part of the last Budget I introduced in the House of Commons, that, after ten years\u2019 experience, admirable as in most ways has been the working of that system - it is the most economical of all our services in ad­ministration by a long way - I think the time has come when we might well have an authoritative inquiry into the whole matter, particularly in regard to the position of the thrifty poor.A National MinimumIn this, and indeed in every chapter of Reconstruction, I should be prepared to adopt for myself and to recom­mend to my friends as a convenient and appropriate watchword and summary the formula of a National Minimum. In concrete terms, I understand that to mean that we ought not to be content, until every British citizen, man, woman, and child, has in possession or within reach a standard of existence, physical, intel­lectual, moral, social, which makes life worth living, and not only does not block but opens the road to its best and highest possibilities.Capital and LabourThe same idea of a National Minimum ought to inspire and direct the inevitable and much-needed reconstruction of the relations between capital and labour. I observe that you have here in your Resolution - and rightly as I think - taken the Whitley Report as the point of departure. Let me summarise in two or three sentences what I think ought to be our aim. We must provide, first, by means of the machinery of Industrial Councils and Trade Boards a minimum wage. We must provide, next, for shorter hours, especially in the more arduous industries, for definite and regular holidays, and for a proper system of superannuation. Lastly, there is the most urgent and most difficult problem of all: unemployment. There is no task on which the State could more fruitfully expend its thought and energy than the prevention of unemployment, which means the discouragement of slack work, and, what is perhaps still more important, the banishment from the lives of the workers of the spectre of insecurity.A Question for the DemocraciesIt is only on those lines that the mass of our popula­tion can be secured in the possession of adequate facilities for home life, and of the leisure which it needs for educa­tional progress and for free human development. I might easily enlarge my survey and extend my topics and yet leave a large part of the field of reconstruction not only uncovered, but untouched. But I will, in concluding, ask permission to leave with you one guiding thought. The great question for the democracies of today is how to reconcile, both in separate societies and in the larger family of nations, the claims of free self-develop­ment with the restraints and obligations, which are needed for the safeguard of common interests, and for the attainment of common ideals. This war, with all its tragedies of suffering and sacrifice, is purifying and cleansing the atmosphere. We can neither go back to the past, nor rest in the present; but out of the lessons and the experience of both we may build up a worthier fabric for the future of humanity.

aVIt is the greatest possible gratification to me to find myself once more addressing the annual meeting of these great representative Liberal Associations. The Chairman has used language in regard to myself and to my past which, particularly having regard to the evident acknowledgment it pro­voked from you, touches me deeply. Public life is at all times an arduous and a difficult pursuit. It has its ups and downs; it has its successes and its failures; it has, now and again, the fruition of long-delayed hopes, and, perhaps more often, the postponement of ideals which one had hoped had been possible to attain.But there is one thing which, to a man - I don\u2019t care to what Party he belongs - who pursues public life in this country in accord­ance with the best traditions of our historic past, is compensation for failures, is solace for disappointments and gives an added pleasure and intensity to success. What is that thing? It is that through­out it all, he has been able to secure and retain the confidence, loyalty, and trust of those with whom he is working.The Chairman has tried to arouse by solicitations, and incentives, and suggestions the lurking old Adam which, I suppose, is to be found even in the most placable of mankind. I am not sure, before I have finished, you won\u2019t find some slight manifestations of that melancholy symptom of our fallen nature. In the meantime I will hold myself in such reserve as I can.Peace DangersNeed for the Restoration of EuropeIt is a little more than a year since I last had the opportunity of addressing the annual gathering of your Federation. It is a year which will be memorable in history, because it has witnessed the con­clusion of the greatest of all wars, and because, also, it has seen the assembling and the work of the Peace Conference, America sitting for the first time at the council chambers of Europe when a prolonged attempt was made to bring into their proper proportions, and to give their due results to, the effects of the war.It was a stupendous task, perhaps passing the wit of man, and while we may regard with satisfaction and with gratitude that many, at any rate, of the purposes for which we entered into the war have, for the time being, been attained, it requires only a modicum of vision and imagination to view the outlook now, a year after the Armistice was signed, with anything but a quiet mind.Peace After WarFor peace, ladies and gentlemen, is not merely a process of liquidation. It is, or ought to be, a new point of departure for the restarting, on better lines, of the renovated machinery of civilisation; and here we must all regretfully admit that there is so far little progress to record.The economic conditions of a large part of the world, and particularly of Central and Western Europe, are indescribably bad. You cannot get a new life on its legs in communities where the children - we are told something like three to three-and-a-half millions - are perishing, or on the verge of perishing, for the lack of milk; where even the hospitals are wanting drugs; where the work of production so urgently needed cannot be carried on because there is no coal and no raw materials, and where transport, both internal and external, is not only lamentably deficient, but prohibitively dear.A General Election Notion ExplodedI want particularly to emphasise at the moment that this condi­tion of things, lamentable as it is in itself, has its reactions elsewhere. The crude notion last December - it was much in fashion at the last General Election - that at the end of the war the victors would walk off with a huge indemnity in their pockets while the vanquished were to be penned up for a probationary period in economic isolation - that notion, so serviceable for electioneering purposes, has in the last year been rudely exploded.The primary need of the world at this moment is, as we all know, to get to work again, each area devoting itself to those forms of production for which it has the greatest natural or acquired facilities, with the full recognition of the interdependence of all upon each, and each upon all. That is Free Trade expressed in inter­national terms and adapted to existing conditions. To bring that about was the primary duty of those Powers who, on the victorious termination of the war, were allied and associated in the war.Russia: The Duty of BritainAnd I must add, if you turn from the economic to the political outlook, it is almost equally overclouded. The situation on the shores of the Adriatic is grave and perilous. The young States which have either been born again or born for the first time, are struggling with the hazards of a storm-beaten and unsheltered infancy, and behind and over them all, there hangs the problem of the future of Russia.We can be thankful - I, at any rate, am devoutly thankful - that after many vacillations, after what I regard as the fruitless expenditure of vast sums drawn from the British taxpayer, which our Exchequer can ill afford to waste, we have at last withdrawn - I hope I am right in saying - by sea as well as on land from any participation in her domestic and internal struggle.We can never forget - we never ought to forget - the magnificent and devoted service which Russia rendered in the early years of the war for the cause of freedom. It is not for us - I say it deliberately - it is not for us or for any outsider to prescribe for her the lines of her self-development. With her enormous natural resources, both in material and men, she must always be one of the dominating factors in the world.Our one and only interest is to see her - whatever may be the ultimate form of her government - a free and friendly State, and we shall best contribute to that end not by taking sides, openly or in disguise, in her internal struggles, but by seizing and going out to meet every opening towards appeasement and the return of normal national life.The Government, I regret to say, have spoken on these matters with uncertain and discordant voices, but I am sure that in what I have said just now I am giving voice to the predominant, the practically unanimous, judgment of the Liberal Party.America And The League Of NationsOne word more before I pass from these external matters. By far the most hopeful, and, as many of us believe, the most fruitful, result of the Paris Conference was the accession of all the States which were there to the solemn covenant which goes by the name of the League of Nations. But here again the prospect is for the moment uncertain. In America there are great difficulties in accepting and in embodying the Paris Covenant. Ladies and gentlemen, it is not for us to transmit homilies or sarcasms to our friends across the water; they are the best judges of their own affairs. They are wedded by a long tradition to the Monroe doctrine which vetoes the interference of Europe in purely American affairs. All these things are matters they have to consider, and as I venture to do on behalf of the Liberals of this country, we can only express unobtrusively, but with great emphasis and with full conviction, our hope that as America - the United States of America - has played a splendid, disinterested, and in some respects a decisive part in this great war, so she may feel that the obligation arising from spontaneous service rendered to the cause of humanity and of freedom may lead her to undertake her share in the responsibilities of the League of Nations.Home PoliticsExperiment of Governing by CoalitionNow let us come nearer home. The outstanding feature of our domestic politics during the last twelve months has been the experi­ment of governing the country by a Tory-Liberal Coalition. Those who declined, as I did - and who still decline, as I do - to be parties to it, and who foresaw, as we did, and protested themselves against the inevitable consequences, suffered a severe electoral reverse. The Independent Liberals who went to the new House of Commons were in numbers a mere remnant, but a remnant which, under the resourceful and sagacious leadership of my right hon. friend, Sir Donald Maclean, has earned for itself a most honourable place in the annals of free Liberalism.But, ladies and gentlemen, the question I want to put is this: How does that election and the verdict of which that election was the vehicle, look now, after more than twelve months\u2019 experience? How, above all, does it present itself to Liberals?An Impossible CompromiseI remember when I was a boy there was a famous essay or lecture by an eminent Nonconformist divine which had the title, \u2018Is it possible to make the best of both worlds?\u2019 At this distance of time I am afraid my memory does not enable me to say whether he answered the question in the affirmative or in the negative, or, like a judicious theologian, arrived at a compromise between the two.But there is a kindred question which sometimes suggests itself to me, and which I am sure must have exercised a good many of my Liberal friends. It is this: Is it possible to make the best of both parties?We read very often, almost every day now, of great amalgama­tions in the industrial and financial world, so many shares of one company exchanged for so many shares in another company which has absorbed the first. I am very much afraid that some of my Liberal friends who went into the great amalgamation in December last will find that for every Liberal share they contributed they received two Tory shares in exchange.A Government That Dare Not Give a LeadI won\u2019t enlarge on minor points. I might say something on the deplorable flaccidity with which, under the conditions of Coalition life, questions of the gravest moment are almost habitually thrown on the floor of the House of Commons by a Government which dare not announce a policy or give a lead of its own. We have seen that recourse during the last few weeks in the case the peculiarly discreditable case - of the Aliens Bill, in the case the other day of the continuance of the unemployment dole, and apparently we are going to see it again next week in the case of Premium Bonds.If ever there was a question on which the Government ought to have a mind and have the courage to declare and give effect to its mind, it is the case of the proposal, which I don\u2019t hesitate to condemn as an old financier myself, as the attempt to introduce, contrary to our best and finest traditions, the spirit of gambling. I venture to predict, with confidence, that it will be eventually, from the practical point of view, the greatest failure and frost which has ever been known.Nor can I dwell for more than a moment on the extraordinary dealings of the Government with the question of housing. They have been at it 12 months, and we are told now that on the largest figure there are 124 houses brought into habitable existence. Meanwhile we have had a tornado of recriminations between the responsible Ministers - deep calling to deep - Lord Downham to Dr. Addison, Dr. Addison to Lord Downham - with the result that the one concrete proposal now left is the crude suggestion that you are to dump down £150 for every house completed.As to finance, I have had several opportunities during the autumn of explaining my view of the expedients made by the Government. We have seen gross miscalculations in revenue, expenditure, and deficit. We have seen little pinchbeck preferences which took in none of us, and least of all our shrewd fellow subjects in the Dominions.We have seen absolute failure to deal with the two most urgent financial dangers, the extent of the floating debt and our inflated currency.Tragedy And FarceThe Chancellor\u2019s Blind Financial PolicyWe have seen an alternation on the Parliamentary stage of tragedy and farce; we have seen, to put it shortly, a total absence of anything like range of vision, firmness of touch and fertility of resource, and the net result is that the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Government, of whom he is the mouthpiece, have nothing to give us but a blind, bland confidence that somehow, somewhere or another something will turn up.I pass all these things by because I want, during the short time I am going to address you, to deal with two matters which are even more vital to us as Liberals, because in both fundamental Liberal principles are at stake. The first is the case of Ireland.It is a commonplace of historians that the history of the relation between these two islands is a long record of misunder­standing and of missed opportunity, but in the whole of that long record there has surely been nothing more fatuous and more futile than the dealings of the Coalition Government with Ireland during the last two years. Memories are short; people\u2019s interests shift rapidly, so let me in two or three sentences recall the history to you.IrelandA Tragedy of Missed OpportunitiesIn March last year a representative body, the Irish Convention, made its report. It was not a unanimous report, but was made by a Convention to which the great Irish patriot, Mr. John Redmond, devoted the last months of his life, and it developed a greater measure of actual agreement, and, still more, a faculty of free and frank give-and-take unknown in the previous history of Ireland. What happened? The Government seized the opportunity for a blunder, and a blunder of the most colossal kind. On the very morrow of the presentation of that report, when the omens - I have watched this matter for thirty years, and I say it deliberately - when the omens for a fair, equitable, and agreed settlement of the Irish problem were more favourable than they have been in the lifetime of anyone here.On the morrow of that report they proposed to apply military conscription to Ireland. That proposal was bitterly resented and strongly opposed by the Constitutional Nationalist Party. I myself - I take no credit for prescience in the matter - I myself warned them of its inevitable consequences. The Government, at the same time, pledged themselves to bring in a Self-Government Bill and to resign if the House of Lords failed to pass it.That was in March and April of 1918. What followed? The Conscription Bill was pushed through and became law, although no attempt has been made to enforce it. The Self-Government Bill was put on one side and up to this moment has never seen the light of day. Military government, enforced by an Army of Occupation, was set up in Ireland, and the office of Lord-Lieutenant was entrusted to a Field-Marshal who, so far as the world knows, has not any qualifications for a most delicate and responsible post except such distinction as he may have won on the battlefield.The hopes raised by the Convention were ruthlessly wrecked. The constitutional party - the party of Mr. Redmond and Mr. Dillon - had during the sitting of the Convention been gradually, but surely - people have forgotten this - recovering its authority in Ireland. In these months no fewer than three by-elections were won from the Sinn Fein camp, but now it was hopelessly discredited in the eyes of its Nationalist constituents, and at the General Election in December was swept out of Parliamentary existence. Sinn Fein was allowed to become great by this deliberate blundering and miscalculation, and worse than that, Sinn Fein was allowed to become the dominant factor in Irish national life. That was the stage we had reached at the time of the General Election of last year. Another year has passed without any attempt to remedy the broken promises of the Government. While we have been joining in Paris in giving free self-determination to Poles, to Czecho-Slavs, to Jugo-Slavs, to Arabs, and to Armenians, and bringing into existence a League of Nations for the world at large, we have at the same time the unspeakable humiliation of witnessing, and letting the whole world witness, close to our own doors our fellow subjects in Ireland the daily victims of the tragi-comedy of a crudely and clumsily administered system of military law.\u2018Back to Coercion\u2019Now, by way of climax, while we are officially informed that a Cabinet Committee with a strong infusion of Ulster Covenanters is hammering out a still undiscovered scheme of up-to-date Home Rule, our almost exhausted faculty of amazement and indignation receives a further shock in the announcement of the Proclamation of Sinn Fein.In a word, we are back to the worst days of coercion - coercion unveiled and unashamed. What a letter of introduction to a Home Rule Bill! By whom is it done? That is the question which we have got to answer. It is done by a Liberal Prime Minister, by a Liberal Chief Secretary, and by a Liberal Home Secretary. It is done in a Cabinet in which three out of five of the Secretaries of State are Liberals; and the Minister of Education who, if not the parent, is to wheel the perambulator of this new bantling, is also a Liberal.A Lead to LiberalismI speak strongly on these matters. (Great cheering.) All my political life has been given to the cause of Ireland. (A Voice: \u2018Give us a lead.\u2019) I am trying to give you a lead. I say to you this - You, the National Liberal Federation, and that great body of Liberals whom you represent in every part of this kingdom - if Liberalism and the Liberal Party is going to tolerate or condone this betrayal of their past traditions, they will deserve the disaster which will certainly be their doom.Was it for this that Mr. Gladstone gave the labours and sacrifice of his heroic old age? Was it for this, to come later down, that under my leadership you fought and vanquished, after two General Elections, the obstructive power of the House of Lords? Let us be thankful that we took hostages from fortune.Through the operation of the Parliament Act we put the Home Rule Bill on the Statute Book, and in that fact we have at this moment the best, indeed the only security that the cause for which our party laboured for thirty years shall not founder among the rocks and shoals of the Coalition.Anti-Dumping Bill: The Paris Resolutions ExaminedI pass for two or three minutes to another betrayal. I use plain language. It is another betrayal, equally flagrant, in that portentous birth of this ill-assorted union, the Anti-Dumping Bill. That is a measure on which I should feel it difficult to speak seriously, so full is it of the very genius of topsy-turvydom, were it not that it is in direct and irreconcilable contradiction to the fundamental principles, not only the fiscal, but the political and constitutional principles, of the Liberal faith.We could spend the whole afternoon pleasantly and not unprofit­ably in analysing its manifold and multiform absurdities. But as many of you have to catch your trains I must be content with two or three salient points.Please let me say by way of parenthesis that any attempt to found this Bill on the so-called Paris Resolutions of 1916 is due to one of two things - either ignorance or disingenuousness. Many people talk or write about these Resolutions, but very few take the trouble to read, and fewer still to study them.I will quote - not for the first time - what I said in Parliament in 1916 when these resolutions came under discussion. I pointed out they were a reply to a challenge thrown down by Austria and Germany earlier in the year at a conference in Vienna, which aimed at establishing as a condition of their policy at and after the conclusion of the war the complete economic predominance of Germany and Austria.The preamble to the Paris Resolutions shows that that is the case. The preamble, which recites that aggressive intention, is the keynote of the whole proceedings, and emphasises the fact that the view of the delegates to the conference was that their deliberations were, as I have said, defensive and not offensive. It was a defensive proceeding from first to last. Each Ally was left with a free hand to maintain liberty of action and have regard to the principles which dominated its economic policy. And I added that I was then speaking as head of the Coalition Government.I said then, \u2018I carried on the fight for Free Trade, and I think I might fairly say as strongly as any man in this country, for the best part of ten years. If I did not believe in it I should not be standing here today, and in asking the House to sanction the policy of the Government to approve this resolution I believe we are left free to pursue the policy most fitted to our economic needs and did not surrender any conviction I ever held.\u2019I need not say, ladies and gentlemen, that the state of things contemplated by the preamble to the Paris Resolutions of continued aggressive economic war after and at the conclusion of the military war by Germany and Austria against this country has not arisen, and is not in the least degree likely to arise. Even if it did, it is clear from the declaration of myself, we should be left perfectly free to pursue our own policy based upon our well-established fiscal lines.The Bill Itself: A Protectionist DemandLet us come to the Bill itself. It is a curious production: it is just the kind of thing you might expect from a Coalition in which neither party desires to show its own hand, and has to arrange something which neither can pretend to reject. This Bill has been devised to satisfy what is in substance and effect a Protectionist demand - I say that deliberately - without having recourse to what to Liberal ears is the unpopular and discredited word Tariff. That that is its reason as well as its meaning becomes clearer day by day. It is little less obnoxious to the Tariff Reformers than it is to Free Traders. It professes to be an Anti-Dumping Bill.What is dumping? I see that in a speech in which I referred to the subject I said that I had been looking in the Oxford Dictionary for a definition of Dumping. I discovered that there is a word which is defined as \u2018to throw down in a lump or mass, to deposit,\u2019 the word being properly applied to refuse or rubbish.No Free Trader has ever contended that his creed required him to sit still with folded arms in face - if such a thing could happen - of concerted and hostile action from abroad, aimed at the destruction of a native industry. Free Traders are not Fiscal Quakers or Quietists. But, as I have pointed out repeatedly - I took an active part in the old fiscal conference conducted by people who understood the words they were using and the issues at stake - I pointed out that, so far as our experience goes, in the first place there has never been a provable case on any considerable scale of dumping, that would satisfy that definition; in the second place, if there had, such dumping is always in the long run suicidal and defeats itself; and in the third and most important place, the measures which you attempt to take - defensive, remedial, or retaliatory - in the long run do you more harm than the dumping against which they are directed.Rings and TrustsDanger that Prices may be InflatedBut there is a new definition of dumping in this Bill which has never been attempted by an anti-dumper of even the most extreme type before. It proposes to define as dumping the sale of goods here or - (put in another way) - the purchase by Englishmen of goods coming from abroad at prices below those which the vendor has been able to extract from his own countrymen. If this is the definition of dumping, we in this country are the Arch-dumpers of the world; for a large part of our overseas trade has been due to that very practice. And do you suppose if you are going to penalise so-called dumpers sending their goods in here at lower prices than they charge their fellow countrymen, do you suppose that you are not going tohave retaliation? And who will suffer most in the long run? Undoubtedly ourselves.  But let us carry the thing a good deal further than that, because I want all Liberals to realise what this thing actually means. The advantage - a great advantage - to the British purchaser which the lower price would give him is to be withheld in regard to a number of commodities - some of them raw material, such as steel billets and plates, some of them food, such as sugar.  The first result will be to carry on and aggravate the rise of prices here at home, which is one of the worst and most dangerous features of our existing economic conditions. A second result would be, it would encourage rings and combinations - one of the great dangers of these days in view of our economic situation - it would encourage rings and combinations to put up their prices when by so doing they could stave off competition from abroad.Further, it is not only on fiscal but on political and constitutional grounds that we regard this Bill as a fatal infraction of fundamental Liberal principles. A large part of the import trade of the country will be put under the control of a Board of Trade committee, officials, and Members of Parliament. They are to be allowed - a year ago I should not have thought it credible that I should be addressing an audience on this point - this irresponsible body is to be allowed to charge a fee, or, in other words, to impose an import duty. It is not fixed - it is not declared beforehand. It varies with what they consider to be the difference between the selling price abroad and the selling price here, and, of course, it will be affected by the condition of the foreign exchange.Gentlemen, I would far rather have a tariff - I say it deliberately as a Free Trader - than any such arrangement as that. Why? With a tariff you know where you are. But here, with this nebulous, floating, indeterminate condition of things dependent for the decisions given from time to time by a body not responsible to Parliament, and in the appointment of which the public had no voice, no forward contract could possibly be placed, because you would have, in the first place, the uncertainty as to whether or not the selling price would rise or fall; and next, still greater uncertainty as to how a Government department would determine that question.Question of ControlA Humorous Tilt at the Geddes BrothersThe House of Commons, which has hitherto been the ultimate, supreme and sovereign taxing power of the country, is to be replaced by this departmental committee, and the trade of the country is to be put in a condition of permanent uncertainty and doubt.If you think these are abstract considerations, their practical importance may be measured by some of our recent experiences. This apparatus would be put in the hands of practically the Board of Trade, and the President of the Board of Trade is, as you know, a distinguished gentleman, Sir Auckland Geddes.The other day, wanting something to read when I went to bed, I happened to take down from my shelves, almost at random, one of the Waverley novels and it turned out to be that admirable romance, Redgauntlet. I don\u2019t know whether you remember the hero, at an early stage of his adventures, finds himself at the house of an excellent Quaker who bore the name of Joshua Geddes. I think it was Sharon Grange, and when he entered the parlour the hero observed there had once been an armorial escutcheon over the fireplace, but it had been defaced and nothing was left but the pious motto, \u2018Trust in God.\u2019 And he said to his Quaker host it was a pity the arms had been defaced.A Page from RedgauntletI will just read you what Joshua Geddes said in reply - he said: \u2018My ancestors were renowned among the ravenous and bloodthirsty men who then dwelt in this vexed country; and so much were they famed for successful freebooting, robbery, and bloodshed, that they are said to have been called Geddes, as likening them to the fish called a Jack, Pike, or Luce, and in our country tongue a Ged - a goodly distinction truly for Christian men! Yet did they paint this shark of the fresh waters upon their shields, and these profane priests of a wicked idolatory, the empty boasters called heralds, who make engraven images of fishes, fowls, and four-footed beasts, that men may fall down and worship them, assigned the Ged for the device and escutcheon of my fathers, and hewed it over their chimneys, and placed it above their tombs; and the men were elated in mind, and became yet more Ged-like, slaying, leading into captivity, and dividing the spoil.\u2019Well, ladies and gentlemen, I don\u2019t know whether the President of the Board of Trade and his distinguished brother have replaced the family escutcheon or whether they are content, as I hope they are, with the simple and unadorned piety of the family motto. Be on your guard against Gedding; and I say so not without reason, because we have had - I was about to remind you before I made this digression - we have had a very recent and poignant experience in the matter of control of coal.You all remember the sudden, the unlooked-for, the uncalled-for increase of 6s. a ton; and it is still fresh in our memories now, the equally sudden and unlooked-for remission of 10s. a ton for the domestic as distinct from the trade consumer. And there are uncharitable people, the world unfortunately abounds in such, uncharitable enough to suggest that there was a flavour of electioneering in it. And if that happened, as it did happen in the case of coal, just consider what will be the case when you place in the same hands subjects of far more complicated possibilities, of all sorts of influence, of trade intrigue, of the promotion of interests of this particular industry or that, the whole of the import trade of the country, and allow a department with this record to play battledore and shuttlecock with it.A Blow to Free TradeI repeat here, the question I asked you a few moments ago in regard to Ireland. This is a blow not only at the principle of Free Trade in its technical sense, but, what is far more important, at Freedom of Trade in its largest and widest significance. The British trader is to be compelled to go cap in hand to a Government Depart­ment to sue for liberty on payment of a fee to import what the consumer needs.Ladies and gentlemen, has Liberalism come to that? I hope not. If it has, all I can say is this; that it is high time that it sold off the small, slender remnants of its goodwill, that it put up the shutters, and changed its name.Message to LiberalsDecide Now: You Cannot Serve Two MastersNow I have only one more word to say. We live in bewildering times. According to the latest message of science, it would seem that infinity itself may after all be only a vicious circle; but nothing has happened, and nothing will happen, to invalidate the plain maxims of commonsense and political honesty, and one of those maxims is that you cannot serve two masters. (\u2018We serve Mr. Asquith, not Lloyd George.\u2019) No, it is not a question of persons, but a question of principles.You cannot serve two masters, and my message today, and if I mistake not the temper and spirit of this great gathering it is your message also, to all Liberals from top to bottom is to cut themselves loose before it is too late from these enfeebling and enslaving bonds. You have shown in the resolutions you have been passing during these last two days some of the great tasks which lie before us, and the spirit in which they ought by Liberals to be confronted.We are not - I have said it before, I repeat it today, and I shall say it again - we are not, and we do not intend to be, a wing either of the Tory or Labour Parties. We are Liberals carrying on the traditions and the policy of a great historic party, never more needed than it is today. And we call upon our fellow Liberals throughout the length and breadth of these kingdoms - everywhere to cut themselves free and to join us in our march.

aVI am heartily glad to find myself once more here in Bradford, and as the invited guest of our great independent party organisation, the National Liberal Federation. It is almost exactly a year since I addressed your annual meeting in Birmingham. The horizon even then was overclouded, but I think I may say it was brightness itself compared with the outlook, both international and domestic, which we have to confront today.At the General Election of December, 1918, we were told that the problems of reconstruction, both at home and abroad, were of such a character that they could only satisfactorily be faced and solved by retaining and developing the machinery of the Coalition, to which, under the stress and for the purposes, and only for the purposes, of the war we had had to resort. The old party lines were for the time being, perhaps for an indefinite time, to be obliterated; the odd party spirit was to be exorcised as an evil influence until the time to come when the foundations of the New Jerusalem had been well and truly laid.\u2018Credulous Electors\u2019 DeludedThe credulous electors of that day, many of them exercising the vote for the first time - the credulous electors, I say, of that day - were deluded by those plausible sophistries, and they gave a free hand to the Coalition. What was the immediate result?The Irish Constitutional Nationalist Party was swept out of Parliamentary existence. The Free Liberals were reduced to a fragment of our old party representation - reduced to a condition in the House of Commons of impotence in point of numbers, though not, I am glad to say, in any sense impotent in fighting strength. All honour to Sir Donald Maclean and to those who, under his gallant leadership, held the fort in the darkest days of our party fortunes. The majority of the new House of Commons - and that remains the case today - was a Tory majority independent in its single strength of the combined vote of all other sections.The Government, in a word, so far as Parliament was con­cerned, was able to do practically what it liked. That was the immediate result of the General Election, and now, after two years, we are able to take stock of what have been its larger developments.The Financial SituationNow, for the purpose of what I am going to say to you this afternoon, I shall not attempt any general survey of the ground - it is too large and too wide an area to cover in a single speech - but I shall try to concentrate both my and your attention on the two most important, significant, and urgent aspects of the situation which we have reached.First of all, I must say a few words as to our economic and financial condition. I dealt with this matter in some detail in a speech I made two or three weeks ago, but I am going to ask you, for a moment or two, to focus your minds on the salient facts. The expenditure, the gross national expenditure of the country, is in this financial year between five and six times what it was in the year before the war. The taxation which is imposed for the purpose of meeting that expenditure is also between five and six times what it then was per head of the population. The cost of our fighting forces - two years, mind you, after actual or, at any rate, ostensible hostilities have ceased - is between three and four times what it was in the last year of peace before the war.Wasted MillionsThe annual surplus for principal and for interest on the National Debt and funded debt is half as much again as the whole expenditure of the country in the year before the war, and we have a floating debt - a thing then unknown, at any rate insignificant - that remains today after all the fumbling and futile expedients resorted to reduce it, at the appalling total of 1,300 millions sterling.Now, that is a summary of our financial situation. The fact that a large proportion of the increase in our expenditure is due directly, or indirectly, to the necessities of the war and the increased cost of living made two duties more than ever incum­bent upon the stewards of our finances - the Government of the day. What were those duties? The first was rigorously to eschew and repress new and costly adventures, and to accelerate by all practical means the opening out of the markets of the world. The first necessity of mankind when the war came to an end was that the continuous and growing destructive expendi­ture of the years of the war should come decisively and finally to an end.Costly Military AdventuresWhat, in fact, have we done? We have spent the best part of a year in financing, at the hands of the British taxpayer, military adventures in Russia, directed against the Bolshevist Government of that country, which from first to last have cost us certainly not less - I myself think a great deal more - than one hundred millions sterling - pure waste.In Mesopotamia, where we had promised that the Arabs should be established - where we had entered the country as emancipators, pacificators, missionaries for Arab autonomy - in Mesopotamia we have an army which, at this moment, amounts to over 100,000 men; which, when the Estimates were produced to Parliament this year, we were promised should be decreased by one-half, but which in fact - now in November - has been raised by more than one-half. What is it there for? There have been large and terrible casualties, both on the one side and the other. There has been an indefinite expansion and prolongation of our military and semi-military expenditure, and we seem as far as ever - I hope we are not further than ever - from persuad­ing the Arabs that we went there to enable the Arabs to govern themselves.Economic State of Central EuropeTake again the case of Poland. Since hostilities have ceased in that prolonged and disastrous encounter between Poland and Russia, we have not spent much in money - or in life - but that prolonged campaign might, in my opinion, as I have endea­voured to say in the House of Commons and elsewhere, have well been averted. The postponement which has resulted from it of anything in the nature of economic re-establishment and the opening of free markets in the whole of Central Europe, might have been prevented if we had taken the Covenant of the League of Nations to heart, and if we had insisted - as we ought to and could have insisted - if we had made our will and authority felt at the moment, with conscientiousness - in having those matters referred at the first moment to the arbitrament of that great international authority.Some people talk a great deal, but not so much as they did at the General Election, about reparations and indemnities. We all agree that for many of the wrongs which were done - wanton and wicked wrongs - by our late enemies in Belgium, and in the North of France and elsewhere, reparation is needed, and ought to be forthcoming. But there again, if our councils had been presided over by wise and far-seeing statesmanship, we should not have left for months, and indeed now for years, the burden, indefinite in duration and amount, hanging around the necks of those vast populations. We should have fixed the sum; we should have prescribed, I won\u2019t say upon generous, but upon reasonable terms, the length of time over which it was to be extended, and we should have been in a far better position than we are now to get any reparation at all.The Economic BarriersEven more important than that, we ought to have insisted, as we could have insisted from the first, not as a matter of philanthropy or of idealism, but as a matter of pure business, that the economic barriers between all these different countries should be broken down, and that we, and the rest of the world, America and Europe, should - as they might have done twelve months ago - establish a free, unrestricted, unimpeded current of commercial and business intercourse. That is one aspect of the matter, what I might call the external and international aspect.To come nearer home - if those gigantic new obligations which we have incurred were to be met adequately it could be only in one way. We have reached, or very nearly reached, the limit of taxation. We have reached, or very nearly reached, the limit of possible borrowing. And that being the case, every con­sideration of prudence and of business prescribed that we should ruthlessly cut dawn unnecessary domestic expenditure. What have we done in fact?Results of Government ControlI am not going this afternoon into an analysis of detail. We have created new Ministries, we have overstaffed old Ministries - we have an unexampled establishment of persons directly or indirectly in the service of the State. So much so, that at this moment there are, for the purposes of our civil and military administration - I am not talking of soldiers and sailors; I am talking of the actual working administration - there are 90,000 men more in the employ of the State than there were when war broke out.All that results from the continuance - which ceased to be necessary when the conditions of the war had disappeared - continuance of Government control over the industries of the country. And what has been the result? Look around you. Unemployment is growing in every direction. The swollen national expenditure met out of taxation means an increased cost of production, not only of the necessaries of life, but of all the great commodities in which we deal. We have short time - you have it here in Bradford - we know it in all the great industrial centres of the country. The capital which is needed for the maintenance of existing and the development of new industries is not forthcoming. The men who have become accustomed - as they did become accustomed during the war - to trade on borrowed money, find that they are at the end of their tether.Retrenchment a Liberal PlankThey find that credit is drying up, and sooner or later we shall have to face this and to cut our losses. I am not sure if any class in the community is sufficiently impressed with the gravity of that situation, but I am perfectly sure that the Government is not. Look at the Liberal Party in the House of Commons. They are a small and relatively impotent band, and superiority in debate counts for nothing in the Assembly. To sum up this aspect of the matter, the first piece of advice I venture to give to the National Liberal Federation, and to those great organisations throughout the country of which it is the focus and centre, is that they should throw all their energies into this campaign. Make retrenchment, as it was in the old days, one of the great planks of the Liberal platform.The Case of IrelandNow I come to another, and, in my judgment, in some ways an even more urgent aspect of our domestic situation. I refer to the case of Ireland. In the last two years things in Ireland have gone from bad to worse. There was a fateful and - alas! - a decisive moment when a good judgment might have been fruitful of the most beneficent results, but when, unhappily, a bad judgment was taken - I mean the morrow of the report of the Irish Convention. For the first time in the history of our relations with that country there seemed to be a real, genuine, hopeful, even a fruit­ful prospect of reconciliation upon lines of agreement.The Coalition Government, with short-sightedness - nay, I would use a stronger expression, with fatuity - selected that very moment to seek to impose on Ireland compulsory military service. It was no use - it did nothing for the successful prosecution of the war. It was accompanied by a promise of a large measure of extended self-government, and while the coercive proposals took their place on the Statute Book - where they remained a dead letter - that promise of self-government was delayed for months and months, for the best part of two years. When finally an attempt was made to redeem it, it was made in a form which the Irish nation with unanimity repudiated and condemned. What is the situation as regards Irish self-government today?The Home Rule BillThe Home Rule Act of 1914, for the attainment of which we of the Liberal Party suffered exclusion from office and power for years - for which we fought, first under Mr. Gladstone, then under Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, and subsequently under my own leadership, under which we passed the Parliament Act - is now about to be repealed, and for it is to be substituted, as the House of Lords appears to have decided yesterday, a scheme which no one in Ireland demands; for which only last week no single Irish member in the House of Commons - not even those who are members of the Government - could be induced to vote; and under which three-fourths of Ireland, in area and population, are going to be reduced (for everybody knows they will not work it and will not accept it) to the status of a Crown Colony and governed by the official Executive.That shows the worthlessness of what I may call the remedial side of the Coalition policy. Meanwhile, what is going on? Ireland is being given up, has been given up for the best part of six months, to the worst excesses of civil war. The Chief Secretary (Sir Hamar Greenwood) two or three nights ago ended up a speech in defence of the Government policy with this declaration: \u2018The question is, as it appears to me, \u201cWho is for Ireland and the Empire, and who is for the assassins?\u201d\u2019 A more insolent piece of rodomontade never in my memory pro­ceeded from the mouth of any responsible Minister. Who is he? A Liberal? (A Voice: \u2018A coward.\u2019) He is returned, at any rate, as a Liberal for an English constituency. Who is he to say to you and me who are carrying on what he has deserted - the great Gladstonian tradition - who is he to charge us with sympathy with the assassins? The assassins! The assassins - ­ah! Is that a charge which can he made from one side without reflecting on the other?What is the Liberal Attitude? What is the Liberal attitude in regard to this matter? To say that we have any sympathy with, or any disposition to condone the foul and cowardly attacks on the police and the military, such as those which culminated in the brutal murders last Sunday in Dublin - to say that you and I, or those whom we represent in the country, have anything to say, I won\u2019t say in sympathy, but in condonation or extenuation of those acts, is a vile and malignant calumny.We Liberals believe - we who still hold to the old Liberal faith - that these excesses, the more inexcusable they are, the wickeder they are, the more disastrous they are in the results they produce, the more necessary they make it that the Executive, while sparing no effort to detect and to punish the guilty, should keep its own hands scrupulously clean.To suppress, or to attempt to suppress, crime by crime, to retaliate upon murder by murder, to visit the sins of the guilty on the innocent, to make the unoffending and law-abiding pay in life and property for the misdeeds of undetected malefactors, is to substitute vengeance for justice.It is to step down from the judgment seat and to engage in competition with the organs and the ministers of crime. That is a degradation of government against which those who detest crime the most, whatever its motives may be, should be the first and the loudest to protest.The Government and ReprisalsWhat is the Government attitude in regard to this matter of reprisals? I listened to the speech of the Chief Secretary the other night. I should like to see it - I won\u2019t say in extenso, but in substance - circulated by all the Liberal Associations of the country, for it will appear, the more you examine it - whatever lip-service the official exponents and apologists for the Govern­ment policy may offer - in effect they are not only condoning, but they are encouraging a policy of reprisals.I believe, and I am glad to hear that you have had today ­and you could not have had it from a more authoritative source - from my right honourable and learned friend, Sir John Simon - a detailed exposure of what has been taking place. I should like, although it is not my purpose to go into details today, to detail one aspect of the case - what has been done by the forces of the Crown, military and constabulary, in relation to the creameries in Ireland. I have never heard a more astounding defence than that of Sir Hamar Greenwood. He tells us there are 710 creameries in Ireland, and the total number wholly or partially destroyed is only 41. Good heavens! Is not 41 enough? Is it not more than enough?The Police and the CreameriesThey told us only a few weeks ago that there was not a tittle of evidence that the military or police had been engaged in the destruction of a single creamery. It has now been proved and admitted that a fortnight before that statement was made in the House of Commons there were in Dublin Castle, sufficiently well known to be given out to the Press, reports from the police themselves describing in detail the destruction of one or two of these creameries by officers of the Crown. They talk about our information coming from tainted sources. I am sorry to say that there is no more tainted source at this moment than the information that comes from Dublin Castle.We could not have a better illustration of the attitude of mind of the Chief Secretary, which, of course, percolates and conveys itself to his subordinates throughout the length and breadth of Ireland, than the perfectly astounding statement which I heard him make with my own ears: \u2018I can assure you if there is one creamery in Ireland which is a rendezvous of the Irish Republican Army, or one manager a member of that army, that manager and that creamery are in peril.\u2019An Anarchic DoctrineWhat does that mean? It means that if there is but a single manager of one of those creameries suspected of being a Sinn Feiner, or a member of the Republican Army, in the view of the Chief of the Executive in Ireland, without investiga­tion, without evidence, without trial, that creamery is to be subjected to the blind and indiscriminate vengeance and de­struction of the officers of the law. I have never heard, and nobody has ever heard, since England became a free country - not even in the worst days of Lord North or of Lord Sidmouth, the worst days of reaction - we have never heard, I undertake to say, from a Minister of the Crown a doctrine so anarchic and so subversive of the very foundation of government.Well, only two nights ago, I asked the House of Commons, in a motion I made myself, to condemn this policy. We had with us only 83 supporters. I might parody the old rhyme and say, \u2018He is a slave who dare not be in the right with 83.\u2019 But we were only 83 - a disgraceful indication, for the case was an unanswerable case, and the doctrine which the majority must he deemed to have accepted was the doctrine laid down in the passage I have just quoted from the speech of the Chief Secretary.Where Were the Coalition Liberals?We had two Tory Coalition Members with us; all honour to them, but where were the Coalition Liberals, those who were elected as Coalition Liberals? Some had the grace to abstain and hide themselves. Over 70 of them went into the Lobby in opposition to our motion and in support of the doctrines and declarations of the Chief Secretary.If you want to have clear and conclusive proof of the impor­tance of keeping free and independent Liberalism by itself, and rejecting all those more or less plausible, though not very insidious, overtures which go by the name of reconciliation, ask them first these questions: \u2018When and where and in what company did you unlearn the doctrines which are the life-blood of the Liberal faith? What inducement or reason is there for us, as self-respecting politicians, who still believe those doc­trines, who are prepared to maintain them through good and evil report, to join your company and abandon our principles as you have done yours?\u2019I am reminded that there is one honourable friend - my col­league Mr. Johnstone, of Renfrew - who of the whole band alone remained true to the old traditions of Liberalism.The Only RemedyI want to pass from that to ask you this question: Are we to continue to look on exasperated, humiliated, indignant but impotent, at this method of Irish government? Depend upon it, the prospect grows not better but worse every day. There is, in my judgment, as you know, one remedy, and one remedy only - to give to the Irish people the fullest form of self-govern­ment which is compatible with our safety, and the fuller, the ampler and the more unfettered form which that self-govern­ment assumes, the fewer in number and the rarer in occurrence will be the occasions for friction between the Irish Government and ourselves.Remember that you are dealing today in many respects with a new Ireland. It is a different country from what it was 50 years ago, different in many ways from what it was when Gladstone first proposed Home Rule, and carried it on. It is a prosperous country. The present tillers of the soil have been made, by beneficent legislation, owners of their holdings, or potential owners of their holdings. The stream of emigration which for two, and even three, generations after the famine drained away the young manhood of Ireland to America and the Colonies - that stream has been checked.You have in Ireland now, self-contained, staying at home, working on their holdings and in various forms of in­dustry - in these creameries, for instance, and other aspects of the co-operative movement - a body of virile young men, and middle-aged men, such as you see in the best parts of rural England and Scotland. And, side by side with that economic change and distribution of the population, you have seen grow­ing up - through propaganda, partly literary, historical, if you like - a far keener and more intimate sense of nationhood than ever existed in Ireland before. And it is not confined to one class or to one area.The Feeling in IrelandNothing is more remarkable than that through the length and breadth of Ireland, with the exception of a small - important I grant you - almost secluded corner in the North-East of Ulster the feeling of a common nationality, common fraternity, common interests, both historical and actual, is far more wide­spread and deep-seated in Ireland today than it ever was at any period in her history.That is the Ireland you have to deal with. There is no quarrel, except an historical quarrel. Its interests and those of ourselves, economically, socially, commercially, and, indeed, politically, are so absolutely interlaced and interdependent that the very idea of permanent separation is inconceivable and becoming as inconceivable to them as it is to us.It is a country in that situation, with those tendencies con­stantly at work, which has now been so reduced by the follies, fatuities, and misunderstandings and misrepresentations of the so-called statesmen to this appalling condition of tragic civil war.Give Ireland FreedomGive it freedom - freedom upon the largest scale with the fewest irritating restrictions and restraints - and, unless all our reading of history and Liberal traditions and convictions is at fault, freedom will produce there, as elsewhere, its own fruit in reconciliation of the best kind, and in the creation of a new sense of unity and brotherhood.I have put forward, as you know, my own - I will not call it a plan, because it is not a plan - my own outline of the way in which this great task can be accomplished.Dominion Home RuleI would give to Ireland Dominion Home Rule. I would place her on the same footing as the great self-governing Dominions of the Crown. I am glad to think that in putting forward that view I am in complete sympathy with my noble friend Lord Grey. I am speaking here, deliberately, to Liberals, some of whom may have doubts and misgivings. Let us see how far we travel together on the same road.In the first place, we would give to Ireland complete fiscal autonomy, which is denied to her by the Bill of the Government now being foisted on her. In the next place we would give to her the most generous treatment in the adjustment of our relations in regard to finance, to payment and contribution to the Imperial Exchequer. There are great arrears which we owe to Ireland; not perhaps on an accountant\u2019s statement of debtor and creditor, but in point of justice.The Army BogeyAgain, as regards foreign relations, Lord Grey says, as I have said: \u2018Put Ireland on the same footing as all the other Dominions.\u2019 They don\u2019t ask for a separate foreign policy of their own. They do ask, and we would give them and give to Ireland also, a freer and fuller consultation in regard to our Imperial and external relations.         The Army is a bogey, one of the most ridiculous bogeys that has ever been raised in the history of this controversy. The Premier tells us that they might raise an Army of 500,000 men in Ireland. For what purpose? Self-governing Ireland, which has no quarrel with England, to raise an Army of 500,000 men to be a constant menace to us, and expose us to the hazards of conscription! That is midsummer madness.The Question of the NavyWhat is left outstanding? - the question of the Navy. I have said from the first, and I repeat, that I do not believe that any sane Irishmen, apart from those who are avowedly in favour of separation, desire to have a Navy of their own at all. Why should they? It is a grotesque and futile waste of money.Our Dominions we have allowed to have Navies of their own under a very stringent condition, which makes them, in an emergency, part and parcel of the British Navy, subject to the commands of the Admiralty.I quite agree the geographical situation of Ireland - and I am not going to take any risks, as I have said over and over again, any risks of any sort or kind to our strategical security - I agree the geographical situation is different from that of any other Dominion.I am perfectly satisfied - nor would I consent to the application of Dominion Home Rule for Ireland on any other terms - that any navy raised in Ireland should be auxiliary to the Royal Navy and subject to its orders.No Difference with Lord Grey As far as Lord Grey and I are concerned there is, I believe, no difference in our opinions. I want to get all Liberals, if I can, to unite in that view, because as I have told you before, and as I repeat now, it is only by giving to Ireland, or offering to her - it is for her to take or leave, but offering to her - in the fullest and freest sense, the same powers of self-government you have given to all your other Dominions that you can possibly get rid of this secular atmosphere of suspicion and persuade the Irish that you mean in good faith to make that country part and parcel of the British Empire. I hope the members of the National Liberal Federation will take the same view.Liberals should Face the Facts with CourageWhat I want to put to you finally is this. It is a very serious matter. Let us Liberals, of all people, face the full facts of this tragic situation, not concealing from ourselves their gravity - that we ought not to do - not underestimating either the uncer­tainties or the dangers of the future, but let us face that situation with courage in the true temper and spirit of the Liberal faith.We have found in the past in the grant of liberty and the creation of that which goes with liberty, the sense of responsi­bility, the solvent for problems of equal, if not even of greater danger and difficulty.It was never anywhere more necessary to emancipate our­selves from convention, from catchwords, from superficial and time-serving expedients, and get into living contact with realities. Great and growing is the reproach of failure. Great and enduring would be the reward of success.The Strength of LiberalismI have confined what I have to say today to those two topics; but I am glad to recognise in the meetings of your Federation, and in the evidence which comes to me from all parts of the country, a new temper, hope, and indeed a certainty, in the ranks of our party. We have been during these last two years in the trough of the wave, and I cannot express with too much emphasis, or sincerity, my own feeling of admiration and grati­tude for the strength and the vitality which the Liberalism, of the country has shown in that most trying and testing experience.We have seen it proved in many ways, and I think in none - I feel bound to mention it - in none more significant than in the strenuous loyalty to principle and party which has been shown by our agents, who, in spite of the most tempting inducements and allurements, sacrificed their own personal interests in order to remain members of the staff of the great army of Liberalism. All honour to them! And let us, to whatever rank in the army we belong, follow the example which they have so nobly set.\u2018Do not be Daunted\u2019There is nothing to he got by being a Liberal today. It is not a profitable or a remunerative career. There is very little, I can assure you, after a year\u2019s experience, pleasure or advantage to be got by sitting on the side of my right honourable friend, Sir Donald Maclean, night after night, on the Front Opposition Bench of the House of Commons. But if we had the tongues of men and of angels - I am afraid we can hardly claim to have both of them; but if I had the tongue of a man and he the tongue of an angel, in the ears of the people who sit opposite, they would be but as sounding brass and tinkling cymbals. Very little can be done except to keep your end up. With the support of a most valiant band of indomitable colleagues we do our best to maintain the position, but the future lies with you outside.       I make this last appeal to you - not to be daunted, discouraged or damped in spirit by the adverse vicissitudes of party and political fortune in the last two or three years.    The Certainty of the Future  Do not lower your flag. Do not be tempted or led astray by plausible temptations to compromise or adjustment. Maintain - and you never had a better opportunity than on these two issues of economy and Irish self-government, don\u2019t be tempted to flinch for a moment - your hold on those good old Liberal doctrines of retrenchment and self-government. Be assured that, however long the struggle, however varying may be its fortunes, from day to day, or even from year to year, you have the certainty of the future.

aVIt is always a great refreshment to me to come to this annual meeting of the National Liberal Federation wherever it may be held; but it is a special pleasure to come to it today, when it is held in Newcastle, which, in spite of occasional lapses and backslidings, is still regarded as one of the sacred places of Liberalism. Toryism also has its hallowed spots, none, I suppose, more than Liverpool. Liverpool only last week was the scene of a gathering drawn, like this, from chosen delegates throughout England and Wales, but brought together in a very different frame of mind, and for a very different purpose; to avert, if that were possible, or, if that were not-possible, at any rate to postpone, a party split. It was a very instructive spectacle, for the resolution which was proposed, and the amendment which was carried by an overwhelming majority, were respectively an amendment which would have been rejected, and a resolution which would have been adopted, twelve months ago, with enthusiastic unanimity.Dominion Home Rule was then - yes - and much later than then - a dangerous form of political dementia. To rub shoulders with the leaders of the \u2018murder gang\u2019 was an unthink­able form of political contamination. We do not complain of the change. Why should we? It was sudden, no doubt, but to all appearance it has been happily complete. In the twinkling of an eye the Ethiopian has become whiter than snow. There are some people, especially innocent followers of Colonel Gretton and his associates, who are full of surprise, and even of bewilderment, at what has taken place. It only shows that they have either short memories, or a very superficial acquaint­ance with the facts of history.Turncoats and DiehardsThere is nothing new, and there ought to be nothing unex­pected about it. It is a phenomenon which recurs in the history of the Tory Party with the periodicity of a comet or an eclipse. It happened nearly a century ago over Catholic emancipation. Twenty years later it happened again over Protection, when Mr. Disraeli described Sir Robert Peel, the then leader of the Tories, as having caught the Whigs bathing and stolen their clothes. After another twenty years it happened again over Household franchise, when Lord Derby, the Tory Prime Minister of that day with a slight softening down of the metaphor from larceny to chicanery, declared with pride that he and his party had dished the Whigs. It happened again after another twenty years over Free educa­tion, and it was almost overdue when it happened this year over Ireland. People talk as if the Diehards were a latter-day political breed, the birth of the twentieth century. They are nothing of the kind. They have quite an ancient, and even a distinguished pedigree. Mr. Disraeli was a Diehard in 1846, when, with Lord George Bentinck, he led the famous procession of the old Protectionists into the \u2018No\u2019 Lobby when Sir Robert Peel had gone over to the Free Trade camp. The late Lord Salisbury was a Diehard when, in 1867, he denounced Mr. Disraeli\u2019s Reform Bill as a \u2018political betrayal without parallel in our annals.\u2019 In these rapid evolutions of Toryism there is always a rearguard left behind: though I must add, to do them justice, we generally find that in the long run they make up for lost time.The Progressive VarnishI have spoken of what is happening, what we are witness­ing, as characteristic of the Tory Party, for I regret to say that it would he a travesty of the facts to represent that this latest volte-face could be put down to the so-called Liberal wing of the Coalition. We are still in the dark as to a great deal of these recent happenings, but it is clear from Mr. Austen Chamberlain\u2019s declarations that the new and the deciding move did not come from that quarter. Why should it? It was one of their number, a political neighbour of yours, who was Chief Secretary for Ireland, and as Chief Secretary was for months the principal agent, and I agree a clumsy and maladroit, but still the daily official apologist, of a policy which has now been abandoned by his colleagues as an abject and disastrous failure. That policy, the policy of retaliation and reprisals, of answering crime with crime, was a systematic negation of the first principles of Liberalism. Where were the Liberal members of the Coalition, who were put there to give it a varnish - a progressive varnish? Where were they during all that time? What is their record? They stood by, they approved, they defended all that was being done, and I will just read - it is instructive in view of what is happening and the claims that are being made - I will read a passage which ought not to be forgotten. It is a classic in the records of political ineptitude, from a speech made by Sir Hamar Greenwood, Chief Secretary for Ireland, in the House of Commons, as lately as February 21st in the present year. These are the crucial words:'A policy of calculated and brutal arson and murder with all its ghastly consequences remains uncondemned by Mr. de Valera and the Sinn Fein leaders.'He omitted to add that a similar policy remained uncon­demned by the Prime Minister and the leaders of the Coalition.'The authors of that policy hope to terrorise into sub­mission the British people and the British Government. It is the policy of the assassin we are fighting. It is watched by sinister eyes in Great Britain, in Egypt, in India, and throughout the world. Its success would mean the break-up of the Empire and of civilisation. I submit that there are only two alternatives. One is to surrender to the assassins. The other is to fight. I am for fighting the assassins.'How does that sound today? We Liberals are most anxious for the success of this new and, as we think, wise departure. Is there a Liberal here in this great gathering - and I will put the same question to any gathering of Liberals whom I might meet in any part of Great Britain - who does not share my satis­faction that our hands at any rate are clean of all responsibility, that from the first to the last at every step and in every stage we denounced with the same energy and sincerity - yes, and with added indignation - crimes done in the name of the Execu­tive as crimes done in the name of Sinn Fein, and that we insistently pointed out from first to last the more excellent way, that tardily, but now at last is being pursued? I will only say one word about the negotiations which are still going on. I say it on behalf of the Liberal Party. We have not receded from any pledge - certainly I have not - which we have given against the forcible coercion of this Ulster minority. But I repeat, and I ask all Liberals to assent to this, what I said a short time ago at Glasgow - that it is equally true that we are not going to be parties at the instance, or for the sake, of a corner of Ulster, to the coercion of the great mass of the Irish people.Paisley PolicyBut it is not only in relation to Ireland that our criticisms have been justified; and I may add that our policy has been appropriated, apparently without any sense of obligation, and certainly without any expression of gratitude. The Lord Chancellor this week described himself and his colleagues as having \u2018staggered from crisis to crisis\u2019 as though they lied been the hapless victims of hostile fortune. The successive crises - I quite agree with his description - into which they have staggered, and they are not yet over, have been to a large extent crises of their own creation, and what is more, they have staggered into them with their eyes open, and in defiance of the most definite warnings. I have here a little volume - and though I am not an advertising agent of my own compositions, yet having dipped into this during the last two or three days, I am disposed to make an exception in its favour. It was published little less than two years ago, and is entitled \u2018The Paisley Policy,\u2019 and if it ever reaches a second edition I should be disposed to add a second title, \u2018The Coalitionists\u2019 Vade-Mecum.\u2019 I do not claim any copyright in the ideas which are here embodied. In fact, the more they are pirated the better shall be pleased. I am going to use it as an illustration of one or two salient points in regard to the policy of our present rulers.The first thing which the Coalition did, after the electoral period of pledges and professions and promises and perorations, and which it continued to do for two years, was to indulge in an orgy of inflated and misdirected expenditure. A maxim which I believe to be universally true is that public extravagance is the offspring of bad policy and bad management. Both those two factors were here at work. In the first place, we had wild, ill-thought-out, and costly adventures in Russia, in Mesopotamia, denounced as they were in this little volume, and now, after the mischief has been done and the harvest is being gathered in, definitely and almost repentantly abandoned.MesopotamiaI mentioned Mesopotamia, and I should like to recall to life, although I fear it is at present dead and buried in oblivion, another dictum of a prominent member of the Coalition: the date was December 6th, either just before or in the middle of the General Election of 1918. He was defending a policy of annexations, and he used these remarkable and prescient words: \u2018Why should we give up Mesopotamia that is so rich a country that it might almost pay for the war?\u2019 Mesopotamia, inhabited by three millions of people on pretty bad terms with one another, liable to constant incursions and irruptions from the Kurdish tribes, and possessing, if it does possess, a highly speculative and contingent commercial proposition in the shape of oil. Mesopotamia, which has cost us over £100,000,000 - perhaps £120,000,000 - on which, in the pursuit of a belated but prudent recantation, the Government are now adopting exactly the policy which I recommended at Paisley two years ago. That is to say they are retiring our forces and allowing the people to look after themselves, and Mr. Churchill, who has assumed responsibility for these matters, is actually claiming credit in the House of Commons for a reduction of £20,000,000 sterling in the expenditure next year for pursuing that very policy which, if it had been adopted when I recommended it, would have saved the spilling both of blood and treasure.Extravagance At HomeOf course, there is another side, which is of very great prac­tical importance, to this branch of Coalition policy. The gross inflation of our national annual expenditure was due not only to adventures abroad, but to the ruinous and ridiculous exten­sion of bureaucratic control at home. We watched the process. I was not at the first beginnings in the House of Commons, but Sir Donald Maclean was, and with the insight, foresight, and courage which have characterised his conduct during the whole of these years, he at once raised a protest, and he, and I with him, have since renewed the protest at every stage.How were our protests treated? They were brushed aside by the highest authorities, the Prime Minister and the then Chancellor of the Exchequer - I use their own words - as the \u2018rant of party platforms\u2019 and the \u2018screaming of political epileptics.\u2019 Here again we have not had long to wait for our justification.There is a secret conclave set up, superseding both the Cabinet and the House of Commons, presided over, by an irony, by the arch-prodigal, Sir Eric Geddes - it is like appointing Captain Macheath to be head of the police - with instructions that, in Milton\u2019s phrase, like \u2018the blind fury with the abhorred shears,\u2019 they shall hew and slash at the Depart­ments. I await with curiosity, but; I am bound to add, with chastened expectations, the fruit of their labours.For the rest, what has happened? Time has been spent, largely spent, in passing Acts in haste and repealing them at leisure. And during this very session, the session which has just come to a close, when the problem of unemployment was growing month by month more menacing and more urgent, whole weeks were squandered in passing through the Bill which now goes by the name of the Safeguarding of Industries Act, a measure for introducing into our foreign trade a maximum of wanton confusion, friction, and incon­venience, without any compensating advantage to anybody in the world. It is safe to predict, as I predict today, that, whether by repeal or otherwise, it will sooner or later, and sooner rather than later, join the long and weary procession on its way to the scrap-heap.What Liberalism Has DoneIt is the first duty of an Opposition to oppose and to with­stand bad policies, not by mere negations, but by offering better alternatives. That is a duty which, as is proved by the illustrations I have given to you just now, we may claim to have diligently and efficiently discharged. But I am not going to leave it at that. A great party, with a great past, and as it believes, and as I believe, with a great future, has a larger mission than that of mere opposition. What are our credentials for that undertaking? I saw the other day that one of the present Ministers had gone down, I think to Cambridge, explaining to the young men there the fundamental differences between Liberalism and Toryism. He told them that Liberalism was too busy catching votes to do anything for uplifting the life of the people. (A voice: \u2018Hear, hear.) Apparently there are two people, at any rate, who share that opinion here, and I am very glad they are here, because I am going, to reason with them. Let us see. Do not let us take refuge - it is not neces­sary - in ancient history.I will confine myself for two or three minutes to what we have done, or attempted to do, within the memory of all but the youngest in this theatre. Take the seven or eight years which immediately preceded the outbreak of the war. We were engaged in those years in one of the greatest constitutional struggles in our history. We were asserting, and it took a long time to do it, the legislative supremacy of the House of Commons, as against the House of Lords. We went through two General Elections in 1910 on that issue, and as a result we were able to carry the Home Rule Act and the Welsh Disestab­lishment Act. What is more, we made one of the greatest achievements in the free development of our free Empire. We gave a free constitution to our late enemies in South Africa. It was denounced by Tory leaders and the Tory party of the day as a mischievous and even a fatal surrender; and what Liberal did not read with satisfaction, in the report of what took place at Liverpool last week, the manly and honourable recanta­tion of Mr. Austen Chamberlain, speaking, as I hope and believe, not for himself alone, but for all the intelligent opinion of his Party, when he described it - regretting and indeed repenting the attitude he had then assumed - as a great and daring act of political faith which had been abundantly justified?Yes, but that is only half the story. What about uplifting the life of the people? Now -(disturbance in the gallery) - I am coming to my friend there. Here we are closer home. What about uplifting the life of the people? We reduced the National Debt and remitted taxation upon an unprecedented scale. We set up old age pensions. We established a system of National Insurance against ill-health and unemployment. We brought into existence and operation Trade Boards, to deal with the conditions of industry where, through sweating and other circumstances, the workers were unable to protect themselves. We brought in and passed through the House of Commons - it would have passed into law but for the action of the House of Lords - a Licensing Act, which, if it had been now in operation would have been found to solve the great question of temperance in this country.For all these I say we found time in the middle of great constitutional struggles, and when the war broke out in 1914 we had developed, and were about to present to Parliament, a land policy to make the best use of our internal resources, not only as a source of national revenue, though that is a very important aspect of it, but to secure a happier, a better housed, better instructed, and more prosperous population. These are our credentials, and let any party, the Tory Party or any other, produce, if it can, a similar record.What the Liberal Party Would Now DoThat task was suspended necessarily, but only suspended, by the war. It has now to be taken up under conditions which the war has profoundly modified, and in many respects com­pletely transformed. What is the change that the war has brought about? I think I can sum it up in a single sentence. The war, which has impoverished the whole world to an unex­ampled degree, has at the same time intensified the interde­pendence of all its parts. It is a moral as well as an economic interdependence, and as such it finds expression in a new instrument, as we hope, of ever-growing authority, the League of Nations.But look for a moment at the economic side. The impoverishment of which I have spoken takes many forms and degrees. In Russia you see famine and starvation, in Central Europe millions of people still underfed, in France a large devastated area, still only in the early stages of reconstruction; and even in countries like ours and the United States, which escaped the actual ravages of war, unemployment with the unmerited suffering which it brings in its train. No country in these days lives to or for itself, and that is one of the reasons why domestic remedies for unemployment, whether they take the form of relief works, or the much more objectionable form of doles, are a palliative which does not go down to the roots. What is needed is something much deeper and more far-reach­ing than any of these expedients. What is needed is a common effort on the part of all the nations concerned for the economic reconstruction of Europe.There are, as I have indicated more than once during the last three years, indeed over and over again - and I want to repeat them here to my fellow Liberals this afternoon - there are three preliminary steps which are needed to clear the way.In the first place, you must have a complete revision of the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles with regard to reparations and indemnities I put that forward at Paisley. I was then represented as a pro-German, but everybody now knows that we are not going to pay for our ravages and losses in the war by a miraculous influx of German commodities. But even now everybody does not yet understand or realise the difference between Traffic and Tribute. Traffic is a normal condition of free interchange between nations. Tribute is an abnormal disturbing factor, which may he equally injurious to those who receive and to those who pay, and which in the interests of all you ought to eliminate as soon as you can from the international problem. It is a wise reciprocal self-interest which requires the complete revision and the speedy extinction of the policy of reparations and indemnity.The next point is to cancel the Allied indebtedness inter se of the European States. When those two burdens are alleviated, and ultimately gone, the flow of normal international exchange will be set free. And thirdly, and finally, what is almost equally important is the removal of tariff walls. The post-war period has unfortunately seen the setting-up of some new barriers and the raising of others, and we ourselves, by our foolish and short­-sighted Safeguarding of Industries Act, have excited, provoked, and at any rate condoned, what other nations have done.The Choice of PartiesI would like to say one last word particularly to the younger people among you. You have got to choose to which party you will, in the days that are coming upon us, entrust your political allegiance. (Voices: \u2018The Labour Party,\u2019 \u2018The Communist Party.\u2019) No one, least of all my friends up there, can regard this disintegrating and moribund Coalition as a real competitor for your choice. It was born in a fit of delirium. Its life has been spent, as the Lord Chancellor tells us, in staggering from crisis to crisis, and the parties to it, especially the predominant party, some with unconcealed eagerness, others with more or less sombre resignation, are awaiting the day when it will be finally wound up. Let us wipe that off the slate.What about Labour? What is the Labour Party? (A voice: \u2018What is the Liberal Party?\u2019) I have been telling you what the Liberal Party is, and shown you what it has done. What of the Labour Party? Let us come to close quarters with that. It was described the other day, and not, I think, unjustly described, by Lord Robert Cecil - who, whatever he may call himself, is, so far as I can discern, in complete sympathy with us on the vital issues of the day - it was described by him as a Coalition. Yes, it is a Coalition. There are a large number of its members who are pursuing the same ends as ourselves - although not, as I venture to think, by equally practical and efficient means. There are others, not an inconsiderable section, for aught I know they may be the dominant section, who agree neither with us, nor with one another. That is my answer to my friend there who asked me, What about the Labour Party? In fact, the only real bond of union between them - I am going to tell them the truth - the only real bond between these warring and discrepant sections is as my right honourable friend Sir John Simon said, with great truth, I think only a week ago - the only real bond of union between them is a bond of class consciousness. That is what unites the Labour Party.The Liberal Party is not today, it never has been, and so long as I have any connection with it, it never will be, the party of any class, rich or poor, great or small, numerous or sparse in its composition. We are a party of no class. We believe - and that is why I am talking to these young people and asking them to consider these matters in the light of history and of reason - the Liberal Party believes - it is the essence of its creed, both at home and in international affairs - as I am never tired of repeating - the Liberal Party believes that the good of each is to be found, and to be found only, in the good of all. It excludes no one who is at one with it on that fundamental principle which ought to govern our public policy. It invites their co-operation. It will welcome their association in its counsels and in its work, but upon those principles it admits of no compromise. In the course now of a long public career it has been my fortune to be at the head, at one time and indeed for a long time, of an army of many legions, which could command victory both at the poll and in the House of Commons, and which, as I have shown you, used its strength to carry out its principles. I am now at the head, so far as the House of Commons is concerned, of a handful, insignificant or relatively insignificant in numbers, but supported by a vast and a growing body of opinion which, as we have seen during these three years, with all its Parliamentary disadvantages, can bend and break the policy of the Coalition. I believe, then, as firmly and as fervently as I ever did, in the persistence and the indomitable vitality of our creed. I have spent in its allegiance, without pause and without deviation, all the years of my political life, and for whatever length of days may be allotted to me, I shall persevere in the same faith to the end.

aVIt is a great gratification to me to find myself face to face with a really representative gathering of the Liberalism of the country, and to have side by side with me on this platform, with one or two exceptions, all the surviving colleagues with whom I fought in the long and strenuous struggle from 1908 to 1916. We miss indeed the venerable figure of Lord Bryce, one of the most accomplished and gifted of our public men and of our writers - one who never deviated by a hair\u2019s breadth from the Liberalism which he had adopted, not as a tradition or an inheritance, but as the result of a profound study of history and of the reasoned convictions of a highly endowed intelligence. Only two or three days ago I received from him a letter, written with all his old, and it seemed to me then his youthful, vigour, in which, being heavily engaged as he was on some literary work in the country, he expressed his regret that he could not be with us tonight and his hearty and complete sympathy with the objects of this meeting.Welcome to Lord GreyIt is a peculiar pleasure to me to welcome here on behalf of the whole Liberal Party a statesman to whom it owes an immeasurable debt of gratitude, and whom physical disability alone has kept for some time past out of our fighting ranks. Lord Grey is almost my oldest political friend. We have sat together and worked together, and shared responsibilities which few can imagine together, during more than thirty-five years, and casting my memory back on the past I cannot remember that we ever had a serious difference that lasted more than a quarter of an hour. You all know that he brings with him not only a sane and finely balanced judgment, but the resources of an unrivalled experience in the conduct of international affairs.When the history of this time comes to be written, the record of Lord Grey as a peacemaker will stand out. For the best part of ten years, in the precarious and ever-menacing conditions of the international situation, he kept the peace of Europe, and it was no fault of his that the peace was ultimately broken. The return of such a man to our public life - I do not speak of it from the party point of view; Lord Grey is something much more than a party politician - the return of such a man at such a moment as this is the restoration to us of a national asset of incalculable value.The AbsenteesI said a moment ago that as I surveyed the ranks of my old colleagues there were one or two, not many, notable absentees. (A voice \u2018For ever, I hope.\u2019) They have been engaged, in the course of last week, addressing an audience. Of what elements it was composed, whence it came, and how it was recruited, I confess I do not know. That it had any claim of any sort to represent the Liberal rank and file is, of course, a transparent fiction. I am told that out of some 400 repre­sentative and freely elected Liberal organisations in England, not less than 320 have openly declared themselves with us. It is difficult to realise it now, but these gentlemen a very few years ago were in the forefront fighting with us for the land taxes, and facing with us two successive General Elections in a single year in order to assert the supremacy of the House of Commons and to secure the passing into law of such great constitutional changes as Home Rule and Welsh Dis­establishment. The land taxes, where are they? Under a Coalition Government they have been wiped off the Statute Book, and the Parliament Act itself appears to be in considerable danger. I am not, as you know, fond of personal references in politics, but there is not one of these men, or, I may add, of the majority of those whose names are known to me who sat beside them last week on this platform, from whom in those days and much later I have not received professions of devoted loyalty and even of affection.I have not changed, Liberal principles have not changed, and yet the Prime Minister thought it seemly on Saturday to indulge in a number of personal gibes directed against myself. I am not going to quote them because it is just the sort of stuff some of us can remember in the General Election of 1910 in the leaflets and broadsheets of the less scrupulous of the Tory candidates, and these stale jocularities are brought again to life by my old colleague and fellow-fighter in those days, now the Prime Minister of England, and are reported to have been received with appreciative laughter by those repre­sentative Liberal delegates. I am sorry for my old friend. I am too old and perhaps too disillusioned to look for anything like gratitude in politics, nor, unhappily, is it possible to teach some people good taste and good manners.The General ElectionAt the time when this meeting was summoned there was a widespread belief that we were going to be plunged into a February General Election. I see the Prime Minister asks with indignant and ingenuous amazement, \u2018Who started all this?\u2019 and he assures us that he did not. Then who did? Someone must have done. It was not a case of what the naturalists call spontaneous generation. At any rate, the kite was vigorously flown with the benediction, if not with the manipulation, of the Prime Minister\u2019s well-known hench­men in the Press and elsewhere.And after floating for a week or two in what the poet calls the azure deeps of the air, and dominating the whole political horizon, it came down with a heavy bump. The odd thing is no one is bold enough to claim any property in the frag­ments. You remember the old nursery rhyme, \u2018Who killed Cock Robin? I, said the sparrow.\u2019 We know well who played the part of the sparrow. My old friend Sir George Younger - unlike the whippers-in of the phantasmal delegates who were in this place last week - is the master of many legions. When the kite was soaring at its highest I was asked by some of my political friends for my own forecast. I said I thought there would be no election, and I will confide to you that I even went so far as to back my own opinion. I do not want to compromise anybody\u2019s character but my own, and so I will not hint with whom the transaction took place.\u2018A General Election,\u2019 I said - and it turns out I was right \u2013 \u2018at this moment would, of course, be a profligate political gamble in which grave national interests would be subordinated to personal and to party necessities.\u2019 That would not be decisive. There was another consideration, which was it would split the Coalition into fragments and would justify a coroner\u2019s verdict of felo de se. I said then, and I say again today, that we Free Liberals can afford to regard a dissolution whenever it comes with the most perfect equanimity. No word of protest came, or will come, from us. We have no interest and no desire to delay by a single day the national assize upon the Coalition.Coalition ClaimsSpeeches, intended, I presume, for Liberal consumption, at the meeting last week were all directed to prove that the Coalition Liberals had been justified by events in being in the Coalition, and - so long as their presence is tolerated - in remaining there. I want to examine this claim. By way of illustration we will take one or two crucial matters in the domestic sphere. Take these two crucial instances - things about which they are pluming themselves most at the present moment - Ireland and retrenchment. Their claim, when we come to analyse it, amounts to this - that in both cases they are now doing under the stress of circumstances - under electoral necessity, actual or contingent - things which they might have done, which they could have done, which they ought to have done two or three years ago, and what is even more important, to the doing of which they have by their own policy or want of policy them­selves interposed the most formidable obstacle.They are now in search of a motto, or, indeed, of a series of mottoes. The Prime Minister has found one in the New Testament; the Attorney-General, as befits a subordinate member of the Government, takes a lower, a more modest course, and pro­poses to appropriate to the Coalition the time-honoured Liberal formula - peace, retrenchment, and reform. If the Coalition could live on mottoes, how happy its state would be. Un­fortunately, in this sublunary world, a party has got not only to live on mottoes, but to live up to them. Let us see what title they have to the inheritance of the oldest of Liberal watchwords. They are all lyrical, and even dithyrambic, over the Irish settle­ment. No one has more reason than we have to rejoice over the Irish settlement. No one welcomes more heartily the agreement, which is published today, between the North and the South. I myself have been urging for more than two years - and particularly from the moment the truce was called and the hideous civil war ended and real negotiations began - that we free Liberals should give the most cordial and open encouragement to such negotiations; and we have not said one word from first to last that would embarrass their conduct or prejudice their success.But what were the Coalition doing in Ireland fifteen months, twelve months, even nine months ago? Where were they - the Hewarts, the Fishers, the Churchills, and the Liberal Prime Minister - when the Liberal Chief Secretary was letting loose his Black and Tans in their retaliatory campaign of arson and out­rage? Did they ever raise a finger of resistance? No. For what we know they were dumb, except when they turned on the stream of their eloquence in the denunciation of Dominion Home Rule. And when the Prime Minister came forward - we now know from Mr. Chamberlain\u2019s public announcement - it was not they, it was the leader of the Unionist wing in the Cabinet who pointed out to the Prime Minister the necessity of kennelling the dogs of war and coming into free and open parley with the leaders of the \u2018assassins.\u2019It is better to be converted late than not to be converted at all, but to claim that this is a triumph for men who now repre­sent themselves as following in the footsteps of, and carrying on the traditions of, Mr. Gladstone is nothing short of a piece of political effrontery.I could tell you if time permitted some things in regard to retrenchment. We are all now, so the Prime Minister tells us, ruthless economists - economists of what and applied to what? In a large part to the profligate expenditure which in an impoverished and devastated world they themselves have since the war - not during the war - created, to develop inflated wild indulgences and costly, vast, top-heavy, lop-sided and hopelessly incompetent bureaucratic experiments at home. They are all abandoned now, all on the scrapheap; though when Sir Donald Maclean and I were denouncing them we were derided - and it is only two years ago - for epileptic screaming and economic rant. Now, when it is to a large extent too late, comes the pure cream of the Coalition milk. Now, do not let me be mis­understood. I do not in the least object to policies wise and sound which I and others have advocated being borrowed or even stolen, as they have been, in regard to Ireland, to retrench­ment, to a large though still undefined degree in regard to reparations and indemnities.I have no disposition to cry \u2018Stop thief!\u2019 and send for the police, but when these people having nakedly and openly appropriated the only means for removing the difficulties which their own policy has created or aggravated - when they ask the world to ignore their past and to acclaim, as the Prime Minister does, the Heaven-sent wisdom of their belated resort to common sense, they are, I think, imposing too heavy a tax on the presumed ignorance and credulity of the British people.Free TradeI will apply one more criterion to the claim of these old associates of ours that they are upholding in the Coalition the Liberal banner of peace, retrenchment, and reform. I speak, as you will readily guess, of Free Trade. It is very amusing to a cynical observer to read the way in which they have handled in their public speeches the Safeguarding of Industries Act. They all speak of it today with bated breath and in perfunctory and apologetic parentheses. It happens to be one of the very few legislative measures of the Coalition which remains, which has not been repealed altogether or completely eviscerated. The Prime Minister described it as a temporary measure to meet abnormal conditions - a totally inaccurate description, as a study of its provisions would have shown him, and he somewhat faintly advanced the ridiculous pretext, the falsity of which has been repeatedly exposed by Lord Crewe and myself, that it is in some way countenanced by the Paris Resolutions. Sir Gordon Hewart tells us that the Act is an unsatisfactory measure and that he is an uncompromising and unrepentant Free-trader. I am going to suggest what President Wilson used to call an acid test.At the next election, a question which the electors ought to put to every one of these Coalition Liberals who supported that Bill is: \u2018Are you prepared to vote for the immediate and unconditional repeal of the Safeguarding of Industries Act?\u2019 I am not familiar with the intricacies of the Attorney-General\u2019s conscience, but some of those candidates will say \u2018Yes.\u2019 It will be their only way of making a pretence of Liberalism upon the platform. But it is too late. The mischief is done. The industries of this country in a number of small, but not un­important, cases are embarrassed, hindered, and penalised every week and every month because this Act is upon the Statute Book, to which, if those gentlemen had acted upon their real convictions, it never would, and never could, have found its way.StabilityMr. Churchill, in a verbose treatise on things in general delivered here last week, late in his discourse got hold of an illuminating idea, or, at any rate, of what he conceived to be a captivating caption. What was it? \u2018Stability!\u2019 He repeated many times that stability is a great boon which has been brought to us by the Coalition Administration. Let us look at it. We had a great Education Bill from Mr. Fisher which has now been rendered administratively largely nugatory in many parts of it. The housing policy of the unfortunate Dr. Addison has been thrown with its author to the wolves. The Agriculture Act which was to revive rural England by guaranteeing prices to the farmer and establishing minimum wages for the labourer - what has become of it? It was repealed within six months of its enactment.Stability! There have been at least three different, distinct, and irreconcilable policies with regard to coal, and finally - though that does not exhaust the list - the Ministry of Trans­port with its vast staff of salaried thinkers, who as a result of prolonged and secluded meditations were to give us cheap and uniform transport - after a short and costly life - is now in liquidation. That is a pretty good catalogue of the variety of ways in which the Coalition Government may give the country the benefits of stability. These are hard, incontrovertible facts, worth tons of rhetoric and cataracts of sentiment. In face of them, what is the use of the Prime Minister and others reiterating platitudes about the evils of party strife and the need of national unity?No Administration that ever existed - certainly no Adminis­tration that ever played ducks and drakes as this has done with the fortunes of the Empire - has been less embarrassed by factions and party strife than this Coalition. I myself have been constantly reproached by my friends - good, candid friends - for over-tenderness to them. What this country needs is not the extinction or suspension of party - necessary as it was in the war. What the country needs is good government. Not a Government by spasms and zigzags, not a Government of expedients and experiments - coercing Ireland one day, and the next conceding all her claims, indulging for two years in costly adventures, and then bowing the knee and the neck in abject servility to the blows of the Geddes axe. Real Govern­ment, a Government that the country can trust, and which is a fitting trustee of the country\u2019s fortunes - such a Government you cannot get from a Coalition. What the country needs, almost as much as an Administration with steady and coherent principles, is a vigilant and well-organised Opposition - to assist, to criticise, and, sacrilegious as the idea seems to Mr. Lloyd George and his friends, even in case of need to oppose.Get Rid of the Coalition\u2018Measures, not men,\u2019 Sir Gordon Hewart described as an old Liberal doctrine. Where does he get it? Do you know its origin and history? It was invented in the reign of George III by a little knot of corrupt place-hunting politicians who went by the name of \u2018King\u2019s friends,\u2019 and whose one object was to destroy the Whig Party, and, if they could, to overthrow the Constitution. I will read from Burke\u2019s famous tract on \u2018Present Discontents.\u2019 He says: \u2018It is an advantage to all narrow wisdom and narrow morals that their maxims have a plausible air, and on a cursory view appear equal to first principles. They are light and portable, they are as current as copper coin, and they are at least as useful to the worst as to the best. Of this stamp is the cant of not men, but measures.\u2019Our position, at any rate, is perfectly clear. We believe that the need of the country is to get rid of the Coalition. We are as eager as any organisation for peace and the restoration of international confidence. We are for free trade, the cutting down of tariffs, the opening up of markets, the curtailment of unproductive expenditure, the consequent possible reduction of taxation, and a drastic policy of disarmament. We had an industrial policy outlined at Newcastle the other day which we believe will be far more effective in securing the real interests of the co-partners in industry than any amount of barking and baying at the spectre of Socialism. We desire to see, and we are indeed pledged to attempt, a better constituted Second Chamber; but whatever changes may be made in its composi­tion its functions must be so defined as to make it abundantly and absolutely clear, that it is not to be allowed to usurp the authority of the directly elected representatives of the people. What we want is to see a definite policy - a policy upon settled lines, pursued by men of real conviction, worthy of the tradi­tion and imbued with the spirit of the great Liberals of the past.

aVLet me thank you most sincerely for your warm and encouraging reception. The chairman, in the speech which he has just made, has abounded in the felicitous application of the phraseology and even the parables of Scripture to our modern political conditions.      There was one phrase which he used at the opening of his speech which filled me with a little momentary apprehension. He said that old bottles could not contain new wine, and I said to myself, \u2018Am not I an old bottle, and is my capacity or utility therefore at an end?\u2019Then I reflected that in those days a bottle was not a rigid and brittle thing of glass; it was a leathern receptacle, elastic and tensile, and, therefore, from whatever date it drew its origin it might still be often capable of legitimate expansion. At any rate, we will hope so, and I desire, at the outset of what I have to say, to express my great gratification with the announcement which you have made as to the better and more effective organisation of the National Liberal Federation.The National Liberal Federation is not and never has been any part of the official organisation of the Liberal Party. It is an entirely independent body so constituted as to give representation, free representation, to all the local Liberal Associations in the country, and in no way bound to a blind support of any single man or group of men in the direction of Liberal policy. It follows that its resolutions, as the spontaneous expression of the views of freely chosen delegates from a vast variety of districts, have in the past been, as they still are to Liberals throughout the Kingdom, of special significance and of peculiar weight.The Federation is not, and I hope it never will be, the docile mouthpiece of the Party leaders and Whips. It is rather the watchdog which, according as occasion demands, can utter the note either of welcome or of warning.Tribute to Old Premier and NewThe Federation this year meets under exceptional conditions. The late Ministry\u2019s short and by no means tranquil life lasted only two hundred days, and has been brought to an end by the enforced and universally regretted retirement - we all hope it may prove a temporary retirement - of Mr. Bonar Law.I will only say of him now that he was by far the most formidable personality in his own Government. His successor, Mr. Baldwin, starts with one invaluable asset - the esteem and affection of his fellow members of the House of Commons.The first-class brains of which we used to hear so much from their possessors at the late General Election are still out in the cold, and, so long as they are not readmitted to the family hearth, I suppose it may sound to them, at any rate, like sarcasm, to describe the present Cabinet as a famous but short-lived Administration more than a hundred years ago was described - as a Ministry of All the Talents. But do not let us despair. The Ministry is not yet complete. It promises to be recruited and reinforced from unexpected quarters, and it is, indeed, curious to us that the hard-shelled Tories, who vetoed the return of Mr. Austen Chamberlain, are prepared to welcome, with more or less open arms, to their innermost council, not a prodigal - the chairman has spoken of prodigals - but a con­vert, an old friend and colleague of ours - a striking and gratifying proof of their confidence in the robustness of his new faith.The Irish DeportationsThe new Government has had only three or four days of Parlia­mentary life, and, in my judgment, it has not started very well. The deportation by its predecessors in time of peace of suspected persons, without trial and even without charge, whether it was legal or illegal, was, in any case, a grave error of policy, and a violent break with the best traditions of our constitutional practice.It has been declared by the Court of Appeal to be illegal, and though the Ministers concerned are, I think, entitled to little or no sympathy, as they acted in good faith and apparently upon the best legal advice that was available, few people would have objected to their being protected from criminal and even from civil liability, subject to three vital conditions.What are these conditions? The first is, obviously, that the protection given should be confined to the particular Order, and to persons who executed it in good faith. The second is that full compensation should be provided to innocent victims from whom rights of action were being retrospectively taken away; and the third, and in my opinion the most significant and most important of all, was that immediate and simultaneous steps should be taken to get rid once and for all of the so-called Restoration of Order in Ireland Act, and of the long series of regulations, many of which were of the most arbitrary and aggressive character.When the Indemnity Bill - and the discussion of it is still going on in the House today - which the present Government inherited from their predecessors came to be carefully examined, it was found not to comply with any one of these conditions, and the utmost that could be extracted from the Government in the debate last Monday, on the second reading, was some very vague and nebulous assurances. There was, therefore, in my judgment, and in that of the fellow Liberals who act with me in the House of Commons, no alternative but to vote against the second reading. It is perfectly idle to pretend that this would have involved, if it had been successful, a denial of indemnity to the threatened Ministers and officers. It would have involved nothing of the kind.Liberal Action VindicatedThe Government had only to take back their ill-conceived and ill-drawn Bill and produce a satisfactory substitute, and an indemnity, properly safeguarded and hemmed in, would have been readily assented to by Parliament. Our protests were unavailing. The Second Reading of the Bill was carried by an exceptionally large majority of variegated composition.The debate in Committee amply vindicated our action. It was shown that the language of the Bill could be construed to cover not merely this particular transaction, but other acts done in the past, or acts that might be done in the future, in pursuance of the eighty-odd regulations which have been made. That contention was at first strongly denied. I was told I knew nothing about the subject when I raised the point in the House of Commons, but it was ultimately admitted to be unassailable and unanswerable by the representatives of the Government, and amendments cutting down the Bill to its avowed purpose were inserted, together with a not inadequate compensation clause proposed by the Government.The Bill, as I have said, is not yet disposed of, but through the vigour and vigilance of the Opposition it has been transformed into a comparatively innocuous measure. That, ladies and gentlemen, is a strong example of what can be done by an Opposition which understands its real functions.It has not only to criticise but to oppose, and, let me add, that there is no more difficulty now than there ever was in the old days in a man finding his way into the right lobby with or without the guidance of the Whip. But nothing has been done or promised to meet the third of the conditions which I enumerated a few moments ago - I mean the complete repeal and obliteration of the Restoration of Order Act. But for that Act and powers conferred by it, this incident would not have occurred. The Act is still on the Statute Book, and though the creation of the Free State in Ireland has, as one might have supposed, rendered both the Act and the regula­tions made under it obsolete, yet, as these adventures and experi­ments by the Law Officers of the Crown sufficiently show, it is high time that the possibility of executive encroachment upon the elementary liberties of the subject should be put an end to definitely and without delay.We ought not to be put off with any promise that the Govern­ment have made of a Cabinet Committee to sit and discriminate. The whole thing should be swept root and branch out of existence. People\u2019s memories in these days are so short, and there is such a natural anxiety in some quarters to wipe out with the sponge of oblivion quite recent history, that I make no apology for asking you, for a moment, to go back not very far, less than three years, to the month of August 1920, when, under the guillotine, this Act was hurried into law. Remember, this was not war legislation; this was post-war legislation. The war had been over nearly two years. The sole justification for the arbitrary powers conferred upon the executive by the Defence of the Realm Act was the supreme necessity of providing for the safety of the kingdom in time of war. That state of things had entirely passed away. The state of Ireland was bad, very bad indeed, worse, perhaps, than it had almost ever been, and the question for British statesmanship was to find the best way for a solution. This Bill was the then contribu­tion of the Coalition Government. Lord Robert Cecil last Monday thought fit to make the gibe that it was framed and introduced by a Liberal Prime Minister, with a Liberal Home Secretary and a Liberal Chief Secretary. That is, unhappily, the truth, although, of course, it is absurd to suggest that Conservative parties in the Coalition were not as fully responsible for its authorship. Let me recall what was the attitude of the small Liberal remnant who had survived the coupon election, and who sought to keep alive and alight in those dark days the torch of Liberal tradition.Complete Justification of Paisley PolicyI had myself fallen a temporary victim to the determined attempt which was made to submerge the Liberal Party as an independent political force, and after a year\u2019s absence from the House of Commons I was returned by the electors of Paisley on a policy which, I do not hesitate to say, in every important item, whether negative or constructive, has in the course of three years been vindicated by the events.I will venture, therefore, to quote some of the language which I used in the House of Commons on August 5th, 1920, when this Bill came up for the Second Reading. I said then: \u2018I have seen in my time many proposals of a coercive character, and I do not hesitate to say that in my judgment of them all, this Bill is the worst in conception. It gives the Executive, without reference to trial, the power, unlimited in point of time, to supersede the ordinary con­stitutional safeguards of personal liberty. It permits the imprison­ment of suspected persons without trial, it abolishes trial by jury, it puts military officers in the places of trained judges, and it will hinder, not help, the Executive in what is already a most impossible task.\u2019I should like to add to what I said then - for I was not content merely with destructive criticism - I said to the House then, and I reminded them that I had stated six months before at Paisley, that matters had reached a stage in Ireland at which it was impossible to procure to Ireland lasting peace by any measure which did not, to all intents and purposes, put Ireland on the same footing as our great self-governing Dominions. I finished by saying that, if you deal with Ireland on the same lines and in the spirit which I have been trying to indicate, the cry for an Irish Republic will very soon dwindle and become extinct.Scouted and Flouted - Then AdoptedI will not quote the reply which was made to me immediately after I said that, by the then Prime Minister, because I am not here, as you know, to indulge in personal recriminations. But what followed? It is a most instructive story.This is not a reference merely to the past, for the evil that men and Governments do lives after them. The second Reading was carried by a majority of something like four to one. Under its authority 84 consecutive regulations were made. Neither the Act nor the regulations were, or ever have been, worth the ink which the King\u2019s printer spilled in giving them publicity. There followed, as we all know, months which constitute a black chapter - one of the blackest - in the history of our relations with Ireland. It was an era when the British Government first connived at and then openly adopted the fatal policy of reprisals. The policy I suggested of Dominion Home Rule was flouted and scouted as an absurdity and as an impracticable proposition. Exactly a year after I had spoken in August, 1920, the leaders of the Irish people, the \u2018assassins\u2019 and the \u2018gunmen,\u2019 and the representatives of the then Chief Secretary were in conference, and a settlement was arrived at on the basis of the fullest and most unfettered form of Dominion self-government.Why do I rehearse these indisputable facts? Not with a purpose, as some people seem to think, of opening old sores. I rehearse them to impress upon you Liberals, to whom I am primarily speaking, to impress upon you, first, the folly and the fatuity and the far­-reaching evils which result when Liberals turn their backs on Liberal principles. And next, if I can, I would emphasise the supreme importance, the paramount urgency, which lies upon all who call themselves Liberals to reassert at every available opportunity the necessity of putting an end once for all to the possibility of executive autocracy, and of blotting out from the Statute Book this stain upon the scutcheon of our free constitution, whose twin watchwords are law and liberty.Russian AffairsNow, Sirs, I pass to another aspect of the present situation. I will say a few words about external policy. The new Government succeeded abroad as well as at home to an unenviable inheritance. There are, I am happy to say, signs at this moment of a break in the clouds in one quarter which, a month ago, overhung the inter­national situation.It seemed then that we were within a measurable distance of a complete rupture of our relations, such as they were, with the Government of Russia. I am glad to believe that, through a process of conferences and discussions, difficulties are now in the way of being removed, and that the Russian Government are being brought along the only road by which they should be brought to realise that it is at least as much to their interest as ours to comply with reasonable demands.As you know, I have never uttered a word during all these years in explanation of or in apology for the methods of the Soviet Administration. But I have urged, in season and out of season - as a rule upon deaf ears - I have urged the expediency of regular communication, through authorised and accredited channels, between the two Powers.Is it not a little strange - and I put this question to our Tory friends, to whom, perhaps, it more specifically ought to be addressed - is it not a little strange that people who acquiesced for genera­tions, without demur or protest, in our continued diplomatic relations with St. Petersburg in the worst days of Czarist persecution and proscription, both religious and political, when banishments and judicial murder were the habitual methods of the bureaucracy - is it not rather curious that they should now be clamouring for the complete ostracism of the Russian nation because its new rulers have borrowed, practised, and perhaps improved upon, in the name of democracy, the suicidal weapons of the autocracy which they have overthrown?The League of NationsLet me come back for a moment to survey the still over-clouded international sky. We cannot forget that we are now approaching the end of the fourth year since the signing of the Treaty of Versailles. That Treaty, as everyone now recognises, settled nothing. Of course, it is easy to be wise after the event, and I am not indulging in, and I have never indulged in, cheap reflection on the good faith of those who were mainly responsible for it. They were presented with an almost superhuman task; but they left a tangled skein of problems, which, after all these years, still has to be unravelled.The one solid and fruitful contribution of the Treaty of Versailles to international security was, or seemed to be, the solemn enactment of the Covenant of the League of Nations. But where is the League of Nations today? It embraces among its constituent members over fifty of the Powers, great and small, of the civilised world. But it is still a truncated and lop-sided body. America is not in, Germany is not in, neither is Russia, and out of the total population which comes within the pale of civilisation, and which ought (to justify the name of the League) to share not only its counsels but its obligations and active responsibilities, I do not think I am exaggerating when I say that some 300 millions of people not only do not assist in its operations but are not even represented on its Board.I will go further. I say from the beginning the League of Nations has never been given a fair chance. It was left for a long time in an almost menial position to gather up the crumbs of comfort - or more often of discomfort - which fell from the table of the Supreme Council of the Allies. Difficult jobs which the Supreme Council had not the time or the capacity to settle were relegated to it, most of which, it is fair and right to acknowledge, it handled with courage and a considerable measure of success. There were regrettable exceptions, one in particular - the impotent action, or rather inaction, of the Council of the League in the crucial case of the indefensible suspension of the elementary liberties of the people of the Saar.I am glad to think, and I say it with the greatest cordiality, that one of the results of the recent change of Government has been, and should be, and is likely to be, that our representation on the Council will be, for the future, put into the hands of Lord Robert Cecil. If the League of Nations is to be made what the Powers who were parties to the Treaty of Versailles profess they desired it to he, it must be backed both by the Governments and by public opinion of the whole civilised world.Problems for the LeagueIt has never been allowed any initiative or effective voice on the three governing issues on which the whole future, politically and economically, of Europe and, indeed, of the world still depends. They are not really separate issues; they are inter-linked and inter­dependent. What are they? First, the definite - and by definite I mean not only clear but final - the definite settlement, both in amount and as to time and method of liquidation, of the problems of Reparation and Allied indebtedness. The second is the economic recovery of Germany, and the third is the future security of France. These are the three interlaced questions. These are, all of them, not local but world interests. Let me, just by way of illustration, put two or three questions. What is the amount actually due at this moment to complete the restoration of the devastated territories? We do not know. There are as many opinions as there are men who know anything about it.Next, what is the amount already contributed by Germany for reparations? Is it 500 millions, which, I believe, is the estimate of the Reparation Commission, or is it 2,000 millions, as the Germans contend, or some other sum greater than one and less than the other? When these two figures have been settled, as they ought to be and must be, how can the balance to the debit of Germany best be met by Germany without fatal injury not only to her whole economic future, but to that of the rest of the world? And, finally, how is France to be given - as I have always contended she ought to be given - effectual security for her political and territorial future?These are the vital problems which, after four years, are as far from adjudication as they were when the Treaty of Versailles was signed. There can be no real or permanent settlement of them except by some impartial international arbitration. We should all prefer, as the appropriate implement, the League of Nations, reinforced and made fully representative, but if that is found to be impracticable, as may be for the moment, let the statesmanship of the world devise without delay some other machinery of international consultation and arbitrament, whose decisions will inspire confidence and command authority.That is the task upon which, as it seems to me, and I hope to you, our Government, which has shown a lamentable lethargy during these critical months we have been going through, ought to centre its energy, and if it does so, I can promise it the support of public opinion of all parties in this country.Constructive Policy on Trade and LabourNow, coming nearer home, it is said by our critics that the Liberal Party has, on the domestic side, no constructive policy to offer to the country. The resolutions which you have been passing here during the last two days on industrial matters, on trade and unemployment, and on agriculture are sufficient refutation of that charge.Our industrial policy, which is not a policy of improvised expedients, but has been carefully thought out during these years of opposition - our industrial policy has three watchwords. The first, partnership by all those concerned - capital, management, and labour - in industrial enterprises; secondly, security of livelihood for the worker; and, thirdly - and this is an old and deep-seated Liberal principle and tradition; we have never been a party of a class, but always a party which stands for the community - thirdly, I say, our policy is the predominance of public advantage over private profit when the one conflicts with the other.The application of these general principles, both in industry and in agriculture, are, I think, well summarised in your resolutions, and they may be contrasted with the half-hearted expedients which are put forward by the Government.There is the Housing Bill, from which it seems doubtful whether the rural districts will derive any benefit at all, and the tinkering measure to give credits to farmers, which was introduced two nights ago.Taxation of Land ValuesThere lies at the root of not a few of the reforms I have men­tioned the question of the taxation of land. Two years ago your Federation passed a resolution in favour of the imposition both of national taxes and of local rates upon site values. So far as the Liberal Party was concerned, that was not a novel proposal. It is to be found in the Undeveloped Land Duty, which formed part of the land taxes in the Budget of 1909, in defence of which we fought the House of Lords for a couple of years, and which since has disap­peared from the Statute Book. The Undeveloped Land Duty was avowedly a tentative measure. It did not exceed one halfpenny in the pound. One of its main purposes was to ensure a complete capital valuation of the land of the country.The tax has gone; the valuation remains; and I am told there would be little difficulty in completing it and bringing it up to date. That being so, it is time for us once more to reassert that we recognise for the purposes of taxation, whether Imperial or local, a distinct difference between two kinds of value - the value created by the energy and enterprise of individuals and the value which is not so created, but which arises from the progress and general development of the community at large. Upon that fundamental distinction we have always taken our stand, and we hold, as we always have held, that so far as practicable local and national taxes which are necessary for public purposes should fail on the publicly created value rather than on that which is the product of individual enter­prise and industry. That does not involve a new or additional burden on taxation, but it would produce these two consequences - first of all that we should cease to be imposing a burden upon successful enterprise and industry, and next that the land would come more readily and cheaply into the best use for which it is fitted. These two things would be two potent promoters of industry and progress.Position of the Liberal PartyI have not attempted to give you anything in the nature of an exhaustive survey of the work which lies before the Liberal Party in the administrative and legislative field. It is work, which I still believe with as much conviction as when I entered public life forty years ago, that the Liberal Party and only the Liberal Party can adequately perform, but the Party can only perform it if it con­tinues to adhere to the principles and to be animated by the spirit which has made it in the past the pioneer of all political, social, and economic reform.It is just fifteen years ago since I was elected leader of the Liberal Party, and whatever my shortcomings have been, I believe that I may claim I have never betrayed the trust you committed to me.It is one of the most gratifying events in my now long public life that after all those years the National Liberal Federation should this week have expressed its unabated confidence in my leadership.As you well know, I have no personal aims to serve by remaining in the stress and strife of politics. My one object, and only object, is to contribute what I can, as long as I can, to the restoration of our Party, and what is far more important, the restoration of the principles and purposes which our Party embodies, to their old authority in the State.

aVOn the eighteenth of last December it became my duty as leader of the Party to tender advice to the Liberal Members of the new Parliament, as to our immediate course of action in the House of Commons. My speech at the National Liberal Club will be still in the memory of many of you. I said that we had not come to Westminster as soldiers of fortune, to offer our swords to this or that combination; and that our unfettered inde­pendence had not been, and would not be, compromised by any form of alliance or entanglement. We were not going to become a wing or adjunct of any other party. I declined absolutely to move a finger to continue the prolongation by the Tory Government of their disastrous stewardship of our national and international interests. And as the natural alternative was that the second largest party in point of numbers should, if willing to do so, take their place, I sought to \u2018reassure some trembling minds outside\u2019 with the expression of my belief that \u2018if a Labour Government is ever to be tried in this country it could hardly be tried under safer conditions.\u2019I have not a word to retract or to qualify in that speech. We have now had five months\u2019 trial of the experiment to which we then gave our assent. Does anyone wish that we had decided otherwise? The hysterical forecasts which were then rife in the well-informed sections of the Press, of the social and political upheaval which must follow the installation of a Labour Ministry have already passed into the category of old wives\u2019 tales. There has, indeed, been profound and well-grounded disappointment among Liberals, which has been shared with us by many men and women of the progressive faith who are not enrolled under our Party banner, both at some of the things which the Labour Government have done, and at its attitude of impotence and vacillation in regard to some things which it ought to have attempted to do. But so long and so far as it has proceeded, whether in legislation or administration, upon the lines of Liberal policy - as, for example, in the main provisions of the Budget, the reopening of relations with Russia, and the adventure of Singapore - we have not hesitated to give it effective support.I shall have to point out presently, and not for the first time, how fundamental are the differences, to some extent in ideals, to a far greater extent in spirit and in methods, between the ostensible aims of Labour and those of the Liberal Party. But there is almost as wide a difference between the official programme of Labour, as put forward in electoral manifestoes, and thundered even today with every inflection of promise and of menace, upon Sunday platforms, and the actual daily routine of a Labour Ministry which cannot com­mand a majority in the House of Commons. So long as that situa­tion continues with its limitations and its safeguards, we have cer­tainly no motive for joining with the Tories in ejecting them from office, in order that they should be replaced by a Tory Adminis­tration, or, still worse, by any form of Coalition.A Twofold TaskOur business for the moment is two-fold, first, to keep a vigilant watch in the House of Commons upon what is being done and what is being neglected, whether at the direct instance or, as frequently happens, with the benevolent patronage or fitful connivance of the Government. Next, by diligent work and effective propaganda outside, to prepare the mind of the country, when the present unstable and precarious situation crumbles to pieces, for the battle that will then be waged in the constituencies, between Liberalism on the one side, and, on the other, the forces, with which it is beset on either flank, of Socialism and Protection.Our reunited Party is working together with the utmost cordi­ality and good comradeship. I cannot sufficiently acknowledge my own personal obligations to Mr. Lloyd George for his constant co-operation, both in counsel and debate. There have been occa­sions when we have not all voted in the same lobby. When has that not been the case with the Liberal Party? And particularly with a Liberal Party in Opposition? We have never attained to the ideal of mechanical discipline described in the French song:Quand un gendarme rit,Tous les gendarmes rient,Dans la gendarmerie.In my salad days, even under the austere and appalling frown of Mr. Gladstone himself, I myself have been an occasional mutineer. As for Mr. Lloyd George, he has been in his time a super-mutineer - almost, I might say, a professional. There is no lack of real and essential unity in our Par­liamentary Party, though its appearance may from time to time be now and again disguised either by the unbending honesty or the momentary vagaries of this individual or that.Evictions and Rent ControlWhat are the things with which we have been most busy? A large part of the earlier months of the Session was given to the subject of Evictions and Rent Control. Let me in a few sentences summarise the dealings of the Government and Liberal Party with this matter.Early in February Mr. Gardner, a private member of the Labour Party, brought in a Bill:This Bill received the approval of the Government, which, how­ever, declined to take any responsibility for it beyond its benedic­tion; it went to a Committee where, after an enormous waste of time due to two causes - obstruction, and refusal of the Government to define its attitude - it foundered, and is now a Parlia­mentary derelict.Meanwhile, on March 26th, a Liberal member, Mr. E. D. Simon, brought in a Bill which permitted a landlord to obtain possession if he could show that the hardship to him would otherwise be greater than to the tenant, but in cases of all post-July-1923 land­lords the Bill required, as a condition of eviction, the provision of alternative accommodation.Thereupon the Government at last produced an Eviction Bill of its own, of which Clause I empowered an unemployed tenant to stay on without paying rent, at the cost of the landlord. This was so glaringly iniquitous that it was not sought to be defended by its authors. It could not survive an evening\u2019s debate, and the Govern­ment, after a good deal of fencing and fumbling, attempted to sub­stitute for it a clause of which no one has succeeded as yet in grasping the meaning, and which was apparently quite unintelligible to its own framers. The consequence was that this Bill was refused a Second Reading.Meanwhile, as I have said, the Liberal Party has not been inactive. Mr. Simon\u2019s Bill went to a Committee, where it was mutilated by a combination between Government supporters and Tories; it came back to the House where, with the belated consent of the Government, it was restored in substance to its original shape; it has gone to the House of Lords, and it is only a question of days when it will become the law of the land. Nor do the efforts of our Party rest there, and two of the main grievances against which the Government\u2019s Bill was ostensibly directed, will be removed by further measures introduced by two Liberal members - Mr. Trevelyan Thomson and Mr. Ernest Brown - which have every prospect of speedily reaching the Statute Book.UnemploymentOne other case. At the last General Election we were all con­fronted with problems arising out of abnormal unemployment. There was no Party which appealed to the electorate with more confident and profuse assurance that they and they alone were ready with a remedy than the Labour Party. It is true that their specific proposals were conveyed in vague and nebulous terms. The debate last night sufficiently lays bare the actual nakedness of the land. Upon one point indeed they were committed by the plain and unequivocal declaration of their leader, Mr. Ramsay Mac­Donald, a year or more ago. These were his words: \u2018The great temptation of a Labour Government will be to offer doles instead of prosperity. Doles are temporary expedients of short-sighted and irresponsible politicians.\u2019 What foresight! That is exactly the temptation to which the Labour Government have succumbed. What have they done to decrease unemployment except to multiply doles? The hotchpotch measures introduced this week are frankly nothing more nor less than a dole-increasing expedient.I do not object, few Liberals object, to the increase of benefit by 3s. a week or to doubling of the child\u2019s allowance from one shilling to two shillings without any increase of contribution, if the fund will stand the strain. But this is the best that the Labour Ministry after all its election promises, can, when it gets into a responsible position, offer as the product of months of official incubation. Let me add that it is at least ominous that this scheme anticipates an annual average of one million unemployed for, I think, the next three years, and a permanent average of eight hundred thousand. Personally I take a more sanguine view, and if I thought this a probable forecast I should tremble for the future of the Chancellor of the Exchequer. But its real significance is that in the view of the Minister of Labour there is nothing that the Government has in hand or in contemplation which can encourage us to hope that we can get below these portentous and even appalling figures.I could easily multiply instances, but these two will suffice for the moment to prove that the Liberals in the House of Commons, so far from being subservient auxiliaries of a Labour Government, are effectively playing the part which we took upon ourselves of independent criticism, of fruitful suggestion, and of constructive legislative work.The Open RoadI pass now to what is really the main business of this great and representative gathering - the immediate task which lies before the Liberal Party in the country.The Parliamentary situation is, as I have said, precarious in the highest degree. No one can tell how soon the electors may be called upon once more to make their choice. Let me say parenthetically that it is a reproach to the present Parliament that no effective step has been taken to secure a real correspondence between parlia­mentary representation and electoral strength. A few weeks ago we asked the Labour Government - without any form of menace, and in perfectly friendly terms - to co-operate with us in promoting speedy legislation for this purpose. The measure actually before the House embodied the scheme which goes by the name of Propor­tional Representation, but it was capable of being amended and supplemented in Committee. For my part, I am not so wedded to Proportional Representation that I would not for the time being accept the alternative vote or any other simple and practical pro­posal, so convinced am I that nothing could be more delusive and misleading than our existing machinery. A combination between the Tories and the rank-and-file of Labour has rendered any such change impossible for at least another year.Both Toryism and Labour are obliged for the moment to veil their real colours. No intelligent observer can doubt what is the real goal of the vast majority of the rank-and-file of either of those Parties. The Tory goal is Protection; the Labour goal is Socialism. Both end in blind alleys - the enthronement of sectional interests, the sterilisation of enterprise, and the undermining of freedom. It is Liberalism and Liberalism only which pursues the Open Road. This is what you should keep steadily in view and make the keynote of your propaganda.The Tories are keeping their general tariff in cold storage, but nine-tenths of the arguments used in support of the inflated and artificial agitation for the maintenance of the McKenna duties are pure and unadulterated Protection. In the same way the Labour Party in the House of Commons are shy and reticent about the Capital Levy and the Nationalisation of Industries. Yet only the other day the whole of them (including the members of the Government) voted in favour of a Bill for the so-called Nationalisation of Mines. It was a sham nationalisation, it is true, for it proposed to place the raw material, production, organisation, marketing, and export trade of one of our greatest industries in the hands not of the community - employers, managers, workers, and consumers - but of what was, to all intents and purposes, a sectional Miners\u2019 Trust.Liberalism is opposed to every form of Sectionalism, however small or however large may be the class or interest selected for favoured treatment. Its task is to safeguard and to enlarge the free­dom of each class in the common interest of all.We are not satisfied with existing conditions - still less are we the blind disciples of dogmas and abstractions. And the two main directions upon which our efforts in the immediate future are to he concentrated are:SecurityThe first is security of livelihood for workers by co-ordination and completion of social insurance against the risks of sickness, accident, unemployment, old age, widowhood. This is our peculiar business, for upon this path the Liberal Party are the pioneers, and at every stage of the road they have led the way. The last Liberal Government, of which I was the head, was the first Government in history to attempt to achieve security for the worker against the hazards incident to his life. The first step was effected by the Old Age Pensions Act of 1908, and the second by the National Insurance Act of 1911. This Act was resisted by the Tory Opposition, and nothing but the energy and tenacity of the Liberal Party enabled it to become law and be put into actual operation. All subsequent legislation has been by way of addition or supplement to its governing principles, which have stood the test both of war and peace, and to which all parties now render homage.We believe that, after more than ten years\u2019 experience of its working, the time has come for another advance in security, fashioned on similar lines, built on this experience, and filling up gaps which could not have been immediately dealt with in the experimental stage.The first is provision for contributory pensions for men and women over 65 years of age through the development of insurance in the interval before they receive at 70 the non-contributory State Old Age Pension. Next, the provision of pensions for widows and allowances for orphans up to the end of school age - or so long as they attend school - when the breadwinner is struck down by death. These and other modifications and additions to the security, insurances have been considered for more than two years by a com­mittee of Liberal members and Liberal ex-members, with the advice of economists and experts, who have formulated a scheme now to be submitted to the Party. We will not offer hopes of benefits which are not actuarially sound or which cannot be fulfilled in prac­tice. We shall not embark on large or impossible schemes for putting upon industry a burden greater than it can bear.We believe that in industrial development, for the present, with­out undue demand on the taxpayer, the employer, or the employed, we can so complete the structure of our national insurance as to save men and women from the Poor Law and enable them, as a right and not as a charity, to safeguard themselves against the risks of life against which no providence can guard.National and Imperial DevelopmentI pass to what is not only of equal, but in the long run of even more, capital importance. It is in the opening up of fresh fields for production and employment, and of the more economic and fruitful development, both of our national and Imperial resources, that the only effective and lasting remedy is to be sought and found. We believe that this result can never be attained either by Protective tariffs, whether in the form of Imperial Preferences or otherwise, or (with rare and carefully guarded exceptions) by State ownership and bureaucratic control.But can anyone assert that under existing conditions our national resources, actual and potential, are being put to the best account? We are, indeed, in some vital matters falling behind our European competitors. Take, for instance, the generation and application of electrical power. In France there has been an increase of three and a half times in the kilowatts generated. The coal stations em­ployed have increased their output nearly six times, and the water Stations three times. The case of Germany is still more striking, when it is remembered that the Treaty of Versailles not only deprived her of important coalfields, but also required her to make large annual deliveries of coal to the Allies. Nevertheless, as com­pared with pre-war figures, the capacity of her electrical works has more than doubled, while the actual production has more than trebled, and this is largely due to the increased use of cheap fuel - lignite. The progress made in this country is not comparable. We do not ask that the work should be done by the State at the cost of the taxpayer, but we do say that here (and this is only one typical instance) there should be a general and co-ordinated plan, to be carried out in the different areas whether by individuals or by cor­porations, with limitations of the same class as those imposed on our railways. In that way you would find, without any risk of exploitation or of undue profiteering, a field for unemployed labour and for the investment of British capital which now goes to dis­charge relatively unproductive functions abroad.The MinesThe mining industry is another capital case. I stated what I believe to be the Liberal view more than four years ago when I was first a candidate at Paisley. I may perhaps quote what I then said: \u2018I think there is abundant evidence that under existing conditions the coal mines as a whole are not being worked to the best advantage or with the most economical organisation. Starting from these premises, I say to my nationalising friends, \u201cIf you mean by nationalisation the acquisition by the State of mineral rights and royalties, I agree with you. I think the case is made out. But if you mean that our mining industry is hereafter to be worked and man­aged under State supervision and control, I say no.\u201d\u2019 I went on to advocate the establishment of joint boards or councils on which both employers, managers, workmen, and not less important, the con­sumer, through the State, would he represented, and which, without throwing away the incalculable advantage of skilled and experienced management, would enable the miners to feel and realise that they were partners, not only in name, but in fact and reality, in a great common adventure.Land ValuesI will only say one word upon Housing. Let me advise the careful consideration of the instructive report of the Trust Com­mission, now some years old, and the carrying of its recommenda­tions into practice. But you will never get to the root of the problem of housing unless you treat it as a part of the larger question of the tenure and use of land, and tackle that question upon the well-known lines of Liberal policy, whether you are dealing with it in its rural or in its urban aspect. The taxation and rating of Land Values is, in our opinion, a reform which is long overdue.EducationAgain, do not forget, or be false to, our party record in National Education. The first great step was taken - the foundation of the structure was laid - in 1870 by Mr. Gladstone\u2019s Liberal Government. I do not claim for us any monopoly rights in its subsequent development, but strange as it may seem, there is none of our institutions which is of more incalculable and ever-growing value, and yet which stands in more constant need of vigilant and even zealous guardianship. I have spoken of the need for making the most of our potential and often wasted national resources. Of those resources the children of the nation - their muscles, their brains, their character - are infinitely the most precious. Waste, which is a blunder everywhere, is here a crime. By perfecting your school system - from the most rudimentary to the most advanced - with an unblocked road for capacity and promise, with a larger variety of type, with greater elasticity for experiment, with better methods of selection, and with a rigorous veto upon any encroach­ment, direct or indirect, upon the length of the child\u2019s educational life, it is in these ways that we Liberals can render as good service as any to the future of our country.In regard to foreign affairs, for the moment there is a breathing space and, I trust, a better hope than for a long time past that the wise counsels which alone can lead to real appeasement, to the revival of industry and economic stability, may prevail.The EmpireFinally, in regard to the Empire, we have a much better title than any other political combination to the credit of having created and consolidated the Empire. That title will not be invalidated in history because we decline to believe that we should add to its strength or its unity by taxing foreign imports and raising the price to the British people of the food and raw materials which they need. Our Dominions enjoy and exercise, with our absolute goodwill, the most unfettered fiscal autonomy, and no one is more anxious and eager than the Liberal Party to co-operate with them in Imperial development.I have only one thing more to say, I know that I am addressing a meeting of you who are the representatives of Liberalism of the whole country. You belong to a Party which is rooted in great and illustrious traditions, which has a record - we have glanced at one or two of its pages tonight - unexampled among all the parties in the State in the development of freedom and of national and Imperial unity and strength. You cannot, and I am sure you will not, be content to rest upon the associations and inspiring memories of that glorious past. You have got to continue the work in the spirit of those who went before you. There are great problems yet to solve, there are greater tasks to discharge than ever fell to the lot of the illustrious Liberal leaders and their faithful followers in the days gone by. Be worthy of your traditions; stick to your faith; do not be led aside by the catch-words and the lies of the hour; and Liberalism will prove in the future, as in the past, the sheet anchor of Great Britain and the Empire.

aVLORD OXFORD, who was very enthusiastically received, said that since he last had the honour of addressing the annual gathering of the Federation at Brighton last year a great change had taken place in the apparent distribution and still more in the Parliamentary representation of political parties. Incidentally he was one of the victims of the change. He thought it his duty to accept the gracious invitation of the Sovereign as offering him the best and probably the only effective opportunity of still serv­ing, for such time as might remain, his party and the State. What was much more important than this merely personal mat­ter, the Liberal representation in the House of Commons had been during the same year reduced from over 150 to less than 50 - a grotesque travesty, as they all knew, of the real electoral facts, and of many condemnations perhaps the most striking and com­plete in our time of our existing representative system. The redress of this dangerous abuse and the reconstruction of our electoral machinery, the defects in which made its recurrence pos­sible, was a reform of vital and even of primary urgency in the interests not merely of the Liberal party, but in the best interests of democratic government itself.Though, as they were grateful to know, the Liberal Party in the present Parliament was a dominant, and even a predominant, factor in debate, they could make no effective protest in the divi­sion lobby.  He earnestly trusted that the National Liberal Federa­tion, in all its units and branches, would not be slow or slack in organising the great forces to which it appealed to bring to the earliest possible end that caricature of democracy.The BudgetAt the last election people thought the country was going to secure some of Mr. Bonar Law\u2019s ideal of stabilised tranquillity, but those who imagined that politics were about to be reduced, for a time at any rate, to the commonplace and the humdrum, must have already realised that they were living in a fool\u2019s para­dise. \u2018I spoke of tranquillity,\u2019 continued Lord Oxford. \u2018Would it have been possible, apart from the introduction of a general tariff - which is for the time barred, or at any rate deferred, by election pledges - to have devised in a Budget any taxation more provocative in itself and more unwarranted by our situation than Mr. Churchill\u2019s new duties? I call them his. One set are his own progeny, and the other set are a little group of cast-off children whom he has adopted into his family.'Referring to the new miscalled McKenna duties and the new tax on silk, Lord Oxford said he would not labour the topic; it would be slaying the slain - unnecessary and almost vindictive cruelty. It was a monstrous thing for the Chancellor of the Exchequer to play this game of battledore and shuttlecock, because it unsettled trade. It was fatal to what was all important to our fiscal system - stability. To take industries like these and single them out from all other industries of the country for specially protective treatment was not a thing they would have expected from a Free Trade Chancellor.The Silk DutiesWith regard to the duty on silk, he could only say, with the fullest deliberation and with some small knowledge derived from experience of national finance, that he could net conceive an import duty possessing more vices. It was a tax on raw materials, and it was not only discouraging the growth of trade, but in­directly it would, if carried into law, have a very damaging effect on the whole of the textile industries of Great Britain. It was always the case when they began with one trade they would find half-a-dozen other trades were involved. It would further, by increasing the cost of articles, hamper our British manufacturers in competition with foreign producers in the extraneous markets of the world.Lord Oxford proceeded to inquire what was the need for the duties in question. The need, or the supposed need, he said, was because it was necessary to balance the Budget. That meant in plain language because it was necessary to provide money to meet expenditure. The capital figures involved in those duties were something like three million pounds in one case and seven million pounds in the other. Even if they could be realised, those figures were comparatively insignificant in these days.Our National ExpenditureWhat was far more important was the scale of the national expenditure. It was to meet that expenditure that the best part of seven hundred million pounds was to be exacted this year from the taxpayers of this country. That meant a gigantic de­pletion of the resources which would otherwise have been avail­able for the replacement and extension of capital, for the de­velopment of existing and of new industries, and - what was of vital importance to us at this moment - for a shrinkage in the ranks of unemployment.He wished to impress upon his fellow Liberals that what was needed in these days was not new taxation. \u2018The taxation we have got is hard enough to bear, and niggling expedients are nothing to the point. I say in all earnestness there is only one way of escape from our financial difficulties and dangers, and that is not by imposing taxation, but by cutting down expendi­ture.\u2019Lord Oxford described the expenditure on the Singapore base as panic-stricken. Singapore, he said, was turned down by the Labour Government, but even it succumbed to the construction of cruisers.The Pensions SchemeTurning to the Government\u2019s proposals for extending the pensions system, Lord Oxford said that Liberals had no hostility to the extension and completion of the pensions system. It was their system in every one of its branches. It was devised by Liberal statesmen and carried out by Liberal Houses of Commons. Why, therefore, should they be hostile?In the first glace he thought widows\u2019 pensions ought to be confined to widows with dependent children, but when they came to dependent children and orphan children he thought the scale proposed in the Government Bill was quite inadequate. He further thought it was open to grave doubt - perhaps more than doubt - whether the provision should cease at the age of 14. Certainly there was a strong case for continuing it to 16 if they were satisfied that during those two years the child was attending a really approved and recognised educational institution.The scheme was on a contributory basis, but for the time being to impose a fresh burden on industry was a very serious matter, and he should be quite prepared to accept a temporary abeyance of contribution and that the scheme should for the time being be financed by the State.The Country\u2019s NeedIt appeared to him that for the moment their problem as a party was twofold. In the first place it was to seek out and to discharge their function not of a Liberal Government, but of a Liberal Opposition. In the second place it was to prepare the electorate, by propaganda, by organisation, by ceaseless and well-combined work in the constituencies, to replace a Liberal Govern­ment in power and to give to that Government the strength to renew its suspended and interrupted tasks of whole-hearted Liberal policy.Therein lay the supreme and capital importance of building up their Million Fund. The immediate practical problem was to work for the reduction of every unnecessary and unproductive item in our national expenditure; next to resist at every stage any attempt, avowed or veiled, to foster British trade by the spurious stimulant and the impoverishing devices of Protection.The primary need at this moment was the revival of our ex­port trade. It could never be revived by crippling and curtailing exports.\u2018Piecemeal Protection is just as noxious as piecemeal Social­ism,\u2019 concluded Lord Oxford. \u2018Away with them both, and pre­serve for the country the freedom which it has won so dearly in every department, and not least in the department of industry - the freedom which is won so dearly, and which is the only enduring safeguard either for the wealth or for the happiness of our people.\u2019

aVMR. LLOYD GEORGE, who was received with great enthusiasm, said it was a real relief to come from the turbulent assembly in the House of Commons at which he was present the previous night to the more serene atmosphere of the well-behaved people in Margate. His first pleasant duty was to congratulate the National Liberal Federation on the great success of its meetings. He saw signs on all sides that the old spirit was thrilling the Liberal Party again.The Chairman, in the course of an eloquent speech, said Mr. Lloyd George, reminded us that this is the fiftieth anniversary of the birth of the National Liberal Federation. My memory goes back as far as that, and a little further, added Mr. Lloyd George. It was a time when things were not going too well for the party. The leaders were not agreed. That has never happened since. There were people at that time who said the Liberal Party was out of power for at least twenty years - the very wise people said fifty years. That was in 1877. Three years later the party won the most remarkable triumph in its history up to that date. That was worth making a note of.The first meeting of the Federation he attended - if they would allow him to be reminiscent: it was the privilege of grey-hairs - was thirty-eight years ago, in Manchester, he believed. Mr. Gladstone, Mr. John Morley, Sir William Harcourt, Sir George Trevelyan, and all that brilliant array of Liberal leaders were there. That was the first meeting of the Federation he (Mr. Lloyd George) attended. He was present also at the meeting in 1892 at Newcastle, where the Federation forced a great constructive programme upon the leaders of the party, the items of that programme including Home Rule, Welsh Disestablishment, the abolition of plural voting, the veto of the Lords, payment of Members, allotments, and small-holdings, and local option. Every one of those items had been carried in whole or in part, because even local option had been carried for Scotland. They had tried it on the Scotsmen first, and they liked it - in principle. All those measures had been carried, and he was proud of the fact that, so far as the first four of them were con­cerned, he was the Minister who took a leading part in placing them on the Statute Book.The Chairman had told them what a difference it would have made had Home Rule been carried when first proposed by that great statesman Mr. Gladstone. There was one thing not clear to the minds of the people of this country, but which was nevertheless a fact - it was thoroughly known by those who were Liberal Ministers in August, 1914. He doubted if Home Rule had been on the Statute Book that we would have ever had the Great War. It was the quarrel over Home Rule, the divisions in the country, the threat of civil war as reported in Germany by the Ambassador that induced the German military staff to come to the conclusion that Britain was out of the reckoning, and, therefore, Germany could crush France and Belgium. Had Home Rule been on the Statute Book, and had the nation been united, Germany would have considered it, not once, but two or three times, before pre­cipitating Europe into a bloody conflict that brought ruin upon themselves. If the voice of the leaders of the Liberal Party had been listened to, it was counsel which would have saved the world from its greatest catastrophe for centuries.The Fortunes of LiberalismSince Home Rule was introduced, said Mr. Lloyd George, the Liberal Party had passed through many vicissitudes. They had had three or four major splits and a multitude of minor ones, but they were all happily healed. Mr. Lloyd George referred to the great success of the party in 1906, after the period of greatest dis­sensions in the party. Mr. Lloyd George said that as they swept the country then they would do it again. There are differences now, he proceeded. I do not mean differences among ourselves, but in the political situation. Then we had two parties. Now we have three. That has obvious disadvantages, but it has some advantages too. I will tell you one. It emphasises the fact that our party is the one party to secure safe and steady progress. One party is on the brink of the precipice here, and the other party is on the brink of the precipice there. We are the only party walking on the safe path.We have two years in which to work. It is not a bit too long. There are people who talk about an immediate general election. Naturally I do not know. I do not think Ministers themselves know. I doubt if the Prime Minister knows. He never knows many minutes in advance what he is going to do. I have heard people say that the Trade Unions Bill and the break with Russia mean a dissolution. Well, I think you had better wait until Market Bosworth comes in. I am making no prediction, but I shall be surprised if whatever the result is it will encourage the Tory Party towards a dissolution.The long drought is over. The Liberal Party has had two refreshing showers - Leith in the north and Southwark in the south. It has rained victories on the unjust for a long time. Now the just are going to have a shower. The cracks in the Liberal garden are beginning to disappear. The nation had arrived at a time of great emergency, and the nation would want the party it could trust to bring it through. The Tories had had a chance of doing what they liked, and the country had seen how it was done.Labour DissentionsThe Labour Party, said Mr. Lloyd George, were in office for a short time, but long enough to show that they had no message for a distracted nation. They were a party which voiced discontent, but a grumble was not a gospel. There were essentially two parties in the Labour Party - the Trade Union Party and the Socialist Party, and there was no real agreement between them on any remedies. They had no real common creed, but a faith cure without a faith. The country had seen enough when in difficulty, and when there were obstacles to surmount that would baffle the best brains in the country, that the Labour Party was not the one to call in. They might be called in in quiet times, when there was nothing doing.Conservative BlunderingAs for the Conservatives, continued Mr. Lloyd George, they were tumbling downstairs from blunder to blunder. The Prime Minister had preached \u2018Peace in our time, O Lord,\u2019 and then brought in a Trade Unions Bill which excited more class animosity than any Bill of modern times. The Bill is an example of extreme foolishness. Whatever might be thought of the Bill, to have brought it in when things were settling down, when there was a manifest improvement in the relations between capital and labour in many directions, and when there was a real desire to settle down, and co-operate, was an act of supreme foolishness. They had created a position in which there was one law for the capitalist and employer and another for the workmen - a fatal thing to do, and a disgraceful act on the part of any Government. The clause regarding the political levy was drafted in such a way as to give the impression that where there were associations of workmen the full force of the Act would tell against them; but it was not so clear that it would apply to such associations as that of the brewers or the Federation of British Industries, and bodies of that kind.Again, the Government expressed a desire for peace in the world, and had erected a new shrine to peace in the mountains of the Alps at Locarno. He was quite prepared to worship at that shrine, but, whilst they were building it, the Government quarrelled with two of the greatest countries in the world - countries which covered half Europe and half Asia and embraced one-third of the population of the world, namely, Russia and China.Even on the question of the gold standard, which was in itself quite a desirable thing, the Government acted precipitately and without consulting the various industries which would be affected. They never considered for a moment what the effect would be on our export trade.When there was trouble in the coal-mining the Government managed to act in such a way that English coal cost about 1s. 6d. a ton more than any other, and the consequence was that England was, therefore, thrust out of the world\u2019s coal market in many places. The whole thing was done in such a way as to precipitate a rupture. When the rupture came, the Government had a great lead from the Report issued by Sir Herbert Samuel. It was rather significant that when they got into a difficulty, the Government came to the Liberals to get them out of it; and three of the four men who assisted with the matter were Liberals.The Government were given a very definite lead by the Coal Commission. But what happened was that first the Government said they would do it; the next day they said they would not; the third day they said they would; and the next day they decided to half do it. In the meantime the stoppage went on month after month, and what should have taken at the most two or three months to settle lasted seven months. Everyone knew, and the speaker, who had had a good deal of experience in such matters knew, very well that in trade disputes the most important thing to do was to get on a clear, definite line as to the basis of settle­ment and what they were prepared to stand by.The Break with RussiaContinuing, Mr. Lloyd George said that Russia provided another good illustration of the Government\u2019s method, or lack of method. This, he said, is a very serious business. To have a diplomatic rupture with one of the greatest powers in the world is a very serious business. It is not a thing to throw caps about: it is a thing to bend the knees about. It is a quarrel between two of the biggest nations on earth - that is what it is. You never know what its repercussions will be, especially with a Govern­ment that is always slithering into positions which it never dreamed of getting into. There had been plenty of reasons for quarrelling with Russia in the past, had we wanted to. The country had the same reasons for quarrelling with her in 1921 and 1922, but he (Mr. Lloyd George) then decided that it was not good for the peace of the world or in the interests of Britain to do so. In 1923 there were plenty of reasons for quarrelling with Russia, but the Tory Government of the day - he thought Mr. Bonar Law was at its head - said, \u2018Although there are reasons for a quarrel, we don\u2019t think it wise to have one.\u2019 In 1924 the Labour Government came to the same conclusion. In 1925 the present Government also came to the same conclusion, and in February of this year, although they had plenty of reasons for quarrelling, they would not.Leaders of the Government in those days told the country that a quarrel in the then disturbed state of Europe was such a serious matter that they did not advise it. Nothing could be gained by it. Why had they quarrelled now? Quite frankly, they never intended it - they tumbled into it. The present trouble was an affair of the police. The Ministerial head of the police in the country has been made the director of the foreign policy of the country, and quite frankly he is not up to it. The most important decision made since August, 1914, was taken, and the Cabinet was never called together. Sir Austen Chamberlain was asked, the Home Secretary was asked, and the Prime Minister was asked about it, but not even those three were called together.          What an extraordinary Government, Mr. Lloyd George added. They decide upon a rupture with 150,000,000 of the most formidable people on earth, and only those who know what they did in the war, without arms, without rifles, without ammunition - they went into action against the greatest artillery in the world with sticks in their hands, and died valiantly at the word of their Czar - it is only those who read of them in dispatches at the time know what a formidable and what a valiant people they are.Mr. Lloyd, George referred to the agreement for which, with Sir Robert Horne, he was proud to have been responsible, and which made possible with Russia a trade of £180,000,000 per annum. In the House of Commons the previous night there was an admission by one of the directors of the Midland Bank that he had made arrangements to credit his English traders for orders to the extent of £10,000,000.           Disadvantages of the BreakRussia could not, said Mr. Lloyd George, be described as a trade rival of England. Russia was not producing the same things that we were. Russia was producing the raw materials which England could not produce and materials which we could not buy elsewhere - hides and cereals, and platinum, and timber, and flax, especially flax. He remembered what a shortage of flax there was immediately after the war. The Russians were supplying the very things that we needed, and we were producing the things that the Russians wanted.A VOICE: Does trade come before honour?MR. LLOYD GEORGE: Oh, no. Trade does not come before honour, but was not honour involved in 1923; was not honour involved in 1925; was not honour involved in 1926; and was not honour involved in February, 1927? And Lord Balfour - one of the most honourable men in this country - said then in the House of Lords, \u2018Although this trade agreement is broken, I say to you it is not in the interests of the peace of the world that you should have a rupture with this great people.\u2019  Now, said Mr. Lloyd George, a disturbing element had been introduced into the peace of the world, and that was the most serious thing of all. Russia could do us more harm than any other country, and there was no other country which was so invulnerable except the United States of America. Russia could do us more harm in China, on our frontier, and in India than any other country. Suppose, he said, they intensify their propaganda. Suppose they increase the difficulties which they are making for us in China and on our frontier. There is nothing more left for England to do. England could not send back the Russian Ambas­sador, because he had gone. We could not recall our Ambassador, because he was on his way back. We have shot the last bolt, said Mr. Lloyd George, except the thunderbolt of war. What folly, what madness. Without thought, without consultation, simply because the Government has made a mistake. They said, \u2018save our faces we will put the country in jeopardy.\u2019 A little more patience would have saved the situation.A Change NeededMr. Lloyd George went on to say that the Government had made blunders during the strike, and another blunder had been made in regard to tackling the China situation. But the Govern­ment were able to defend every blunder in turn. The servant who broke crockery could defend each particular case, but people came to the conclusion that they would rather have a change.Sir Herbert Samuel, said Mr. Lloyd George, had undertaken the great task of reorganising the Liberal forces. As I have said before, he declared, whatever service I can render to assist him I am entirely at his command. What is much more important, I state solemnly here that I will place no obstacle in his way.The annual gathering of the National Liberal Federation was not merely a festival. Work was wanted; it was a council of war. Those who could speak - and there were lots of them - should go out and do so.An Appeal for Liberal WorkersContinuing, Mr. Lloyd George said: We really want speakers to speak who will undertake to do what the speakers of the Labour Party do; not merely say, \u2018What sort of a meeting are we going to get?\u2019 \u2018What sort of a hall is it?\u2019 and \u2018Will my speech be reported?\u2019 Get your audience for yourself: I have had to do so many a time, though others do it for me now. Labour speakers get a chair or a soap-box and put it in a convenient, or rather an inconvenient, place, get a man and a boy to hear them start, and gradually, through curiosity, they get a crowd. Sunday after Sun­day, I have seen this sort of thing happen. With a reasonable class of language, which would pass muster with the police, the speakers denounced everybody, and at the last general election that party polled five million, five thousand votes.You must, Mr. Lloyd George added, get men and women to speak who are prepared to take the risk of not having a good meeting. The task is not a pleasant one. We ought to have, just as the Labour Party has, thousands, many thousands, of young men and women who are prepared to take these risks, who are prepared to take the gospel of Liberalism, which I think is the gospel which will save this country, into the highways and byways. Help; don\u2019t think it is merely your duty to cheer. Work; we are right with our programme, and it is a constructive one. That is not electioneering, it is business.The ablest thinkers and the best economists of today were members of the Liberal Party. When the Liberals went into office they wanted to make sure that they had a programme of repara­tion for the countryside, the cleansing of the slums and the mean streets that are not fit for men and women to live in, the re-housing of millions of men, women, and children, the reinstatement of our homes, and the reduction of useless armaments.If, said Mr. Lloyd George in conclusion, we work hard, and work conscientiously, and with the devotion of a noble effort, then generations unborn will bless the Liberal Party that came into being in the third decade of the twentieth century.

aVI have to apologise for interrupting your agenda and for taking up a part of your morning conference, and I should not do so if I had not what is known in Parliamentary language as a definite matter of urgent public importance to put before you.We are on the eve of what may turn out to be one of the greatest and most momentous general elections in the history of the country, and there are questions which arise before the election and in reference to the conduct of the party after the election with regard to which it is well we should take counsel.We have had the group system in the Parliamentary affairs of this country for some time. It is difficult to predict what may happen in the future, but it looks as if it were to become an integral part of the democratic machinery of this land, at any rate, for a long time to come. Extremists to the Right and extremists to the Left will probably always have their separate organisations, and there will always be a body of sane opinion in the middle that will also seek definite expression. The problem in front of us is what will happen to us in the next Parliament if none of those groups is able to secure a definite majority that will enable them to form an Administration and to carry through their task during the lifetime of that Parliament.There has been a good deal of discussion on the subject. The Prime Minister, addressing a meeting in Yarmouth, issued a challenge to the Liberal Party as to what we should do if we were in a minority. Would it not be better that he should have answered that question himself? Is he not just as likely to be in a minority as any other party? If he is, will he support a Liberal Government or a Labour Government? I know which he would prefer, but he dare not say so. But we are just as entitled to ask the question of him as he is to address it to us.And the Socialists have been very busy discussing the same question, and rightfully so. It is a matter of growing urgency, and may become a very urgent problem in June of next year. It is right we should all be in a position to give our answer when the time comes. On the last occasion, owing to the action of Mr. Baldwin, that crisis was precipitated upon the parties without our being ready, and we had to come to our decisions in a hurry. Now we have plenty of time to think about it. Let us do so.Some of the Socialists are discussing it in a manner which is temperate, courteous, and fair. There are others who are exceed­ingly offensive. They rudely refuse invitations that were never extended to them. It will be time enough for them to answer, to refuse offensively, when they get a card from the Liberal Party with R.S.V.P. written on it. It has not been issued yet, but that does not prevent us from being alive to the importance of discuss­ing it among ourselves, or clearing our own minds so that when the crisis arises leaders will have the mind of the party upon the subject, and will be able to come to a clear, definite decision.A Question that must be FacedDuring the last few weeks more particularly the leaders of the party have been meeting to discuss the matter between themselves, and what I say about it will not be the expression of my own opinion, but the collective opinion of the leaders of the party. I know it would be very easy to shirk giving the answer. There is the famous answer given by Abraham Lincoln when he was asked what he would do in a certain contingency. He did not particularly want to answer, so he said: \u2018I never cross the Fox river until I come to it.\u2019 Well, I do not think that will do now. Candidates are being asked what we mean to do in certain contin­gencies. Liberal electors want to know, and the general electorate of this country, especially the wavering electorate which is terrified of Socialism, want to know what Liberals will do before they make up their minds. We propose to answer them, and I am going to ask your patience even if I refer more than I am in the habit of doing to notes, because this is an important occasion, and I want not only to weigh my words, carefully, but to give as careful expression to them as possible.Let us review the possibilities of the next general election. I am much too old a hand to commit myself to a forecast, especially under present conditions. If it were a straight fight I would predict to you that the Tory Party would not get 200 members in the next Parliament. But it will not be a straight fight.There are three predictions I will make. The first is that there will be an overwhelming majority of votes recorded in condemna­tion of the present Government. They are in a minority of a million now. There will be many more millions against them the next time. It will be an avalanche. The next prediction I make is that there will be an enormous accession of strength to the Liberal poll; and the third is that whatever party will be in a majority it will not be the Socialists.Our Grotesque Electoral SystemBut even if there is a sweeping reduction in the Tory poll and a doubling and trebling of the Liberal vote, that is no guarantee as to the composition of the next Parliament, and that is the new element of doubt which has been introduced. We have an anomalous, unjust, and grotesque electoral system which is a fraud and a mockery of democracy. Just look at it. In the present Parliament there is one Tory member for every nineteen thousand votes recorded at the last election. There is a Socialist member for every thirty-six thousand votes. There is a Liberal member for every seventy thousand votes. Under those conditions no one can judge what will happen with a system of that kind. In the South of England, as everybody knows, there are eleven counties, and for four hundred thousand votes recorded for the Liberals there is only one Liberal member. And if it had worked in the same sort of way in the rest of the country there is no reason why the remaining two and a half million votes should not have only four members. We were lucky enough to get forty. Really we might have got five.Under this system in the next general election nobody can tell which way it will work, whether for Liberals, whether for the Socialists, whether for the Conservatives. In 1923 there was one Liberal member for Manchester for every fourteen thousand Liberal votes and one Tory member for one hundred thousand votes. You never know how this special Providence will work.Next time the Liberals may have only a third of the members they would be entitled to in proportion to their votes, but they might have twice as many as they are entitled to. You cannot predict under those circumstances. This is not government, it is a gamble and, next time, who can tell? When that little ball stops rolling it may drop in the Liberal number. At the by-elections the Liberal strength is growing and the Conservative is waning, and the Labour strength is something in between the two. One of the most encouraging features of the last two years is that we have won five by-elections in triangular contests. The tide is rising. We were stranded on this sandbank in 1924, but the tide of sanity is rising, and next time it will enable the Liberal craft to float over the sandbanks and the reefs of the electoral system.They say, \u2018There is a difference between a by-election and a general election.\u2019 Don\u2019t I know it! There will be a difference this time, and I want to tell you why. When you come to a general election the electorate will be face to face with deciding who is to govern them for the next five years; whether they are going to renew the mandate, the trust, the authority of the people who have let the country down so badly, who have done nothing to pull it through our great trade emer­gency, and who have thoroughly muddled the cause of peace and disarmament in the world. They will hesitate, and they will look round, and they will say, \u2018What is the alternative?\u2019 They will look at the Socialists, and one look will be enough. They will pass by on the other side. And if the Socialists were the only alternative, I honestly believe the electors of this country would say, \u2018Well, all we can do is to put the other fellow in again and trust to Providence; a Providence that has extricated this old country very often from the muddles made by its Ministers and its statesmen, and which may help us through in spite of these muddlers.\u2019The Alternative GovernmentBut there is another alternative, and we have got to present it - the alternative in policy, the alternative in programme, the alter­native in a definite scheme of practical work to extricate the nation out of its difficulties. And I should like you to allow me one word on that. We do not dwell on our assets. We are a modest party. But I want to say this, that Liberalism can command a larger number of men of high distinction who can point to unchallenge­able success in responsible spheres of activity for their country than any other party in the State.I will just run over a few of the names. Lord Reading, one of the most successful leaders that this country ever had at a very critical moment. To his financial advice we owe more than I can tell you. As Viceroy in a critical moment he pulled us through very grave difficulties. There are men like Lord Beauchamp and Lord Buxton, who showed wisdom in positions demanding judgement, tact, and dexterity as Governors of some of our greatest Dominions. There is Sir Herbert Samuel, who achieved such success as the first Governor of probably the most renowned country in the world. And if you will allow me to say so, there is nothing I am prouder of than the fact that as Prime Minister I had the honour of recommending him to that post to the Crown. There is Sir John Simon, the greatest lawyer in the British Empire, who has been chosen by the present Government, who have on a second occasion shown their confidence in the Liberal leaders. In the first place, they did it for Sir Herbert Samuel and now for Sir John Simon by appointing him at the head of the Commission to decide, I should say, one of the most delicate and difficult problems of the Empire today. I had the pleasure of consult­ing him about this statement before he left for India, and he is in full accord. And then we have men who have held very high offices in the State, like Lord Grey, Mr. Runciman, and our Chairman (Sir Chas. Hobhouse), Mr. Macpherson, Dr. Macnamara, who was responsible for the whole present system of unemployed insur­ance, which, in my judgment, has saved a vast amount of suffering, and, I think, saved this country probably from revolution. And if there were testimonials required for another Liberal leader I could get a sheaf of them signed by some of the most distinguished members of the Tory Government today as to the services rendered by him to the Empire.There is no other party which can call together such an assembly of men for the direction of the affairs of the nation, who can show such a record of successful achievement in exalted and highly responsible positions. I challenge any of them to point to any Ministers either in the present Government or its predecessor who can show such a record. I can point to many who can claim honestly a record of failure which in its magnitude compares with the record of success of some of the gentlemen I have mentioned. So that superior people who write off the chances of Liberalism in a light-hearted way forget that these facts will be present to the minds of the electors of this country when they come to choose next time.That is why, as we approach the general election, in spite of one or two setbacks due to the group system, there is a growth of Liberal strength, especially the last year or two. I have never seen a horse race in my life, but I am going to do so next week for the first time. But I will tell you what I am told. There are men who can check me if I am wrong. Sometimes there is a great surprise; the horse that the knowing ones think will win is a way behind, and another horse not supposed to be in the running comes cantering in - owing to atmospheric conditions. There are certain conditions where stamina tells and the flashy ones are no good. You can see the horse at first a long way behind, nobody taking any note of him. You can see him coming along, coming along, and at last passing them one after the other, and getting past the winning-post first, to the dismay of all the experts. That is the Liberal horse. And the electioneering bookies are going to be let down pretty badly. In the last two years he has already passed the Labour horse; our figures are above it. Even in Cheltenham we left him a long way behind. Whatever happens in Tavistock, we shall have left the Labour horse behind. We will soon leave the other one behind.Possible Results of the ElectionSo I am not one of those who say that the Liberal Party has only to consider what it will do if it is only a little handful holding the balance between the other two parties. The other parties will have to consider what they propose to do with their balancing power. And there is another factor to which I would like to call your attention, which is encouraging. The larger the number of aggregate votes which a party gets the better its propor­tion of members. The Tory Party had more votes than anybody, the result was that it secured one member for every nineteen thousand. The Socialists come next with one member for thirty-six thousand. We come third in our aggregate poll, and we have only got one member for every seventy thousand votes, which means that if you increase the aggregate of your votes you increase the chances of getting a larger proportion of members.Let us have the possibilities. There are roughly only two possibilities: either one party will have a majority over all the others or no party will have a majority, and those are the only two alternatives. There is a third possibility, or I should say certainty, and that is that one of the parties without having a majority will have a larger following than either of the other two.Let us say that the Liberal Party get the largest number of votes. Then we will have a Liberal Government, and we shall have Liberal measures. We shall have a Liberal spirit in administration at home and abroad. We shall have national and inter­national peace dealt with on Liberal lines. We shall have a policy of peace and disarmament, of economy in expenditure, of develop­ment of our national resources leading to the permanent enrichment of the land, and at the end of five years the nation will bless the chance that gave them a Liberal Government.If Liberals have the largest party they will also form the administration and submit their policy and their programme of work to the judgment of Parliament and the country. And if they are turned out by a combination of Tories and Socialists they will know what to do. Believe me, if there is a combination of Socialists and Tories in the next Parliament it will not be the first time you have had it, either in Parliament or out of Parliament. You will not hear very much said about that, but it would be the realisation of a dream of Mr. Ramsay MacDonald, who once upon a time said he had a natural affinity for the Tories because they were gentlemen. And if there is a Liberal Government in power those gentlemen of England, Tories and Socialists together, will march arm in arm through the lobby to turn it out. I should like to see that.Now, these considerations can apply to any party that has a majority or is the largest party. If the Tories have a majority they will form a Tory Government, and we will have to put up with it and survive it as best we can, and if they have the largest party and will form a Government the same thing applies to the Socialists. So that therefore there is no difficulty about these things. The one difficulty is the case of deadlock.What if there is a Deadlock?What the nation wants to know is what will be the attitude of Liberalism in that event - if you had a complete deadlock in Parliament. The Socialists have already given their answer. They have made it clear that under no conditions will they associate or co-operate or enter into any compact or understanding with Liberals unless they swallow Socialism, horns, hoofs, and all. We say at once we are not there, we never shall be there, unless we cease to be Liberals. Socialists are not equally emphatic about what they will do with the Tories.A Socialist leader the other day said that if the Socialists entered into any compact with the Liberals, that is the straight way to Fascism. That is wrong historically. How did Fascism arise? It has its lesson for us in certain eventualities. There was a failure of the groups in the Italian Parliament, and notably of the Progressive groups, to form a Government at all. There were gaps and intervals of weeks, and that led straight to a dictatorship. Liberals have the supreme trust of safeguarding democracy, and they must see that does not happen.There can be no doubt as to the attitude of the Liberal Party under those circumstances. The Liberal Party may be relied upon in that case to determine its course in reference to one considera­tion and one only, and that is what will be best in the interests of the country. It will realise that the King\u2019s Government must be carried on and that there must be no paralysis of the Government of this country. In the highest, and not in the blatant, sense the Liberal is a patriotic party. It does not wrap itself in the Union Jack or stick its plum puddings with little flags. Nevertheless, it is essentially a patriotic party, and when another party claims a monopoly of patriotism we regard it as a piece of impertinence. We have a special reason as Liberals for pride in Britain and her Empire. What is best, what is noblest, what is most enduring in that Empire is something that was brought into it by the efforts of three hundred years of Liberalism in its free institutions, in its free trade, in the condition of the people and the relation of one part of the Empire to another and to the Mother Country, in the very fact that our great Dominions are in the Empire at all. The pillars of British strength have been hewn out of the Liberal quarry by Liberal hands. It is a Liberal Empire, and Liberals therefore have a special responsibility to see the structure is not impaired by any friction or any partisanship on their part.And, whatever Parliamentary conditions may be, as far as lies in the power of the Liberal Party they will see that the King\u2019s Gov­ernment is carried on. If they cannot form a Government of their own, and if, unfortunately, the alternative should be either a Tory or a Socialist Government, although I am not so much concerned with which of these parties is in power - it is only a choice of two evils in the end - our main concern will be what they will do or fail to do. We are neither Socialists nor Tories, but Liberals, and as such are equally opposed to both, and have no particular preference for either. There are historical cases of men showing great anxiety as to the method of their execution, but if the prosperity and well­being of this country is to fall into the hands of either of these two Governments - well, Liberals will have very little to choose between strangling prosperity with a rope of tariffs or drawing and quartering it with Socialism. And therefore our task will be to do our best to minimise the amount and circumscribe the area of the mischief which they will render and to do all in our power to extract the maximum of good out of an unpropitious situation.But I am not without hope that if there be a deadlock the common sense of this nation, which is, after all, the greatest demo­cratic community in the world and the one country in the world that thoroughly understands democratic institutions, that its common sense will prevail over all party considerations, and that we shall always realise the gravity of the emergency through which the country is passing. We cannot, of course, whatever befall us, enter into any understanding, formal or informal, with another party under any circumstances to advance measures or policies in which we disbelieve and which we in our hearts know to be detri­mental to the interests of our country.For instance, whatever Government is in power we shall resist every effort to overthrow the great fiscal system upon which the trade and commerce of this country have been built. In spite of its depression, it has the greatest international trade in the world. Other nations at Geneva admit regretfully that our policy is the right one, but they cannot get their feet out of the tariff stocks.We shall resist every attempt to set up what is known as a Socialist State and to substitute the nationalisation of all the means of production, distribution, and exchange for private enterprise. This we shall resist.The Conditions of Co-operationBut I am not blind to the fact, and I even rejoice in it, that even if a Liberal Government as such were not obtainable next Parliament owing to the operation of our electoral system, there is a vast and fertile territory common to men of progressive minds in all parties which they could, at any rate during this interval, agree to cultivate together without abandoning any of the principles and ideals which they cherish. But under these circumstances the conditions of co-operation and understanding must be honourable to all and humiliating to none. Those who were in the 1924 Parliament know what I mean. But let me say for once and for all, as far as I am concerned - and this is the view of the Liberal leaders I have consulted - we shall decidedly and emphatically decline to admit the possibility of the experiment of 1924 which proved so disastrous. It was only justifiable as an experiment, and history may or may not say it was necessary as such. It was no fault of ours that it failed. But it cannot be repeated.In my judgment the Socialist leaders, by their ineptitude then, threw away the last chances they will get in this generation of forming and carrying through a Socialist Administration. They have no reasonable hope of securing a Socialist majority in our time, and I cannot see Liberals, after the unfortunate experience of the past, again taking the risk of committing the life and fortunes of their party so completely to the keeping of any other party, be it Tory or Socialist.A prominent Labour leader, in one of his articles the other day, made it clear what he thinks will happen. He assumes that if we are in a minority we will help the Socialists into power, but once they are there this great Government will introduce measures of such beneficence that we dare not resist them, and we shall be unwillingly chained to the Socialist chariot to the end of Parliament and then will be comfortably put away. In vain is the net spread in the sight of a bird caught in the same net before and escaping with his life, but leaving a good many of his feathers behind. That is my answer to that gentleman.An Independent PartyThe question of our best course to pursue in a particular junc­ture, or in a particular Parliamentary situation, or on a particular Parliamentary occasion must be left necessarily to consultation amongst the chosen leaders of the party at the time. You cannot dictate or decide this in advance. We must judge them at the time. It would be folly to try now to determine. We can only make our general position clear. We shall fight the general election as an independent party. We shall act together in the next Parliament as an independent party. Our main concern will be to consider the best method of advancing certain ideas and promoting certain practical measures which we regard as being essential to the well-being of the nation, the advancement of the cause of peace, the pressing of a general measure of disarmament as the only security for peace, the grappling with the national emergency with a view to the improvement of trade and employ­ment. This will include comprehensive measures for recondi­tioning the country, the development of our national resources in and under the soil, the cleansing of the land of slums, the solution of the problems of transport, and measures of temperance reform. We shall claim the full and free right to censure incompetent Ministers either by speeches or by votes in the lobby, whatever the consequences may be, and whether it be Tory or Socialist or anybody else.And we shall certainly insist with all our strength upon the next Parliament dealing with the outrageous electoral system, which robs millions of good citizens in this country of their fair share of government. We must have a system to enable the will of the people to be fairly expressed in the House. We claim nothing but justice. Quite frankly, neither of the other two parties understands political justice. The Tories and the Socialists alike laugh when we present our case for redress - the fact that we cannot get one-fourth of representation for our voters that the Tories get, who have one man for every nineteen thousand voters, while we must have seventy thousand Liberals to return one Parliamentary representa­tive. They know it is unfair, but they profit by it. Fair play! It is quite unknown to either where their interests are involved. They are both essentially class parties. That is their strength, that is their weakness; both fighting for class advantages and privi­leges. Socialists are not fighting for the working classes. They are fighting for that proportion of the working classes that vote Socialist.The Liberal Party will Fight to WinAnd I want to say one thing further. After my close observa­tion of what has been going on in the country and in Parliament we must expect no quarter from either of those parties, and we do not ask for it. I can see them conspiring and intriguing, separately and together, to destroy Liberalism in Parliament and out of Parliament. I have seen it in the House of Commons these last four years. We have a small party. We are only entitled to very limited opportunities for raising discussions. I have seen the Tory Party and the Socialist Party meeting behind the Speaker\u2019s chair to deprive our little party of the limited opportunities they have for discussion. And the meaner of the two is the Socialist. I have seen where the Socialist and Tory Whips agreed together to closure a debate on an important financial matter imposing new taxes merely to prevent Liberals from taking part in that discus­sion. I have given the challenge. If they deny it I will give several illustrations. I throw the challenge out here and now.In the country there is no doubt they are working together. Why do I say that? If you notice the seats where the Liberals in a straight fight would have an absolute certainty of winning, and both the other parties know they would win, what happens? Even although the Labour Party knows perfectly well they have no chance of getting anywhere near, they put up a candidate to wreck our chances, and the Tories return the compliment by putting candidates in places where they have no chance. In Middles­brough, in Halifax they had no chance, and the Tory Party preferred letting Labour in. Why are they playing into each other\u2019s hands? I can see it in my own county. There is a Labour candidate in the county seat who has no chance in a straight fight, and so the Tories, who will barely escape without paying a forfeit and who have not the ghost of a chance, are putting a Tory candi­date up to help him. And there can be no possible purpose except to put the Labour man in instead of the Liberal for that constituency. In my constituency Labour returns the compliment by putting up a candidate to help the Tory win that seat.They are playing into each other\u2019s hands like this all over the country, and the Socialists and the Tories say, \u2018Look at those Liberals; they cannot last.\u2019 They are people who like to talk like that. They are conspiring all over the country in and out of Parliament.I have seen it in Tavistock, their abuse of Liberals and their respect for Labour leaders. They are combining to attack the Liberals because they think that they will then get Liberalism out of the way, and that it will then be Tory Government, Socialist Government, Socialist Government, Tory Government, and no Liberals to interfere with mismanagement, muddle, wrong policies. The country will have a choice of muddlers with no Liberals to interfere. And they say to each other, \u2018Keep it up. This party will disappear.\u2019 They tried that game, the Tories did, with Nonconformity. No careers for them, no bench of magistrates, nor any offices in the House of Commons, no entrance to the university, and even to this very hour there are thousands of schools maintained exclu­sively out of the rates where no Nonconformist can become even a pupil teacher. What did they say? \u2018Keep it up and Nonconformity will vanish.\u2019 Its altars call for the devotion of more millions than ever. We have got the same game with Liberalism. They said: \u2018Keep them out of Parliament, keep them out of office. See they do not get in. You play the game here and we will play the game there, and in some places we will play it together. We will squeeze them out.\u2019 No they will not, ever. They do not understand the breed of Liberalism. We shall fight in the next election, we shall fight in the next Parliament. If necessary, Liberals will go on fighting one, two, three Parliaments, yea twenty, if necessary. In the end they will triumph, for their cause is the cause of right and of reason.

aVWe are here tonight as part of the army of 5,300,000 men and women who were mobilised under the Liberal flag a few weeks ago at the General Election, the largest poll ever recorded for the Liberal Party, and it will be bigger next time.It is true that the members of the House of Commons are no indication of the proportion of the electorate which we secured, for as some speakers pointed out here today, each member of the Liberal Party in the House represented three times as many votes as each member of the Labour Party. And it fills us with pride to realise that we are three times better men than either the Conservatives or Labour.The Socialist Government and its PredecessorWe have got a Socialist Government in power again. Who put them there? And what are they doing?I am going to deal more particularly with the first question. Although not very important at the moment it will be very much more important in a year or two. When driving about the country during the last election I saw great posters which said \u2018The Liberals put the Socialists in in 1924. They will do the same thing again.\u2019They did not. Who put them in? There was an Anti-Socialist majority of six millions. Mr. Baldwin knew that, but he was in such a hurry to put his Socialist friends in that he could not wait, for 24 hours even, to consult with the representatives of 5,300,000 non-Socialist electors who had voted Liberal. If the Socialists succeed - well, we shall have to thank Mr. Baldwin. But he would not get the credit. If they failed there would be another poster \u2018He put the Socialists into power\u2019 and at the end \u2018Vote Liberal.\u2019The next question was \u2018How are they doing?\u2019 It was early days yet. They had been singularly fortunate in their predecessors. He read a very witty article in an independent Conservative paper that week. \u2018We do not for one moment believe (ran the article) that this is the best of all Governments. We are uncertain in spite of what it has accomplished. It is a good Government, but let Mr. Chamberlain make no mistake, it is a magnificent Government com­pared with the last.\u2019The Conservative paper concludes: \u2018The country has no certainty that it is going to live happy ever afterwards in a Socialistic regime, but, quite frankly, it has felt a lot better since putting the last Government out.\u2019\u2018But still,\u2019 continued Mr. Lloyd George, \u2018we must not forget what the last Government was like. You must not speak evil of the dead, but if the dead expect to come back to life in another couple of years, and afflict us again, it\u2019s just as well you should examine something of their record.It was the poorest thing in the way of a government I had seen in my time. No department tackled its jobs - mines, agricul­ture, trade, the department of health, labour, go through them one by one, transport - they never tackled a single job. They never faced a single problem.They did not even seem to realise what was going on. All the staple industries of the country were suffering - textiles, coal, engineering, shipbuilding - go through them all. They were quite oblivious. The crushing taxation, the estrangement with America, the prestige of the country going down throughout the world. They had no conception.They thought things were going fine, and they said: \u2018See what we are doing.\u2019The fact of the matter is, it was not so much a Cabinet as a kind of opium den. Drowsy, dreamy, oblivious to all realities; supinely and stupidly happy, thinking all things were well; very pleased with themselves! It is only now when it is over that they have collapsed.And even now the fumes have not evaporated.Read that speech of Mr. Neville Chamberlain\u2019s, who said: \u2018It\u2019s all right: if they misbehave I will slap them.\u2019Take the Bank rate. It all had its origin in that foolish settlement by Mr. Baldwin of the American debt - which burdened us with £38,000,000 gold payment every year before we had made any settlement for the moneys that were due to us from others.We have already paid over £200,000,000 in gold. The French waited for a better opportunity. The result is they have £300,000,000 of gold now and we have £130,000,000, and it was coming down rapidly.It is well that the public should keep in mind the fact that the members of the late Government believe that they are the only alternative to the Labour Government. In 1924 the country had had no experience of a Conservative Government. They have now had five years\u2019 experience, and they know what it is like, so that when the Socialists\u2019 time is come for them to put in their ticket, the country must be taught to look for something better to succeed them than the late Tory administration.The Government\u2019s Foreign PolicyHow are the Tories\u2019 successors shaping? I am going to talk fairly and quite frankly about that. Take what they have done. If you take what was done at The Hague, I have nothing but unqualified commendation, praise and admiration for that. The Liberal Party first raised the issue in the House of Commons, but still that does not rob Mr. Snowden of his share of the credit.Mr. Lloyd George went on to say that Mr. Snowden showed great courage and resolution in face of great difficulties. \u2018And perhaps the greatest difficulties of all did not come from foreign Powers but from much nearer home.I am glad he did it because of the selfish French policy which was damaging British credit. So I give him full marks for that.Now with regard to the Optional Clause, that ought to have gone through before. There should have been no hesitation about it. It was part of our programme at the last election, and I cannot conceive of any hesitation. I am delighted that it was achieved.As to evacuation - by the Treaty of Versailles - and I do know something about that because I was there for months framing it - the French, the Belgians and ourselves were to evacuate the Rhine­land the moment Germany was carrying out the Treaty.She was carrying out the Treaty - and it is acknowledged she was - when she was permitted to enter the League of Nations. It was a dishonourable thing to have remained there a single hour after that. And there again - full marks!Tribute to Herr StresemannMay I just in passing say with what deep distress I heard of the death of Herr Stresemann. I never had the privilege of meet­ing him. I think there were three great European figures I never had the honour of meeting. Herr Stresemann, Mussolini and that other great figure - you may disagree with me - Lenin.He was a great man, Herr Stresemann. He was a man who faced great unpopularity, faced the taunt that he was unpatriotic when he was struggling for European peace. He faced it bravely when his health was completely broken, and he fought right to the end. May God rest his soul.RussiaAs to Russia - well, I am glad that they have repaired the blunder - the silly blunder committed by the late Government. You cannot expect quite the same rule of conduct from a revolutionary Government as you can from a settled Government. You cannot expect men in a fever to behave quite normally. It is in the interests of the peoples of the world not merely in the interests of the peoples of Russia, but of all nations, that you should bring them into the comity of nations and gradually accustom them to the methods of a more normal civilisation. Therefore it would have been wisdom on our part to overlook a few errors of judgment - he would not call them breaches of faith. The French are doing it, the Poles are doing it, the Germans are doing it.But all I can say is why did not the present Government do it two or three months ago?They entered into the negotiations with regard to questions which had not been settled. Why did they not go on with this and other outstanding questions. I am glad that Mr. Henderson has repaired the error of Sir Joynson Hicks and also his own blunder. Not quite full marks for that!Misgivings about EgyptThen there was Egypt. He was full of misgivings about that settlement. It had had the effect of adding another desert which they had got to occupy, and there was the effect it would have when, later, they would have to enter into negotiations with the great people of Hindustan. Neither would it make Sir John Simon\u2019s task as easy as if they had not been so precipitate in dealing with a position of that character.India and the Simon CommissionI would also like to issue one word of warning about India itself. I see in the Daily News of Thursday that there is some talk of dominion status for India, and there is a letter from the Secretary of State for India which is a rather remarkable and disturbing letter. He says he has been working hard daily for four months, going over the ground, and he thinks he will be able to contribute something to Indian policy which is in harmony with the ideals of the Labour Party. And he says he has a united Cabinet behind him.Well, you must bear in mind that there is a very important and influential commission with Sir John Simon, one of the ablest jurists in the Empire, at the head of it. It was appointed with the full consent of the Labour Party. They placed two members on that Commission. They have worked hard in the face of very real and dangerous risks to their own lives.They are now approaching the stage when they will come to some definite conclusions and recommend them to the Govern­ment. Surely the Government will not form their judgment or make their contribution according to Labour ideals until first of all they have heard what is the report of this influential and able Commission.Well now, I thought it necessary just to say one word upon that, and we will suspend our marks until we see what they do.PalestineWith regard to Palestine, they were undoubtedly caught napping, and I am not disposed to criticise them very severely for that reason. They had not been in power very long before the trouble began, but they were undoubtedly unprepared. I am much more inclined to blame their predecessors.Had not a small mobile force, which was not expensive, been taken away, he thought there would have been no disturbances, or at any rate no massacre.This question was of great international character. There were Jews in every country, and the Commission of Enquiry should command not only the confidence of people at home, but from its constitution and membership the respect and confidence of other nations as well. The report of the Commission would probably be the basis of action in the future. It was a great pity they had appointed a weak Commission instead of taking time to confer with other parties, because, after all, they were a minority Government.DisarmamentDealing with disarmament, Mr. Lloyd George said that he rejoiced heartily in the steps that had been taken in re-establishing good relations with the United States of America, and from the bottom of his heart wished well to the mission of the Prime Minister. The whole peace of the world depended upon whether disarmament was a reality and not a sham.First of all there was naval disarmament. It was vital that there should be an understanding between the two greatest naval powers in the world - the British Empire, and the United States of America. The success of the efforts at such disarmament did not, however, depend on the mission to America, but on the Five Powers\u2019 Conference which would take place a few months hence.A more important part of disarmament to which he called attention last year at Yarmouth, was the land and air armaments. He then pointed out that the victorious Powers had given an undertaking that if Germany reduced her forces to the figure in the Treaty of Versailles, i.e., 100,000, they would reduce their forces alike to the lowest proportions consistent with security. That was 10 years ago. What reductions had been effected?We proceeded at once to carry out our part, and also entered into negotiations with America for the reducing of naval armaments and at that conference such armaments were reduced by 1,800,000 tons. What had been done beyond that? Let people examine the position in regard to men. Germany had reduced her gigantic army of millions to 100,000, and at the present moment had 98,000. France\u2019s total effective peace establishment was 614,000, but her reserves of trained men were 3,000,000, so that in the event of war she would have 3,614,000, and Germany 100,000. That was what was called reducing the Army to the minimum consistent with security.Now let us turn to munitions. No army is of any use as a fighting machine unless effectively equipped - thus the possession of equipment is a vital factor in war, and the reduction or absence of equipment an equally vital factor for peace.The Russian Army was one of the bravest in the field. There had never been anything to exceed their gallant daring. They went with sticks in their hands to fight those with rifles, bayonets, and machine guns under the terrible cannons of Germany. What happened? Although they were trained, although their bravery was superlative and their sacrifices were enormous, they were beaten down. It was two years after we entered the war that we could equip those men. Had we been able to equip the Russian Army the war would have been over in 1916.At the beginning of the war we had 1,955 machine guns, and during the war we manufactured 210,000. At the beginning we had 800,000 rifles, and at the end we had 5,316,000. Except those that were destroyed in the war, they were all there now. At the Armistice Germany handed over 107,000 machine guns, 6,000,000 rifles, and 83,000 cannon. They were all broken into scrap iron, and the rest ought to be. The French equipment was almost as great as the German was formerly, and the Italian equipment was also enormous. What was still worse, this machinery of destruction had been \u2018perfected\u2019 since the war.All this in spite of the fact that the Treaty of Versailles, and the Covenant of the League of Nations, which were signed by all the great powers of the world, and which dictated conditions to Germany as to her disarmament, contained a pledge that if Germany observed the conditions imposed upon her the other parties to these documents would reduce their armaments to the minimum compatible with security.They call this \u2018reducing armaments to the minimum.\u2019 It was a farce, a dishonour, and a menace. Viscount Cecil had put up a gallant fight for disarmament at Geneva. He had met great opposition and the abuse of the Continental Press. It was after Mr. Macdonald and Mr. Henderson had left, but they ought to have put up that fight. He was not in the least disparaging Lord Cecil, for he was a man for whom he had a very great respect.He had ability, a great courage, and was respected by all parties in the country, in Europe as well, and in America. But he held no official position, for he only represented the Government in the sense that he was a delegate sent there. The Prime Minister should have dealt with this before he left the conference.It is a case that ought to have been presented with the full force and influence of the British Government. It was a British Prime Minister who signed that undertaking. The Prime Ministers of the Dominions signed it. The British Parliament passed it and inscribed it on the Statute Book of the realm.All parties to the Treaty were bound equally in honour. A wrong has been committed against one party to the Treaty and no man who cannot speak with authority in the name of the nation can see that wrong righted, can see that pledge redeemed, can see the British name and the British honour is untarnished.You must all take risks for the purpose of seeing that our honour is kept untarnished. As long as those gigantic guns are ready to be rolled into the battlefield, those rattling machine-guns that crackle death - as long as they are there peace is a very poor thing.Do you think they are going to refer vital issues to arbitration when they have got 4,000,000 men behind them and 50,000 heavy guns, and only 100,000 on the other side and no guns?It means, I tell you, that so long as the deadly instruments of war exist there will be no peace on earth or goodwill amongst men. It is too serious to criticise the Government.I say here in this Liberal meeting that I appeal to the Government, to its head and to the Foreign Minister, not to leave the matter merely to Lord Cecil but to back him up in his effort.Home Affairs - Unemployment, etc.Turning to home affairs, Mr. Lloyd George said here the Government had not done so well. The Labour Conference apparently agreed with the National Liberal Federation as to their failure on the home front.Proceeding, Mr. Lloyd George said that Socialism would not eliminate or provide remedies for the great troubles of the nation. There was unemployment. It had increased by 62,000 since the Socialist Government came into power. Unemployment is a terrible curse. There was the question of the congested areas in our great cities to be dealt with. Then there was the question of the mines - aggravated by the refusal to accept the Liberal Party\u2019s practical proposals made several times during the last ten years.Mr. Lloyd George suggested his hearers should look back at their old newspapers and find out what was offered in 1919, 1920, 1921, and afterwards in 1925 by the Samuel Commission.And look at what they are getting from the Labour Government - after great schemes which would have put the whole situation of the mines right had been repeatedly rejected by the Labour Party who had said \u2018No, we will have nothing but nationalisation!\u2019The Labour Government is not going to propose Nationalisation, but is going to propose something which will be less than they could have had but rejected ten years ago.Then there was the problem of the decay of the countryside, the great and growing difficulty of the traffic on our roads, improvements in the efficiency of our industries, and the great problem of making the best use of the natural resources of this country in men and material.It was the one issue that we concentrated upon during the War - how we were to make the best use of our men and material for war. When are we going to put the same question to ourselves in peace?Mr. Thomas took the lead at the General Election in abusing the Liberal plans. He called them juggling, cheating, and lying, excelling himself in the language he used. And there\u2019s no man who can use such language so well. He\u2019s strong in language, but very weak in action.Mr. Thomas had not the courage to admit he was wrong, and the Liberals were right, but each day he would realise more and more that the Liberal plans were not improvised, that we had consulted the best business men and the best experts, and we had put them forward after years of consideration. He won\u2019t admit it, and the result is he is going blindly headlong to destruction.\u2018Our plan,\u2019 said Mr. Lloyd George in conclusion, \u2018holds the field. If they refuse to adopt it they will inevitably fail. If they accept it they will succeed, if they know how to carry it out, and we will demand to know why they abused it at the election.Meanwhile, we shall continue in the House of Commons with the very able party we have got there - and when the time comes we shall ask with confidence the electors of this country to return to power the only party that thought out the real remedies for dealing with the great social and economic evils that has afflicted this country, one of the greatest of which is the crying evil of unemployment.\u2019

aVI join with our Chairman in congratulating the Federation on one of the best gatherings it has been my privilege to attend. You seem to be here in very good numbers and even better spirits. I am afraid I shall have to beg your indulgence very considerably this morning, because it is my duty to review the very grave position of industry and employment, and indicate to you what, in the judgment not merely of myself but of my colleagues, will be the best contribution towards the solution of these serious problems. As you are aware, the head of the present Government was good enough to invite the co-operation of the other two parties. In my judgment the head of the Government took the right step. There is a national emergency, and men without distinction of party ought to give any assistance to the King\u2019s Government in extricating the nation from its present difficulty. The Party in the House of Commons appointed Lord Lothian - whom I am delighted to see present for the first time at an Annual Meeting of the National Liberal Federation - Mr. Seebohm Rowntree and myself to meet representatives of the Government. I don\u2019t know that any particular gratitude has been indicated to us. We met the representatives of the Government, and even gave up our holiday for that purpose. Let me sketch out how the matter appears to us. We are here representing one-fourth of this nation, a fact which is obscured by our representation in the House of Commons which has no relation to our strength in the country. If we were represented in Parliament on fair and honest principles we should have, not 58, but 141 members in the House of Commons. The millions we represent are bound up individually and collectively with the well-being of Britain, proud of its greatness, and deeply concerned about any condition of things which will effect its prosperity and lower its power and influence in the world. As such, we view the present state and prospect of our country, not as political partisans, but as patriotic members of a great community. It is very easy to make political capital out of the present state of the nation. It was never easier and never more tempting. Think, for instance, of the five and half years of Tory rule with its unbroken record of depression and unemployment; how they not only missed every opportunity of putting things right, failing even to apply remedies which they, themselves, believed in, but actually aggravated the difficulties by a series of in­conceivable blunders over gold, the American debt, the mines, rubber, agriculture, and finance. We are suffering today from the set-back they gave to our export trade. It might also be easy to say something about our present rulers, but I think it better I should defer that duty. All I would say generally is that there is no lack of material for criticism if that were helpful. What missiles there are to hand in the debris of failure scattered around! It is difficult to resist the temptation to pick up a few of them and hurl them at the appropriate persons. But I am not going to do so, and you have no idea what it costs me to refrain. There is more important work to be done. Let us help in doing it for the sake of our common country. Things look bad, and unless I am mistaken, we are in for worse. We have had enough of sloppy optimism from all Parties. Let us look the facts in the face and apply our minds patriotically to the task of averting disaster. At the last election the Liberal Party did face it. It put forward proposals for dealing with it. If those proposals had been put into operation, the situation would not have been as serious as it is today. I have no Ministerial secrets to reveal. I know no more of the plans and purposes of the Government than any one of you who has taken the trouble to read Ministerial statements. I therefore propose to give you my own views, fortified by those of the two colleagues chosen by the Liberal Party in the House of Commons to investigate the matter with me, and to make recommendations to the Government. We have at the present moment over 2,100,000 out of work. The figures are growing. That is not the most serious factor in the situation. Other industrial countries have also millions out of work, but that must not obscure the gravest fact in our national position. It is that underneath this sudden growth of the last eighteen months, there is a solid mass of unemployed which has lasted in this country for ten years. It is what I have called the \u2018Refractory Million.\u2019 Other countries have had their depressions and their booms, but whether trade is good or bad here and in the rest of the world we have had over ten years an unbroken record of a million unemployed. In the aggregate it has cost us £800,000,000 to maintain the workless and their families above hunger and privation. If world depression vanished like a cloud tomorrow, there would still be the problem of the million to be dealt with in this country. The subsidence of the deluge would only uncover that rock. The Ararat of the million will still be there. Let us consider for one moment what it means. It is due in the main to the failure of our export trade to re-ascend to the heights which it attained before the war. We are more dependent upon our export trade than any other country in the world. Thirty per cent of our manufactures are for export. We have still incomparably the greatest export percentage in the world. United States of America export only 10 per cent; Germany only a little over 20 per cent. The percentage in France is much lower than in Germany. In addition to our export trade, there is also our great international carrying trade. That has also suffered. So far we have only recovered about four-fifths of our pre-war international trade, perhaps slightly over, and our population is greater by millions, and our burdens by thousands of millions than they were before the war. A still more serious fact to be reckoned with is the fall in our proportion of international trade. In 1922 it was over 14 per cent. Last year it was only a little over 10 per cent. 1922 was the last year I held office. They do not seem to have done much better since I left, have they? But I am not egotistical enough to believe that that accounts for the difference. Not altogether. It is due to the fact that nations were stimulated by the war to manufacture for themselves, goods which formerly they purchased from us. We must reckon on that as a permanent factor in our trouble.An ExaminationWhat adds to our difficulty is the fact that we are the most densely populated country in the world, and have thus to provide maintenance for a very much greater number of people in proportion to our area than any other great land. Our great international trade, built up under the Free Trade system, enabled us to do so with comparative ease up to 1914. Had Germany been as thickly populated to the square mile as our country is, its population would have been not 63 millions, but 122 millions. France would have been not 40 millions, but 144 millions and the United States of America would have a population which exceeds that of the whole world today. That is a rapid summary of the situation with which we are confronted. It is much too grave a position to make party capital out of it. We can only succeed if we call a truce to factiousness between and inside all parties on the issue and work together as a people to find the best way out of our troubles. Other parties will say to us: \u2018You have got your plans; so have we. Are you prepared to consider ours?\u2019 I would rule nothing out of discussion. No proposal, no suggestion, no plan, seriously put forward by serious people, who have seriously thought them out. They may say: \u2018Would you be prepared to examine the question of Tariffs without prejudice?\u2019 Certainly I would, on one condition, that they also would be prepared to examine the Free Trade position without prejudice and in turn to review the working of all its methods and machinery. Whatever is decided let it not be done in a panic.A frightened judgment is always a bad one. Let us examine the whole situation calmly. To Liberals I would say: \u2018Do not act as if you were afraid of a re-examination of our fiscal system. We have nothing to fear. The more thoroughly it is examined the better for us, and anyhow it is going to be reconsidered whether we like it or not.\u2019 To others I would say: \u2018Do not risk losing our great shipping and international trade without first of all finding out whether there is not a better way out of our difficulties.\u2019 Men in a tight corner are apt to put the whole of their wealth on the gaming table in the hope of retrieving their fortunes. Let us take care we do not gamble away our great international trade, because for the time being we are hard up. My business is to find out a better way. Liberals have been examining these proposals for four or five years in a series of most thorough investigations into economic and social problems, and the most systematic that have been conducted in this country certainly for over a generation. Most of the greatest experts on land and other aspects have been called in to contribute. A tribute to their standing is that when the present Government came in they set up an Economic Staff. The Government had to draw upon some of the very experts who had assisted us to prepare these programmes, and they are still there. I cannot see much impression which has been made up to the present, but that is not due to them.The Better WayToday I am going to point out the better way. It has this advan­tage for all parties, that it is not inconsistent with either or any of the several alternative fiscal systems proposed. We can all agree on one proposition: that to keep a million men and women in idleness for years at an enormous expense constitutes a national peril and that to find useful work for them to do is a national necessity. Can it be done? I say emphatically: \u2018Yes.\u2019 There are four essential conditions. The work which is found must be of a kind which would increase the national wealth and efficiency. Made work is worthless. The second is that it must be work of a kind that will stimulate, help, and encourage healthy industry. Not the kind of work that is provided by war for instance. That also is a stimulus for the time being. But it is like alcohol, it draws upon and consumes our reserves, and this at the end leaves us much weaker. It must be a kind which, like healthy food, stimulates energy, and at the same time builds up the tissues. Thirdly, assuming that the work contemplated is of a character which would ultimately have to be done in order to make the nation more efficient, then it ought to be accelerated and concentrated within the period of depression, not merely in order to find work for the unemployed, but to equip our industries to compete in our markets, and in the markets of the world against all corners, and, when the boom comes, to be ready to take full advantage of it. The period of unemployment ought to be like winter on a farm, a slack season of which a good farmer takes advantage to do the repairing, the renewing, the drainage, and other essential duties which cannot be attended to in the spring time and the harvest, when labour is engaged on other tasks. Lastly, I would stipulate that able-bodied men and women must accept the work for which they are physically adapted when it is offered them by the nation, or be deprived of the dole. I observe that the Russian Soviets, dominated by the working classes of Russia, have already issued a decree to that effect. But that decree did not come from Stalin in the first instance, but from St. Paul: \u2018This we commanded you, that if any would not work, neither should he eat.\u2019 How is work to be found for the workless immediately? The first thing to do is to remove every obstacle which exists in the way of the success and development of our industries. Many more men and women would then be enabled to find work in the trades to which they have been brought up.Call a ConferenceWe recommend that the Government should at once call together a Conference representative of all industries and commercial interests, employers, trade unions, banks, and distributive trades, and should put the whole facts before them. It is the business of this Conference to review the position and determine, within a limited period, what steps could be taken with a view to increasing our efficiency and reducing the costs of production in order to enable us to compete more success­fully in the markets of the world. The banks should further be urged to agree on a policy of less restricted credit for financing industrial developments. The problem of industry is to reduce the costs of production without lowering the standards of living of the worker. I agree with President Hoover and leading industrialists like Mr. Henry Ford, that this can be accomplished by greater efficiency in production and in marketing. The right way to higher standards is to increase efficiency and also through the more effective use of the International Labour Office established by the Treaty of Versailles. But the Government itself must set the example by lowering its own costs. Expenditure is on too prodigious and too lavish a scale. We are even threatened with an increase in taxation. One is reminded of the famous classical phrase of Oscar Wilde to his doctor when he was dying, \u2018I apologise to you. I am dying beyond my means.\u2019 It seems to me that the British Government is dying beyond its means whenever I look at the gigantic expenditure going up year by year. I read the Chancellor of the Exchequer\u2019s speech the other day in which he talked about the possibility of further taxation. So far from taxation being further increased it ought to be reduced. Expenditure is far too lavish.I believe that with a determined effort this can be achieved. It is no use attempting it by ordinary Treasury methods. Exceptional methods must be taken and expenses cut down ruthlessly. The Government ought to follow the precedent which has been set by Australia in this respect. May I also recall another precedent which was highly successful - that which is known in history as the \u2018Geddes Axe,\u2019 whereby a number of business men were called together to scrutinise the whole of the estimates and make proposals for cutting down. I found when I was in the Treasury - for eight years or so - that you cannot cut down expenditure through Treasury machinery It is all right for a little saving here and there, but when you have got to cut down you must have an axe, and that is why we set up a Committee in 1921 of big business men to go through the whole of the departments, and in a couple of years the expen­diture was cut down by £300,000,000. It is a scandal that ten years after the war, with Locarno Pacts referring dangerous disputes to arbitration, Kellogg Pacts which have outlawed war altogether, we should still be spending £110,000,000 upon preparation for war. The whole cost of unemployment ought also to be scrutinised. One hears every day tales of unwarranted cadging on the dole - millions could be saved without impinging on meritorious claims. The industrial airship of Britain is weighed down with a load of unnecessary expenditure, whilst it is fighting its way through a terrible world gale. Economy - relentless economy - is an essential condition to industrial recovery. There were resolutions passed by the Labour Congress at Llandudno for additional pensions and family allowances which, in the present industrial and financial condition of this country, would be sheer lunacy.Old MachineryWe must also revive the Trade Facilities Act, which helped so materially to reduce unemployment in 1922. We must revise and liberalise the conditions of our export credits, so as to enable us to capture business, like that which is available in Russia. Germany, which has none of our financial resources, is showing very much more enterprise and wisdom in that respect than we are. Our timidity there is depriving us of millions a year of excellent business which would provide work, more especially for our engineering trades. Further­more, when we come to the question of reducing taxation, I trust that special consideration will be given to industries which are expending large sums of money upon renewing, improving, and extending their equipment. In the U.S.A. the life of a machine is supposed to be, on an average, between two and three years. We keep old machinery on to compete for business in the world markets against countries which are armed with the latest devices of science. It is an unequal contest. Nothing would stimulate our industries more than such a readjust­ment of our taxation as would enable our industries to make deductions on a fairer scale for capital expenditure which they incur in improving their equipment. All these things are essential preliminaries to any serious and effective attempt at dealing with the grave condition of our trade and industry. They will take time to produce their full effect. But the influence on the numbers who are employed will be immediate and they represent only a part of what can be accomplished and ought to be attempted in the re-equipment and the reconditioning of this country for its great task in the world.Before the last Election we submitted to the country a detailed list of plans of this character which we suggested could be imme­diately put into operation and which if executed with energy would, in the course of a single year, reduce the refractory million to normal proportions. They were all plans for necessary and useful work. We have since re-examined them in the face of official and other criticism, and the scrutiny to which they have been subjected has confirmed us in the conclusion to which we came upon the advice of some of the ablest experts available.Question of Speed is VitalI am not in a position to reveal what passed between Ministers and ourselves either on this question or any other. I think I am entitled to say this, that in so far as the proposals made before the last Election in reference to roads, telephones, drainage, and electricity are concerned, they are not challenged. The only difference of opinion is as to the speed at which they can be executed, and that, of course, is vital when you come to provide work for the unemployed. It makes all the difference whether a contract is to extend over five or ten years as far as the numbers engaged upon it are concerned. In substance their contention is that the obstacles are so great that they at any rate cannot go faster. Perhaps they are right. But, as you know, with a motor-car it is very largely a question of who drives and also the quality of the machine. It makes all the difference when you come to unem­ployment. It makes all the difference between employing scores of thousands and hundreds of thousands. I see Mr. Philip Snowden says the Government have already set aside £140,000,000 but he did not say over what time. Over a period of thirty years he could have said they had set aside a thousand millions, but it is all a question of time and concentration. At any rate, the actual quality and character of our work have not been impugned. It is all a question of the speed at which we shall go along. In submitting those proposals to the country we made it clear that we had others of a more far reaching character, more particularly those which had already formed part of the published Liberal programme. The most important from this point of view are those which deal with the all-important questions of agriculture and housing. As proposals of a similar character were also adopted by the Labour Party, I assumed that there would be no difficulty in getting complete co-operation and ensuring immediate action upon that basis provided the necessary courage, capacity, and enterprise were forthcoming. You ought to regard unemployment, not as a disaster - you ought to regard nothing that happens in life as a disaster - but as an opportunity.AgricultureI will now come to our proposals with regard to agriculture. These proposals we have submitted in detail to the Government, and I am very hopeful that they will work in with the plans which have been, and still are, under consideration by the Minister of Agriculture. This is pre-eminently the time and opportunity for restoring the position of our oldest and most important industry to its proper position in the national economy. From that position it has been gradually deposed by the phenomenal industrial development of the nineteenth century and the early years of the twentieth century. We built up our gigantic wealth so rapidly and so easily by the supremacy which we achieved in other industries that we overlooked and neglected the most fundamental industry of all - that of the cultivation of the soil. The result is that we are over-industrialised. The risks we ran of starvation during the Great War and our inability to find employment for a million of our workers since the War, taken together ought to convince the most sceptical and scornful of the peril of such a state of things. This is the only country that has allowed the industry of land cultivation to go downhill. Even the great industrial countries like Germany, France, Belgium and the U.S.A., whilst developing other and more remunerative industries, clung to the land. We, on the other hand, allowed our land to go out of cultivation, drew our best workers from the soil and treated the agricultural industry with complete neglect and contempt as if it were of no account. That is mainly the reason why we are the only country left with a problem of chronic unemployment. In the United States 26.3 per cent of the population are still on the soil. Germany, our greatest rival in Europe, has 30.5 per cent, France has 41.9 per cent, and Belgium, perhaps the most highly industrialised country on the Continent of Europe in comparison with its size, has 19.1 per cent of its population on the soil. Great Britain has only 7.2 per cent. It may be said that these other countries have maintained their population on the soil by protective tariffs. This is not true, at any rate of Belgium, where the tariffs are quite negligible, and it is not in the least true of Holland, which, whilst it maintains a great international trade, has still 23.6 per cent of its people on the land and is substantially a Free Trade country. Denmark, which has 34.8 per cent of its population on the land, is also Free Trade. In Holland and Denmark the agricultural population are highly prosperous. Even since 1921 our workers on the land have decreased by 108,000 and, during the last ten years, when there is so much unemployment, young workers from the country are still seeking and finding employment in our industrial areas and, being sturdy, strong fellows, are driving the town population on to the dole. Our land is steadily deteriorating. A good deal has gone out of cultivation during the last few years and still a larger proportion has sunk into a state of half cultivation. Despite the great advances which science has made in assisting the fertility of the soil, the productiveness of British land has during the last two or three decades, been practically stationary. On the other hand, European countries have steadily increased theirs from decade to decade. It is time that we should make a real national effort to restore the balance between agriculture and the other industries of this country, not only as a means of providing healthy employment - the healthiest of all for our population - but as a vital contribution to the national well-being. We have in this respect, at any rate, one advan­tage over our rivals. The very fact that we have neglected our land to a degree which is unknown amongst them has left us with an enormous margin to make up both as to cultivation and as to labour. They do not find it so easy to put more men on the soil, in spite of the fact that they are still making gigantic efforts. In Italy, which is a land of culti­vators, Mussolini is utilising the present difficulty of his country with regard to emigration and employment to reclaim millions of acres. He is using the credit of his country to develop great tracts of derelict land, with a view to planting 200,000 more families upon the soil. There they are even cultivating the hillsides. Carrying soil there. And you may have thought it was impossible to increase the population on the land in Italy. He has now got 80,000 men working on reclaim­ing marshes and derelict land, and he is going to settle 200,000 families on that reclaimed land. We are fortunate, at any rate, in this respect, that there is a greater opportunity for development in this country. In France there are 5,000,000 smallholdings under 25 acres. In Germany there are 5,000,000 under 50 acres; in Great Britain there are 250,000. Surely there you have a margin for accomplishment which ought to encourage us. The small family farm has withstood the agricultural depression with comparative success. That is acknow­ledged by the Official report of the Ministry of Agriculture. I come from a country of small family farms - there are not many big farms there - and they have all weathered the storm. There are no big labour bills because they work themselves, and everybody works, and a very good thing too. I do not believe in this doctrine of keeping children in idleness. They have got to be trained not merely in the alphabet and mathematics, but they have to be trained to work. Every great Liberal reformer, whether Chamberlain in 1884-5, Campbell-Banner­man and Lincolnshire, they have always seized upon this as a fundamental proposition in the agriculture of the country. Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman was almost fanatical on the subject. I always thought it was a tragedy he did not come into his own before his strength was exhausted. Believe me, from the little I saw of him, it would have made a great difference had he come in ten years sooner. He had the root of the matter in him. Nevertheless, in spite of the efforts to establish smallholdings in this country, made in the first instance by Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, and Lord Lincolnshire and afterwards by my Government in 1919, the numbers of the small family farms have gone down steadily in recent years. This is largely attributable to the fact that the landowners of this country have not the necessary resources to keep up the equipment upon these farms. Therefore, whenever there is a vacancy, there is a disposition to add these small farms on to an adjoining farm and thus avoid the heavy burden of repairs. This process is going on at an increasing rate throughout the whole of Great Britain. The Smallholdings Acts of the last twenty years have only been a partial success. Where they have been put into operation with energy they have been an unqualified success. The County Councils have been, as a rule, prejudiced, timid, and occasionally hostile. There are only a few Councils that have made a real effort to carry out the Acts. Had the remaining County Councils followed the example of these three or four, instead of about 30,000 smallholdings, we might have had 100,000. You would know what has actually happened if you were to talk to Mr. Fordham, who was one of the Commissioners and to whom we owe a great deal for the success of the Campbell-Bannerman Act. He could tell you what has been done in Cambridgeshire. He showed me a place with smallholders prospering, a population enormously increased and maintained on the land and everybody looking very happy. It was the happiest little com­munity I have ever seen. That is what you want on the land of England, instead of despair. The process was almost completely stopped by the Tory Act of 1925. I am very glad to see the announcement made by Dr. Addison that the Government have decided to take direct action by the State to establish small farms and cottage holdings. Whether the action of the Government will be successful or not depends upon the scale upon which they undertake it, the finance which they are prepared to put into it, and, above all, upon the drive which is put behind it. Is their plan merely a one-horse plough with a blunt coulter, or a full-powered and well-bladed tractor? Time counts if agriculture is to be saved and the young and vigorous are to be kept on the land. Even today, with 2,100,000 out of work, the sturdy young labourer is tramping the towns to find a job. Is there land available? There is always, and especially during a period of depression, land coming into the market and land which becomes vacant through death or departure. There is also another supply which could be made available and suitable. I have dealt with the way Mussolini is finding land for addi­tional settlers by reclaiming millions of acres of swamp and wilderness, and at the expense of the State doing what he calls \u2018soil reconditioning.\u2019 He is employing at the moment 80,000 men on that task alone, and this is without reference to those engaged on setting up the buildings. Here in this country you have millions of acres which were once highly cultivated, but have been allowed to become practically derelict. Post-war taxation has made landlordism bankrupt. Drains are neglected; land has become water-logged; buildings are falling into decay. There is more uncultivated and half cultivated land here in this country in pro­portion to its size than in any other country in Western Europe. There ought to be schemes of reclamation and reconditioning on a large scale with a view to settling on the soil a very considerable number of men who would thus earn a healthy and happy livelihood. Not only would employment be then found for a considerable number who are either out of a job themselves or keeping others out, but this country would be enriched permanently as a result. On land thus reconditioned, cleansed, drained, and fertilised, families could be settled and land fit for nothing else could be afforested. There are millions of acres of land in this country which are now almost entirely waste, which if it were in Germany, France, Holland, Denmark or Belgium, would be covered with forests.Marketing, Transport and AdvertisingThe State would purchase the land, reclaim and recondition it, set up the necessary houses and buildings. It would also help, with its credit, the settlers to equip their holdings. Let me say at once, I am opposed to the State finding all and everything. In Italy the State are giving the settlers a grant to assist them in equipment. We must once more revive the pioneer spirit of this country. In itself such a revival would enrich and strengthen the nation. Where some­thing has already been attempted on these lines under the Acts of 1908 and 1919 the results have been good. The Ministry of Agriculture reported in 1925 that on a certain scheme of land settlement which had been undertaken on a number of arable farms from 1919-1925 the population maintained on the land had risen from 294 to 682. On another scheme it had risen from 97 to 548. On these two schemes the population maintained on the land increased as a result from 391 to 1,227. But we are told, and rightly so, that there is no use increasing production unless the cultivators can sell their commodities. I quite agree, and this is an essential part of the programme. Lord Oxford, when he was Prime Minister, appointed a Committee under the chair­manship of Lord Selborne to consider this problem of marketing our agricultural produce. That Committee came to the conclusion that there was £200,000,000 worth of food bought by this country from across the seas that could be raised here, and Lord Selborne certainly did not qualify the statement by saying that it would be dependent upon tariffs. £200,000,000 in that day would be nearly equivalent to £300,000,000 today. At the present moment we are paying a heavy subsidy to one very small branch of the agricultural industry - beet production. It is suggested by Mr. Baldwin that you should, by means of a quota, subsidise another branch, namely wheat. The lowest figure that I have heard mentioned would at present prices be equivalent to a subsidy of 50 per cent. This is what I am told. Wheat is being sold under thirty shillings. If anybody gets thirty shillings here he gets quite a good price. The farmer will tell you he cannot make it pay without something like fifty-five shillings. That really means forty-five shillings. I am a farmer myself. You will see what that means. If you have a quota at a fixed price which will make it pay for the farmer you are putting fifteen shillings on to thirty shillings, which is equivalent to 50 per cent. Unless you are very careful you will find a tariff of 50 per cent put on in the name of a quota. Who will pay it? The consumer. It will appear not in the Budget of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, but in every household budget, and there are 8,000,000 or 10,000,000 of them in the country. Take care! And when you extend it to the Dominions it is no use to the Dominions unless there is a fixed price. What will it all mean? It will mean that the country with the heaviest taxation in the world, with a burden of 8,000,000,000 for an Imperial obligation which was just as much theirs as ours and with 2,000,000 unemployed, would be paying a subsidy to farmers at the ends of the earth who on the whole, taking it year by year, have been quite pros­perous. Examine these things very carefully. Don\u2019t swallow them at a gulp. There\u2019s a hook. Taking beet and wheat together they do not represent more than 5 per cent of the total production of our soil. We cannot compete with the new world in the production of wheat for a variety of reasons, which I need not enter into, and nothing short of a tariff of anything from 25 per cent to 50 per cent would enable us to do so. But that is not true of other products such as dairy and pig products, as Denmark has most successfully demonstrated. Most of this produce which comes from overseas has to be brought hundreds and even thousands of miles across the seas before it is landed in our ports. I know it is said that sea transport, even for long distances, is cheaper than rail transport for short distances, but that answer seems to assume that in these overseas countries the produce is raised on the quays and the animals reared and slaughtered on the wharfs. It is forgotten that they are produced far inland and brought by rail - some­times hundreds of miles to the port of embarkation. The real reason why this overseas produce is beating us in our own markets is because of better marketing, grading, collecting, advertising, selling, and trans­port arrangements in those countries. There the landlords help; the middleman helps; the Press helps; the railways help; the State helps; and the farmers help each other. Here you will often find them all helping themselves and not the industry. The result is that they all suffer. In all these directions our arrangements are casual, hap­hazard, unbusinesslike, and ramshackle. The Minister of Agriculture has brought in a Marketing Bill. All I can say about it now is that I am glad he has had the courage to bring in a challenging measure. I do not mind an element of compulsion, although I would have pre­ferred incentives to co-operation, but if necessary a certain element of compulsion in the background would be helpful. Dr. Addison will not, I am sure, be discouraged by criticism. The weakness of this Government so far has been that they are much more afraid of being criticised for going forward, than for standing still - or rather for messing around in the same old trodden and trampled spot. I should like to add a further word about transport because I think this vital. Here is the medium through which the State can render assistance to every branch of the industry in collecting as well as carrying commodities to and from the farm. We ought to see that every help is given to our agricultural industry by means of transport facilities as well as rates. Both are equally important. By this means you would give practical and substantial assistance to every branch of the industry. The only part of Mr. Churchill\u2019s De-Rating Scheme which I commend is that where he allocated a sum to the reduction of the rates on agricultural produce. At the present moment our transport system is so organised as to give a distinct preference to foreign produce. I know the railway companies have got their answer. They say that the foreigner arranges his goods in such a way as to enable them to carry in bulk and therefore more cheaply. That must be got over. I say without hesitation that preference should, if necessary, be given to the home producer and not to the foreigner. I come to another point. If you create a large num­ber of small holdings, have you got men available to man them? With­out doubt. There is still a surplus population in the rural areas in spite of the great depopulation of the last forty or fifty years. You can see that from the growing unemployment amongst labourers in many parts of the country. As I pointed out there are many who are still leaving the countryside to seek employment elsewhere, then you have farmers\u2019 sons and labourers\u2019 sons who are coming to maturity, who can make excellent farmers. You have also miners - tens of thousands of them brought up on the soil - many of them crowded to the mines during the period of prosperity and a very great number during the war. You will also find men in every industry with a natural aptitude for the soil. There are nearly a million allotments in this country, which shows the craving even in our towns for a bit of land. They are all hungry for the land. Somehow or other the hunger comes down, either from the father or grandfather, and perhaps the great-grandfather; just something planted in the brain which has sprung from generations of cultivators and still breaks out in the form of a craving for the soil. In the case of a very large number of the people out of work, if they now had a little bit of land it would keep their hearts from breaking, their souls from rusting in idleness. Take the experience of the Society of Friends in organising allotments in South Wales. During this period of distress they have succeeded in securing or preserving 100,000 allotments for miners, thus saving tens of thousands of them during the depression from the misery and demoralisation of complete unem­ployment. In their judgment, arrived at after a very careful investiga­tion of those with whom they are dealing, 13 per cent of them are quite suitable for larger holdings. We also propose that a number of training farms should be set up here and there over the country in order to give the necessary training to a number of men with special aptitude who would like to earn their living on the land in some capacity - some for market-gardening, for fruit culture or chickens, for afforestation and for mixed farming, and also to teach them, more particularly those who are engaged in the smaller forms of culture, the rough carpentry which would be exceedingly useful to them in repairing and also in setting up the necessary hutment accommodation for their chickens, for their storage, and for the employment of their industry. In other countries you have a very large number of holdings of one, two and three acres which do not find employment all the year round for those who cultivate them, but which do provide work for them when their labour is not in demand for other tasks. They provide a reservoir of labour which is available for large farms in the country, and in Belgium especially for the docks. The casual labourer, therefore, in these countries when his services are not needed, does not stand in idleness in the market. He is usefully em­ployed in necessary work on his own little plot. There is no need for men of that kind to receive the dole. In the Welsh quarries you have quite a number of quarrymen who have their little crofts, and when things are slack in the quarries, they find work on their own land. It is the best way of draining the stagnant pool of unemployment which is poisoning our community. I propose to deal with the finance of the matter later. If you had a development of this kind, you would increase the production and consumption of healthy food. I do not care what anybody says, I cannot believe that these stale goods that come frozen from the ends of the earth are as good for the health of the community as the fresh produce of our own soil. We have too little of the fresh and vitalising produce of our own soil. Agriculture has been thrown on a rubbish heap clattering with empty tins. Agriculture is the only industry where there is no real attempt to push the business by advertising. You could increase considerably the consumption of healthy produce by that means. For instance, the consumption of milk in this country is exceedingly low. In the U.S.A. the consumption is three times as high per head of population as it is here. In Sweden it is four times as high. The time has come for making a great all-round national effort to restore the countryside to prosperity. Both in health and in wealth the country would be richer. This period of depression is pre-­eminently the opportunity, and if we let it go, agriculture, the most important of all our national industries, is doomed as far as Britain is concerned.Housing and Town PlanningI now come to another very important branch of the problem - that of housing. I know a measure was carried last year to deal with the slums. If the question is left there, there is little hope of anything very drastic being accomplished, because the real solution of the problem lies in the alleviation of overcrowding. You do not want to rebuild slums. You want to clean them out by finding an outlet for a large part of the population to other more spacious centres. In these crowded districts there is no light, air, or elbow room. There are no playing grounds for the children. Take districts in London where millions live, there are practically no playing grounds for the children with the exception of disused churchyards. No wonder in these dis­tricts the infantile mortality is appalling. There is nothing comparable to these areas in squalor in any civilised country in the world. They are a national disgrace. My daughter and I went the other day to see some slums in Kensington, where you have some of the biggest houses and some of the richest people. We went up a street and said, \u2018Where are the slums?\u2019 but they said, \u2018Here they are.\u2019 They used to be some of the best houses in that quarter. What had made them slums? Overcrowding! We went down and found a man and wife and children living in two miserable rooms intended as cellars or store-houses. The man was earning. I said, \u2018What are you doing living here?\u2019 He replied, \u2018Where could I live otherwise and be near my job?\u2019 You must have an outlet to let them get outside and at the same time get, without much trouble, to their jobs. If you watch what is happening with the well-to-do population you will find amongst them a steady flight to the country. The town for them is the workshop and the counting house but the country is the dormitory. I would say, \u2018If the well-to-do see that it is better for them to live outside and come into the town to their work, then it is equally good for those who are half as well off to do the same thing.\u2019 Let the working man have the same chance. Liberalism means equality of opportunity for all classes. It does not mean equality. The Creator never intended it. It means an equal chance in life and for life. Give them life and give it more abundantly. That is the doctrine of Liberalism, and it comes from the highest authority. Wherever a tube is constructed or a new road, new suburbs spring up and houses are soon taken up by those whose income enables them to pay the rent for commodious houses, each with its little garden. Take the case of Golders Green. I remember opening the tube to that district over twenty years ago. It was then an area where there were practically no houses. Now the whole of that district is covered with quite attrac­tive habitations. Take the Kingston By-Pass, only opened a few years ago. Almost every weekend as I pass along it I discover a new cluster of houses springing up which I had never noticed before. It is true there is very little planning and laying out. It is all helter-skelter. Factory, villa, bungalow, cottage have been thrown up here and there without any well-conceived plan on a large scale. It is a question of quick profits as a driving motive for both surveyor and speculator. The difficulty is that the towns which empty their population into these areas have no control over them. In the Housing Act of 1919, power was given to the Local Authorities for setting up Town Regional Planning Committees, which could study the possibility of development in the countryside in terms of the housing needs of the town. There are at present eighty such Committees at work, planning out regions occupied by thirty million people, and comprising a total area of 21,000 square miles, or nearly a fourth of Great Britain. Over a thousand local authorities are involved in the areas thus being planned, which cover the territory likely to be developed in the near future. About thirty of these Committees have already completed the preparation of their regional plans. These plans show, even on a cursory examination, that there is a large amount of work waiting to be done, the carrying out of which is essential if the further development of the countryside is to take place in an orderly manner, instead of in the haphazard, waste­ful, and unsatisfactory way which has too often been followed in the past. In spite of all that, there has been no real move on, and this seems to me to be pre-eminently the opportunity to take advantage of the work which has already been accomplished in the way of surveying and planning and to make a real start. There are certain essential conditions to be observed if these developments are to be successfully carried out:(a)  Access to work. Any new dormitory suburb for members of the working classes must be provided with means of transport for them to and from their work that will be adequate, quick and cheap. This means that broad avenues must be driven from it to the industrial centres where its residents are employed, and ample transport services provided by road, and often also by electric rail or tube. Fares for this transport must be within the means of the poorer wage-earners.(b)  Gardens and Open Spaces. Provision must be made in these newly-developed districts for adequate open spaces and playing fields. In addition, it is of the utmost importance that an adequate proportion of the houses should be supplied with gardens large enough to make an important contribution to the livelihood of the families. Belgium affords a striking example of the advantage of this arrangement. Of the dockers who work in Antwerp, 80 per cent live in the surrounding country, and the bulk of them have substantial gardens attached to their houses. When there is no work at the docks they do not hang about all day waiting for something to turn up, but return home and work in their gardens. They keep hens, rabbits, and pigs, and often a sheep or goat, and grow potatoes and other vegetables. Thus when not working for wages they are profitably occupied on the soil. Seasonal workers, such as bricklayers, benefit in a similar way. We believe it would he possible to provide similar facilities in this country, which would be of inestimable advantage to many working people, especially to those whose employment is seasonal or irregular. The ability to work for oneself when other employment is slack might also relieve the pressure of claims to unemployment benefit. A discussion which we have had with expert town planners in close touch with what has been done has satis­fied us that several of the schemes are ripe for immediate action, and that a selection could be made upon the basis of which steps could be imme­diately taken and that is150,000 men could be turned on without loss of time to open up access to these areas, and prepare the ground on whatever points are agreed upon before actually beginning the building operations. We propose that immediate practical steps be taken to carry out a number of the more urgent and important public improvements which have been already approved and tabled by the local authorities concerned through their regional planning committee, attention being specially directed to those schemes which assist most effectually the develop­ment of new residential and industrial areas, and fit in best with national plans for housing, roads, electrical extension, water conservation and supply, etc. We further suggest that those regional planning committees which have not yet tabled definite schemes should be urged to proceed with all despatch, so that appropriate features in the plans for their areas can similarly be included in the expedited programme.But the initiative must come from the Government. An Advisory Committee should be appointed forthwith consisting of, say, half a dozen experts and representatives of the local authorities to confer with the Government Departments concerned and to make recommendations as to the best method for carrying out and for financing the work. Then a Development Department should be set up for the purpose of carrying out these schemes. The plans could either be carried out by the depart­ment itself or the choice of an alternative should be given to the Local Authorities to do it themselves. If it is undertaken by the State, the State would have to find the capital. If it is undertaken by the Local Authorities the State might give assistance to the construction of the avenues or tubes necessary. The State would then recoup itself by a first charge on the enormous land values which would be created.An example of the way in which new road construction increases the value of land is furnished by the experience of the Kingston By-Pass. Here land, which before the road was first contemplated, had an agricultural value of £30 to £50 per acre only, had to be purchased for road construction at £250 to £300 per acre; and building land previously worth £300 per acre had to be purchased for the Merton connection at an average of £1,250 per acre. Building land worth £100 per acre in 1921 was sold, when the road proposals became known, for £350, and is now offered at from £2,000 to £3,000. There is land worth £60 an acre before the road was contemplated, which sells at £1,800 near the road and at about £600 for back land. If the local authorities undertook the work, then naturally the first charge upon these reserves would be theirs, and, in any event, the surplus would go to them to assist in cheapening fares and in the ordinary tasks of local government. It is vital that not merely should there be facilities for enabling those who dwell in these suburbs to get to their work in the adjoining town quickly, but also cheaply, and here we suggest that transport arrangements should be subsidised out of these land values which have been created by the expenditure and enterprise of the State.Finance of the SchemeNow as to the finance of the scheme; we propose that a National Development Loan be raised for the purpose of carrying out these operations. You may say, \u2018What about economy?\u2019 Any business man will inform you that there is a great difference between cutting down current costs and investing capital sums in extension, re-equipment, and improvement of your works. The latter, if necessary, constitutes a truer economy than keeping an old inefficient plant going in order not to save money. It is no use saying that money is not available. Our credit is the best in Europe. We have made enormous sacrifices in taxation and in trade in order to restore it. Let us make the best use of it in order to increase the restoration of our own country ere it is too late. Our financial reserves are greater than those of any country in Europe. Did you observe the two issues that were put before the market this week? They were over subscribed thirty or forty times. This year at the present rate we should be raising £100,000,000 for investment abroad in enterprises practically none of which would bring any return to our trade. We raised £8,000,000,000 for the war. We have still £4,000,000,000 invested abroad. A loan representing less than one month\u2019s expenditure during the war - that is £250,000,000, would enable us to prosecute schemes of amelioration and development through with energy for a period of two years from the date at which we were able to start off. You could find work this winter for half a million men, and as soon as the necessary legislation was carried through, you could make arrangements which would raise that figure to at least three-quarters of a million. Unemployment is costing us £100,000,000 a year. We are now actually borrowing to pay the dole. The loan will reach over £70,000,000 by Christmas. We can borrow for idleness, but not for useful healing work. And this is sound finance. You could raise your money on the security of the State. To give it a special character, you could allocate special assets as collateral security. In addition to the Road Fund, there would be the land which had been purchased and improved and equipped for the purpose of settlement. I do not antici­pate that you would get a full economic return on the land which would be equal to the interest and sinking fund paid by the State, but the collateral advantage of the community would be infinitely greater than that and at worst you would have a return of 2½ per cent on that land. Then, as I have pointed out, you would have the enormous site values created by State expenditure and enterprise. At the end of two years these assets would enable you to raise further funds to complete and extend the tasks undertaken without resorting to ordinary taxation. At the end of two years you could review the situation with regard to the state of trade and employment at that period. If the depression were over and we recovered our trade, there would be no labour available for further developments on a great scale. But if we had not quite struggled through then we could extend the operations for another two years until we had quite completed the undertakings which are so essential to the restoration of our countryside, the housing of our people in healthy surroundings, and the re-equipment of our industries.

aVI thank you most warmly for the cordiality of your greeting. I take it that your welcome is meant not only for me but for all my colleagues who sit upon this platform.I believe that our action in withdrawing from the Government at this juncture meets with the almost universal approval of the organisa­tions and the members of the Liberal Party throughout the length and breadth of the land. When we joined the Government fourteen months ago, although there were some doubts expressed here and there, on the whole there was a large measure of unanimity then. When the Prime Minister resolved upon a General Election then, indeed, there was some difference as to the course that we ought to pursue. I can only express my own conviction, which is fallible; I may be wrong; but to me it is very clear that if we had resigned from the Government at that time, in that crisis, and fought the Election on Party lines, Liberalism would have been split from top to bottom. The Free Trade issue would have been overlaid by the financial crisis. Some injury would have been done by our action to national interests, but Liberalism would have been brought to complete disaster.It is one of the conditions of a coalition that the minority are compelled to acquiesce in many things they greatly dislike. Others before me have experienced that. I shall have something to say later this evening about disarmament. A letter was published yesterday with regard to which I shall only make one observation. It takes two to make a quarrel, and I shall not be the second one. That is all that I shall say on that topic tonight or at any time.I am more concerned to convince the country, as we are ourselves convinced, that our action in withdrawing from the Government now was necessary in the best interests of the nation and of the Empire. The main task for which we joined was accomplished. Mr. Baldwin, speaking a few days ago at Blackpool, bore testimony to that. He said that, although the conditions today were not without anxiety, the general financial position has improved beyond all belief. We have effected a wonderful conversion and we no longer suffer any anxiety about our currency. Those were the objects which we set out to achieve; and, although no doubt there are many and grave difficulties surrounding our nation and afflicting the whole world, still they can be dealt with in the ordinary course of government.In January we accepted the agreement to differ, and of late some of our opponents have done me the honour to quote statements of mine made earlier in the year defending our action then, and they ask why it should not be continued now. But they omitted one quotation. I used these words when speaking last March of that situation. I said: \u2018It may be unavoidable for us to leave the Government in spite of all its disadvantages if some further division should arise in the Cabinet on a matter of large and permanent importance.\u2019 What was foreseen in March has occurred in September, and we should be false to sound principles of politics and to all the honourable traditions of British public life if we consented to suppress or to conceal or to mitigate our differences with regard to these Ottawa Agreements, or if we failed to leave a Cabinet which was resolved upon so disastrous a policy.For any Minister it is a sacrifice to lay down a high office of State. For my part, I greatly regret that I must forgo the opportunity in the next Session of introducing a comprehensive measure of Penal Reform which, as Home Secretary, I had planned; but, after all, I have had the privilege of holding responsible offices of State at home and abroad for as many as seventeen years. But for my colleagues who, for the first time, have had experience of the absorbing interest and the wide opportunities which ministerial office presents - for them the sacrifice is far greater. Sir Archibald Sinclair, Mr. Isaac Foot, Lord Lothian, Sir Robert Hamilton, Mr. Graham White, all of whom have conducted with remarkable efficiency and success the affairs of their several offices; and our admirable band of Whips: Mr. Rea, Sir Murdoch McKenzie Wood, Mr. Harcourt Johnstone, Lord Allendale: all of them with complete unanimity forewent the offices which they held and made the sacrifices which public duty required.Liberal Nationals and Liberal UnionistsI have no doubt that this common action, this unanimity, would have been approved by our great leaders of earlier days, whose example we seek to follow: Campbell-Bannerman and Asquith, and would most certainly have had the concurrence of our dear friend and colleague, Donald Maclean. I am sorry that we have not got companionship in this action from all those Members of the Government who in the past have borne the Liberal name. When you consider the events of the last twelve or fourteen months and are inclined sometimes to criticise our action, bear in mind, if I may venture to ask it, how our hands were weakened by the action of those Liberal Members of the House of Commons who accepted completely and without demur the whole Protectionist policy of the Conservative Party: two in the Cabinet; four or five in the Government - there are several more now; another twenty in the House of Commons. At every stage, at every crisis, their abstention almost halved the efficacy of our action. But our hands were upheld by the rank and file of the Party throughout the country and by every one without exception of its central and district organisations.I have repeatedly uttered a warning that the Liberal Nationals of today are treading the path of the Liberal Unionists of a generation ago. Now that is confirmed completely from another source, more authoritative, if I may quote once more Mr. Baldwin. He has made an interesting and a very useful speech, which we shall have occasion to quote somewhat often. He said at Blackpool the other day: \u2018The situation reminds me very much of that which I remember so vividly when I was a boy at the time of the defeat of Mr. Gladstone\u2019s Home Rule, and the Liberal Unionist Party under Mr. Chamberlain\u2026 We worked for them; we did not oppose them, and in a few years looking back there was not a member of the Tory Party which did not rejoice at that infusion of fresh blood and fresh strength. I assure you that none of those who support the Ottawa Bill right through must suffer from it at the election.\u2019 I wonder whether the Liberal Associations who adopted those Members, and the Liberal electors who supported them, approve of and rejoice in this cordial welcome to them by Mr. Baldwin, as bringing an infusion of fresh blood and fresh strength to the Tory Party. Perhaps it was not kind and not tactful of Mr. Baldwin to have been so frank so soon.As for the policy embodied in the Ottawa Agreements, we have given in our letter of resignation the reasons for our condemnation of them, and I shall not repeat them. I shall limit myself now to giving some answer to the replies which have been attempted by those who defend the Agreements.The Dangers of Hard BargainingBy far the most important of our objections to the Ottawa Agree­ments is the view that we hold that they do damage to Imperial interests and imperil the whole future of the British Empire.This process of hard bargaining is very dangerous. Mr, Neville Chamberlain takes exception to our use of the words \u2018hard bargain­ing.\u2019 Speaking at Blackpool, he said: \u2018\u201cHard bargaining\u201d was a word invented by Free Traders in order to create prejudice.\u2019 In our letter it appears, but within quotation marks. It is taken from a letter to the Times, of September 5th, describing the Ottawa Conference, signed with the name of Mr. Amery. I am afraid that Mr. Amery\u2019s feelings will be hurt that his Protectionist colleague in Birmingham should describe a phrase of his as \u2018having been invented by Free Traders in order to create prejudice.\u2019 Hard bargaining there was, and much injury it has done, and this is the gravest aspect, I repeat, of the whole business.I am one of those who believe, and I feel sure that the great majority of you share the view, that on the whole, in spite of many failures, many blunders, and some follies, the existence of the British Common­wealth of Nations is a service to the world at large. Over a quarter of the whole globe there is mutual peace, and, as a rule, goodwill, and that quarter of the earth does influence for good the other three-quarters of mankind. It is untrue that Liberals have been indifferent to the problems of Empire. Our Commonwealth has been built up on Liberal principles. But for them it could not have endured, and never has more eloquent or more sincere expression been given to a noble and a wise Imperial patriotism than fell again and again from the lips of Gladstone. Indeed, I am one of those who would wish that the rest of mankind should imitate the principles of this Commonwealth of Nations. When we find at Geneva 60 nations gathered together endeavouring to frame some common policy the difficulties are very great. If only there could be groupings or federations, with full local autonomy, with full scope for variety of national characteristics; if that 60 could be reduced to 16, or even to 6, I believe that that would conduce to the welfare of mankind. But for the opposite to take place, for our own Commonwealth, as it is, to break up and dissolve, that would indeed be a disaster for us and an injury to the world. But that, according to Mr. Neville Chamberlain, was in prospect but for Ottawa. We must have this watery cement of tariffs and quotas, or the Empire will fall to pieces.Here I would draw your very special attention - because this goes to the very crux of the matter, to the very essence of the difference between us - I would draw your attention to these sentences from Mr. Neville Chamberlain\u2019s speech, and, after all, he is the hereditary high priest of this policy. \u2018When he first got to Ottawa,\u2019 he said, \u2018he had the impression that the ties binding the Empire had begun to get dangerously frayed, and if something were not done to change the tendency of recent years the time would come when disruption of the Empire would actually begin. He believed that great danger had been averted at Ottawa.\u2019 Is there one man in this country who would say that he would cast off the Dominions if they did not reserve their markets for our trade? Not one. Then why accuse the Dominions that they would cast loose from us if we would not reserve our markets for their trade? Why suggest that the love of the Dominions and Colonies for the Motherland is nothing more than cupboard love?The Conference of 1930 broke down on these trade matters. Did the Dominion representatives go away angry, resentful, filled with thoughts of separation? By no means. They said their policy was Canada first, or Australia first, and they understood fully that the Mother country had a complete right to consider also its own economic interests. I have no use for this new brand of pseudo-patriotism. I am one of those who regard it as a degradation of religion to consider it as based upon some personal benefit to be obtained whether in this world or in some other, and so it is a degradation of patriotism to make it dependent on a material advantage to be got out of it.\u2018St. George for the Meat Quota!\u2019If this is to be our doctrine we may roll up the colours of our regiments; we may haul down the White Ensign from our ships, we may lower the Union Jack on the Houses of Parliament, and adopt a new flag with a glorious device, the words: \u2018Tariff preference.\u2019 St. George for the Meat Quota! Rule Britannia, provided always there is 2s. a quarter duty on wheat! We shall have, no doubt, long and vehement discussions upon these Agreements, but I hope we shall hear no more of this commercialised prostitution of patriotic ideals.There have been set on foot political discussions that can only be harmful in many parts of the Empire. In Australia, Mr. Scullin, the Leader of the Opposition and ex-Prime Minister, looking at the matter from the opposite standpoint to that from which we look at it, has declared formally that he and his Party if they come into power will not regard these Agreements as valid.In Canada, Mr. Mackenzie King, the ex-Premier and Leader of the Opposition, criticises the Agreements most vehemently, and has declared that the attempt to establish them for five years and make them un­alterable is, in his view, and to use his own words, \u2018fundamentally wrong.\u2019He proposes a completely different plan, and his policy has been remarkably vindicated at a striking test by-election which took place in Canada only a few days ago. Here, in this country, both the Liberal and the Labour Parties contest the constitutional right of the present Government to try to make these Agreements unalterable by Parliament. This is not the occasion to argue in detail the constitutional aspect of what we regard as a grave departure; we shall do that from our places in Parliament, and we shall substantiate there our assertion that it is con­trary to the spirit and to the practice of our Constitution to deprive Parliament of the right to lower or to alter any of the duties which it imposes unless the assent has been obtained of His Majesty\u2019s Govern­ments in other parts of the Empire. The Liberals of an earlier day did not fight, as they did fight, to establish self-government for the Colonies, free from Downing Street control, as it used to be called, in order to establish the converse - that Ottawa or Canberra, Wellington or Pretoria, should control the actions of the Imperial Parliament at Westminster.The Slender \u2018Advantages\u2019 of the AgreementsSome trade advantages for our industries these Agreements un­doubtedly will bring. Mr. Neville Chamberlain says that we have declared them to be worthless. That is not an epithet we have used. On the contrary, in our letter of resignation we said that they would undoubtedly bring some benefit to some branches of our trade; but we assert that those benefits are comparatively small and often doubtful. The Agreements in all their details will be published tomorrow. You will see as their most conspicuous feature that they involve a flat refusal of anything approaching Empire Free Trade. The Australian Agree­ment, you will observe, fully justifies the statement of Mr. Bruce, the principal Australian delegate at Ottawa, that it involves no radical departure from Australia\u2019s fiscal policy, and we know what that is. In Canada, you will observe that the staple branches of our textile trades get practically no advantages, while the iron and steel concessions were arranged outside the Ottawa Conference by agreement between the industries concerned; and although there is a formula which appears to give some assurance for equal treatment for British goods in competition with the Dominions in their industries, that is vitiated by one most formidable exception. Any industry is taken right out of that provision and may be granted any protection, no matter how high, \u2018if\u2019 (and these are the words of the Agreement) \u2018it is not fully established and has reasonable prospects of success.\u2019 What industry in the Dominions is there which would not claim that it is not fully established and has reasonable prospects of success? We know well these infant industries in protected countries; infant industries forty years old, weighing 15 stone, but still wearing baby clothes and calling out for \u2018Nurse.\u2019 All of these are wholly excepted from these provisions, which are supposed to give an equal chance for British industries, and whatever small advantages there might be, in our view the disadvantages are greater.There is a whole range of food taxes, and that we most vehemently oppose. Mr. Chamberlain tells us that the foreigner will pay for the privilege of entering our markets. We are told that the dear food cry is a mere bogy raised for political purposes, but sometimes we get words of candour coming to us from distant quarters. Yesterday the Times reported that Mr. Latham, the Federal Attorney-General of the Dominion of Australia, said that \u2018the Agreements offered very fair advantages to Australia, while for Great Britain they involved the imposition of taxes on food and restrictive arrangements which would increase food prices.\u2019 There is testimony from a wholly impartial source. How can any member of the present Parliament who gave pledges - and many members of all Parties gave pledges against food taxes, how can any who under­took to their constituents that they would vote against the taxation of the people\u2019s food now consent by their vote in the House of Commons to implement these Agreements? For my part, at the beginning of the last General Election campaign, opening the campaign in a speech at a great meeting at Bradford, I stated clearly and categorically that the Liberal Party was opposed to tariffs upon foodstuffs, and we shall oppose now such measures with all the energy at our command.It is true that world prices have been dropping during the last twelve months, and that has neutralised the rise in retail prices that would other­wise have taken effect, but, when world prices begin to rise, then there will be complaints of the dearness of the cost of living, and then these food taxes will be swept away. Already there are, it appears, some doubts. In February Mr. Neville Chamberlain said in the House of Commons that they were clearing the way for the restoration of pros­perity. Then all was bright and hopeful, but last week, in October, Mr. Baldwin said at Blackpool: \u2018If Protection fails I do not see our Party sticking to the carcase of dead policies.\u2019 And there are some whiffs already of an unpleasant odour.As for the three purposes which were declared last year to be the objects of the adoption of tariffs, we never hear mentioned today the question of the balance of trade; that is wholly forgotten; its name is never heard. As for revenue, these duties will provide very little, and I think it is true to say that Protection by hampering trade and business always destroys more revenue than it brings. The third was, Tariffs to lower tariffs. What a mockery! Next month we shall have the World Conference, at which the British Government is to give the lead for the reduction of tariffs and the abolition of quotas, while this month it will be passing a Bill through Parliament, every clause of which imposes additional duties or authorises further restrictions, and, worst of all, would make many of them permanent and unalterable for a period of five years, no matter what the World Conference may propose or may agree. So much for Ottawa.Peace and DisarmamentOur policy, the Liberal policy, must be laid plainly before the country. We must face in our own way the problems that surround us. We must lay before the country the distinctive Liberal view. And what, in any declaration of Liberal policy, must have pride of place, must come first and foremost, beyond compare and beyond challenge? There can only be one answer: Peace and disarmament. In the old watch­word of Liberalism peace came first. We see in these days in the League of Nations the only hope of the world. When I was at Geneva this summer for several weeks, as many of our friends who were there will testify, I laboured long days and often far into the night to endeavour to secure the maximum agreement for the maximum disarmament to which the nations could be brought to consent. Great and formidable are the difficulties in bringing countries into line when the feeling of goodwill and loyal confidence is not there; but the spirit of the Versailles Treaty and the Versailles undertakings, no matter what their letter may say, do undoubtedly require the general disarmament of all Europe. I shall rejoice in the strong expressions of public opinion from Liberals, and from men and women of all Parties, here and in all countries, in the Parliaments and out of them, which may help to save the Confer­ence from the grave dangers which do now threaten it, and will help to bring it to the full success which the hopes and the needs of mankind so imperatively require.Liberals are reformers. We exist to promote progress, to make head­way against poverty, to enlarge the opportunities for all men and women to live a full life. I care deeply for these things. I came into politics, now forty years ago, for the sake of social reform. If Liberalism does not stand for that I take no special interest in it. But social reformers are terribly handicapped in these days by the financial situation and by the immense and excessive burden of taxation. The war has made the whole country poorer. You cannot blow off into nothingness the value of ten thousand million pounds\u2019 worth of labour and not make any difference to all who are affected. Our first task has been to maintain financial stability; financial stability is the first condition of social pro­gress. We have restored it during the last twelve months with great difficulty and with much sacrifice. Our prime duty now is to see that that financial stability is not imperilled.The channels of trade must be freedThe World Conference may bring about monetary changes and bring help to a troubled world through those monetary changes; but they must be international, and with regard to them there is as yet no agreement. But there is universal agreement on one great world problem, and that is that it would be wise to free the channels of trade, that the choking of those channels of trade is the chief single cause of the world depression that is now pressing upon all the nations and throwing tens of millions of working people out of employment. There is universal agreement that the channels of trade must be freed. All say it, but the difference is that, while some are trying to get it done, others - and in this country perhaps more at this moment than anywhere else - are busy choking up yet more than before the very channels of trade it was their duty to clear. We should like to see this country enter into regional agreements for lower tariffs such as have already been entered into by Belgium and Holland. We should like to see us develop our trade with the one half of mankind that live in three countries, China, India and Russia. Large opportunities are there for the expansion of our trade and for bringing people into employment. Russia, with its 150 millions of population, in a state of active industrial development - their Government is their affair, not ours. We did not scruple to trade with the Russia of the Tsars. Why should we scruple to trade with the Russia of the Soviets?In this great matter of unemployment we see before our eyes, adver­tised in the press every day, the fact of enormous accumulations of un­used capital. The great conversions of War Loan so brilliantly successful give proof of it. They are a very good sign as to British credit, but a very bad sign as to British trade; they show that there is no active demand for money in industry and in commerce; and many of our industries, some that are more depressed, than any, like iron and steel and building, depend for their welfare upon the expenditure of capital which supplies a demand for their products and services. In our view the time has come when lending should not be discouraged but en­couraged, whether for private or for public enterprise - I draw no distinction between them - provided that no heavy burden is being imposed upon rates and taxes and that we do not run the risk of again having a great deficit in our Budget.Those are some lines upon which we believe that Liberal policy may proceed, and Liberalism must have an agricultural policy (A Voice: \u2018We have one.\u2019), active and definite, based upon science, upon marketing, upon land tenure reform, including the encouragement of small holdings. As one friend says, up in the Hall, \u2018We have one,\u2019 and a good programme it is, for England, Wales and Scotland, and the time will soon come when we should actively propagate it through­out the country. Industrial relations, the proposals in \u2018Britain\u2019s Industrial Future,\u2019 those must not be forgotten; and there is electoral reform at home, and in the Empire the building up that great edifice of self-government in India, of which Lord Lothian is one of the principal architects.Only in a few brief words have I been able to sketch out the policy which must be the main objective of Liberalism at headquarters and throughout the country in the months and years that are at hand. But let us be careful, in promulgating these ideas among the electorate, not to go one inch in promises beyond the prospects of fulfilment. Let us be scrupulous about it and understate our case rather than over­state it. The Labour Party has brought upon itself great discredit by the opposite course. It aroused high hopes among some of the keenest progressive minds in the country. Many of them have been discouraged by its adoption of an impracticable Socialism. I was one of those who hoped after the last Election that the lesson of that Election would have been learned, and that the Labour Party would adopt a carefully considered policy which would stand the test of practice, opening the possibility to some future co-operation between what are called the \u2018Parties of the Left.\u2019 That has not come about; the tendency has been just the opposite; and therefore on Liberals and on Liberals alone rests the duty of prudent, progressive leadership of the nation. So tonight I beg our friends to strengthen our organisations in the con­stituencies - now, in good time. By-elections may occur anywhere at any moment, and the next few by-elections within the next few months may have most important results upon the whole future of British politics. The date of a General Election is always uncertain. In politics it is always unsafe to prophesy, but I am inclined to think that, in view of the character of the last Election and the mandate given to this Parliament, it is unlikely that this Parliament will run its full term; it may fall very far short of it. Let us, then, heighten our zeal, expand our numbers, concentrate our ranks, say clearly what we mean to do, claim national support, and do it. We cannot rest with the country as it is. We in our generation must labour in order to restore to it its prosperity and its greatness, and make it worthy of its past.

aVAlthough this is only the first Session on the first day of the meetings of this Convention, let me make bold, at the very beginning of my speech, to offer on behalf of us all - and I feel also that I am speaking for millions of Liberals all over the country - our congratulations to the Convention Committee on the magnificent achievement which this crowded and purposeful Conference of vigorous, resolute and independent Liberals already represents.This gathering, the biggest Convention by several hundreds that the Liberal Party has held since the war, affords by its size, its enthusiasm and its geographically representative character a clear demonstration of the national scope, the constructive purpose, and the power of the Liberal Party - power now latent, but by your decisions at this Convention to be quickened and aroused. Then we shall once more draw into our counsels and into our political activities all men and women who hate tyranny, whether of the Right or of the Left, whether of privilege and monopoly or of officialdom and Governments, and all those who love freedom, justice, and peace, and mean to create a new and better order in which men and women shall live, in peace and freedom, a fuller and richer life.Such are the purposes of Liberalism, and we are entitled not merely to beg but to demand the help of men and women who share our aims. That is the main purpose of this Convention - effectively to organise in support of the Liberal Party the great mass of opinion in this country which shares its aims, but which stands aloof or strives vainly to achieve them through one of the other party organisations.The time accurately and fully to assess the value of this Con­vention will be at the end of your deliberations and when we begin to see the results - say in a year\u2019s time.Meanwhile, as a demonstration of the nationwide resources and resolute will of the Liberal Party, and of the eager and spontaneous response of the rank and file to the leadership of the Organising Committee, this Convention is already an impressive and inspiring success, and we do well to put that on record at the outset of our proceedings, along with an expression of our gratitude for their hard work and constructive inspiration to Lord Meston, to Mr. Ramsay Muir, and the members and officials of the Organising Committee.My friend, Lord Hutchison, addressing another Convention last week, said that as a good Scotsman, he was glad to know that so many delegates were attending that Convention at their own expenses As a good Scotsman, and still more as a convinced Liberal, I am glad and proud to know that every one of the eighteen hundred delegates to this Convention is attending at his or her own expense - and, more than that, is paying a registration fee for the privilege of directing the destinies and expressing here the will and purpose of the Liberal Party.We are here in the exercise of our responsibilities as citizens of a free country because we want to get certain things done which neither of the other parties will do, and because it is our duty to get together and work together to impress upon the people of this country the ideal of a Liberal Britain leading the British Common­wealth of Nations and the world in the paths of peace, disarma­ment, social and international justice, and, above all - because rightly understood it embraces all - of freedom.The Price of LibertyWe learnt at school that good old tag - that the price of liberty is eternal vigilance. Not that we really believed it - we probably thought that liberty was a law of political evolution which worked out more slowly and less successfully in some countries than in others, but was bound to assert itself in the long run. Now we have had to learn our lesson afresh from sterner teachers than those at school - from Lenin, from Mussolini, from Hitler. Britain is still the freest country in the world, still the best country in the world to belong to, in spite of the weakness and folly of the present Government, and largely on account of the statesmanship and foresight of Liberal Governments before the war and the leadership of great Liberals like Campbell-Bannerman, Asquith, Mr. Lloyd George, and Sir Herbert Samuel. Yet even in Britain we have seen ominous encroachments in recent years upon our economic and civil liberties.Fascism is, of course, the enemy of freedom and Liberalism, against which we must be, and are constantly, on the alert; but it is not the only enemy. Marxian Socialism is another enemy of freedom. The Labour Party, in so far as it advocates social reform and better conditions for the masses of the people, is following in the footsteps of its Liberal parent and in the same direction as we are going; but insofar as it attacks private property, denounces private enterprise and personal initiative, which we believe to be not only the mainspring of industry but the salt of life, and holds up, as its ideal, the nationalisation of all the means of production, distribution, and exchange, it is pointing the way to the totalitarian state, in which one party holds all power and crushes freedom, and in which the State, instead of being the servant, becomes the master of its citizens.Against such enemies we must vigilantly and strongly defend freedom. But the best form of defence is attack. We must attack Fascism and Marxian Socialism before they get strong. We must attack them in their strongholds; we must destroy the conditions which give them strength.Spreading PropertyThe Socialists who attack property are barking up the wrong tree. Property is not the enemy but the bulwark of liberty. A Labour Member of Parliament once said to a friend of mine that, after working very hard and having had a stroke of luck, he found himself with a balance of £100 at the bank - and then for the first time he felt he knew what freedom was. \u2018Money,\u2019 said Francis Bacon, \u2018is like muck \u2013 it\u2019s only good when it is spread.\u2019 So it has been one of the main objects of Liberal policy from Harcourt\u2019s Death Duties to Mr. Lloyd George\u2019s People\u2019s Budget, coupled with old age pensions, unemployment and health insurance, and other measures of social reform, to spread the possession of property and to give the worker that freedom which comes with economic security. It is not property but poverty which is the enemy for Liberals to attack.Class barriers, privileges and monopolies, these are the enemies which we need to attack. \u2018Socialism attacks capital; Liberalism attacks monopolies,\u2019 declared Mr. Churchill, who will never be so powerful and persuasive an advocate of his new heresies as he was of Liberalism.That was true, and no genuine Liberal can support a Government which, by repealing the Taxation of Land Values, and by tariffs and quotas, is constantly entrenching old and creating new mono­polies. Freedom is and must remain our constant aim.Political freedom was the great achievement of nineteenth-century Liberalism. We must complete that achievement in two ways.First, we must secure such an alteration in the system of election to Parliament that the danger of a majority elected to Parliament with a revolutionary programme, but on a minority of votes in the country, may be averted, and that every vote will have one value in every part of the country. Under the present system, Parlia­ment does not reflect, it distorts the opinion of the electors, of whom tens of thousands are virtually disfranchised. We must mend that system by electoral reform Take the great cities, London, Liverpool, Manchester, Glasgow, Birmingham, Leeds, and many others, and you will find hundreds of thousands of Liberals with virtually no representation at all. To deny to Liberals repre­sentation in proportion to their numbers is tyranny.Secondly, we must secure for the Scottish and Welsh people a greater measure of control over their national affairs, and let me take this opportunity of welcoming to our counsels for the first time a great Scotsman, a keen advocate of Scottish Home Rule, who is here today to show his confidence in the faith and future of Liberalism - the Duke of Montrose.Spreading ProsperityBut if political democracy was the great achievement of our fathers in the nineteenth century, and if it is, as I believe, our duty to complete their work, our main task in the twentieth century must be to secure economic freedom for the masses of the people. This generation is blessed with abundance and with a hitherto undreamt of power of production of all that is required for the material happiness of the people. We Liberals condemn equally the Government\u2019s schemes of control and restriction, the taxation of the food of the people, and the erection of monopolies, like the monstrous waste of the sugar-beet subsidy, on the one hand, and also the Socialist conception of an all-embracing monopoly under the control of the State on the other hand.We oppose to both the Liberal ideal of using the power of the State to liberate the energies of man, to encourage production, to free the exchange of goods and wealth between nation and nation, to curb the power of trusts, combines and monopolies, to safeguard the rights and opportunities of the small trader, industrialist and farmer, to protect the workman against arbitrary dismissal, and to raise the status and improve the prospects of the farm labourer.Then by providing better nourishment, especially milk for mothers and young children, by increasing nursery schools in industrial districts, by making better provision for milk and meals in schools, and for playing fields and physical training, and as I believe by an extension of the system now applied in unemployment grants, of family allowances, we should increase the consuming power and raise the standards of nutrition and physique of the people, and so wipe out the reproach - for it is a reproach in an age of plenty that one-third of the men who present them­selves at the recruiting offices of the army have to be rejected on physical grounds.By these means and by abolishing the slums, by raising the school age, by ensuring that lack of means shall never be a bar to a university education, and by improving and widening the range of vocational training, we should at last approach the Liberal goal of equality of opportunity for every boy and girl in these islands.Nor would this country under a Liberal Government lag behind other countries in shortening the hours of work and giving holidays with pay. There was a discussion at the International Labour Office at Geneva a few days ago on a resolution that a committee should prepare an International Convention for a forty-hour week. The Government of the United States of America voted for it. So did the French Government. So did Belgium, Spain, and Norway. Where was the delegate of the British Government? Did he abstain? No, with one companion, the delegate of Denmark, the British Government delegate voted against the resolution.No doubt the Government will presently tell us that the League of Nations has failed to secure a forty-hour week. The present Government uses the League of Nations as a cloak for its own impotence and futility.Social Reform and Sound FinanceA Liberal Government would find in the League and in the International Labour Office a powerful instrument for improving the lot of the workers and increasing the sum of human happiness.You will say that this programme would be costly; and you will rightly insist that the Liberal Party must never make the mistake which the Labour Government made in 1929-31, and which the Liberal Governments before the war avoided, of ignoring the principles of sound finance.Certainly we cannot afford to increase the high ratio which taxa­tion now bears to the national income. Yet in so far as they eliminated the appalling economic and social waste of unemployment, ignorance and disease, these enterprises would be sound investments.All the prophecies of woe with which the Tories greeted the Liberal programme of social services before the war have been falsified. Far from destroying thrift, for example, they fostered and encouraged it, and made it worth while. But to make such a programme practicable we must effect economies in expenditure in other directions and open up fresh sources of revenue.The reduction of unemployment and of armaments through an effective League of Nations policy pursued with faith and con­sistency are directions in which we must look for economy; while, on the other hand, by freeing the exchange of goods between our­selves and other nations, and restoring overseas trade, we should greatly increase our sources of revenue, and thus lighten the burden of taxation; and in addition, by the rating and taxation of land values, fresh sources of revenue would be opened up without laying new burdens on productive industry.So much for the objectives towards which we are working. Now for two of the great practical problems with which we are faced.Unemployment is WasteFirst, unemployment. We must always be alert to shatter the complacency which Government propaganda fosters about un­employment. On the whole the tide of unemployment is ebbing, but ebbing terribly slowly, and we are warned by the Statutory Committee on Unemployment Insurance, on the authority of the Economic Advisory Council, that it will probably begin to flow again and the figures of unemployment to mount in eighteen months\u2019 to two years\u2019 time.Even now, the fact that the figures are slowly declining ought not to blind us to the appalling dimensions of the problem and to the social and economic waste which is involved.One million seven hundred thousand is the published figure of the insured unemployed. Add the agricultural workers and the black-coated workers, for which no precise figures are available, and you are back at the two million mark.But to understand what that figure really means in human misery and frustration and economic waste, you must analyse it.Take the figures for the latest available calendar year, 1935. You will find that out of the twelve and three-quarter millions registered as insured, eight and a quarter millions made no claim at all on the Unemployment Insurance Fund. But that means that four and a half millions did claim, and their average experience was twenty weeks of unemployment in the year. So on the average one man out of every three insured workers suffered from this scourge during the year, and their average experience was that they were two weeks out of work for every three weeks in work.Now apart from radical treatment of the unemployment problem on which I shall presently have something to say, there are two things which ought to be done at once to help the victims of unemployment. The first is the production of the new Unemploy­ment Assistance Regulations. The Act under which these Regula­tions are due to be framed has now been in force for nearly two years.Liberal criticism of the original regulations was ignored in debate but justified by experience, and the regulations had to be with­drawn. That was a year and a half ago. We pressed the Government to produce new regulations, and they promised them in the spring. Still they remain wrapped in impenetrable mystery. The failure of the Government to grapple with this problem is one of the most glaring instances of their paralysis in the face of great issues. We shall continue to press the Government to introduce them and drastically to reform the Means Test, which, in its present shape, is breaking up households, destroying family life, and inflicting needless hardship on the most helpless victims of the economic depression.The second thing which ought to be done to help the unemployed is to enlarge the facilities for training men, and for restoring their skill to men who have long been out of work. One of the saddest and most ironic aspects of such recovery as has taken place is that while we have two million men unemployed, certain branches of some industries are already experiencing a shortage of key men who need exceptional skill and experience, and that men who have long been unemployed, especially the older men, are finding that they have lost their skill. To let these older men rust on the scrap heap would be a tragic waste of human material. They ought to be the first to be helped back into industry as it revives.Attack the RootsBut these, after all, are mere palliatives. What we Liberals demand is a constructive, vigorous, and radical attack upon the causes of unemployment. These causes are many and various, and deserve our close and constant study.Let me only mention two of the chief causes today. The first cause is that the Government are neglecting to do the work of national reconstruction which lies to hand; work like the abolition of the slums for which the Government\u2019s schemes are quite in­adequate, the desperately needed provision of water supplies in rural areas, electrification, land drainage, and reclamation, and an increase in the number of smallholders.We do not ask the Government to make relief works or to employ men unproductively. We do demand that they should plan ahead and not put off or slow down work which requires to be done in the public interest until money rates are high, until trade revives, and unemployment and public works would cause dislocation in ordinary industry, but to do it now when the men are idle and money is cheap.The second and most fundamental cause of unemployment is, of course, the destruction of our overseas trade by economic nationalism and by the Government\u2019s policy of protection and quotas. Protection has devastated our sea-port towns, rendered derelict the great areas which depend on exports, in South Wales, in North-East and North-West England, and in Scotland, brought ruin to the once prosperous fishing villages round our Scottish coasts, and strangled our shipping and maritime industries.The Economist had a remarkable article last week in which unemployment was analysed and divided into three categories - normal, cyclical, and special. In the last category was all the unemployment in our export trades, and in those other industries such as the distributive trades in the export and depressed areas which are dependent upon the earning power of the coal export industries; and the inevitable conclusion is that the only cure for nearly two-thirds of our existing unemployment is the revival of our overseas trade.I see that Mr. Ramsay MacDonald was making a speech at Cardiff on Monday. He declared that he would regret as long as he lived that certain circumstances occurred that prevented the World Economic Conference from coming to a successful issue. We should have to return, he said, again and again and again to that idea.The Curse of the Ottawa AgreementsThe chief circumstances, of course, which prevented the success of that Conference were the Ottawa Agreements, and the fact that while we were inviting the delegates of other nations to lower their tariffs and abolish their quotas to help our overseas trade, the Government was defending the Ottawa Agreements in Parliament and on the platform on the very ground that they enabled us to divert trade to Empire countries from these foreign countries with which we were about to negotiate.In 1933 Mr. Runciman, on behalf of the Government, in reply to the scathing criticisms of Sir Herbert Samuel - criticisms of his trading agreements and of the Government\u2019s failure at the World Economic Conference to secure multi-lateral agreements - declared: \u2018It has now become well-nigh impossible to cover the ground by any one agreement or by any group of agreements\u2019 - and, again, \u2018One thing is certain: that unless we are to proceed piecemeal (that is by bilateral agreements) it will be impossible for us to achieve anything like that agreement in trade relationships which is necessary for freeing trade.\u2019On Monday last, at Cardiff, Mr. MacDonald said: \u2018Tariffs, subsidies, quotas, and restrictions on currencies that could be exported to creditor countries, were problems that could not be solved by merely bilateral negotiations.\u2019 That was the Liberal case in 1932 and 1933, and still is.I have never wavered in my belief that the course which the Liberal Ministers took, under the leadership of Sir Herbert Samuel, in resigning from the Government on the Ottawa Agreements, emphasising the appalling consequences to this country and the world of torpedoing the World Economic Conference, was the right one.Now no less an authority than Mr. Ramsay MacDonald confirms the views we then expressed. But his speech, like so much else that this Government does, is just three years too late. In three years\u2019 time no doubt - probably less - he or Mr. Baldwin will be telling us that we made a fatal mistake in not upholding the Covenant of the League against Mussolini.And that brings me to another cognate problem. For there will be no revival of international trade without a reduction of tariff barriers, the stabilisation of exchanges, and the restoration of that confidence in international relationships which can result alone from lasting peace and disarmament.Conversely there will be no assured and lasting peace in the world and no disarmament so long as our own and other Govern­ments are following policies of economic nationalism, are treating trade as a means of national aggrandisement instead of mutual enrichment, and are hampering by preferential tariffs and quotas the access of foreign merchants and traders to the sources of food and raw materials in colonial territories.We must return to the Liberal conception of trusteeship as the sole justification for the possession of colonial territories - trustee­ship for the natives, safeguarding their right to raise their standards of living by buying in the cheapest market and training them increasingly to share in the responsibilities of government; and trusteeship for the interests of civilisation in those territories, including the sound Liberal principle of the open door for the merchants and traders of all nations.The League of Co-operationNow there is in the world one great international organisation through which these ideals of international co-operation can be advanced, and that is the League of Nations. It therefore follows that the League of Nations has received and will continue to receive loyal, consistent, and unswerving support from the Liberal Party.The conception which underlies the League of Nations is two­fold - on the one hand to assert the rule of law against arbitrary power and to secure the defence of the peace and freedom-loving peoples of the world against force and aggression. It aims at doing this by creating a system of collective security so strong and so certain in its action that it must deter any potential aggressor from the use of force; and to that system we must be prepared to make an effective contribution in those elements, by sea and in the air, in which we share common risks with our fellow members of the League.On the other hand the League seeks to remove the causes of war. The nation with a grievance must not only be deterred by the risks of war; it must also realise that a peaceful and effective means exists for the discussion and redress of grievances. Most important and threatening of all are the economic causes which have largely destroyed overseas trade, have spread impoverish­ment and unemployment throughout the world, and have closed the doors of nearly every country to migration.To secure peace and revive trade and employment we must get the world out of its strait-jacket of economic nationalism, and restore the free movement of men, capital, and goods over the surface of the globe.The Liberal Party alone of the three great parties in this country is solidly united in support of these twin policies, and in this crisis in the relations between our country and the League of Nations it is our duty to do all in our power to mobilise support for the League, and to stand by the obligations to which we are pledged under its covenant.Oh, God! Oh, Abyssinia!We must all feel ashamed at the destruction of Abyssinian independence, which it was in our power to prevent, but, if the struggle between Italy and Abyssinia is over, the far more important struggle between Italy and the League - between arbitrary power and the law of the covenant still continues. They say sanctions were not intended to be punitive, and that those who advocate the maintenance and intensification of sanctions are merely being vindictive. Sanctions were intended to prevent the aggressor from profiting from his aggression. The maintenance and intensification of sanctions would compel Mussolini - and it is the only way of compelling Mussolini - to come to terms which would be in conformity with the Covenant of the League.Our failure to give effective and decisive help to the Abyssinians, who fought so gallantly for their freedom, and withstood the bombs, and tanks, and gas of the Italian army and air force for nine months unaided, is sufficiently shameful. To refuse to honour our signature to the Covenant and to condone Italian aggression, which Ministers have denounced as a crime, because it has been successful, and when we have the power to frustrate it would be to touch a still lower depth of degradation.They say that the League needs to be reformed. In my view there is something much more urgent and practical to be done, and that is to reform the Government. It is not for want of material force that the League has so far failed - its material force is overwhelming in its struggle with Italy. It is moral force which has been lacking. It is not the machinery of the League, but the faith, the nerve, and the will of the Government which has failed.Strengthen the LeagueNevertheless no one would claim that experience has not suggested useful amendments to the Covenant. I would give two examples. Article XI of the Covenant, which deals with the prevention of war, is stultified by the fact that the vote of one party to the dispute can hold up action to prevent preparations for war. The League ought to be able to decide upon action to stop preparations for war without counting the votes of the party to the dispute.Then the machinery for revising obsolete treaties and meeting the legitimate claims of any country for the alteration of the existing order ought to be made workable. Article XIX has never yet been put into operation.Germany, Italy, or any other country should have the right of asking for the revision of any treaty or of bringing any other grievance to the notice of the Assembly, and of asking for the appointment of a Commission to study it; and the Assembly should, in my judgment, have the right to come to a decision and to call upon the parties to the dispute to accept its decision - enforcing it if necessary by action under Article XVI.There are other amendments which might be suggested, but those which seem to be favoured in Government circles are amendments which would enfeeble and emasculate the League.Those which I should favour would be amendments which would strengthen the League as a bulwark of peace and justice against aggression.The Effect of Even Partial SanctionsMr. Neville Chamberlain, in his now notorious speech, last week declared that the policy of collective security has been tried out, and that it has failed. He declared that he was not blaming any­body for the failure; he was merely recording it. The truth, which must be apparent to any careful student of the course of events during the past nine months, is that sanctions have not been tried out: that the machinery for applying them is still working smoothly and so effectively that the Italian reserve of gold and foreign exchange has been reduced by nearly half, and Italian trade by more than half.Here is a letter which I have received from a personal friend, for whose integrity and intimate knowledge of Italy I can vouch. I received it a few days ago, and a quotation from it runs as follows:I have just returned from Italy, arriving by sea from Naples - the port completely dead - not another ship besides our own - hotels mostly closed - hardly a motor about - thirty thousand in the glove trade alone are out of work; factories working three days per week and to be reduced to two; copper stocks practically exhausted, cotton the same. What more could be expected from these limited sanc­tions? The Italians are in a desperate plight for financial help, and think they will get it from Britain.So much for the increasing effect of existing sanctions, but further non-military sanctions were devised as long ago as November and agreed to by all the Powers, including Britain and France, which were represented on the Committee of Eighteen.If the oil and other sanctions then proposed had been applied, the war would have been over months ago, Abyssinia would have been free today, and the rule of law and the authority of the League would have been vindicated.But Mussolini blustered and threatened, our Government turned and ran like rabbits, and we witnessed the infamous and fatal betrayal of the League by the Hoare-Laval negotiations.Mr. Chamberlain may not wish to attribute blame for the failure, but the people of this country will rightly attribute no small share of the blame to our own weak, timid, disunited, procrastinating, and irresolute Government.True it is that the Government of M. Laval failed to give the League that prompt and wholehearted support in its struggle against Italian aggression which we had a right to expect from France. But a firm lead from Britain, forcing the French Govern­ment to choose between the League and Italy, would have brought even M. Laval into line. Meanwhile, however, the French people have expressed their will at the recent general election, and have returned to power a Government which is prepared to back up the League. No longer can our Government shelter behind French unwillingness to uphold the League. They have had to make their own decision, and they are to announce it this afternoon in the House of Commons.If that decision is, as the newspapers suggest, to recognise and condone the triumph of aggression in Abyssinia, to take the initia­tive at Geneva, or to support the initiative of some other power, in lifting sanctions, in short to be false to our obligations under Articles X and XVI of the Covenant and to the Government\u2019s pledges at the last election, it will mean that the reactionaries in the Cabinet have won, and it will be a challenge to all those who believe in the new international order, based on peace and justice - a challenge which none of us here will be slow to accept.Liberal Proposals and DemandsRefusal to recognise the annexation of Abyssinia, a ban upon lending money to Italy for the strengthening of her armaments and for the development of the territory which she is illegally occupying - indeed loans ought not to be made to any country which is at variance with the League - and the advocacy at Geneva of the collective maintenance and intensification of existing sanc­tions, are the demands which we shall make upon the Govern­ment. And in my view if Italy refuses to honour her signature to the Covenant it must raise the question whether she can be allowed to remain a member of the League which her Government defies.A League of Nations, strong in the collective security which it gives its members, willing to recognise the equality of all nations, and equipped with the means of redressing national grievances, offers us the best hope of exorcising the evil spirit of economic nationalism, restoring our overseas trade, solving the world problems of migration and unemployment, healing the secular feud between Germany and France, cutting down armaments and securing peace and justice for ourselves and our children.The goal of the Liberal State stands clearly in our vision. Our immediate tasks are plain, and we firmly believe that the problems with which our country and the world are confronted - problems which have been aggravated if not created by the neglect of Liberal principles - we believe that these problems can be solved by the Liberal measures which we advocate.It is therefore our duty, as it is our right, to take those measures which will be most effective in spreading the message of Liberalism throughout the country. We need money - we need carefully planned and co-ordinated activity. We need an efficient democratic organization energetically working in every part of the country, its activities co-ordinated by a representative authority in the Centre. We need good brains in the centre, too, constantly studying current problems, and elaborating and adapting our policy to solve them. All this we shall get under the new plan.But if Liberals are right - as I believe we are - in attaching supreme importance in life to the value of human personality, so in advancing the cause of Liberalism everything will depend on the work, energy, and sacrifice of each individual member of the Party.\u2018The Light,\u2019 says an Indian philosopher, \u2018is catching - like fire travelling from point to point, from soul to soul.\u2019 So must we spread the light of Liberalism - confident that we shall so hasten the dawn of a happier day for our own country and the world.

aVI welcome this opportunity of meeting - for the first time for two years - the Liberal Party Assembly, and of meeting it under the chairmanship of its trusted President, now, after his recent illness, so happily restored to health and strength, Lord Meston.Though public duty has kept me away from your deliberations, I have followed them with keen interest, and I have kept in touch, though not such close touch as in other circumstances I should have wished, with the work of your committees which have been studying important political, social and economic problems.The Report of Lady Violet Bonham Carter\u2019s Committee on Family Allowances; and the interim report of Mr. Harold Glanville\u2019s Committee on the reform of our electoral system and methods are bold and lively documents.They must not be pigeon-holed! Scrutinised certainly, amended if you will, further elaborated perhaps in certain respects, they must be regarded not merely as texts for speeches, but as starting points for action.For this Assembly will have been held in vain if the delegates do not leave it with a vital sense of the fresh responsibilities which the war has brought to the Liberal Party, and if they do not impart to their constituent organi­sations when they return home a new understanding of the opportunity which will present itself to them when the war is over - the opportunity and public duty of organising the huge body of Liberal opinion throughout the country and of obtaining for it effective representation in Parliament.For it was a leading member of the Labour Party who said in April in the House of Commons:'It is true that there is only a small Liberal Party in this House, but there is hardly one Conservative and hardly one Socialist. The war has brought us together as Liberals in defence of liberty\u2026 the over­whelming mass of all the people on our side in this war are Liberal.'Freedom and LawLiberal, not of course in any narrow technical sense - not in the sense that they would approve of every line of every resolution ever passed by the Liberal Assembly - but Liberal in the sense that they feel that freedom - freedom of the mind and spirit, freedom to seek out truth, freedom to speak and write as conscience dictates, freedom to criticise the rulers of a country, freedom of trade and intercourse between countries, freedom of enterprise and initiative - that freedom buttressed by law is the indispen­sable condition of human progress and civilisation.In the troubled truce between 1918 and 1939 the Liberal Party never wavered in that belief.It strove to build up under the aegis of the League of Nations a peaceful order based on justice, guarded by force, as the instrument of justice against lawless aggression.Never did the Liberal Party for one moment bow the knee to tyranny or aggression.It was prepared for all sacrifices and to contribute to the world forces then available for resistance to aggression, on a scale fully commensurate with the wealth and responsi­bilities of the Empire.There was no other way to preserve peace without sacri­ficing freedom.So after the war, when the world will be ready for revolt against tyranny and dictatorship, it will be our task to provide a broad and strong rallying ground for those who think with us in putting first among all political causes the cause of freedom.In the van of these new recruits to the Liberal Party will be the young men and women of the country.Even before the war, the most hopeful sign of the increas­ing vitality of the Liberal Party was the growth of the University Liberal Clubs and of the Young Liberals.No one will persuade me to become sentimental about youth. I doubt if the rising generation is noticeably wiser of braver than our own. True they are a good lot. I firmly believe that in no country now or at any time in history could you have found a more resourceful, strong-minded and valiant company of fighting men than the pilots and aircrews of the Royal Air Force today. None of you can realise quite so sharply as I do how miraculously they have fought. So, as they know well, did their fathers who flew out to fight the enemy day after day, without self-sealing tanks and without parachutes. So did their fathers who fought at Jutland, on the Somme, or at Passchendaele.The world might have been a better place today if those who returned as young men after the last war had played a bigger part in our affairs in the last twenty years.I do not believe that youth likes adulation - they won\u2019t get it from me - but in the life of a nation, youth is the sap imparting growth and vigour to the tree. If our politics are to be healthy and robust after the war, we must encourage the flow of that sap through the body politic.Youth has one handicap for politics - lack of means - we must remove it. Therefore I commend to you the sugges­tion made by Mrs. Corbett Ashby that constituencies should raise savings funds for service candidates.Remove the obstacles from the path of those young men and women, and let them bring into our counsels and into those of the nation the fresh outlook and strong impulses of youth.Tyranny, dictatorship, materialism, the rule of force, these things spell decay.Progress, beauty and happiness are gifts of the spirit conveyed to us through extraordinary men and women in every generation.Only in the atmosphere of freedom can their energies bear fruit and their light shine for the comfort and inspira­tion of their fellow men.Two RevolutionsDuring the present month we have celebrated two great anniversaries, the 4th July and the 14th July. The first was American Independence Day, commemorating the occasion 163 years ago when the triumphant leaders of the American Colonies proclaimed the citizens\u2019 right to \u2018life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\u2019 On the 14th July, 153 years ago the people of Paris stormed the Bastille, the building which stood there as the symbol of feudal privilege and arbitrary power.Those were the two great revolutions of modern history. They made possible the great Liberal era of emancipation which followed in the nineteenth century. What we are fighting today is the counter-revolution, which seeks to undo all the achievements of the great revolutionary epoch - the counter-revolution which destroys liberty, and which pro­claims that there can be no equality or fraternity between the Herrenvolk, the master race, and the other peoples of the world. There is nothing new about the Nazi creed. It is an attempt to re-impose fetters which, a few years ago, everyone believed had been struck off for ever. The system of forced labour by Poles and Czechs, who are compelled to leave their homes for Germany, the announcement that the subject peoples must return to the land, quite irrespective of the capacity of agriculture to re-absorb them, and become in effect tied to the soil through the absence of other occupa­tion; the differentiation everywhere between the ruling caste and the subject races, a differentiation which reveals itself in the food and clothing rations, in the manipulation of exchange rates, in the application of the law and in many other ways - all these are the sign of the modern feudalism.What needs to be emphasised is that the Nazis are as anxious to impose economic as political regimentation. They are the enemies not merely of free thought and free speech, but also of free enterprise. If Hitler were to win the war, the ordinary man would not only be prevented from speaking his mind or from worshipping or voting in the way that pleased him best. He would also be prevented from earning his living in any manner which did not com­mend itself to the Nazi planning authority. Here again is a reversion to the ideas which prevailed before the age of emancipation. If we are to fight Hitler in the realm of ideas as well as on land, on the sea, and in the air, these distinctions must be made abundantly clear. It would be of no use telling the peoples of the world that we propose to regiment and dragoon them in a slightly different way from Hitler.Economic FreedomWe stand for freedom as against Nazi slavery. It would be a profound error to limit or circumscribe that freedom. We must boldly proclaim that we aim not merely at freedom from foreign domination or from arbitrary tyranny, but also at the greatest possible freedom of trade and enterprise.In war time we have had to make many sacrifices of cherished liberties, but at the head of the Government stands a man who is not only the inspired war leader of embattled democracy in its fight against Nazi tyranny; but is also a true democrat and Parliament man - Mr. Churchill - and we have his pledge in the name of the Government that these liberties will be restored to us after the war.Social SecurityThen we must complete and extend that system of social security of which the last Liberal Government laid the foundations. Already we are making progress even in the stress of war. Improvements in Social Services advocated by the Liberal Parliamentary Party which have been carried out or are in process of being carried out since the forma­tion of the National Government under Mr. Churchill include:The Liberal policy in the field covered by the Com­mittee\u2019s work has been:A Minimum StandardIf the Committee should proceed on these lines, it should be possible to establish a basic minimum standard of sub­sistence as of right to every citizen in our democratic State.In another direction, too, we are making progress - in the development of Town and County Planning, in which field again, the last Liberal Government was the pioneer. We must root out the slums, prevent the evils of overcrowding, provide wide avenues for movement and transport into and out of our great cities, and stop the pillage of the public by the speculators. Then within the boundaries of an educated society so housed, so protected against ill-fortune, we must secure the greatest possible freedom for productive and commercial enterprise and initiative so that a man can buy what he likes, where he likes, and at the lowest price it can be economically sold to him.The many and varied problems, social, financial, and economic, at home as well as those of world reconstruction abroad, are already being closely studied by groups of Liberals.The conditions of their study are hard because it is so difficult to forecast the limits of what will be practicable after the war. Nevertheless, those of us who are engaged day and night incessantly in the fight against a ruthless and formidable enemy must be grateful to those who are thinking those problems out for us so that peace will not find us unprepared to deal with them.Meanwhile, the war must have the first place in our thoughts. For only on the basis of victory can we retain our freedom, and solve the problems you have been dis­cussing at this conference. My faith in victory is un­shaken, but I have never taken it for granted. Its price is, and will be for a long time to come, constantly increasing effort and sacrifices by us all.Week by week, Germany and Italy are feeling the grow­ing power of the Royal Navy, the Army, and the Royal Air Force. Our fighter squadrons are daily ranging deep into the industrial centres of Northern France, escorting our bombers to destroy the factories working for the enemy, and the railways and communications which serve them, and serve the military forces in occupation; and, fighting at their extreme range over enemy territory, they have destroyed on an average more than twice the number of aircraft that they themselves have lost. By day also, our Blenheims have carried out with increasing intensity their attacks on enemy shipping. They fly over the ships so low that they sometimes hit and break the masts, and above the docks also at Rotterdam and Havre and Cher­bourg, and even as far as Hamburg, Kiel and Bremen.Power of RAFApart from the raid on Rotterdam, they have sunk in the past four months no less than 300,000 tons of enemy shipping, and damaged as much again. The rate of destruction increases, and the weight of attack delivered on enemy ships in the first fortnight of this month exceeds any previously achieved.There has been a marked increase also in the weight of attack delivered by our heavy bombers on occupied France, and on Germany, particularly the Ruhr.In May this year, more than twice the tonnage of bombs was dropped by the Bomber Command than in May last year, and in June more than half as much again was dropped as in May.The strength of the Royal Air Force is growing steadily, and, as the nights become longer, Bomber Command will strike ever more deeply and more heavily into the vitals of Germany.Two events stand out in recent weeks. First, the characteristically treacherous Nazi assault upon Russia. It brings Russia where Liberals believe she would have been long ago but for the follies and vagaries of British and French policy before the war - fighting alongside us against the common Nazi enemy. And the Russian troops are fighting as stubbornly and valiantly as they have always fought in defence of their land and homes - but never before have they faced so formidable an enemy - and never have they fought so well.Geography makes it difficult for us to come directly to their help in the crisis of their battle between now and the autumn rains, but all that we can do to help we are doing, and we shall not relax or stint our efforts.The second outstanding event was the despatch of a United States expedition to Iceland, which, you may be sure, struck a chill even into the strong heart of Mr. Hitler.The Germans, with their great armies built up behind the protective screen of appeasement, have won many battles - but we have won battles, too: the great victories of our Army in Africa, and the brilliant naval actions in the Atlantic and in the Mediterranean; while in the air our pilots have decisively asserted their superiority wherever they can reach the enemy.Nazi MythsBut there is one man who stands out as the greatest victor of the war - and that is Doctor Goebbels. The gallant doctor has sunk nearly all the British mercantile marine and more British warships than the Navy possessed at the beginning of the war; but I don\u2019t at all like the spitefulness with which he pursues the Ark Royal - to sink a ship once - well, that\u2019s war; but Dr. Goebbels goes on sinking the poor Ark Royal again and again!As for the number of our aircraft that Dr. Goebbels has destroyed, I must confess to you, that I haven\u2019t dared to add them up - for I am quite sure that if I did I should find that I had no aeroplanes left at all.Then, why hasn\u2019t he won the war, you may ask, but he doesn\u2019t shrink from announcing from time to time that the war is over and that the Germans have won.So far the British people, like Wellington\u2019s troops in the Penisular War, have been too stupid to know that they were beaten, but Dr. Goebbels is not the man to despair of us, and especially if the fortune of war turns against Russia, you will find that he and Mr. Hitler will start a fresh peace campaign.It will be dinned into our ears that Germany has triumphed - attractive terms will be offered - the assurance of peaceful intentions and economic advantages will not be less clear, definite, and binding than those given to Czecho­slovakia, Poland, Holland, Belgium and Russia.We shall probably be offered generous slices of other people\u2019s territory.The gangsters will try and sell out at the top of the market.But the days of appeasement are passed. We know that Mr. Hitler\u2019s signature is worth no more than Dr. Goebbels\u2019 victories.We know that it is not pity for the war-torn countries that will move Mr. Hitler to suggest peace, but the rowing weight of our attacks on his war industries, shipping and communications, and the assurances of Mr. Harry Hopkins yesterday that the irresistible industrial might of the United States of America is ranged behind us in the war.We know the turns and twists of Mr. Hitler\u2019s policy, so his repentance will come too late.We know that the struggle will be long, and that we may have to endure far worse things than we have yet suffered, but we shall not flinch.Nor shall we enter into any arrangement with Mr. Hitler and his gang, for not till the cancer of Nazism is out of the body of Europe can health and peace return.

aVIt is the people whom the Liberal Party exists to serve - not a section or a class, nor an abstraction like a State or an Empire - but individual men and women and the families in which they live. To serve them - to create for them an environment of peace and justice, of beauty and happiness, and of health and freedom - freedom to express themselves in worship, in art, in literature, in craftsmanship, in commercial enterprise, or in farming the land from which they sprang, and freedom to enjoy the works of others - that is our aim and purpose.To achieve that purpose, the first requirement is complete victory over Germany, Italy and Japan. Rightly do you recog­nise in your resolutions our allegiance to the moral law. Liberals can never say, \u2018We know no King but Caesar,\u2019 but unless you do say that, you have not a chance of survival under the gangster rule of a Hitler or a Mussolini. Their cruelties and villainies, and the sufferings which they have inflicted on all the peoples whose countries they have over-run, have made any suggestion of a compromise peace intolerable to the conscience of humanity. The power of the dictators must be smashed and pulverised. We must assert the supremacy of law over brute force in Rome, Tokyo and Berlin. Until that is done there is not the remotest chance of creating that environment in which men and women can live in peace, freedom and productive activity.Let no one underestimate the concentration of thought and energy which will be necessary to attain it. Liberals loathe war - yet as soldiers, sailors and airmen, as civil defence workers, as sailors in our merchant ships, as workers in farms, and in factories and offices, they are in the forefront of this war. They are right - not because victory will solve our problems, but because victory alone will give us the opportunity to solve them humanely, wisely and well.It is easy to see that the world is in the midst of a revolution. No Liberal wants to go back to the old order - but some Liberals fear that we might. That is impossible - it has passed away beyond recall.A hundred and forty years ago we entered upon a similar struggle because we were convinced that Napoleon would be satisfied with nothing short of the domination of Europe. But after Waterloo, in the days when \u2018kings crept out to feel the sun,\u2019 we made the major error of trying to resurrect the Europe of 1789. We reinstated the Bourbons who, in the familiar phrase, had \u2018learned nothing and forgotten nothing.\u2019 We are not waging this struggle in order to restore the political and economic Bourbons of the twentieth century. It is easy to see that the old world has passed away.It is more difficult to discern the shape of the new world through the smoke of war. Two things, however, seem to me manifest. First, that there will be no salvation for any of us except on the basis of a stable international order. Everyone here must have welcomed the noble speech - which I am glad to see printed in our Agenda - by the United States Secretary of State, Mr. Cordell Hull.He states plainly the need for an international agency which will keep peace among the nations - and he emphasises this point on which we used to dwell before the war - by force if necessary. He demands an international court of Justice. We agree with him. The foundation of the new world order must be justice, buttressed by force, and administered in the first place by those nations who have fought and suffered for the cause of justice and freedom in the war. China, whose ordeal began so long before ours; the gallant Poles and Czechs, the first victims of aggression in Europe whose airmen have fought so brilliantly alongside our own - they must be there. The French, the Nor­wegians, the Dutch, the Belgians, the gallant Greeks who beat the Italian legions in every battle, the Yugoslavs, the Russians whose heroic resistance to the main armies of Germany has stirred the world to admiration and thankfulness; the Americans whose teeth are already in the tyrants\u2019 flesh and who will never let go; Brazil and the South and Central American Republics which have rallied to our cause, and of course the Dominions and India - they must all be there.Then Mr. Hull goes on to point out that we must also estab­lish a new and better system of international economic relations. It would be impossible to realise the economic objectives of the Atlantic Charter, he said, if America followed policies of narrow economic nationalism, such as their \u2018extreme and disastrous tariff policy\u2019 after the last war. \u2018We must realise,\u2019 he told his fellow Americans, \u2018that our own prosperity depends fully as much on prosperous conditions in other countries as their prosperity depends on ours.\u2019A world of 70 or so sovereign States, each with absolute political and economic power, would be a world leading not to peace and plenty, but to autarchy, anarchy and war. The world today is fast becoming one economic unit. A crisis in Wall Street in 1930 meant poverty on the banks of the Danube; in 1950 it might mean catastrophe.The events both of the war and the pre-war periods have shown, beyond any possibility of doubt, the folly of isolationism. When we hear the term \u2018isolationist,\u2019 we are accustomed to think of some of the critics of President Roosevelt in the United States. But we had our own isolationists in this country. Their doctrine of detachment expressed itself in many ways, and it was not an accident that many of the keenest supporters of the Ottawa agreements of 1932 were also those who argued that the Italian invasion of Abyssinia, the German occupation of Austria, the fate of Czechoslovakia, and the Spanish Civil War were no concern of ours.This is a very old issue in British politics. It dates from the days of Marlborough and Bolingbroke. But as a result of this struggle it ought finally to be determined. It is abundantly clear that we cannot, even if we would, disinterest ourselves in what happens on the Continent of Europe. No one would suggest that our interests can ever be exclusively European. Our ties with the Dominions will, I hope, be even stronger after than they were before the war. Our affairs are becoming, in the Prime Minister's phrase, \u2018increasingly mixed up\u2019 with those of the United States. But these affiliations with nations across the seas do not relieve us of our natural and inalienable share of responsibility for the future of Europe.So any major planning that has to be done - whether in relation to access to raw materials, conservation of natural resource or food surpluses - is the business of more than the one State within whose frontiers the immediate problem arises.Such major planning will be indispensable, both nationally and internationally. We must not allow things to develop in a haphazard, lop-sided, chaotic way under the uncontrolled impulse of profit-seeking and economic nationalism. Planning can indeed be used to cover a multitude of sins; it is possible for it to be a cloak under which vested interests can fortify themselves; but as Liberals we must plan to give our people at home and the nations abroad that equality of opportunity which should be available to all, large or small. We want to give the small man and the small nation the best chance of survival and of material, intellectual and spiritual development.Our task, when the war ends, or when the German armies are driven out from any considerable area, will be as much economic as political. We are all glad to know that plans are already being made in London and in Washington for the rehabilitation of the European Continent. It will not merely be a question of sending relief supplies of food and clothing and medicines. We shall also have to provide the plant and equipment, the fuel, and the raw materials which will enable our Allies once more to stand upon their own legs. Make no mistake - this will be a colossal undertaking. The Supply and Purchasing Organisations which have been established in Washington, London and elsewhere for purely war purposes may well prove their worth again during the period of reconstruction.It would be a cardinal error if we were to divorce the political from the economic settlement of Europe, and our first task, therefore, will be to plan recovery and reconstruction in concert with the United Nations.The second thing is this. I have often paid tribute to our heroic and trusted Allies of many nations in this war; but I have added that we cannot expect them to win the war for us - that it is on ourselves and on our own will and effort that we must rely for victory. So in peace we shall need all the peoples and Governments of the world to work with us - but not for us. To restore the world, work, sacrifice and discipline will be as neces­sary in peace as in war. The contribution of Britain to the common effort must be as huge in peace as it will prove to have been in war.While we are hoping to break down in this country all privi­lege that does not carry with it responsibility, we must remember that the same democratic ideas are afoot throughout the world.Greater equality at home implies greater equality between peoples throughout the world. How does this affect Britain? In 1938 our foreign investments amounted to about £4,000 millions. That meant that food and raw materials to the value of about £200 millions a year were coming into this country by way of interest to feed our people and our industries - values created by the enterprise of our forbears in the nineteenth century. One ship out of every six coming into this country brought us goods to which past savings entitled us.The needs of war have already made great inroads into our foreign investments, and they will shrink further as the war goes on. The loss is masked by princely gifts from our Allies - such as Lease-Lend and Canada\u2019s £250 millions\u2019 worth of food and munitions. But we cannot expect to be pensioners after the war.Our foreign investments and our lead in industrialisation have enabled Britain to support a population of 517 to the square mile compared with 43 in the United States and 20 in the U.S.S.R. We will have to support them in the future paying as we go in goods which we can induce the rest of the world to accept - in competition with other countries which have made good our industrial lead, or are in progress of doing so.The problem of producing after the war directly (or in­directly by foreign trade) the goods which will maintain and improve our pre-war standards is far from solved so far as post­-war Britain is concerned.This, as the Fabian Society has recently reminded the Labour Party, is the central fact of our post-war economy: it is more important than any doctrinaire views of what economic system is theoretically best. Those who talk lightly about the problem of production being solved and look forward to a future of slothful prosperity are living in a fool\u2019s paradise. We should be false to our trust if we lent ourselves to the deception that there will be nothing to do after the war but pass a few laws which will bring about a general increase in the standard of life.It is just that all citizens should be assured of enough to maintain themselves like civilised human beings. There should be a national minimum of food, clothing, shelter, access to health services, recreation and the rest. But the prime need of post\u2011war Britain will be not merely to redistribute the existing pool of wealth but to increase the pool. This demands that men of initiative - skilled workers, inventors, businessmen ready to risk their savings in developing ideas which may give employment to thousands - shall have scope to try new processes, start new businesses and exploit the energy which is the lifeblood of any economic system.Britain is the last country in the world who ought to develop the economic Maginot Mind. That way lies stagnation and a falling standard of life. While it ought to be made clear that no private concentration of economic power will be tolerated which is strong enough to hold the community to ransom, there ought to be room for different types of industrial organisation, ranging from the public utility to the \u2018one-man concern,\u2019 from the large farm heavily capitalised with every modem scientific and mechanical appurtenance to the small-holding and allotment. Where there is variety, there is scope for experiment without endangering the whole fabric of economic life if the experiment proves a failure. I observe in this connection that most of the resolutions and amendments on the order paper raise an old issue in a new form.That in itself is nothing new. Each generation is under the necessity of reconsidering and restating the relationship between the individual and the State. Economic changes, political changes, mechanical developments, changes in habits and tastes, all make it inevitable that the problem should constantly recur, and the welfare and happiness of every community depends upon the degree of success with which it is solved.In a modern State there must be power which can be swiftly and effectively wielded, but not arbitrary power. The distinc­tion between our form of government and that of the Nazis does not lie in the holding of elections, because they, too, hold elections of a kind. It does not lie in the consent of the governed because Hitler has been able to obtain the acquiescence of at least the majority of the German people. The real distinction lies between government by law and government by caprice. That is a distinction which we must preserve, as much in the economic as in the political field. Do not let us place ourselves at the mercy of every bureaucrat \u2018dressed in a little brief authority.\u2019If, however, we are to avoid the alternative evils of economic anarchy and bureaucratic stagnation, we shall have to make very considerable changes in the machinery of government. Before the war, both the larger Parties showed a singular reluctance to consider organic reforms. There were many Statutes increasing the functions of public authorities. Yet comparatively few people stopped to ask whether our legislative and administrative structure was capable of bearing the increasing weight, or of standing against the shocks which were certain to come. In the realm of administration, for instance, we have had hurriedly to devise in time of war improvements which should have been carried out at leisure in the preceding years. For this reason I welcome in particular the Liberal report on the Reform of the Civil Service, recently presented. It is already widely recognised as a valuable contribution to the great task, which lies ahead, of devising an instrument of government which will meet the needs of twentieth century democracy. Now, as in earlier generations, the Liberal Party is the pioneer in the field of constitutional reform.I cannot pay tribute within the compass of a single speech to all the activities of the Liberal Policy Committees, but there is one other committee whose work is in a field of such especial importance that I must commend its recommendations to your particular study, and that is the Liberal Education Advisory Committee. We are fighting to preserve our civilisation - this committee has been thinking how, when civilisation has been preserved, we can improve its quality. There is no more vital or natural field for Liberal endeavour.What matters is that we should be firmly united when it comes to action. Nations will have to sink their differences, Parties within nations will have to sink their differences, schools of thought within Parties will have to sink their differences, if we are going to get a common action to save the world from ruin after the war.Let me, in conclusion, thank you for coming together in such great numbers today. Four things in particular keep me braced for my work in the war. First, the glorious example of our fighting men - and naturally I think more especially of the brilliant daring of our fighter pilots and the cool, enduring, unflinching courage of our Bomber and Coastal crews. Secondly, to meet a gathering of my fellow Liberals, who never fail to send me away refreshed by their friendship, their support and their confidence, and stimulated by their high purpose. Thirdly, the knowledge of the terrible sufferings of the people in Europe, now reduced to literal slavery to the Nazis. Many a man and woman in this hall has drunk deep of the cup of sacrifice, but it is difficult for us to plumb the abyss of horror and degradation into which the Nazis have plunged millions of our fellow creatures in Europe. The families ruthlessly torn asunder - the young men sent one way, the young women another way, as slaves of their oppressors. The hostages waiting to be led to execution for deeds that no one even alleges that they have committed; and the dull brutish horror of Nazi rule. Did you read of the Russian soldier marching into a liberated village and giving half a loaf of bread to a pale, bent, white-haired woman? She pressed it to her chest, and just cried. So the soldier said, \u2018Cheer up, old woman, the Nazis won\u2019t be coming back.\u2019 \u2018Am I an old woman?\u2019 she answered. \u2018I am only 28!\u2019 That starving, withered old woman of 28 had escaped from the horror which is blighting the beauty and corrupting the soul of Europe. I tell you that my whole thought and action are concentrated on destroying it. My Conservative and Labour colleagues are working in the same spirit. They are men of strong character and independent views. We don\u2019t spend our time in Cabinet handing out bouquets to one another; our discussions are vigorous and sometimes lively, but always directed not to sectional or Party advantage, but to the one single aim of defeating Hitler. Don\u2019t ask us to break off from our work together at defeating the Nazis to fight bye-elec­tions: I tell you frankly I am not prepared to do or say anything which will in the slightest degree loosen the concentration of the Government and the great Parties on the tasks of war. Burke might have been writing for us today when he said: \u2018When bad men combine, the good must associate; else they will fall, one by one, an unpitied sacrifice in a contemptible struggle.\u2019And the fourth stimulus I mentioned, but not the least, is the glorious fighting leadership of Mr. Churchill. Directing and inspiring the war effort of this country, he links it with that of America and Russia. The friendship which has long existed between him and President Roosevelt, and which now embraces Premier Stalin, is one of the surest guarantees of the victory of the Allied Nations in this war. The burdens he carries are colossal, but I have never seen him falter. Stand by him; and when they criticise him, stand by him all the more - it is bad weather and not good weather that tests sincerity and firmness of purpose. We have passed through fiery trials with our purpose un­shaken and our faith strengthened. So long as we preserve our faith in the supreme value of the individual soul, and so long as we know in our hearts and consciences that we are pursuing no selfish, personal, Party or national aims, but seeking to vindicate the rights of men to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness, none can make us afraid. In that sure faith we shall conquer, and when the storm subsides and when peace and justice reign, in that sure faith we shall build.

aVThere are no happier occasions in life than when friends meet and rejoice together. Such an occasion is this. As Liberals we have a particular reason for rejoicing, to which I shall presently refer, but we also have the supreme reason for rejoicing - which we share with all our fellow countrymen and with our friends and Allies of the United Nations - the forward surge of our victorious land, sea and air forces in the Mediterranean. Defeat is always bitter, but defeat in their Sicilian outwork will be more of a blessing than a calamity to the Italian people if it banishes from their minds the illusions which Mussolini and his Fascists have sedulously fostered, and if it reveals to them the path of wisdom. They should receive - and there are signs that they are receiving - the Allied armies not as conquerors but as liberators.We can have no dealings whatever with Mussolini and his Fascist gangsters. But for the Italian people we have no enmity. Let them purge themselves of Fascism and revive those traditions of freedom and democracy which were once their pride. Then they will regain their rightful place in the comity of European nations. Honourable capitulation is the course which the British and American Governments have recommended to the Italian people. Till they accept it, the armed forces of the United Nations will wage ruthless war against them. Half measures are cruel in war: they increase the toll of casualties. It was Mussolini who wantonly appealed to the hard arbitrament of war, and nothing but the repudiation of Mussolini and unconditional surrender can now save the Italian people from its severities.Nor must rejoicing over the substantial successes that our armed forces have achieved in recent months blind us to the formidable character of the task which they have yet to accomplish. Germany is immensely strong. All the industrial resources of Europe are at her command. The brains of her brilliant scientists and technicians are concentrated on the invention of new and the improvement of old weapons of war. Millions of foreign workers have been enslaved and forced to work in German war factories. When Hitler had inflicted a series of heavy reverses on our gallant Russian Allies in 1941, he declared that the road lay open to Moscow. He was wrong. We must not make the same mistake. We must not think that because we are winning victories in the Mediterranean theatre of war, and because Bomber Command is tearing at the very vitals of German war industry that the road lies open to Berlin. It is a long road with many turnings, and the Germans will fight back at us hard and furiously. So the war still demands the utmost concentration of our efforts on its vigorous prosecution.Therefore I am grateful for the renewal of your pledge of support to the Government. We have been through hard times in the last three and a half years. I told you at the beginning of the war that it was bound to be full of reverses, setbacks and disappointments. When we stood alone, when our munition supplies were still scanty, while we were still paying the price of Parliament\u2019s repeated rejection of the Liberal Party\u2019s demand for a Ministry of Supply before the war, when, consequently, we were suffering successive defeats, there were in all Parties weak-kneed men whose faith was shaken; but Parliament as a whole and, I am proud to say, the Liberal Party as a whole stood by the Government as strongly in foul weather as in fair. The knowledge of the support of the Liberal rank and file through­out the country, and of this Assembly, has sustained me and my Liberal colleagues in the Government when things were at their worst for us and before our plans could come to fruition. I thank you for it with all my heart.When we look back upon the war in future years we shall be proud of our steadfastness and of the unswerving support which we have given to our great Leader in this crusade - Mr. Churchill. Defeat never dismays him; victory never dazzles him. War requirements have compelled the Govern­ment to obtain and exercise exceptional powers; not only has the Prime Minister never abused them but he has been scrupulous in his respect for Parliament and in his determina­tion to base himself and his Government on the authority of Parliament. He has been rewarded by the wholehearted confidence and devotion of the British people; while the relations of mutual respect, trust and understanding which he has established with the Leaders of the other United Nations, and especially with President Roosevelt and Premier Stalin, form not only one of the surest guarantees of our eventual victory in this war but one of the brightest hopes for the establishment of a lasting and fruitful peace. Nothing is more certain than this - that neither Britain nor any other country after the war will be able to assure the peace and prosperity of its own people by its own unaided efforts. Immediately after hostilities have stopped in Europe swift concerted action will have to be taken in many fields of activity by the three great nations, in whose hands power will reside - Britain, Russia and the United States. Our biggest task, of course, will be to rescue China and to finish the war with Japan. At the same time, we shall have to disarm our enemies, restore order and justice in Europe, do our utmost to relieve the hardships and privations of the people of the countries now in German occupation, and begin the process of European reconstruction and the resumption of inter­national trade. As Mr. de Rothschild said in the House of Commons the other day, we shall have to transform our economic warfare into economic welfare. In tackling these problems all the United Nations will have to work together, but they will all look, and will be entitled to look, to Britain, the United States and Russia for leadership.Before this war there were many people who thought that if a nation were only quiet and inoffensive it would never get into trouble. The fate of Norway, Denmark, Holland and Belgium and other small countries should have banished that illusion, which was one of the weaknesses from which the old League of Nations suffered. So, peering further into the future I hope that confederations will be formed of the smaller nations in different parts of the world, and that these con­federations will be represented, along with the great Powers, on the councils of international administration. Thus we should give effect to the principle of the equal, but not absolute, sovereignty of States, great or small. The common interest of all the peoples of the world in rising standards of living and in the improvement of working conditions in all countries and in all occupations must be safe-guarded by the International Labour Office, which should receive from the British and other Governments much closer and more under­standing co-operation in the future than it has had in the past. Technical organisations must be established to study the world problems of commerce and finance and to encourage the freest possible development of international trade. Above all, there must be a tribunal to which international differences can be referred, and armed forces must be available to enforce its decrees and to prevent any recrudescence of uncontrolled national armaments or any other form of international gangsterism.Sonic people are very particular in the choice of their friends and very catholic in the choice of their enemies. There would be a great danger to the future world if that attitude of mind were carried into international politics. For my own part, I am very particular in the choice of my enemies. At the moment I have no enmity to spare for anyone except Hitler and Mussolini and their friends, and the German people have proved themselves to be such unscrupulous accomplices of Hitler and the Nazi gangsters that it will be a long time before they will be able to regain their position among the civilised nations of the world. If, however, we are to construct a just and lasting international order, we shall have to work with a great number of people who live in far-away countries and of whom we know little. We must strive to increase our knowledge of these people, whose co-operation with us will be indispensable and whose interests and ideals we must consult and respect. It is much easier - and often more popular - to inflame suspicion than to cultivate understanding, but we must under­stand and work with not only our own Dominions, India, and the people of our Colonial Empire - whose interests and welfare must be our constant preoccupation - but also with foreigners; not only with Americans and Frenchmen, but also with Russians, Chinese and the men of many other nations if we are to build a lasting peace and give useful work and a sense of purpose in life to our own people after the war.Indeed, the best-contrived structure of international order and peace will inevitably collapse if its economic foundations are unsound and if masses of men and women in many countries are condemned to unemployment and falling standards of living. No longer are Liberals alone in asserting that protective tariffs and other manifestations of economic imperialism and nationalism impoverish man­kind and lead to war. The same truth is proclaimed by Mr. Sumner Welles and by other spokesmen of the American and other United Nations; it is proclaimed also by the spokesmen of other Parties here, and Liberals must welcome with especial warmth the success of the first great international conference on an important aspect of these problems - the recent Food Conference in Virginia, for which a generous share of credit is due to the leader of the British delegation, Mr. Richard Law. Before the war we were accustomed to receive every year as interest on our foreign investments some £200 millions of pounds, consisting in large part of food and raw materials. Nearly all those investments have gone - we have sacrificed them to win the war: so after the war we shall have to export goods or give services, in return for all the food which our people eat, over and above what we can grow at home, and for almost all our raw materials except coal. Clearly, therefore, we shall have to refrain from consuming a great many of the much-needed fruits of our own labours at home after the war in order to export them to foreign markets in exchange for food and raw materials. Hence the necessity for keeping on controls - even some of those we most dislike - for some time after the war. Hence, also, the impossibility of achieving our social and economic aspirations at home without laying the foundations of a just and free political and economic order abroad.These are reasons for realising the primary and supreme importance of laying broadly and soundly the political and economic foundations of the world, in concert with the United States, Russia, China and the other United Nations.They are not reasons for ignoring our own domestic problems. The Liberal Party has not ignored them: on the contrary it has given them the most intense and fruitful study - and that is our particular reason, as Liberals, for rejoicing today! Well do Sir Percy Harris and his hard­working colleagues deserve the thanks which you have so generously voted to them for their strenuous labours. You recognise in that resolution of thanks that the uncertainty of the post-war outlook - indeed the grave uncertainty as to when the war will come to an end, for the end is far from being in sight - renders it impossible for the Party to be committed to the details of these resolutions. There is, however, every reason why the Party should make its ideals clear in plain language which people will understand. We are all of us victims from time to time of misunderstanding and sometimes of misrepresentation. We should be the victims of the greatest misunderstanding of all if excessive caution prevented us from voicing our generous aspirations.That great Liberal Leader who brought us through the last World War - Mr. Lloyd George - has often been criticised, and criticised most unfairly, for the phrase which he used about building homes for heroes. For my part, I think it was a splendid vision which would have been realised if we had had a Liberal Government in power in the last twenty years with Mr. Lloyd George as Prime Minister.So I am glad that you are looking ahead and thus fulfilling your duty to the men who are fighting.They are asking, \u2018What is going to happen to us after the war?\u2019 A high officer in the Royal Air Force was telling me the other day that some of the officers who had fought in the squadron which he commanded in the last war were in unemployment and destitution after it. It isn\u2019t enough to say \u2018We won\u2019t allow that to happen after this war,\u2019 for it will happen after this war unless we solve the hard, practical problems of economics, commerce and finance. It is not even enough to say \u2018We will give them pensions after the war,\u2019 for unless we solve those practical problems of economics and unless all the nations of the world will work together to find and practice the right solutions, pensions will be worth no more than the paper money which the Germans used to cart about in wheelbarrows when they slid into the morass of currency inflation. Nothing could shake the confidence of the people in Parliament and in the good faith of their political leaders more than to find after the war that the savings they had lent to the Government had shrunk in value through improvident finance, or that a pension of a pound a week brought no more - or even less - than a pension of ten shillings a week before the war. Therefore generous impulses are no substitute for hard study and wise policy.Such study you have given to these problems, and I am delighted to find myself in broad and general agreement with your conclusions. You have addressed yourselves to the difficult problems of reconciling public welfare with private liberty; attacking poverty, whether produced by unemploy­ment or by the evil of low wages; bringing monopolies under some measure of public control and accountability; stopping monopolistic practices which lead to restriction of output; increasing the avenues of investment open to the State; while on the other hand preserving and fostering that private enterprise and initiative which is the mainspring of the economic life of the country and which gives to industry and commerce much of its adaptability and virility, and much of its incentive to fresh growth and swift development. To respect and preserve the dignity of man and his personal responsibility for the performance of his duty to the State to the limit of his capacity must at all times be the special task and paramount duty of Liberals. I should like in particular to express my agreement with you in your aspirations for social security - that is to say, for a minimum standard of food, shelter and clothing for all our people. To my mind it is utter nonsense to suggest that ragged clothes, draughty houses and under-nourishment are the best incentives to good work. It is true that some quite exceptional individuals of outstanding character and ability have risen to eminence from the humblest homes in our great cities and in the countryside; but for the most part our leaders have been drawn from homes which have enjoyed the blessings of economic security, and I do not believe there is anything in a sufficient provision of good food, good housing and good clothes which will dull anyone\u2019s instinct to give expression to his natural gifts and to win the prizes which, in a well-ordered society, will reward the man of enterprise and exceptional character and talents. I think you will find - and I think you will be glad to find - that when our soldiers, sailors and airmen return from this war they will be more politically-minded than most of our generation were after the last war. They have thought a good deal about the future of our country and of them­selves and their families: they want to have some part in shaping it. They cannot all be Members of Parliament, though a good many of them want to be! But this is a free country, and there is no reason why they should not all play a great part in political organisations, on the platform and in the press, in advocacy of their political and social ideas. And, for my own part, I believe that the Party which is willing to give them the warmest welcome will obtain a robust, vigorous and invaluable inspiration and reinforcement. I hope that Party will be the Liberal Party, and I hope you will rope the young men into your Associations and Committees - and not only rope them in; for they will soon leave your Committees if all they are expected to do is to sit and clap their hands at your distinguished speakers. You must give them responsible work to do - send them as delegates to Party Conferences and elect them to responsible offices in their Party Associations and other organisations: then seek out the best of them and adopt them as candidates for Parliament.It is much too early to prophesy when and under what conditions the next Election will take place. I have always recoiled from the prospect of a General Election fought immediately after we finish the war against Germany. As we remember from our experience of the 1918 Election, the atmosphere is charged with emotion. Such emotion is particularly likely to produce a Parliament which is a distortion of the true will of the people under the present electoral system, and I feel sure that the Party will make every effort to persuade public opinion of the necessity for reforming that electoral system - a necessity to which a resolution now on the Order Paper of the House of Commons, and signed by over a hundred Members of Parliament, bears striking testimony. Nevertheless, as the life of the present Parliament is extended from year to year, the feeling grows that consultation with the electors ought not to be unduly delayed and, in my judgment, the demand for a General Election as early as possible after the defeat of Germany will be irresistible. If that is so, it will throw upon Mr. Churchill an immense responsibility, for not only will he have the last word in deciding the time and conditions of the election and the issues on which it will be fought, but strong among the emotions of the people at the end of this war will be deep admiration and thankfulness for, and confidence in, the great Prime Minister who will have led the nation through so many and such great dangers.Meanwhile, so long as the three great Parties are represented in the Government it is - in my opinion and in the opinion of every member of the Government, to whatever Party he belongs - a necessary corollary that the electoral truce should be maintained. Its abandonment would set up grave strains and stresses within the Government and weaken its concentration on the day-to-day task - but the supreme task - of winning the war. But the truce applies only to bye-elections during the life-time of the present Parliament, and we who signed the truce have entered into no commitments whatever beyond that and are absolutely free to take what ever decision seems right when the time comes. And in taking that decision we must be moved by no considerations of personal or Party advantage but consider only where our duty lies to our country and to the causes which the Liberal Party exists to defend.In the meantime the Government is making large plans for the restoration of peace, order, justice and commerce throughout the world. If, but only if, agreement is found to exist on these plans, there would clearly be a strong case for preserving the unity of the Government for a period of reconstruction - a period during which the common interests of mankind will require swift and resolute action. However that may be, I can tell you this - that no member of the Liberal Party is more determined than I am that, come what may, the Party shall not barter its independence or lose its individuality in a permanent coalition with any other Party.For we have important work to do. Here, in the resolutions which you have passed, are the broad outlines of a policy which would provide ample work for more than one Liberal Parliament. Here is a platform on which not only the Liberal Party as now constituted can stand firmly and aggressively, but on which all men and women of Liberal and progressive outlook can join us, and the stronger and closer our own cohesion, the more support we shall attract from men and women of good will now outside our ranks.Four days ago my old friend and colleague, Mr. Ernest Brown, spoke to me. He opened the conversation from a public platform; so I will answer him here and now. In old days he and I worked strenuously together for the Liberal Party and I am grateful for his frank recognition of the fact that subsequent political differences have never caused any personal estrangement between us. I gather from what he said that, if there is agreement upon policy, he and his friends are willing in future to work closely and continuously together with you and me. If that is the true interpretation of what he said, I am glad of it. Experience has shown that the existence alongside the Liberal Party of another Party with a Liberal appellation confuses the electors. It gives Liberals an undeserved reputation for faction fighting and heresy hunting, and plays into the hands of our opponents. Therefore I want to see the Liberal Party strong, united and reinforced by all men and women who subscribe to its principles, will support its policy and will resolutely maintain its identity and its independence. On that basis I shall be very glad to talk things over with Mr. Brown. For I believe that the stronger and more united is the Liberal Party, the better it will be for our country and for the world after the war. We want to build after the war a great Temple of Peace and Justice raised to the memory of those who fell in the war. We want to root out the cancer of Nazidom and revive the Liberal ideal of the rights and dignity of man. We may differ among ourselves and with others about methods, but our only enemies must be those who would put private and sectional interest above the public welfare, and assert national interests against the general interests of mankind. We are not fighting the war as Liberals for power, or glory, or riches, or territory - but for freedom and justice and to bring scope, beauty, dignity and purpose into the life and heritage of the common man.

aVIt seems a long time since we have met together - not since July, 1943. I told you then that the road to Berlin was a long one and that the war was not nearly over.Those, too, who remembered what I told you then about the German scientists - how they were bending their diabolical energies to the invention of new and the improvement of old weapons of war - will not have been surprised at the advent of the flying bombs and the rockets. But for the pre­ventive measures we took, the at­tack would have been on a scale many times as great as we have in fact experienced. So then - in July, 1943 - I pointed to a long vista of war stretching out in front of us.Now I tell you that we shall not meet again in this Assembly until Germany is beaten and victory in Europe won. This conference, therefore, is a conference of the Liberal Party militant.The Party still shoulders, in full loyalty to the Prime Minister, its share of the heavy and tragic bur­dens of war, but it is preparing - when the war in Europe is finished - to enter the ensuing General Election as an independent Party.Wartime UnityEver since the summer of 1940 - at once our darkest and our finest hour - this nation has derived im­mense strength from the political unity of its people. For nearly five years the Liberal Party has been an essential part of the structure of this Government - the Gov­ernment which has led the country through the most terrible and searching ordeal in its history. Our men in the fighting Services have been fortified by knowing that a Government - not only of great power but of great singleness of purpose - has been behind them with all its might and main. The political unity which we have achieved in this country has been matched by the support and com­radeship freely and staunchly given by the Governments of the Com­monwealth and Empire.Apart from one or two splinter groups, there is no organised politi­cal force in this country which does not applaud the major achieve­ments of the Government, and which does not wish to see it con­tinue until the end of the German war. That situation has no prece­dent in all the two and a half cen­turies which have elapsed since our Party system first began to take shape. The chief credit for it be­longs to Mr. Churchill.ChurchillThe spirit and ardour of Winston Churchill will be writ large on the pages of 20th-century history. We - his immediate followers in the Government - know what his resourcefulness, his courage and his zeal have meant to the country. Yet we all realise that his strength and his capacity to lead is derived from the character and steadfastness of the British people. Like a prism which catches the light and throws it out in a diversity of brilliant colours, he has caught the spirit of Britain and illuminated it with his own dazzling gifts. We may apply to him some words which he applied to his illustrious forbear, the Duke of Marlborough - \u2018Happy the State or Sovereign who finds such a servant in years of danger.\u2019Government PlansThis Government came together - Liberals, Conservatives and Soci­alists - inspired by a single purpose - to win the war; but we have not neglected social problems or those of post-war reconstruction. Last Session, for example, Parliament passed that great piece of con­structive and progressive legis­lation - the Education Act. The Wages Councils Bill, now go­ing through Parliament - with its forerunner, the Catering Act - will bear comparison with our great humanitarian factory legislation. The arrangements for releasing men from the Armed Forces after the defeat of Germany - a process which produced so much discontent and confusion after the last war - have been carefully thought out, have commended themselves to the troops as fair and wise, and are impervious to the assaults of influ­ence or wealth. In the White Paper on Full Employment and the White Paper on Social Insurance, the Government has planned to meet the changed conditions of the post-war world. Mr. Churchill\u2019s Government is not slithering or blundering into the paths of peace. The Government is making plans. Things were not always so. This is a big departure in policy. My memory goes back to the bad old days of the twenties and thirties, when successive Tory and Socialist Governments sat, as helpless as Canute, in the seats of authority while tidal waves of depression swept over these islands. One Leader and one Party had a. plan. It was the Liberal Party, and its leader, Mr. Lloyd George, cried­ \u2018We can conquer unemployment.\u2019 We were derided by the Tory and Socialist Parties, by the Treasury pundits and by the City penguins, but I am glad that Mr. Lloyd George has lived to see the day when his ideas that unemployment was a terrible social disease which menaced the very life of our civili­sation and that it was possible for, and incumbent upon, governments to cure it - ideas which were twice rejected and denounced as dis­honest electioneering - are now ac­cepted as the inspiration of the Government\u2019s policy. Lloyd GeorgeWe all rejoice that the King has delighted to honour that great Welshman and Liberal prophet and leader, Mr. Lloyd George, and that, without the strain upon his health and strength which an election must have imposed, he will have a place in Parliament from which to speak his mind. When Chatham was living in retirement, Burke ap­plied to him some words of Lucan which fitly express our own feel­ings for Mr. Lloyd George:Clarum et venerabile nomen,Gentibus, et multum nostraequod proderat urbi.(An illustrious name, venerated of the people, and one which has much helped our country.)For four and a half years, in fair weather and in foul, the Liberal Party has remained staunch and steadfast in its support of Mr. Churchill\u2019s great Administration. It may be, said - indeed, it is being said \u2013 \u2018This is a good Government. Why break it up? Why not go to the country as a Government and seek another lease of power?\u2019 If we were a Government of office-seekers that is exactly what we should do, and there could be no doubt of the result.Democracy Needs ExerciseNevertheless, I am sure that the decision which the Prime Minister announced in the House of Com­mons on the 31st October to fight the next General Election on Party lines was wise and right. For a democracy in which the people were never consulted on concrete and specific issues of policy would be a sham. Already nearly ten years have passed since the people were last consulted at a General Election. When the German war is over, it will be healthy for our democracy to get some exercise.What does consultation mean? It must mean something better than offering the electors in each con­stituency a choice between a Gov­ernment supporter and a freak candidate. It must mean some­thing better than asking Liberals in one constituency to vote for a Socialist, and Socialists in another constituency to vote for a Tory, merely because those candidates happen to be Government sup­porters. I will tell you what I think consultation means I think it means, first, the presentation to the electors of alternative pro­grammes by the organised political Parties, and then - the supreme act of sovereignty in a democracy - the elector\u2019s vote.Then we shall have a fresh House of Commons - not so repre­sentative of the opinion of the people as it would be if we had a fairer system of election - but de­riving its authority not from the Whips\u2019 offices, as under a coupon arrangement, but direct from the electors in each constituency.In passing, I may say that it was precisely on that issue that we failed to reach agreement with Mr. Ernest Brown and his followers. We met, we talked, and we parted because we found that they con­templated a standstill order in the constituencies under which no single one of the 351 seats now held by the Tories would have been con­tested by a Liberal candidate.To that we said \u2018No.\u2019We have made it quite clear that we shall fight the General Election as an independent Party, with a clear and distinctive policy.BeveridgeLet me here and now - on your behalf as well as my own - thank Sir Percy Harris and those who, during the past year, have given so much time and labour to studying our urgent post-war problems and applying to them the Liberal solu­tions. In particular, I should like to acknowledge the tremendous contribution made by our latest re­cruit to the Liberal Parliamentary Party, Sir William Beveridge. No doubt we should have been willing in kill a fatted calf for him, but he brought with him two beautiful little beasts of his own. The first was called Social Security. This is very much more than a mere ex­tension of our existing Social Ser­vices. It is, in effect, a practical plan for the abolition of poverty, and that was why I welcomed it as an admirable Liberal document. The second is called Full Employ­ment in a Free Society - a plan for cutting the cancer of unemploy­ment out of the body politic with­out extinguishing the vital spark of personal liberty, initiative, enter­prise and responsibility.We Believe in FreedomUnder a despotic or bureaucratic system the resources and man­power of a country can be swiftly, efficiently - and ruthlessly - organ­ised for a specific purpose such as war. Such systems cannot endure. Repression provokes revolt. It is only in the atmosphere of freedom that the human mind can produce its finest fruits of spiritual and in­tellectual achievement. Least of all people in the world will the British people tamely submit to bureaucratic encroachment on their liberty - or on their family life, which to them is precious, and to their country is its greatest source of strength.So before the war, in the days of Mr. Baldwin and Mr. Chamberlain, we in the Liberal Opposition chal­lenged every provision in every Bill which threatened the liberty of the subject or infringed the Rule of Law. If ever we nodded, there was Mr. Dingle Foot at hand to rouse us. One of our first actions when the war came was to secure the withdrawal and amendment of the Defence Regulations. After we joined the Government, we obtained the pledge from Mr. Churchill that it was the Govern­ment\u2019s intention to preserve in all essentials a free Parliament and a free Press, and that the extra­ordinary powers affecting the free­dom of the Press and the personal liberty of the private citizen which were entrusted to the Executive for the effective conduct of the war would vanish with the advent of victory and peace.Defining FreedomNo honest controversialist can suggest that the Liberal Party\u2019s faith in freedom is growing cold. The Liberal Party believes in free­dom much as a man might believe in blood or nerves or sinews Love of freedom is a principle of its be­ing. But it is nonsense to suggest that because we wish to maintain the level of public and private out­lay, because we wish to direct the location of industry, or because we intend to control the activities of great combines and monopolies, that we are depriving the British people of their freedom. It was Mr. Walter Lippmann who pointed out, some years ago, that there is no essential similarity between the rights of the individual and the rights of the Joint Stock Company. When the Barons met King John at Runnymede, or when the House of Commons compelled Charles to accept the Petition of Right, or when the citizens of Paris stormed the Bastille, they were upholding the rights of individual men and women against arbitrary power. They would have been surprised if anyone had told them that they were establishing the divine right of a tinplate manufacturer in the 20th century to freeze out his competitors, or of a film magnate to decide what films we should or should not be allowed to see.Freedom From FearWhy, when we seek to make political rights effective over econo­mic power, is it always suggested that we are striking at personal freedom? You will all remember what happened when St. Paul arrived at Ephesus, with disastrous effects upon the trade of the silver­smiths. Demetrius and his col­leagues drew no attention to their shrinking turnover. Instead they cried, \u2018Great is Diana of the Ephesians.\u2019 So now those who propose any collective action to abolish the evils of mass poverty and unemployment are met with the cry, \u2018Great is the liberty of the subject.\u2019The distinction which we must keep clear in our minds is that be­tween power and arbitrary power. The former must exist in any modern community. The latter need exist only under a dictatorship. We ought never to hand over authority to regulate other people\u2019s lives to boards or officials or departments which are them­selves, either in theory or in prac­tice, irresponsible. In other words, we must make democratic control a far greater reality than it has ever been before.We must also preserve and strengthen all those safeguards which protect the ordinary citizen against any misuse of authority. We have all heard of the four free­doms - freedom from want, free­dom from fear, freedom of speech and freedom of worship. Yes - freedom from fear; from fear of what? - Of war? No doubt - yes, but even more important, because it goes to the root of both inter­national and domestic peace and order, from fear of injustice. Those who give the orders should not themselves be above the law. There should always be a legiti­mate way of calling them to account for what they do.An Out-of-Date AntithesisThe idea of an antithesis between private enterprise and the State is unreal and out of date. There is plenty of room for both. The State need not be the enemy, but can be the ally, of private enter­prise. We Liberals wish to see the hoary and unreal squabbles about nationalisation settled calmly and objectively on the merits of each individual case. If nationalisation or some form of public control is shown to be the best solution for the problems of any industry or service, then let it be our policy. We are slaves to no doctrine, we seek to apply no hard and fast abracadabra to these diverse prob­lems of industrial organisation.Individual enterprise in a modern society might be likened to a great river. We allow it to flow in its natural channel and we use it for power and transport and irrigation. But we do not, if we can avoid it, allow the river to flood its banks and destroy the dwellings of those who live nearby, and if it seems in danger of being silted up, we send out dredgers to remove the obstruc­tions. We say, \u2018Strengthen the banks and deepen the channels,\u2019 and thus abolish mass unemployment, while leaving ample scope to the free and fruitful currents of personal initiative and enterprise - in short, full employment in a free society.In the last few years your studies have left few corners of the politi­cal, economic and social fields un­explored. You have planned boldly, undeterred - and rightly undeterred - by the reflection that the best laid schemes of mice and men gang aft .agley. Yet we know well that the Tory notion that our national economy can be insulated from the outside world is a dan­gerous chimera, and that the suc­cess of our plans must depend upon world security and upon the revival and abundance of world trade.Economic Problems AheadWe shall be up against some hard facts before we frame our pro­gramme as a responsible Party for submission to the electors. We shall be in some ways in a position like that of Russia since the Soviet Revolution. As in Russia, we shall have to build up the strength of our heavy industries, and especi­ally our export industries, at the expense of many amenities and nearly all luxuries. Materials will be in short supply, and labour will be scarce - for the war against Japan will be the first charge on all our resources. To divert any labour or man-power from the requirements of that war and so to prolong it for as much as a month or a week, would imperil precious lives and would cost us dear in the long run. We cannot allow the war in the Far East to be a war of limited liability. \u2018Finish it off\u2019 must be our slogan.Foreign exchange will be scarce. Almost every country in the world will be a sterling creditor. Lend-Lease will be coming to an end, and nearly all our foreign invest­ments will have vanished, and with them vast supplies of food and raw materials which used to reach us before the war. Production from our own farms will have to be maintained at the highest possible level, exports will have to be in­creased by half, and controls will have to be kept on to ensure that our all too meagre supplies of foreign exchange are not squan­dered on the purchase of all the little luxuries and amenities which we have done without during the war, and which we would like to enjoy again, but that it is concen­trated on the purchase of essential foodstuffs for our people and plant and raw materials for our in­dustries.The industrial and transport sys­tems of Europe will have been shattered by the war, but it is not impossible that order may be re­stored swiftly out of post-war chaos, given one condition - and that is close understanding and co­operation between all the Govern­ments of the United Nations, and especially between those of Britain, France, Russia and America.Bretton WoodsHence the importance of those great international conferences at Hot Springs and Bretton Woods. I think it is not too much to hope that the achievement at Bretton Woods may prove to be a turning-point in human history. The re­port of the Conference offers - in substitution for the old gold stan­dard, now dead and buried - an orderly but flexible currency sys­tem. It also offers a plan for an International Investment Bank, with the aid of which the capital of nations with capital to spare would be made available for developing the productive resources of nations which are short of capital. The re­port has not yet been officially approved either by the British or by the American Governments, but it is certainly calculated to appeal to thoughtful and progressive minds on both sides of the Atlantic.You do not need me to remind you of the close association be­tween these questions of international trade and foreign policy.Victory will give us our chance to build up a world order which should safeguard future generations against the catastrophe of war. Unless we can achieve this, there will be no security, no prosperity, no Beveridge Plan, but only the lowering, hideous shadow of pre­paration for the next onslaught.Principles Backed By ForceOur Foreign Policy must be founded upon moral principles, buttressed by force. Force not directed by moral principle is no remedy for evil. Moral principle not buttressed by force is impotent, as the fate of Abyssinia, of Spanish democracy, of Czechoslovakia, Poland, Norway, Denmark, Hol­land and Belgium clearly show. Nor will foreign countries after this war be disposed to listen to moral lectures from our representatives in international conferences unless our strength commands respect. Britain, therefore, and the British Commonwealth and Empire, must remain strong - strong in military power and strong in faith and pur­pose to uphold the cause of justice and the rights of nations, great and small, in the Councils of the World.The Three Great PowersThe main burden of responsi­bility for laying the foundations of peace and security after this war must rest on the three Great Powers - Britain, Russia and America. They must undertake this imposing task as the trustees of mankind. Others will play important parts. All must be brought in. The cen­tral fact remains that if Britain, Russia and America learn to under stand one another, to trust one an­other and to work together, no large scale war will be possible. If they fall apart, another war is cer­tain. We must not allow emo­tional sympathy for ideal solutions of particular problems to blind us to this dominant fact. This is no imperialist alliance, for I pray and believe that these three Powers, much as they differ in their charac­teristics, their history and their constitution, are at one in desiring peace and the upward progress of mankind.Their first tasks will be to apply the principles of the Atlantic Charter in the building of the new world order, and to foster the growth of a World Organisation on the lines discussed at Dumbarton Oaks.Dumbarton OaksIn the new International Organi­sation there would be, according to the Dumbarton Oaks proposals, an Assembly and a Security Council on which the Great Powers would have five seats out of eleven. I do not think that this would give them too much influence. In military matters it happens to be the case that the larger national units have a power that is more than in proportion to the number, wealth and high quality of their population. A large number of small nations, brave and efficient though these may be, do not in sum provide the same military strength as one big nation of equal numbers. We can­not, if we would, by a resolution of this Assembly, deprive it of its power. The evil against which we must use our influence is irresponsible power - so power must be brought to accept responsibility. If peace is to be maintained we have to utilise power where we find it and range it on the side of peace. If we are to use the power of the great nations we must give them proportionate responsibility, and this means seats upon the Council.On the General Assembly and on the Economic and Social Council, all of the United Nations, great and small, would be equal with one vote each. Nothing could be more democratic. It is being said that these are secondary matters, that this is merely the chicken-feed which you are doling out to ap­pease the friends of democracy; what will it profit the small Powers to labour on these works of good­will when the real power is in the hands of the great? Such reason­ing is myopic and retrograde. What are the great questions of the future? The economic expansion of the world, raising standards of living, the growth of commerce, the application of science to production, conservation of the soil, reclamation of deserts, maintaining the populations of areas in equi­librium, diffusing education, know­ledge, culture, civilised standards, sweetness and light through all por­tions of the globe. These are the great tasks that lie ahead, and in them, under these Proposals, all nations may co-operate on an equal footing. These are the interesting and absorbing questions; nor are they divorced from the question of power, for whoever partakes in the decisions regarding them is fixing the shape of things to come.Policing the PeaceIf you took an Englishman of a thousand years ago, when crime had to be kept in check by the clumsy method of the hue and cry, and showed him all the achieve­ments of modern administration, with its complex law, its social security, its public education, its scientific research, he might fail to be impressed by anything save one single item in it all - our police force. And that is now our primi­tive condition in international affairs. But if by means of the Security Council we can achieve something better than the hue and cry in the international order, then the scene will be set in which all the other works of international co­operation, the works of peace and progress, can grow and blossom. And in the due passage of time, when international war is as obso­lete and as little to be feared as private wars between the great earls and barons of England are today, then, indeed, it will be safe and possible to bring the constitution of the Security Council into line with those of the other organs of the United Nations of the world.Based on experience, the new United Nations organisation (let us hope) will gradually develop into a permanent system which will be accepted throughout the world as being as natural and healthy as is the British Commonwealth of Nations. We must be patient and realistic. We cannot expect to reach the mountain tops of com­plete success at the first assault. but let us get our feet firmly planted on the right road.The Party\u2019s Task in 1945As we look to the prodigious rolling advances of the ever-glorious Red Army, as we watch the progressive enfeeblement of the German armed forces under the hammerstrokes of the British and American Bomber Commands, as we witness the sure and firm mastery of the sea routes of the world by the British and American navies and air forces, as we follow the British, French and American armies battling nearer to the Rhine and the Po, and as we applaud the American victories in the Philip­pines and the British advance towards Mandalay, we may reason­ably and thankfully exclaim, \u2018These are the portents of Vic­tory.\u2019 Certainly we should be right to claim that our share in the resounding defeats which the Allies are inflicting on the forces of dark­ness represents the greatest military achievement in our history.An Individual TaskBut to a Liberal, the mere fact that we have annihilated German and Japanese resistance will no mean that we have won the war. The military might of our foes has sprung from the poisonous doctrines which have stifled the promptings of humanity and generosity in their hearts. The final eradication of those wicked doctrines will depend less on what we do to the Germans and th­e Japanese than on what we are ourselves. This will be decided, not by the Big Three or the Big Four, but by our own individual exertions. The world has been torn asunder by doctrines of the Dark Ages imposed on it by men who would wish to see it switched back to the days of the barbarians. In, our own land war has led to a toughening of our race, but to a roughening of our minds. To restore the sundered friendship of nations, to break down the barriers between them, to alleviate the sorrows and sufferings of our own peoples, is the hard but stimulating task which confronts the Liberal Party in 1945.

aVThe tone of this assembly has been lively, taut, well-informed, and confident. And I believe that it will finally silence the parrot-cry that Liberals have no policy.We are now, indeed, accused of the opposite offence, of having too much policy (Laughter). Now nothing we do, I hope, is ever going to please the numerous hostile commentators that there are in this country. It is as foolish to think that they will suddenly be converted to Liberalism as it is to think that the Communists will suddenly take to the free way of life. We used to be told that the trouble with our assemblies was that they groan under the ruthless dictatorship of the executive (Laughter). Fellow delegates, we have made this party, you and I. It has not always been easy, but we have built it up and there are a lot of people in this hall who have come into the Liberal Party and have devoted their money, their energy, their wits to building up their party. And it is your party - my party - and all of our party. We stand for partnership and we mean to practise partnership in this party.It may be that we should run a different sort of party. Some people do (Laughter). But a Liberal Assembly comes together so that we may together fashion our policy, see each other, talk to each other as equals, take the pulse of the party, and feel the fist of the party when necessary.We like it like that, and it is our party, and we are going to have it like that.Now, we are also charged with the new and curious offence of looking critically at the aims and institutions of our country. We do this because we care about our country. We do this because we are deeply aware of the British contribution to the institutions of the civilised world and we do not want to see this contribution cease, and run into the sands of defeatism (Applause).A new radicalismIn all the great periods of our history, Britain has been not only unafraid of change, she has been in the forefront of change. In the Elizabethan age - and I remind you that there was an Elizabethan age, it was not something invented by the Tory Central Office, rapidly discarded when it did not fit the facts under the Tory Government - it was Spain which wrapped itself in the trappings of outworn prestige and grandeur. It was Spain which refused to change. It was Britain which reached out to the new 16th Century frontiers opened up by the birth of science.At this Assembly we have hammered out a workmanlike set of proposals for change in Britain. We have said again that people count. We believe in change. We cannot say it too often and we reiterate it at this assembly. It follows that these changes must be brought about by the common will of the nation. But we shall only generate that common will if we can generate some passion behind the projects of our policy. Mr Gladstone said that little is accomplished in politics without passion and it is true. The reforms we propose are not very complicated. They are widely agreed to be necessary, but this country is inert and will only be shaken by passion.It is typical that reforms that everyone knows to be necessary, and which many other countries have carried out, should in Britain be considered to be absolutely visionary (Laughter). How dare people think that when science is undergoing revolution after revolution, when the whole structure and obligations of government have changed, that it is impossible to change the political institutions by which we run our country? (Applause) How can you suggest, when in the arts and sciences there is this enormous ferment, that politics alone must go on being wrapped up in a polythene bag, being more remote from the ordinary people? (Applause)Breathing new life into democracyDictatorships do not primarily arise from the ambitions of wicked men. Lust for power is very often the symptom of a malaise in the body politic. Dictatorships arise when democracy ceases to serve the interests of the ordinary people. We are on the approaches to the general election. What is going to count for this party in the coming year is not only the clarity and cohesion of its policies. We have got to make those policies live for ordinary people so that they mean something to them. That is the prime task of this party next year.Can we imbue partnership with life and give it magnetism? Can we make structural reforms inspiring? Can we kindle again in this country the flame of political interest and catch the divine spark which has been so sadly lacking in our public life?Now partnership is a magnificent ideal, but do not let us delude ourselves. We shall never get everybody to take an active part in political partnership. What we have got to do is to give everyone the opportunity and the chance to take part. We have to create a free society in which even those people who do not feel that they have a place can take part - and can at least give their assent, feeling that they believe in it.I believe it is possible. I believe we can create a society which people can admire, and to which they can respond. In every great society the citizens have been proud of proclaiming their citizenship. Men would have died rather than deny that they were Athenians or, indeed, citizens of Elizabethan Britain. Banishment from their society was a punishment less dread only than death itself.When a man claimed to be a Roman citizen, he identified himself not solely with the victories of the Roman Armies or the material prosperity of the city itself. He identified himself with the public virtues of Rome, embodied in the structure of her Empire and in the systems of law and administration.A return to civic prideBut who could be proud of an association with the public life of Britain in the last few years? (Loud applause)Today too many people are backing away from Britain, backing away from their responsibilities to their country. They emigrate. They take pride, not in developing and moulding the civilisation which we have inherited, but in enjoying what is ludicrous and sordid in it, and disclaiming all responsibilities for its ethics or good management (Applause).Now I beg of you Liberals, identify yourselves with your country! Get closer to it. It is yours - and this backing away, this snide dissociation from the great past and from the beckoning future - it will be the death of this country if it continues (Applause).But today voluntary banishment from Britain is common. Who can wonder at this? There are things we have got to put right. The decline in our public life is not confined to the Profumo affair. Indeed that affair, though dramatic, is important only as a symptom. Never since Suez has this Government attempted to lead and instruct the people. It has misled and distracted them whenever it can. It is the shoddiness, the lick of the paint on the rotten boards, the lack of candour, the lack of quality in the actions of those who lead us, which makes people contract out of their responsibilities.If the Government will not face awkward decisions, why should the people? If the Government cling to office at all costs, how can we maintain any values or standards in the country at large?\u2018A twentieth century Ruritania\u2019­The ordinary boy or girl too often feels around him a 20th Century Ruritania. They soon learn that to have a title, to have the right background, to know the right people, is more important than to know your job. The British used to laugh at foreign bigwigs loaded with medals, posturing under meaningless titles, prating of prestige and all too often corrupt and decadent. Now no establishment in the world is so much concerned with titles and decorations as is official Britain. Nor is any governing class so concerned with its prestige and anxious about status rating. Underneath all this façade we now know what has been going on.Now wonder then that there is cynicism about the conduct of our public affairs. This cynicism has lead to a good deal of complacency and a great resistance to change. Suggest even that you change such an obviously unworkable system as the rating system and \u2018Oh\u2019­, you will have been told, \u2018that will be very difficult.\u2019 Yet however difficult it may be to change this system, it would be impossible to devise a tax system so unfair, so punitive to enterprise, so generally unworkable, as the rating system. But in spite of this it continues.For 100 years, we are told, banks have been sending old bank notes by the million uncancelled to the Bank of England. We know that, when suggestions that this practice was possibly a little dangerous were made, the good old answer came back, \u2018What was good enough for our forefathers is good enough for us.\u2019­ I dare say that this system will continue. After all, who shall be assured in those classic words \u2018it works.\u2019 So far we have only lost £2 million-worth of notes and have had the meagre police force of this country totally distracted from what, to me, are more important tasks. The primary duty of the police is not the protection of property - important though that may be - but the protection of the weaker and older members of the community, from fear and from assault.Standards in public lifeWe are now awaiting the report of Lord Denning on, among other things, the state of public life in this country. I ask you to consider this astonishing development. Since when have the people of this country had to call in a High Court judge, however eminent, to carry out a roving commission into the private lives of various individuals, so that we may be informed whether we are behaving ourselves or not?Ladies and gentlemen, can you contemplate Mr Gladstone requiring advice on this subject? (Laughter) Let us be fair, Mr Disraeli would have laughed himself silly at the idea. Mr Asquith would not have stomached it for a moment. And Mr Balfour would have cut it down with a phrase. As for Mr Churchill, I wonder what he is thinking now? This constant setting-up of inquiries by judges into wholly unjudicial matters is itself conclusive evidence of our failure to equip the Government with the proper machinery for carrying on its business. It is also a sign of a failure by the people of this country to shoulder their responsibilities. It is a failure of democracy to make up its mind about whether its affairs are being conducted to our satisfaction or not.What is to be the outcome of this report? It is surely unthinkable that evidence taken in private by a process which, as far as I know, is unknown to any judicial system in the world, should be made public. But under what system of law is a court or an individual entitled to pronounce on questions of public conduct without making this evidence public? That is the dilemma we are in.Now, we shall be told, these reforms may be necessary and perhaps we do need some changes in the way we conduct our affairs, but you must take them slowly; do not rush into things.\u2018The wind of change\u2019­If you have read your newspapers this morning, you will have seen the desperate price we are now being called to pay for not having looked ahead, for not having grasped the difficulties when they were manageable, for not having discharged our duty to countries under our control and, later, under our influence.Britain, which has a very proud record at the United Nations, has been forced for the third time to cast her veto, and for the third time this had been upon a matter which rightly or wrongly, will be interpreted throughout Asia and Africa as being a matter in which white supremacy is in conflict with the just aspirations of the coloured people.We are in this dilemma because, first of all, we failed to bring up Southern Rhodesia and other parts of Africa, to bring up the Africans, to be able to discharge their own affairs. We did not give them sufficient education. We did not begin early enough to lead them to self-government. We have failed further because, when Liberals again and again pointed out that the policy of trying to enforce a federation on Central Africa was bound to fail, unless it had the consent of the people concerned, we could get no Tory to listen to obvious sense or to look at the obvious dangers ahead (Applause).The Prime Minister talked about the wind of change. There was, after the war, a man - and not an ignoble man - called General Mikhailovitch. He disappeared. And as he went he spoke these immortal words: \u2018The gale of the world has blown me away.\u2019 This is not a wind of change. This is a gale. Now, Liberals have said that there is a clear obligation on this country, before we hand over authority to Southern Rhodesia, to use our utmost influence and ability to ensure that the franchise of that country is widened and to maintain the Armed Forces of the Crown in the hands of the Imperial Crown.I do not believe we can get out of this situation without difficulty now. But I do believe it is a tragedy, from which we must learn, that we should be casting our veto at the United Nations in the face of African aspirations for decency. It is a tragedy, as Mr Mark Bonham Carter has said, if the impression left on Sir Roy Welensky should be that he cannot trust the British Government. I believe it is a tragedy that at this moment, when our record is so good, we should be brought up against this sort of situation by failure to act in time.Now, unless we can get people to identify themselves with their institutions and their country, and unless we can get them to take notice in time, we can say Goodbye to the chances for the ordered reforms for which Liberals stand.What should citizenship of Britain mean today? What should we create here to which people would assent, so that people will be able to say, \u2018I lived in the Sixties and Seventies and, for all my life, I shall be proud of the public life of my country\u2019­? What can we do to restore that confidence, that optimism, to draw people once again into their country\u2019­s affairs and give back power to the decent, hard-working, general British citizen? I will tell you what I think British citizenship should mean.Reviving BritainFirst, that this country gets its role in the world right. To begin with, it should be the proud boast of everyone who is entitled to claim citizenship of our Commonwealth, that they can come to this country freely, and walk its streets, as Britons (Loud applause). Secondly, few things have been more inimical to the true development of Britain than the attempt to keep up as a nuclear power with the U.S.A. and Russia, while neglecting the opportunity to play a constructive part in Europe. We lost Europe through delay. We lost Europe through failure to look into the future. Europe still needs Britain, and Britain, Europe. We must be prepared to take a political initiative. We must allay the justifiable European suspicions that we still do not yet realise that the Channel tunnel will soon be a reality.Secondly, it should mean that a citizen should have a clear political choice put before him. I have never denied that there is a place in any democratic system for Conservatism. But equally any healthy country must - and especially is this true today - have placed before it clear leadership on the progressive side of politics.It is monstrous that so little information should be supplied to the public about politics. The simplest and most obvious thing is for a television edition of Parliament daily. The next thing which is needed is that Parliament and the press, acting on behalf of the public, should be allowed to probe into the recesses of where decisions are taken, and to be informed how our civil service works and where it needs improvement.There is considerable friction between Press and politicians and that is right - that is right. And, if you doubt it for one moment, look at the fate of the Daily Herald. The House of Commons and the Press have a great interest in common. They stand, if you like, for the non-Establishment against the Establishment. They have a common interest in finding out how things are done. And whatever criticism you may make of the Press of this country, it discharges that obligation. As a politician I have said again and again that, however critical or indeed beastly it may be to politicians, it gives publicity to politics and without that publicity the House of Commons would die (Applause).At this Conference we have put forward radical proposals for the reform of Parliament, the executive and the civil service. I wonder if, indeed, Liberals appreciate just how radical those proposals would be, and how vital they are to the creation of a more satisfactory Britain.If, for instance, you set up specialist committees in Parliament to take part in the decision-making process of government, you will fundamentally change the nature of Members of Parliament. I am quite sure that neither the Labour Party, nor the Tory reformers, understand or welcome this. It is not a question of providing some more desks and pay for members, but it is a question of expecting them to do a new job to participate in the managerial side of government, and to supervise the direction of such things as the nationalised industries.I want that because I believe the functions of government have changed enormously in the last fifty years, that it is now doing all sorts of positive jobs, and has extended its range immensely. And if democracy is to answer the purposes of the people - and I know of no other role for it - it has got to bring democracy into the discharge of these new roles of government which have grown up in the last twenty years.Pursuing the general goodEqually, when this party calls for change it does not simply mean change in general, and the maintenance of the status quo in particular. That is what has so bedevilled the effort to stop inflation in this country. Everyone is against rising prices in general, but all in favour of bigger wages and higher prices for their own goods in particular (Laughter). We do not mean, when we demand a new transport system, that every branch line is going to be kept open. Our reforms are based on the need for greater participation, the association of people and their representatives in a system of government which will answer the problems of today.But, once again, let me give you a warning. If this is to be effective, a clear distinction must be drawn between those questions in which dissent is inevitable and proper, and those in which agreement should be inevitable. There are issues which must be brought to a conclusion before participation can take place.The world around us is a difficult and, in many ways, a savage place. The people of East and West Berlin are divided by a wall - one of the harshest divisions in history. They are more conscious of loathing, than of any participation with, the Communist oppressors of Eastern Germany. Negro children taken under escort to the schools in Alabama cannot be very conscious of any participation with the white society in which they live. Surely there is no greater tragedy of our times than that children who feel no scintilla of colour should be drawn in to bear the burden of their fathers\u2019­ and their mothers\u2019­ failures. They reflect, however, this basic division in the human race. In South Africa and all through the world there are many questions which have to be solved before you can have participation.In this country, there are still groups of lower-paid workers left behind in the general surge forward who have the right to dissent from the easy platitudes of the affluent society. And above all in human affairs there is a natural friction between the governors and the governed. We felt the beginning of it in this hall yesterday (Laughter and applause)This friction is very often essential to freedom and, in their justifiable emphasis on participation, Liberals must not forget that freedom lies at the root of Liberalism and freedom often entails dissent and opposition. You must not be afraid to dissent from what is evil, and it often entails opposition as well.Redistributing wealthThirdly, to be satisfactory, a society must feel some confidence in the distribution of its wealth. In this town ten days ago, the Trades Union Congress were wrapped in a serious debate about an incomes policy. Two years in Edinburgh I said that an incomes policy was inevitable in this country. We have made known our proposals for this in our pamphlet \u2018Opportunity Knocks.\u2019 We believe both that capital wealth should be more widely shared, and that the salaried workers and those in the public services should be more adequately rewarded. As for industry, apart from giving the worker a share of the profits, we believe that the state should give a lead to industry by fixing minimum wages and indicating a maximum for wages, salaries and profits, leaving room within these limits for bargaining over exact wage rates. As far as profits are concerned, our proposals for free competition and consumers\u2019­ protection, and the steps to curb speculation in land, should keep them in check. But of course profits must be brought into the general purview. If the public welfare is ignored by firms, then sanctions in the form of extra taxation should be applied. These proposals are related to a detailed programme for job-training, consultation and the more skilful use of manpower in industry. We stretch out our hands to the unions who are going our way. The forces of progress in the movement must feel the support of all progressive opinion. But an incomes policy will only be accepted in conditions of economic expansion.Fourthly, we have made our proposals for the reform of parliament, the executive and the civil service. But these proposals must be completed by reforms of the legal system.But first a word about the police. I hear people at this assembly criticising the police. Now there may be things wrong with the police. They, too, may need their organisation overhauled. But do not, I beg of you, let it go out from this Assembly that we are critical of policemen and policewomen (Applause). I have, over the experiences of the last twenty years, formed a high regard for decency, and there is no more decent body than the police of this country. If any of you get into trouble you may pray that you fall into the hands of the British police and not some of other police forces in the world.They are not very well paid. There are not too many of them. They are loaded with a multitude of jobs and they are put into some pretty exasperating circumstances.Equally, when we say we require the reform of the Civil Service, let me pay my tribute to the people who run the Post Offices, National Assistance and the Labour Exchanges of this country. They all do a decent job. They do it with humanity and with devotion; and, while we want to change the Civil Service, we are deeply conscious of the inheritance of a dedicated, incorrupt, hardworking Civil Service which we have from our forefathers.Reforming the legal systemNow a word about the reform of the legal system. Here I speak with some affection for the system, because I was trained as a barrister. It needs reform, under three heads. First, the reform of the penal system, about which we have been talking this morning. When I compare some of the sentences awarded for offences against property, and sometimes on demonstrators, with the sentences which are often given to people who beat their children half dead, I wonder just whether we have our priorities in punishment quite right.Then I draw your attention to the recruitment to the legal profession. The trades unions in this country are constantly under attack for restrictive practices. This speech now requires some courage as I look around on the platform. But the restrictive practices of the most reactionary union fade into oblivion compared with the restrictive practices of the Bar (Applause).Not only is the profession of Barrister and Advocate in this country, through the operation of our schools and educational system, largely confined to the upper-income groups, but it insists upon maintaining a closed shop which would be the envy of the most black-hearted tycoon or the most reactionary Trades Unionist. If anyone wants to take a Barrister off his circuit he has to pay an extra fee and engage in a supernumerary junior. Talk about the plumber\u2019­s mate! (Laughter) Nor have most legal offices and chambers begun to modernise themselves, or sought to make access to the law cheaper.Most important, there is a growing divorce between the people and the law in this country. Nobody gets involved in civil action if they can avoid it. If they do, they may find themselves engaged in litigation of unknown cost, conducted in archaic and unintelligible language so that you cannot find out what is going on. And at the end of it all they may have more judges on their side than against them, and lose the case.It is an axiom of British law that not only should justice be done, but should be seen to be done. It is also a justifiable boast of the British that the judiciary are independent of the executive. But the office of the Lord Chancellor is a standing negation of this. He is both a leading politician and head of the judicial system. The Attorney is put into a most difficult position when he has to appear before tribunals which may affect the reputation of the Cabinet. And further, the use of High Court judges in political matters under no satisfactorily established procedures is liable to be damaging to the whole standing of the judiciary. Liberals have pressed that at least the procedure of tribunals ought to be altered and brought up-to-date. In its present form it is not only inefficient as an enquiry, but it often does great damage to innocent individuals. We also say that the Judiciary and the legal profession must be drawn from all the nation, it must be equipped to deal with cases where the individual is in conflict with the executive, and must be seen to be absolutely free from any contact with, let alone subservience to, the Executive.I do not want to put too much stress upon a single remark or take it out of its context, but there was a judge in one case who suggested that duty to the State over-rode every other duty (Cries of \u2018Shame\u2019­). I am bound, as a citizen of this country, to dissent from that remark (Applause).The Conservatives will not set about the reforms necessary to give us a Britain of which we can be proud - this is abundantly clear from the record of the last 13 years. They have had their chance. They have failed to take it.The failure of LabourBut what of Labour as the alternative? It is true that Labour are still primarily representative of one section of the people only. It is true that they have tied round their necks a shopping list for the nationalisation of further industries. But what to my mind are more damaging to the credibility of the Labour Party as a progressive alternative in this country are two other criticisms.First, their failure to grasp the importance of just this structural reform which Liberals have stressed, and without which we shall never get the right decisions carried into effect. You have only to read the recent debate on the reform of Parliament to see that those most complacent about our Parliamentary system are to be found in the Labour Party. How are you to get the reform of industry from a party so intimately concerned with industrial vested interests? We know, from the experience of those who have lived for long under Labour local authorities, that progress in the Liberal sense is not by any means always to be found under Labour local government.Secondly, the country has a right to know where Labour stands on many wider issues than nationalisation. It was made quite clear a year ago, in this town, by Mr Gaitskell that they were opposed to this country joining Europe. Since then the Labour Party have shown no appreciation of the need for a British initiative in Europe. And, in home policy, what is their attitude towards the private enterprise system? They have lost all moral belief in Socialism. You will search in vain for any mention of nationalisation or socialism in the by-election addresses of Socialist candidates. Yet they do not seem eager to improve the competitive system. This country cannot afford a government which is evasive on this issue.To my mind we have got to make up our mind how we are going to run the economy in this country and, as far as I am concerned, the largest sector of it will be run by private enterprise. We have got to help and foster that sector, to make it efficient, assist it, and do so in the name of the people as a whole. But the Labour Party personify that most disastrous attitude. They do not want to abolish the private enterprise sector, but at the same time they will not associate themselves with it.Punching above our weightAs I regard this Conference as focused on the future, I will finish by giving you your marching orders for the campaign which will not open when Parliament is dissolved, but which is opening now, this autumn, and will not end until polling day at the General Election. We have in recent by-elections polled more votes than the Tories. We have produced before you at this Conference men of higher calibre than many Tory Ministers.Now I do not mean to indulge in any personal criticism, but in all seriousness - if you look around, you have before you Lord Ogmore, who has already discharged in the most difficult circumstances some of the highest tasks which the body politic can place upon any man. There is at this moment a contest going on for the succession to the leadership of the Tory Party. Does anyone doubt that had, by some impossible chance, Mr Frank Byers been a member of the Tory Party, that his name would have been canvassed alongside Mr Maudling, Mr Macleod, Mr Heath and anyone else you like to name in that party? (Loud applause) And if the Prime Minister is going to lay his relations on the line - well, I back mine against his! (Laughter and applause)We have lately had two Ministers of Education, Sir David Eccles and Sir Edward Boyle. Now Sir Edward in my view is a brave and able man, and I see nothing wrong in saying that about him, when he has come under public criticism for a courageous act, whether you agree with it or not. But Sir Edward, I feel sure, would not claim to be better informed about education, or to be a better presenter of the educational case, than Mr A.D.C. Peterson whom we have here at this Assembly (Applause).I could go on to mention Professor Fogarty, Professor Wheatcroft and others who have come to this rostrum. I make no wild or extravagant claim when I say they are men of equal ability, character, dedication and force to any you will find in public life today. To my mind, it is foolish to indulge too much in personalities in politics, and in particular to say that people are not fit for office. The one thing you could be certain there would be agreement about in any Tory gathering before the war, was that Mr Winston Churchill was totally unfit for office. It had nothing to do with his opinions. It was considered by the Tories that his judgement and his personal qualities made him unfit to serve this country, and efforts were even made to put up a National Liberal to get him turned out of his constituency. Let that be a lesson to us, and to those who learn from history.We shall have over 400 candidates in the field at the election. Our hat, as Lord Ogmore said, is in the ring, but there are many people who are genuinely puzzled by the effect of the Liberal campaign. Some of them may still be tempted to vote Tory or even to join the Tory Party for the sake of keeping Labour out. I ask them to reflect on the fate of those who have done this over the last 40 years. There have been plenty of rats to leave the sinking ship, but the ship has gone on and the rats have sunk (Applause).\u2018Towards the sound of gunfire\u2019­There are no more miserable spectres in our political life than the numerous varieties of National Liberals absorbed in the Tory Party. They have done that party no good. They have done politics in this country little good, and advanced the cause of Liberalism not one title. That makes us all the more welcoming to the converts who are coming back. I welcome old members like Sir Frank Medlicott, the former M.P. for Brighton, Kemptown - I say, come and join us, come and join the march forward.It may be that the brothers of the prodigal son were a little harshly treated but there is respectable authority for welcoming back the prodigal sons.The people of this country, as I have said, are entitled to have politicians who stand up and tell the people what they mean. They are entitled to have politics in which the parties stand for some principle and, without that, you will never have healthy politics in this country.One thing is certain about this election. Great interest is going to be fixed on the number of votes cast for Liberal candidates and the number of candidates returned. Even if there is not a Liberal Government, the temper of whatever government there is going to be will be validly affected by the public support given to the Liberal Party. If you want an example of how effective a Liberal vote can be, only consider the result at Orpington. Not even the crackest shot in the Tory Party has ever bagged six Cabinet Ministers with one barrel! (Loud applause)If we return after the election with a solid block of Liberals in the House of Commons, even if we do not hold a majority, we shall be able to influence the whole thinking of the country and attitude of whatever party may be in power. We have made it clear that we intend to use that influence. As the election approaches we shall not shirk the battle, nor shall we be diverted by the great volume of criticism which we hope will pour down upon us (Applause).War, delegates - war has always been a confused affair. In bygone days, the commanders were taught that when in doubt they should march their troops towards the sound of gunfire. I intend to march my troops towards the sound of gunfire (Loud applause). Politics are a confused affair and the fog of political controversy can obscure many issues. But we will march towards the sound of the guns.Our Government, for too long, has pretended not to see what it does not like. It has put the telescope to its blind eye in a very un-Nelsonian mood, so it can say that there is no enemy in sight. But, delegates, there are enemies, there are difficulties to be faced. There are decisions to be made. There is passion to be generated. The enemy is complacency and wrong values and inertia in the face of incompetence and injustice. It is against this enemy that we march (Applause). We are not alone. The reforms which we advocate are inexorably written into the future. We move with the great trends of this century. Other nations have rebuilt their institutions under the hard discipline of war. It is for Liberals to show that Britain, proud Britain, can do this as a free people without passing through the furnace of defeat (Loud applause).

aVIt was I suppose inevitable that this Assembly should have been dominated by the running debate on the Lib/Lab agreement. You will be relieved to hear that I don\u2019t propose to add more than two brief thoughts to it this morning. First, I believe that the press are in general correct in their judgement that this debate has added new stature and credibility to the Liberal Party. I believe that in the public mind it is going to prove much more convincing at the next election to argue our case for electoral reform through an even stronger hold on the balance of power in the next Parliament than we have now; and that by the next election we shall have been able to demonstrate not just Liberal policies in theory, but a first taste of the effectiveness of Liberal policies in practice.Second, the argument between us as Liberals in the crucial debate this week has, as Cyril Smith rightly put it, been not about the ends which we all want but about the best way of reaching those ends. We\u2019ve had a perfectly clear difference of opinion on the means. The vast majority of this Assembly has supported my view, but the minority who opposed it remain loyally united with us in our common aim of securing the return of a Liberal government in Britain.I am delighted that the Assembly has backed the judgement of the Parliam­entary Party, and I want to assure you that we in turn take serious note of your demands for more effective public presentation of Liberal successes under the agreement.Thank you for your confidence in us. Now let\u2019s get out and tell the voters of Britain what this agreement really means. It is a step towards negotiated politics and away from confrontation. It is a way of saving Britain from polarised extremes of Right and Left. It sets the modern Liberal Party on the road towards the power and responsibility it has never known. We have nothing to be apolo­getic about and we have much to be proud of. We have helped to pull Britain back from the precipice of economic disaster. But I also recognise the limitations of the agreement. We Liberals have larger ambitions and hopes for our country than merely surviving the current economic crisis. We want to see fundamental changes in our society - and for those it is no use looking to the Labour or Conservative parties. We have to look instead to our own conviction and effect­iveness.If we really want a Liberal society in Britain based on the development of each person\u2019s full potential in a co-operative community, we won't get it from the Tory or Labour parties. You know that and I know that.It depends on whether we can mobilise public opinion behind our radical humane alternative, and whether we can inspire confidence in our fitness to govern. Make no mistake, although we can achieve individual policy advances as a junior partner, the Liberal society we are striving for will only be brought about by Liberal-led Governments.It should be clear to anyone who has followed our debates this week that the agreement is simply one between the Parliamentary Liberal Party and the Labour Government. There is no agreement, and there can be no identity of purpose, between the Liberal conference meeting in Brighton this week, and the Labour conference meeting here next week. In this town next week will be heard the clamorous voices of class antagonism and crude Marxism. The heavy squad masquerading as the once great party of liberty and brotherhood.We will watch weak-kneed capitulation to the more intolerant demands of Trade Unionism - imposed closed shops and the extension of trade disputes by mass picketing.The individual citizen is not respected in Britain today. Whether it be the way council housing is administered, or welfare regulations that confuse and restrict those they are supposed to assist or the determination to make life difficult for the self-employed, we see more evidence daily that the humble citizen is required to bow the knee for the benefit of over-mighty officialdom. It should be the other way around.We believe in self-management and public participation. They, the State Socialists, believe in more bureaucracy. Their appetite is inexhaustible. If the proposals set out in the Labour National Executive\u2019s recent Programme for Action were to be carried out by the next Labour Government, we would be carried clearly over the thin red line which separates social democracy from state socialism.And on libertarian issues too we are in a very different camp from the authoritarian left. We believe the Official Secrets Act should be reformed, and I understand that the White Paper the Government plans to publish shortly will reflect the wholesome influence of Emlyn Hooson and the Liberal Lawyers, who want to let the fresh air of knowledge and information circulate around the stuffy corridors of Whitehall.Or take the question of an NUJ post-entry closed shop through the proposed Charter. It would, as Basil Wigoder said in his speech, be totally unacceptable for one union in this country to secure control over who may write for a newspaper and whether they continue to do so. The imposition of a monopoly union power throughout newspapers would carry with it a fundamental and serious threat to one of our most precious liberties - that of free speech - and I am astonished that far from taking a critical look at the NUJ\u2019s attempts to secure this, the Labour Party actually highlights the very danger of which I speak by threatening a ban on journalists caught up in the Westminster Press dispute from reporting their own conference.But what else can you expect from an organisation whose creaking semi-derelict apparatus at grass-roots level has just this week sought to remove an MP from her constituency as a decision of only some forty persons? Compare that figure with the turnout of grass-roots Liberals last year at the leadership election when in the constituencies we hold, hundreds, and in some cases thousands, took part in each constituency in the decision making process.And finally on the dismal subject of the Labour left, let me say how deeply I deplore the so-called wage policies of the people who are most vocal for free collective bargaining.In a period of national sacrifice and falling living standards there will always be those ready to argue that \u2018our particular case is different\u2019 - I could move you to tears on the comparative financial plight of Members of Parliament - but those eager to foment industrial action in pursuit of hefty wage claims rarely stop to think of the potential damage to the fabric of the national economy or the inconvenience to the public.I find it difficult, when I see Clive Jenkins\u2019 snout jostling at the wage trough, to distinguish him from free-market Tories like Mrs Thatcher and Keith Joseph. They all share the same acquisitive values, the same greed, whether it is disguised as free-market ideology or socialism - the same lack of concern with the wider interest. The comrades call each other \u2018brother,\u2019 but there is precious little brotherhood in their idea of society as a whole. On the left of British politics there is no conscious attempt to reunite what should be the family of Britain.Some socialists are at least frank enough to recognise the validity of our constraints on the present Government even though they do not like it. One constituency Labour Party Chairman put a perfectly fair democratic argument to me in a letter: \u2018We clearly stand for certain things (such as nationalisation of banks, insurance and building societies) leaving it clear from the nature of the Lib/Lab arrangement that these will remain merely policy until we can persuade more voters that they want it.\u2019It is up to us to dissuade voters on the merits of the case from allowing the return of a Labour majority to Parliament which would naturally be free to pursue such a course.It is not the right wing of the Labour Party hawking their expensive con­sciences around, who have restrained the left. It is we Liberals. We have done more from outside in a few short months to reduce the influence of the left than the right wing of the Labour Party has done in a decade. Give us more seats and we can do even more.But I say to the voters of Britain: if you recoil from the threat of the total­itarianism of the left, don\u2019t leap from the frying pan into the fire.Freedom should be one of the great issues of the next election. British Governments, both Conservative and Labour, have been too little concerned with the implications for individual liberty of the continuing growth of Govern­ment control over more and more aspects of our lives; and of the undue weight carried by the great corporate interests of ownership and labour in determining the priorities of our society. Our commitment to a free society has always been the moving spirit of the Liberal Party: it is Clause One of our Party constitution.But our understanding of liberty differs sharply from that of the Tories. It is time for Liberals to expose the poverty of their vision of freedom.The new Conservatism deliberately rejects much of the mainstream Conser­vative tradition of the last thirty years. The central emphasis of this new Conser­vative ideology is not on freedom itself but on the free market. Individual freedom is defined primarily in economic terms - the freedom of the entre­preneur, unhampered by Government interference. Its patron philosopher is Adam Smith, who wrote of a society in which the selfish instincts of materialistic men amounted in total to the common good. It looks to the Victorian age for its image of capitalism, which it equates with freedom. It repudiates the legacy of Macmillan, Butler, McLeod and Heath, the modernising Conservatives who insisted that the Party must have a social conscience.In the strictest sense of the term, this ideology - Mrs Thatcher\u2019s recipe for Britain - is reactionary. Behind its intellectual posturing, it rests upon nostalgia for the simple values of an age which we have lost - and we cannot regain.Adam Smith\u2019s prescriptions and those of his twentieth century followers cannot fit the complexities of our highly industrialised, urban society, in which government is inescapably caught up with industry and the economy, and in which co-operation among Governments is an essential factor in international economic stability.I am not only concerned here with the illusions and contradictions of the New Right\u2019s approach to economics, but with the materialistic values which underpin them. Freedom does not begin and end with the free market. There is more to individual liberty than the freedom to pursue wealth without hindrance. The values of a civilised society - a Liberal society - must be based on justice, equality, community. I can find almost no reference to these values in the approach of such Conservative associated bodies as the Society for Individual Liberty and the National Association for Freedom. In their scheme of things, the good of the community, in so far as it is taken into account at all, is seen as somehow emerging out of the clash of private interests, without any positive effort on the Government\u2019s part.This eighteenth century image of society as a mechanism, its parts moving in a simple relationship with each other under the motion of the free market, may have seductive appeal to narrow logicians like Enoch Powell, or conservative economists like Milton Friedman. But it is entirely inappropriate to the problems we are facing in the last quarter of the twentieth century; and if under its new leadership the Conservative Party is so beguiled by it as to pursue their own rhetoric into a massive attack on those functions of government which operate to police the market, to protect the individual from the abuses of power, to create the conditions of liberty themselves for the vast majority of our popul­ation, they will re-open the wounds inflicted by the injustices of nineteenth century capitalism, and divide still further our already sadly divided society.Nor is it just within the United Kingdom that the blast of the new right\u2019s contempt for brotherhood and community will be felt. One of its most pern­icious and dangerous attributes is the indifference to the threat which the growth of racialism poses for us in a world which has drawn closer together in communication while drifting apart both in understanding and in wealth.What are we to make of a Party seeking to be the next Government which allows its candidate at a by-election so to misrepresent its own official policy that he adopts the very slogans of the National Front without a word of rebuke from the leadership. What are we to make of a Party which allows a couple of its MPs to wander round Rhodesia sabotaging the Anglo-American attempts to secure a peaceful transition to majority rule by suggesting to anyone who will listen that if Smithy \u2018hangs on till the Tories get in, we\u2019ll see him all right\u2019 - again without a word of repudiation.Indeed on her recent visit to Washington Mrs. Thatcher noticeably failed to endorse the Carter administration\u2019s objective of universal suffrage in Zimbabwe. I am reminded of the prayer:From the deliberate cruelty of evil menFrom the plausible evasions of ambitious menAnd from the silent apathy of good menGood Lord, deliver us,for all three in the context of events in Southern Africa today have precisely the same effect.Tyranny, wherever it is found, from the Soviet Union to Uganda, and whether it be of the left or of the right, is the first enemy of Liberalism. But tyranny which is based not on warped ideology or the crazed thirst for individual power, but on erecting an entire fabric of society to suppress the mass of the people purely on the grounds of the colour of their skin is especially odious and degrading, for it denies the most simple and fundamental equality of the rights and dignity of each man with his neighbour.I spoke on Tuesday of my visit to Sweden. One of the most impressive achievements of the Swedish Liberals in using their influence as a minority in the new coalition government was, at a time of inflation, rising unemployment and public expenditure cuts to increase their overseas aid budget to over 1% of the GNP. Compare that with our miserable 0.37% here in Britain. Theirs is liberalism in action. Yet here we are scratching around to save even what we contribute through the work of the British Council and the BBC overseas service to any sense of international brotherhood. We should be working positively with our partners in the common market to open wider the doors of trade with the third world and to stabilise commodity prices.Over these next few years Britain will have an unprecedented opportunity to take stock of its position in the world and re-order its own priorities. Thanks to the security and benefits of North Sea oil, we will have a chance to change direction for the better. We must use the oil revenue not only in the obvious directions of improving the standards of our health service, our education, the needs of the elderly and the public squalor of our inner cities, but to gear Britain for a post-imperial era not of grandeur but of civilisation, efficiency and harmony.It is becoming a set political cliché to say that oil brings us unprecedented opportunities. The Prime Minister has called for a national debate. I welcome the idea, because the all-too-real prospect is that the auction-room approach of adversary politics, with bidding-up, with exaggerated promises, will take over - and we shall be left in ten years time like a foolish pools winner, with nothing to show but a mass of debts and a hangover.In our view, Britain should devise a ten-year national strategy plan to make use of the opportunities.What should this strategy be? Apart from modernising the decaying fabric of our welfare society, as I have mentioned, there are three other potential components.First, it should provide us with an opportunity to end the ceaseless alter­ations to industrial investment incentives, and allocate substantial long-term resources to the updating of industry. We should not resist the replacement of men by machines in repetitive tasks in mass-production industry. These jobs have often been soulless in their requirements of the human beings who operate them, putting little premium on any skill other than patience and a simple dexterity. Their products often compete on world markets, which they should not have to do with unnecessary labour costs added to their unit price.But we should seize other opportunities to expand employment. We should look to build greater self-sufficiency through food production in Britain, with farming acreage jealously conserved and even expanded. We should recognise that the petroleum base of agriculture, whether through fuel for machines or as the base for chemical treatments, is an insecure one. Long-term, the countryside should be revitalised, with more people working in what has always been one of the most natural of human activities - growing food.We should look for an ambitious plan for youth employment. Instead of the present hotch-potch of emergency schemes, we should create a national volun­teer service scheme, concentrating young people\u2019s efforts on our physical and social environment, and a greatly stepped-up training programme.Second, against the background of new national income, the wholesale and radical reform of our tax structure as recommended by this Assembly can be realistically and speedily introduced. The Liberal Party has been in the fore on many policies in the past. We are first again with coherent proposals to lift the burden of tax on earnings.Third, we should be prepared to spend some of the benefits of oil on capital expenditure to reduce our dependence for our future energy requirements on the narrow choice between further exhaustion of limited stocks of oil, gas and coal on the one hand, and our over-dependence on nuclear resources on the other.Now is the moment to plan for the necessarily heavy outlay on such possible schemes as the barrages on the Severn and Solway, which would use the limitless resource of tidal power, as well as the development of solar and wind sources of energy. I very much hope that Mrs Thatcher and the Conservative Party might join with the Government and ourselves in the development of a national strategy for oil along these lines.For there is a major threat to all this vision of a new prosperity and national assurance. It is the alarming lurch into more and more extreme confrontation politics.A rational society depends upon civilised people arguing and reasoning together until they find a common way forward. The application of this idea to politics has been one of Britain\u2019s great gifts to the world.It is all the more tragic to see in our country the drift towards polarisation, the gradual triumph of sectarianism. It is such a short progression from denying any merit in your opponent\u2019s argument, to denying his right to voice it, to questioning his right to exist.It is hard self-righteousness and narrow intolerance that are the first enemies of civilisation. The bully-boys of the National Front and the fanatics of the Socialist Workers Party share this quality. So, regrettably, do far too many of the ideologues on the right of the Tory Party and on the left of the Labour Party. If politicians offer nothing but confrontation, how can we blame those outside the system for imitating their example? If children grow up seeing their leaders engaged in an endless Punch and Judy show, are they to be blamed for thinking that there are only two sides to every question, and that one has to win at the expense of the other? \u2018LAW OF THE JUNGLE RULES, OK\u2019 ought to be chalked on the walls of the Palace of Westminster.Great Liberals have always recognised that liberty does not exist in a vacuum. Each man's liberty depends on respect for every man\u2019s rights and obligations. People talk of \u2018rights\u2019 easily; they talk of \u2018freedom\u2019 almost glibly. Yet how often do you hear of \u2018responsibility\u2019? I fear for a liberal society when it is not also a responsible society.Responsibility is breaking down around us. How can it be responsible for some Conservatives to treat one and half million unemployed either as second-rate malingerers, or far-away people of whom the well-heeled know nothing? How can it be responsible for the unemployment rate among black school-leavers to be two or three times the average? Are the screaming savages of soccer matches or violent demonstrations the product of a mutually responsible society? A great fuss was made recently about school-leavers not knowing the names of politicians. What is infinitely more serious is the school-leaver going into the world with no concept of duties as well as of rights, obligations as well as freedoms.Free societies are based on mutual respect. Once that respect weakens, freedom is threatened.We have seen in the past few months a dangerous and dispiriting escalation of language in political debate in this country. Suggestions that Mr Callaghan as a socialist is indistinguishable from the so-called socialists of Eastern Europe, comparisons of those who would favour compromise between APEX and Grunwick with those who would appease Hitler, attest to an atmosphere of hysteria within certain sections of the Conservative Party and the press. Mrs. Thatcher has been fond of attacking \u2018the wreckers in society.\u2019 I ask her to reflect on whether those who seek always to polarise issues, who look for confrontation and reject conciliation, are not themselves undermining the fabric of our democ­racy by creating an atmosphere in which extremism thrives and moderation is considered weakness.I am particularly concerned at those who would use the law as a battering ram in pursuit of their own sectarian interpretations of freedom. Respect for the law, as well as respect for our institutions, rests fundamentally upon consent. If that consent is weakened, if divisions are exaggerated and conflicts pursued, then Britain will slide further towards becoming ungovernable.The rule of law is under threat directly from those on the left and right, who abandon reasoned argument and take to the streets in pursuit of their aims. This imposes an intolerable and unfair strain on our undermanned police force, who are expected to act as referees in the midst of chaos. Remember that 1977 has been a year when the unacceptable level of political violence of Northern Ireland has spilled over on to the mainland at Grunwick and Lewisham. Riot shields have been seen on our streets for the first time. But isn\u2019t it likely that those who resort to physical assault on the police derive encouragement from the verbal antagonisms of the more legitimate left and right within respectable politics.There are those in the Tory and Labour Parties who would rather be locked together in mortal combat, dust and dirt flying, until one falls to the ground and the other is declared victor, regardless of whether they drag the country down in the process. The politics of the warring extremes is deeply destructive. It fore­shadows the creation of the truly illiberal society.Many of the right and the left would agree with each other that there can be no reconciliation between liberty and equality. But as John Stuart Mill in his classic essay \u2018On Liberty\u2019 argued there is an unavoidable tension between indiv­idual liberty and social justice which only an active and educated democracy can resolve. Or as Schumacher (whose death earlier this month was such a loss to modern liberal thought) summed up our distinctive response in his book A Guide for the Perplexed, it takes fraternity to reconcile liberty and equality.May I for one moment be very personal? To be a Liberal in recent times can\u2019t have been easy. For each of you it has taken the sort of courage that can only be sustained by a great ideal. The struggle for that ideal involves many sacrifices, great commitment and a lot of patience.I want to tell you what sustains me on what Andrew Phillips called the long march of Liberal politics. It is our concern for fraternity, for the creation of a self-governing society in which active consent is more important than the en­forcement of law, in which participation is more widespread than bureaucratic control. It is a concern which runs through the whole range of Liberal policy. It underlies our commitment to devolution and the decentralisation of power. It is behind our attack on the obsessive secrecy of central government, and our demands for far-reaching reforms at Westminster. It motivates our enthusiasm for the co-operative principle in industry, and for the introduction of a genuine industrial partnership.Of course it is not easy to re-awaken the spirit of community in Britain. We have to build a Liberal society out of the embittered divisions on which the other two parties have thrived.But if we can harness the latent energy of the British people, if we can set free the imagination and determination of a people depressed and exhausted by governments which have offered them stone when they cried out for bread, then our achievements can match our hopes.Forgive me if for a moment I speak to those millions who have been follow­ing our conference on radio and television.This nation once set an example to the world. It can do so again. But it will not happen without new leadership and a new generation. We are that generation. We demand to be heard. From now on we will not be ignored.There is no power on earth that can resist an idea whose time has come. We are that idea.To you in this great Assembly I say that in the last six months of struggle together we may have sustained some losses but we have forced a bridgehead. Now I urge you to go back to your constituencies and intensify the campaign.This is not the battle of Britain. It is the battle for Britain; and it\u2019s the battle we\u2019re going to win.

aVIt has been a somewhat unusual and tumultuous year. As one Liberal wrote to me: \u2018We understood from your speech last year that you were keen on marriage but we didn\u2019t expect to find ourselves pushed to the altar quite so soon.\u2019 To be candid neither did I! But I take the point, and it is only right that at the outset of our annual assembly I explain what we have been doing and why. And so, reluctant though I have been to divide what I have to say into two parts I want to concentrate this afternoon on the current political situation and our role in it, and return on Saturday to the longer-term development of Liberalism.I freely admit that I did underestimate some of the problems in the agree­ment between ourselves and the Government. I underestimated the difficulty of putting over what we were trying to do; I underestimated the rage of the Tories and their allies in the Press, thwarted of what they still think of as their rightful inheritance. Incidentally let us note the double standards - the Conservative Government elected in 1959 went on to within weeks of its 5 year maximum term of office despite great mid-term unpopularity and loss of seats at by-elections. I underestimated how much the British people have been taught to think of politics as \u2018picking sides.\u2019 I underestimated how frightened we have become in this country of innovation, of trying to do things a better way.But I have never for one minute underestimated the significance of the step my colleagues and I decided to take last March. It was a decision of great con­stitutional importance and, however much it may be misrepresented by those who prefer the drama of confrontation politics, it marked the beginning of the return to sanity in this divided country. Negotiation, with patient bargaining and compromise, may not call for high adrenalin and screaming headlines but it does call for something more important: patience, persistence and judgement.Our critics are not sure whether we have gained too much or too little: I am alternatively portrayed as the youthful dupe of wily old men, or the Frankenstein monster which has risen to terrorise his erstwhile master. Mr Ian Mikardo declared that Mr Callaghan has handed over the choice of date of the next election to me. If that's so, I must confess to you, the Prime Minister forgot to tell me.Well history will have to judge where the balance of party advantage lies. I care much more for the long overdue emergence of the national interest as the proper standard of political decision.I was much impressed by my visit last month to the conference of our Swedish counterpart, the Folkparteit. The parallel between our position and that of the Swedish Liberals is most striking. They had been out of power and influence since their participation in the wartime coalition. So have we. Per Ahlmark was known to me through our work together in the Council of Europe when we found an identity of views, and in 1976 his party elected him a new leader at the age of 38. We did likewise. He was attending his conference enjoying the loyal support and presence of his two distinguished predecessors. So am I. Within a few months he found himself leading his party into association with others. So did I. Only in Sweden they are actually inside a coalition government led by the Centre Party along with the Conservative Party.I had a long talk with Ahlmark, who is now deputy Prime Minister of Sweden, and I asked him what was the greatest difficulty he had found. He replied that the biggest problem, which they were discussing at their conference, was how to preserve their identity as a party in the public mind when their work was submerged with others. That is precisely the difficulty of which we must inevitably be conscious throughout this week\u2019s assembly.The Swedish Liberal conference discussed soberly and amicably - as I hope we shall do not just in tomorrow\u2019s important debate but throughout the week - the new role in which they found themselves, and emerged at the end of the conference with a sharper programme and renewed confidence. Let us do the same here in Brighton.It has long been our view as Liberals that there should be fixed parliamen­tary terms subject only to the government retaining the confidence of parliament. We have opposed the uncertainty and unfairness which a Prime Minister\u2019s arbitrary right of dissolution inflicts on the country. We have also in recent years campaigned against too frequent changes of policy direction by govern­ment which have prevented coherent long-term economic planning.It was against the background of these two attitudes that we met as a parl­iamentary party in March to consider the motion of no confidence tabled by the leader of the opposition. We knew that our votes could be decisive in bringing about a third general election in three years, something which scarcely anybody outside the ranks of the Conservative Party, and only some inside, thought to be in the national interest.There was one preliminary matter we had to settle among ourselves. I knew how damaging in the history of the Liberal Party had been the splits when Liberal MPs regularly voted in opposite lobbies on major issues. These occurred in the pre-war parliament and indeed post-war as Frank Byers, who was chief whip after the war, will tell you. It took years - until after the 1964 election in fact - to get over that image in the public mind. I therefore told my colleagues that although following my talk with the Prime Minister I was going to argue in favour of supporting the government through a parliamentary agreement between us, if in the end of the day the party was going to divide part into one lobby and part into the other, I would rather call the whole idea off and lead a united party into a general election. We were all agreed therefore that whatever decision we took it should be a collective one.There was another matter on which we quickly reached agreement. None of us saw any point in registering a vote for the government for that day only, to stave off an election. That way we should attract all the blame for maintaining in office an unpopular and unsuccessful government without having any influence over its future course, and we should also be exposing ourselves possibly to weekly \u2018no confidence\u2019 decisions at the behest of the Conservative leader. We therefore agreed that our decision should depend on the terms the Prime Minister would publicly agree in order to ensure maintenance of the government and on the creation of machinery to assist Liberal influence over it for the remainder of the parliamentary session. The rest is now well known. We took our decision, and I want to record a word of thanks to you all - especially to those of my parliamentary colleagues who had genuine and substantial reser­vations about the course we were taking - and to you, Mr President, and Geoff Tordoff as Chairman of the party, and many others for the necessarily speedy but efficient way in which liaison throughout our party was conducted. However history may judge the rights and wrongs of that decision, the manner of taking it was of a mature, decisive and democratic party.Let me just say a word about the nature of the agreement itself. It is precise­ly the same as that we offered to the last Conservative Prime Minister in March 1974, namely support from the opposition benches for an agreed programme in the national interest. It is not a coalition. Coalition was not offered nor was it sought. In fact the Prime Minister and I have never even discussed the subject. Why? Because I have made it my guideline never to ask for things which I know it is not in his power to give. That seems plain common sense. But some people have quite fairly drawn attention to the dangers of a political arrangement which involves neither a coalition nor a subsequent electoral pact.First, we are not inside the government and therefore some disagreements do occur after a government policy decision has been taken. This happened in the case of the petrol tax increase. Had we been inside the government we could have said: \u2018Of course we agree with the need to conserve fuel. Let us therefore return to the system we used to have and which President Carter has just intro­duced of higher taxation on larger cars and less on smaller.\u2019 As it was we had to get reversed a decision taken by Labour alone, a party which has very little knowledge of the problems of areas where a car is a necessary part of the cost of living, but on which we have extensive first hand experience.Second, let\u2019s not exaggerate what can be achieved by the influence of 13 MPs on a party of over 300 MPs. Every day I receive letters - some hostile to the agreement, others friendly to it - which advise me to break it off if the govern­ment does (or fails to do) such and such. The list of potential breaking points becomes enormous. Let us face the fact squarely that \u2018we are in the position of a body of men whose sole sanction to enforce their behests is capital punishment. There are two objections to that. You cannot inflict capital punishment for minor offences; and you can only inflict it once for any offence.\u2019 These are not my words but those of David Lloyd George in 1931.Now, at this conference it is entirely right that we should assess the con­sequences of the agreement. First, there is no doubt that we have lost some public support. Part of this was foreseeable and in my view inevitable in the short-run. One of the Tory commentators wrote: \u2018The electors who built up the Liberal vote for years have been the electors who have used the Liberal Party as their outlet for protest when angry with the Conservatives.\u2019 He is possibly quite right. But frankly I have never thought that there could be a secure or expandable future for the Liberal Party as a kind of convenient temporary wastepaper basket for the ballot papers of discontented Tories.As to party activists, we have lost scarcely any parliamentary candidates or national or local officers. But we have lost some members, though gaining others. I said last year that the road I intended to travel would be a bumpy one and that we might therefore lose some of the passengers. Some of them must have had a pretty tenuous hold on the vehicle, for they fell off at the first pot-hole.Our influence through this limited agreement has so far been largely but not unimportantly negative. We can and have stopped nationalisation; we can and did stop certain tax proposals both reducing petrol tax and freeing thousands of small businesses from VAT; we can and will oppose those cuts in defence spend­ing which would take us below our obligations to collective security in NATO; we stemmed the flow of partisan legislation.But our influence has been positive as well. Foremost, we have made a major political contribution to national stability and recovery over the last six months. As the director-general of the CBI put it earlier this month: \u2018At least businessmen have returned to operating in a climate in which they can plan ahead - instead of reacting to circumstances on a week-by-week basis.\u2019If anyone had said to you a year ago that in 1977 a Labour government would introduce a bill for direct elections to the European Parliament recom­mending a proportional system, you would have been right to doubt his judge­ment. Yet under our influence that has indeed happened.Of course the actual system proposed is not Liberal policy and is something of a concoction, but it .will be used on only one occasion until the Community as a whole agrees a rational uniform system throughout Europe for future elections, and it does have three obvious advantages.First, the delegation we send to Strasbourg will become reasonably repre­sentative of political opinion in Britain.Second, the system allows voters, rather than the party machine, to choose which candidates within a party list they prefer.And third, because of the delays caused in the past by the uncertainty of the Labour Party's approach to the Common Market, it is the only way of securing elections in Britain in time to meet the Community target date of May/June 1978.Of course we still face the difficult task of getting this system adopted in both Houses of Parliament on a free vote. It\u2019s a free vote for everyone and we shall be watching the division lists most carefully. We have a right to expect the substantial majority of Labour Members - and especially ministers whose continuance in office depends on us - to support the government\u2019s recommen­dation. We hope also that a majority of Conservative MPs will remain true to the European ideal and support it as well, though there are alarming indications of a readiness in some Tory circles to allow Britain to delay the whole European election, so great is their hostility to any concept of electoral justice.We Liberals have often enough been the voice for European progress in Britain. Let us be so again. Our fellow-members of the Community are fed up with Britain always being last, always sullenly dragging its feet. That must not be the case on these elections. They must not be postponed as part of the British party game.In a not so publicised part of her television interview with Brian Walden, Mrs Thatcher twice complained that in the February 1974 election the Tories had polled more votes than Labour. Well the answer to that is not to dream up another referendum, but to ensure that our system of election provides us with a government which commands the support of a clear majority of our people. That is the right way to strengthen parliament against forces which might seek to undermine its supreme authority.Of course it may yet be a few months or years before we convince enough Labour and Tory MPs that this is so. Meantime the case for embarking on elections to new and non-government institutions such as the Assembly in Europe on the same proportional principle as every other member state is surely overwhelming.While on the subject of Europe may I say how much we as a party are look­ing forward to contesting these elections in concert with our allies in the feder­ation of European Liberal and Democratic Parties. This is potentially an organ­isation of great mutual strength for liberalism on our continent.We shall be debating this matter later, but I hope the Assembly will not adopt any rigid view of the internal political situation in France which could effect our membership of that organisation just at the very time when my friend Robert Fabre is finding his own position in French politics increasingly fluid.Turning from the constitutional future of Europe to our internal constit­utional future in these islands, it has always been the Liberal view that all-round decentralisation and reduction of government is desirable in itself, but we also agree with the reasoning behind the Labour Party\u2019s late conversion to the need for devolution to Scotland and Wales as a means of preventing the unneces­sary break-up of the United Kingdom, a view shared by a minority of the more rational Tories.The original devolution package was a mish-mash of two entirely different schemes for Scotland and Wales thrown together in one unhappy bill, with ex­cessive veto powers over the operation of the assemblies by Westminster. The new devolution package which we have helped to create, while still falling short of the federal solution a Liberal government would introduce (and which enjoys increasing support in non-Liberal quarters), represents a substantial improvement; and this time parliament will also be free to discuss and vote on the case for proportional representation in these assemblies without opposition from the government. The long awaited aims of the people of Scotland and Wales for their own elected internal government can be achieved this session, thanks to our political agreement.But the greatest gain for the country has not been progress on these impor­tant constitutional questions, absorbing alas only to a minority, but on the new confidence and the path to economic recovery which has been followed with our support over the last six months.Over this period the annual inflation rate has dropped. In the quarter before the agreement it was running at 18%. This last quarter it was down to 9.6%. The Financial Times share index has risen from 427 to 521 and earlier this month reached a record level. The pound has risen 22 points against the dollar after months of decline. The balance of payments has changed from a deficit of £76 million to a surplus of £316 million. The reserves have shot up from £5½ billion to £8½ billion and could be nearly £10 billion this month. Meantime bank interest rates are down from 10.5% to 6% and mortgage rates from 12¼% to 9½%. This means that the family with an average mortgage is now paying nearly £17 a month less for their house than they did in March.In short the economic outlook is now very much brighter than it appeared in the spring. It was right to give the battle against inflation our highest priority. Rising prices have ruined the expectations of the retired, discouraged savings, harassed the housewives struggling to operate a family budget and forced many people out of their jobs. The relentless rise in British prices was also threatening to do permanent damage to our economy by wrecking our international trade prospects. The volume of imports was becoming larger and relatively cheaper while our exports became more expensive and difficult to achieve.The stark truth is that from 1973 to 1976 we had successive governments, Tory and Labour, presiding over this growing threat of disaster and failing to rectify it. But in these last few months we have provided the political conditions in which it has been possible to start on the road to recovery. I don\u2019t believe it could have happened any other way.But, say some critics of the agreement, that\u2019s all very well. So what if the country does benefit, what\u2019s in it for the Liberal Party? Isn\u2019t the Labour Party going to get all the credit at the next election? Having avoided the return of a damaging Tory government are we not now risking the return of an even more damaging Labour government?Michael Foot is regularly quoted at me as saying: \u2018What we want to do is to prepare for the time when we can get a full Labour majority again in the House of Commons. There is nobody who wants that more than I do.\u2019Well he would, wouldn\u2019t he. Of course if a Labour government is returned at the next election with a majority of its own it will be a very different kind of government from the one we have now under Liberal influence. Read the reports from Labour\u2019s national executive, or watch their conference in this town next week. The onward march of bureaucratic state takeover and control remains their main aim.It is up to the electorate to decide whether they wish to give them that opportunity. Let us invite the voters to compare the period of Labour govern­ment 1977-1978 when the Liberal tail wagged the dog to the period 1974-76 when the Tribune group wielded more influence than us. I\u2019ve no doubt which will prove the more successful and the more popular with the electorate. It is up to us to argue forcibly and convincingly that a Liberal hold over government is both healthy and desirable, and that the electorate should seize the opportunity to increase our influence and representation in parliament. Our chances of arguing the case are stronger the greater the success we make of this agreement. We will enter the next election not just as a party equipped with splendid policy pamphlets and an excellent history in government in the distant past, but as a party which as I said last year has shown itself not afraid to roll up its sleeves and dirty its hands with some responsibility for the direction of national policy, and then made a good job of it. As Shakespeare\u2019s Henry V said on the eve of the battle of Agincourt \u2018He that hath no stomach for this fight, let him depart.\u2019The question is have we the self-confidence as a party to make such an appeal convincing? As I say, I understand many of the legitimate anxieties of those who questioned the agreement we made. But I am absolutely certain that the one course which would prove totally fatal in our standing in the public eye would be for us to be dithering and hesitant now that we have embarked on this course. If we stop now and say \u2018oh dear, we\u2019ve lost local elections and the polls don\u2019t look too good for us, let\u2019s pull out,\u2019 we should acquire and deserve a reputation as purposeless incompetents.What is the image of the Liberal Party to the onlooker? An ability to laugh at ourselves is not a bad political quality and I thought this description a few months ago by one political correspondent rather near the bone: \u2018There was a time when it welcomed all and sundry. All the pied beauty of British politics was found in the Liberals. They were there to amuse, to entertain, to divert. All over Llandudno their orange badges proclaimed things were going on - a commis­sion on microdevolution, a meeting of Gays against Fluoridation, An Esperantist coffee morning. There was street theatre, Morris dancing and a lecture entitled \u2018Radical Alternatives to Sex. Heaven forbid that we should ever lose the capacity to entertain and divert, and become a party of dull grey uniformity. But we do need a greater sense of professional determination. We can\u2019t go on lurching into by-elections with little money, no organisation and no candidate until after the writ is issued.At the Assembly in September 1972 we had fewer MPs and lower opinion poll figures than we have now. Yet within eighteen months we went on to score our biggest electoral turnout in the general election. We can do that again and more if we set about it the right way.The Labour Party in this country has been in steady decline for years. As a radical movement it is intellectually exhausted. The social democratic tradition has run into the sands and many of its ablest exponents have departed for more worthwhile or agreeable perches in Brussels, in universities or on television. The left has taken refuge in the reiteration of past doctrines and is making successful takeover bids in moribund constituency parties. The grassroots Labour member­ship in the constituencies has been shrinking steadily over the years to a point where a successful Liberal membership drive this autumn should for the first time give us more individual constituency members than the Labour Party.We must give special effort to expanding our resources and that is why the Executive and the parliamentary party have joined forces to launch a nationwide membership campaign today. The response to my appeal for members at the end of each recent party political broadcast has shown that there are large numbers of people in all corners of this country who want to help but have no present contact with the party and are never asked to join. We must go out and find them.I do not want to pretend, however, that the Lib-Lab agreement has provided the solution to all our national problems. There are two obvious ones staring us in the face.Unemployment is still growing. Under our agreement for next session we have put forward four proposals which will help to reverse this appalling trend, apart from the overall strengthening of the economy.The first has already been accepted in the announcement last week that Harold Lever is to co-ordinate plans to help small businesses. Successive govern­ments have - possibly unwittingly - discriminated against small businesses and the self-employed. The number of firms employing 200 people or less dropped in Britain from 136,000 in 1935 to 58,000 in 1968. Some drop is general in the western indust­rial world, but our competitors - Germany and America - have far more small firms than we have. If our governments instead of propping up decaying indust­ries or spending over £760 million on Concordes had encouraged new enter­prises to replace the 20,000 we\u2019ve lost since the war, even at only 25 employees each this would provide half a million jobs. This is one area of greatest potential in providing new employment.Another is in the construction industry, and we hope that any reflation this autumn will concentrate on providing more jobs in labour intensive building work.In the exchange of letters with the Prime Minister we called for a particular campaign on youth employment and I expect a government announcement on this very shortly.Fourth, we have put forward detailed proposals now being considered by the Treasury for a steady and major shift in the burden of taxation off incomes. This is absolutely essential to provide stimulus to production, and we shall expect at least a move in this direction in this session.We have also incidentally asked for the reintroduction of the lower rate tax band, which is vital to help overcome the problem of many families who at present can be better off on social security for part of the year.But the biggest single long-term ailment in Britain - of which both inflation and unemployment could be assessed as symptoms - is the lack of output. We are a manufacturing and trading nation which over the years has been becoming steadily less competitive. And it\u2019s no good for the Tories having correctly diagnosed what is wrong to prattle on about how all that\u2019s needed to put it right are the Conservative policies for incentives. This is no new problem. We had a long period of Conservative government from 1951 to 1964. According to OECD figures the average annual economic growth rate in that period was 3.2% in America, 7.3% in Germany, and 9% in Japan. In Conservative Britain it was only 2.9%. In international real terms we were getting steadily comparatively poorer. Mrs Thatcher talks of expanding the national cake, but in the more recent period of Tory rule in which she was actively involved, 1970-1974, the growth rate was actually slightly less at 2.8% per annum, and it is still more stagnant now.So mere sloganising about growth is not enough. If you define output as a result of the most effective use of labour and investment then you can readily identify the British disease. We have shockingly low levels of investment and poor output per man employed.It is time we recognised quite bluntly that we shall continue to be a failure as a country so long as we are governed both industrially and politically on the outdated confrontation attitudes of the class war. Mr Terry Beckett, Chairman and managing director of Fords, whom I\u2019ve never met and who to the best of my knowledge is not a member of our party, put the damage of alternating political confrontation very well in a speech recently: \u2018The gap between the stance of our two major parties in this country is too wide on economic matters and this gap is a real impediment to our progress. If the Conservatives were returned to power in the near future they might well want to reverse some of this government\u2019s legislation as this government reversed some of its predecessor\u2019s. Contrast the common ground for economic policy in Germany between the two main parties and the chief coalition party the Free Democrats with the situation in this country with some Conservatives\u2019 advocacy of a pure market economy and some Labour Party members\u2019 insistence that their real aim is to secure Clause 4. Extremes are advocated and are held with increasing intransigence. The over­whelming majority of the electorate is moderate politically. But this is our problem. No one has told them what a sensible common ground is, what is really needed.\u2019We are now telling them.If we are going to change this pattern we need to secure electoral reform which will provide a genuinely representative parliament. To get that we need to increase our own influence over the next government of whichever colour at the next election.Although we actually don\u2019t do at all badly as far as output lost through official union strikes is concerned, our industrial relations are bedevilled by restrictive practices, antagonism to new technology, go slows, working to rule and unofficial strikes. All of this suggests that we are attempting to run a late 20th century economy on late 19th century attitudes.We are supportive of a democratic and free trade union movement and offer it opportunities for responsible power far beyond the Labour confines of Bul­lock - as electors of Board members, as Board members, as works councillors, as shareholders in share-ownership schemes.But we are critically supportive of trade unions. We cannot and will not - in joining with the trade union movement, owners and management in a common quest for economic growth - give up our responsibility for those at work who are not and do not wish to be trade union members. Nor do we give up our responsibility for those owners and managers who are not members of the CBI, nor to the consumer as we demonstrated when we persuaded the govern­ment, the Post Office management and the unions to accept consumer represent­ation on the new Post Office board.The Liberal trade unionist seeks to convince the \u2018doubter\u2019 to join him - not threaten him with the sack; the Liberal trade unionist knows the difference between a good closed shop and a bad one.It is a pretty worthless organisation which, unable to persuade or attract employees in a non-unionised firm to join up, then forces them to do so by blacking that firm\u2019s work.Having condemned the worst side of some trade union practices and uphold­ing as we do the right not to belong to a trade union, it is also necessary to con­demn bad employer practices and assert that right which was fought for and won decades ago, namely the right of workers to combine together in a union for their own protection. That is what the Grunwick dispute was originally about. Of course sadly it became obscured in activity which we deplored, namely mass picketing and the illegal interruption of public services to the company, but Lord Justice Scarman put the position in a nutshell when he said in his report: \u2018The company was perfectly entitled to prefer a policy of conducting its employee relations without the intrusion of trade unions in a collective bargaining role. But the maintenance of such a policy depends on industrial relations policies which in terms of pay and conditions, management attitudes, and the provision of an adequate alternative to collective bargaining machinery, do not cause employees a sense of deprivation or grievance. We are satisfied that it was the company\u2019s failure to meet these exacting criteria which led to the dispute.\u2019The public was rightly outraged at the riots outside the factory and I joined in the condemnation of those who had nothing to do with this dispute and whose presence resulted in violence and disorder.But equally as Liberals we must condemn and apportion a share of the blame to those who encouraged an autocratic low paying employer in prolong­ing, deepening and widening the dispute, not least Conservative politicians who should know better.There is both on the left and right of politics today a growing thirst for confrontation and for blaming the other side for all our ills. I see it in my mail­bag. Leave aside the cranky or extremist letters which I receive by the bundle and let me quote one perfectly rational letter disagreeing with my views on Grunwick and supporting Keith Joseph\u2019s: \u2018the return to sanity cannot be accomplished without hard, relentless and prolonged confrontation, though let us hope without too much actual bloodshed.\u2019\u2018Confrontation without we hope too much bloodshed.\u2019 What an appalling vision of a Tory Britain. Reconciliation, tolerance and co-operation are the Liberal watchwords, loathed by the extremists on left and right alike.It used to be thought that radicalism meant moving to the left of the Labour party or to the right of the Tory party. Certainly both of these can be described today as radical. But the biggest single radical change we could make n Britain to ensure both a contented society and a more successful one would be to break down the barriers in industry, housing and education which separate our people into distinct warring categories.That is radicalism which can come only from the centre of British politics and as the other two parties each move increasingly in opposite directions the middle ground of politics is becoming potentially larger than at any time in the last thirty years.I propose three steps to break down the barriers in industry. First, I believe that the transition from a rigid pay policy should not be the total free for all of free collective bargaining. The encouragement of genuine plant productivity deals in which employees get a direct share in the rewards from increased output should become the pattern for greater prosperity in the 1980s.Second, we favour a total but calm and not hasty review of the whole framework of labour legislation which should include new measures to promote a genuine working partnership in industry. I believe we have to look not only for greater partnership in existing industry, public and private, but for the stimulation of new forms of enterprise. I am greatly encouraged by what I have read of the co-operative in Spain started over 20 years ago at Mondragon. It now employs 13,000 people in some 75 units backed by a co-operative bank operating in a free market economy. Jo Grimond is leaving us later in the week to visit Mondragon and we look forward to hearing more about it from him.Third, I want to see as part of a programme based on first creating and then sharing greater wealth direct encouragement of profit sharing and employee shareholding schemes. In our agreement for the next session of parliament the government undertook \u2018to consider ways of encouraging the creation of schemes for profit sharing in private industry with a view to legislation.\u2019 Work has indeed been proceeding in the Treasury on this subject, and the government has been in consultation with us on possible tax incentive schemes. The Chancellor has now told me that he intends to issue a consultative document outlining these within the next three months and that providing all goes well the necessary legislation will follow in next year\u2019s Finance Bill.Almost every year since the war the Liberal Assembly has passed magnificent resolutions on this subject. Almost every year the party leader has included a plea for industrial partnership in his speech from this platform; almost every year our spokesmen in the House of Commons have moved an appropriate new clause to the Finance Bill; and almost every year we have trooped solemnly into the lobby in vain to support it. But this year we\u2019re actually going to do some­thing about it. I don\u2019t pretend that this itself is going to bring about a total revolution, but it is a significant step in a direction never before taken by any Tory or Labour government.What we have to do is turn the country away from the remorseless conflict of interest and ideologies which has rendered us incapable of developing and allocating our resources in a successful manner. For in persistent economic failure lies the greatest threat to liberty and democracy.We have met together as Liberals at these conferences for years talking of the ways we would like to change Britain. Too often for us the light at the end of the tunnel has turned out to be that of a train coming in the other direction. This year we have done more than talk. We have begun to change - just slightly - the way in which Britain is run. Now we have to demonstrate that if this much can be done by a tiny band of Liberals outside government how much more could be done by a larger grouping inside the next government, and still more by a Liberal government itself.The task of the Liberal Party is to convince people that we need not be governed in a way which divides our people against each other. We need to face an election in which we argue that the voters don\u2019t have to choose between a government dedicated to making us all subservient to the state and one anxious to create a society in which you grab what you can for yourself and clobber any­one who gets in the way. Don\u2019t let anyone tell you that being moderate means being in favour of timidity or appeasement of the aggressive. I want our party to become the militants for the reasonable man. We need to create - and I shall return to this theme on Saturday - a nobler concept of the family that should be Britain.Time is short. Our task this week is to prepare for that argument. Enjoy the Assembly. The responsibility on us is greater than before. But so is the need for liberalism greater than before and we must not fail our people.

aVWhen I spoke to you for the first time as leader two years ago at Llandudno I warned that the road we intended to travel would be a bumpy one, but I must confess that I never foresaw how rough it would be. Yet we lost remarkably few members and even gained others, and I want at the outset of this speech to say a very warm thank you not only to my colleagues in both Houses of Parliament and the party officers and all those who have been closely involved during this period of political innovation, but of appreciation and admiration to you all both in this hall and throughout the country for holding so firm and being prepared to travel together through these difficulties. Of course all parties must expect, from time to time, to run into political difficulties and we are no exception. But as we all know we\u2019ve had other distressing problems as well. If adversity is good for the soul, I think all our prospects of redemption must really have improved. At the end of a particularly long day I some­times think of those lines of W.E. Henley:Under the bludgeoning of chanceMy head is bloody but unbowed.I am sure that all of us at times recently have felt bloody, but looking around I don\u2019t see too many bowed heads.Indeed as I look at this splendid Assembly and feel the warmth of your enthusiasm, I think there are two questions which all the critics and Liberal obituarists ought to ask themselves. \u2018What is it that gives the Liberal Party its stamina and resilience? What is it that will see the Liberal Party going into the election with high morale and even higher hopes?\u2019It certainly isn\u2019t what sustains the Conservative Party! They believe they have a divine right to rule. Nor is it that uneasy brew of class hatred and lust for office which fuels the Labour Party.No - for Liberals it\u2019s something quite different. It\u2019s a burning conviction that what we believe in and what we stand for is right. Politics may have become a dirty word. It\u2019s prostituted and debauched by the way poli­ticians bid each other up in an electoral auction. But it can still be a noble vocation for those with conviction and determination. And we have plenty of both.Britain is badly governed. It is badly governed because its political in­stitutions are antiquated and undemocratic. This crucial weakness is at the very root of Britain\u2019s continuing economic and social decline. There\u2019s no longer much dispute about this in the serious press, among observers of politics outside the ranks of the two establishment parties, or in the mind of the public at large.One of the messages that has gone out clearly from this Assembly is that Liberals will not tolerate a slide back down the slippery slope of inflation. That\u2019s why we are insisting on a fair statutory prices and in­comes policy. That\u2019s why we got involved with the government.Remember when we formed the pact the rate of inflation had doubled in the previous two years of Labour government. The country was on the brink of disaster.Of course there has to be an alternative. But does anyone seriously think it should be a Conservative Government when their main achieve­ment was to increase the rate of inflation two-and-a-half times when last in office. We on the other hand strengthened the economy.Yet we still hear the argument trotted out by Conservative and Labour spokesmen that the preservation of our undemocratic voting system and our impotent Parliament are necessary to ensure what they call \u2018strong government,\u2019 and that any fundamental changes would lay Britain open to the sort of \u2018weak\u2019 governments from which our continental partners are said to suffer.Let\u2019s just look at that so-called \u2018weak\u2019 government. Do they mean the performance of the German economy, or the cohesion of Scandinavian societies or the broad mutual tolerance which characterises the Dutch parties? Or perhaps they mean the way that new policies are introduced in other democracies with representative voting systems - the open debate, the careful all-party scrutiny, the search for a consensus to back new measures.If that's what they mean by \u2018weak\u2019 government - I can only say that Britain could do with some of it. We need a totally new parliament.I'm sure it\u2019s satisfying to Mrs Thatcher or Tony Benn to contemplate the prospect of having the unfettered power in Government to bulldoze through their pet schemes. Satisfying for them - but disastrous for any prospect of good government in Britain. We need to spell this out to the voters in the clearest terms. Single party government, as we have seen it from Labour and Conservative, is bad government. To get good government - of the quality which most of our European partners have - we must throw out our indefensible electoral system. We must give Parliament the power and the information to criticise and control the Government.No one in the Conservative or Labour front benches has found a con­sistent or logical case against a more democratic voting system. The argu­ments we have heard in the House of Commons in the past two years have been awash with contradictions. I remember Michael Foot saying about Spain after General Franco\u2019s death that he would not regard it as having regained democracy until it had a government which clearly reflected the wishes of a majority of its people.I agreed with him but it didn\u2019t seem to worry him that he and his col­leagues were totally hostile to government based on majority support until they were forced to come to an agreement with the Liberals. Tony Benn talks with conviction about the need to build a participatory democracy. But he shies away from the obvious conclusion that wider participation starts with a broader-based Parliament accurately reflecting the choice of the voters.We\u2019ve just had an excellent report on Parliamentary reforms from the Select Committee on Procedure. Lots of sensible suggestions which most people would agree with. Like most MPs I\u2019ve had dozens of letters from members of the public since the broadcasting of Parliament started. They\u2019re simply stupefied by the radio rhubarb of Parliamentary debate, by what the Committee called \u2018the totally adversary character of present proceedings.\u2019 The Economist commented \u2018that adversary character is largely of course the product of Britain's undemocratic electoral method,\u2019 and it was right.I was astonished and saddened to discover during the Agreement with the Labour Government how firmly ministers resisted the idea that they should carry through their own manifesto commitment to repeal the Official Secrets Act. And I noted the strange silence on this issue from an Opposition which rarely misses other opportunities to attack the Government. True, Conservatives make brave speeches about the wickedness of the bureaucratic and secretive regimes of Eastern Europe; nevertheless they seem quite happy with bureaucracy and secrecy here, just so long as they can be in charge of it.We have now in front of us a most scandalous example of secrecy. The record of the Wilson and Heath governments over sanctions for Rhodesia is deplorable in itself. British oil companies, backed by British Civil Ser­vants, with the connivance of British Ministers and with the knowledge of the British Prime Minister broke the sanctions on Rhodesia. As a result Smith is still there, majority rule has still not been established, and Rhode­sia is sliding into tragic carnage.Since I spoke earlier in the week we have heard that the Bingham Report on Rhodesia sanctions is to be published next Tuesday.I want to reiterate our demand for a Tribunal of Enquiry held in public to carry on where Bingham left off. I\u2019m glad to see this morning that one member of the last Tory cabinet - Geoffrey Rippon - is supporting that call. Who are these Ministers of both parties and who are these Civil Ser­vants who\u2019ve set themselves above the law, who formed alternative poli­cies in secret, who lied to Parliament and the British people? I urge the Government to move swiftly to set up the Enquiry. Secrecy corrupts - and this Petrolgate scandal is striking at the very integrity of our government.Secrecy, arrogance, resistance to change in the way Britain is run \u2013 we\u2019ve had to put up with them for too long. And on all these issues the Labour and Tory front benches huddle together.I\u2019ve been talking about Westminster so far, but a genuine democracy cannot rest on a properly elected Parliament alone. We have to put the main assumption of British political life briskly into reverse. Tories and Socialists alike assume that people are not to be trusted, not to be informed and that they should be allowed as little real choice as possible.By contrast the sort of democracy that Liberals want must be built on a structure of trust, information and choice.That\u2019s why we want a Federal Europe; that\u2019s why we want devolution to the countries and regions within Britain; above all that\u2019s why we want decentralisation of decision to the villages, towns and neighbourhoods of this country. Power is like muck; it\u2019s better spread than concentrated in one place. The basic building block of a liberal democracy is a vital local community, with the power and resources to provide a satisfying shared life for its members. Unless the roots are healthy the democratic grass will not grow.One of the other enemies of true democracy is the power that big money has in politics. A revealing table was published in the Investor\u2019s Chronicle a few weeks ago. It detailed the Conservative Party\u2019s support from large corporations and, the Labour Party\u2019s from the big trade unions.You don\u2019t have to be over cynical to suspect that he who pays the piper calls the tune. So the billboards have been full of Conservative propa­ganda, by courtesy of brewers and insurance bosses. And a bankrupt Labour Party, devoid of members and funds, has been bailed out once again by its union paymasters.If you are a company chairman or a union general secretary you can certainly buy yourself some pretty high-powered representation in demo­cratic Britain. With a bit of luck you might even pick up a whole Govern­ment at a bargain price.Of course if you are just an ordinary private person going to work, doing your shopping, worrying how to make ends meet, it is a very dif­ferent matter.Is it really surprising that people feel alienated from a system where money and power get together to squeeze them out?The results are obvious. Let me remind you of the Labour Govern­ment\u2019s craven acquiescence to union demands from 1974 to 1976, before we got our hands on the wheel.The Dock Work Labour Bill and parts of the Trade Union & Labour Relations Act had nothing to do with good government. They didn\u2019t even have anything to do with socialism. They were simply a pay-off by the Labour Government to the Trades Unions.I want to emphasise that Liberals have always supported the principle of free trade unionism but that is not to say that we go along with the worst excesses of union protectionism and bloody-mindedness. If Trades Unions are given their head by a Government which is in hock to them, we shall see more not less of this ugly and negative side of a great movement. And that can threaten something every democrat holds dear, like the free­dom of the Press.I have been reading two detailed reports which illustrate just what I mean. The first concerns the efforts by SLADE to recruit members through blatant coercion by blacking art and print work from firms or individuals who are not members of that union - a process which makes an absolute mockery of the very phrase \u2018free trade unionism.\u2019 The second is a catalogue of occasions over the last decade when sections or members of the NUJ or the NGA have attempted to censor material from appearing in the press. These include successful attempts to have political cartoons withdrawn and even one incident on a local paper where the blacking of all non­-union copy included a ban on the publication of readers\u2019 letters.These direct threats to freedom of the press have grown in the last four years, and the new parliament must be prepared to extend the bound­aries of freedom rather than retreat further in the face of such pressure.Mind you some of the press editors and proprietors themselves are not exactly in the best position to pontificate about what constitutes a free and independent press. Liberals should not get too sore about any abuse we might get in the newspapers - sometimes I think we get the press we deserve, but I do think it can get a bit far fetched. For example, here is the News of the World editorial of June 18th. It is headed by two photographs - one of Sooty the puppet and other of me. It points out, for the benefit of its less perceptive readers, that I am the one on the right. It then goes on to say I\u2019ve \u2018become as independent of Mr Callaghan as Sooty is of Mr Corbett.\u2019Now I don\u2019t mind that particularly; it is advancing a hostile political argument in a populist way. What I did object to was this when I turned the following Saturday to improve my political education by reading the editorial in the Sun.Here was one of its fortnightly attacks on the Liberals ending: \u2018The reality is - as the News of the World shrewdly pointed out last Sunday - that David Steel is as independent of Jim Callaghan as Sooty is of Harry Corbett.\u2019 Now how many of their readers realise that the Sun and News of the World are owned by the same organisation? That the one is as independent of the other as Larry the Lamb is of Rupert Murdoch? I sometimes think that it would be in the interests of a really free press if like the government health warning on cigarette packets certain newspapers were required to carry a box on their front page saying: \u2018WARNING: This newspaper is dedicated to the return of a Thatcher government at any price.\u2019We Liberals must pledge ourselves to represent the ordinary citizens of this country who cannot buy influence through their wealth. Who will defend their interests against the vested interests of the owner party and the union party if we do not?So the first priority for the new Parliament is fundamental reform of our political and electoral system.But that does no more than clear the deck for the urgent issues of the coming decade. We are in the dying throes of the \u2018you\u2019ve never had it so good\u2019 society. The plastic cornucopia is drying up. If we are to get our whole civilisation back into a more healthy balanced relationship with the natural world, if we are to be frugal in our use of energy resources, if we are to find more fulfilment in our children than in our consumption pat­terns, then there will have to be profound changes in all our values and practices.It cannot and will not be done by an all-powerful government holding meetings with the representatives of industry. Centralised big government, monopolistic big business, giant trades unions are like dinosaurs. Obsolete - still large and frightening, still crushing everything in their paths - but obsolete, incapable through their very size and inflexibility of meeting the problems of the new age.Both Government and Parliament have totally failed to take the eco­logical and environmental case seriously. It is astonishing, for instance, that Britain is rushing towards a nuclear economy - which most thinking people seriously question - on the sole basis of a restricted government enquiry at Windscale.It\u2019s a commentary on the impotence of Parliament and the reluctance of the opposing front benches to grapple with awkward issues that this has not yet been examined or discussed at Westminster. Debates about economic recovery and future economic growth still largely assume that we can somehow get back to the easy days of the 1950s looking forward to doubling our standard of living every 25 or 30 years and thinking of economic growth in crude quantitative terms - as if the crucial problem was to get up from 2% to 4% and the long term aim to move from one car and TV set for every family to two. I believe that this is not only a false set of assumptions, but also pro­foundly dangerous. Neither we nor any of the other developed countries of Western Europe and North America can or should expect to get back to the sustained and high rates of economic growth which obtained for al­most 25 years after World War 2.In industry, in government and in life generally people are best able to find themselves and express their potential when they are not reduced to units in a calculating machine. Don\u2019t believe those who tell you that everything has to be big to be efficient, to get economies of scale. Cheap information-processing and high energy costs are making a nonsense of the monopolists\u2019 arguments. It\u2019s up to us Liberals to point the path away from the land of the giants and back to a more human landscape.Small is not just beautiful, it works better.The Tories\u2019 changes in local government destroyed the one thing that really mattered - the link between local government and the local com­munity. The baby was thrown out with the bath water. Since then many councils have been losing touch with the people in their areas.It\u2019s the same with their new health boards and the vast hospitals that have replaced district hospitals; it\u2019s the same with the village schools that have closed; it\u2019s the same with the industrial mergers that may create new scope for highly-paid executives but destroy people\u2019s satisfaction at work; it\u2019s even the same in the trade unions where more energy seems to go into mergers and empire-building than into the protection of their members. It\u2019s the same with the neglected housing of our inner cities and their replacement by tower blocks and anonymous estates.I want the Britain in which my children and grandchildren grow up to be more than a run down slag-heap, dominated by a few giant organi­sations - an urban wasteland in which all sense of belonging, of continuity between generations, of happiness, and satisfaction in life has been sacrificed.We have had some success in forcing Labour to face up to the demands of small business but that is no more than a beginning.The New Parliament must face up to the priorities of the new age. A strong local community is the only place for the full development of the individual - and it\u2019s up to us to build that community.It is a tragic paradox that in our rush to modernise and rationalise, we have so often discarded the very basis of a civilized life. A lively com­munity, with its own local school and health centre, with good public transport facilities, with restored local buildings, with a local policeman on the local beat, with thriving local enterprises and a real sense of local ident­ity. That\u2019s real civilisation - and it wouldn\u2019t just be better in the country­side but in the run-down areas of our great cities too. Rebuilding the local communities of Britain is a massive task. It will need some very fundamental changes in the way we do things. It will take a lot of work and I mean that literally.If we really want to put people to work we have the solution at hand, in the regeneration of Britain from the grass roots upwards. It will demand a total change in priorities in the New Parliament. But it could be done. We could conquer unemployment!We have seen the very detailed and impressive plans of the Liberal un­employment commission and we all have confidence that with the right training and retraining, with extensive restructuring of work, with proper investment and above all with the right job creation strategy, we could take advantage of our opportunity to put people back to work. We could stop throwing away the precious resource of their talent and labour.But it won\u2019t happen overnight. There are no instant solutions to un­employment which has spread like a cancer through the whole Western world, and is not confined to Britain. Any party which suggests other­wise is dishonest. The Tories are cruelly misleading the men and women out of work when they suggest that their queues could disappear as quickly as the advertising posters peel off the hoardings.I was relieved that Jim Prior at least had the integrity to disown the ad­men\u2019s promises and admit that the Tories had no magic to make the dole queues vanish.But I fear the taste for magic solutions which do not bear examination is deeply engrained in Margaret Thatcher\u2019s mind. Consider her notorious statement on race.Two years ago, I said - and you\u2019ve endorsed it this week - that we should be prepared to join with other parties in the government of the country provided that certain basic conditions were met. I said then that we would never compromise with the obscenity of racialism.Prospects of a share in government were remote at that time - they are certainly not so today. It is therefore even more important that I should make it abundantly clear that a fundamental condition for any co-operation with the Tories would have to be an end to the racialism that has so per­vaded the thinking of the Conservative Party. Any immigration policy must be humane and civilised, based on the legal rights of British citizens and on human need, but firmly rejecting the criterion of colour.Mrs Thatcher\u2019s views on the importance of family life seem to be strict­ly conditioned by the colour of that family\u2019s skin. Their new immigration policy would trample on the rights of teenage children to live with their parents; and we have never heard any hint of criticism from her lips of the inhumanity and degradation caused to the family life of millions of black South Africans by the hideous practice of apartheid. Canon Trevor Beeson in his new book Britain Today and Tomorrow says that the growth and renewal of our national character depends on us recognising the other face of society \u2018which is illiberal and degrading to the poor, the marginal and to the underprivileged alien.\u2019 We must realise that a vital part of our continuing duty is to ensure that our liberalism - which must be a passionate liberalism - affords every protection and assistance to all these.For while the National Front and other similar organisations are crudely evil and must be firmly resisted Liberals must resist even more strongly the more subtle, institutionalised racialism which is so insidious and which has become a curse in our land.In concluding its submission to the Franks Committee the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants called for politicians to return to discussing immigration, not in terms of numbers, but in terms of principles of human rights and family life: \u2018Only when politicians, in and out of Government, are prepared to take on this task of public education can the tide of racial­ism, swollen on years of debate about numbers and fresh restrictions, be turned.\u2019I have a feeling that the greatest of my predecessors, Mr. Gladstone, with his deep abiding concern for the rights of oppressed and under­privileged minorities everywhere would have thoroughly approved of these words.It\u2019s been saddening over the past 25 years to witness the gradual de­terioration of British society, the slow decline in a feeling of the common interest which transcends the immediate interests of class, profession or pressure group. Britain is becoming one of the least generous societies in Western Europe. There is a sense of sourness and an unwillingness to help others which is spreading its blight across the country.Politicians and political parties must bear a great part of the blame for this deterioration. The style and tenor of political debate does much to set the tone for society as a whole; and the style and tenor of the British pol­itical debate in recent years has been destructive and petulant. Politicians have play-acted at class war, because they believed that such play-acting would win them votes.Oppositions have refused to give governments any credit for their constructive acts. Above all, both the established front benches have sought at all points to emphasise the differences between them - even when these are illusory - rather than the common elements in their approach. The result has been a general decline in popular acceptance of government proposals, a weakening of that popular consent on which democratic government must ultimately rest. If all these problems I\u2019ve been describing are to enjoy any hope of solution then after the next election the new parliament must be wholly different in character and composition from all the post-war parliaments we have known.What will be the choices before our people? An overall Labour majority? The Labour Party is not just bankrupt of members and finance. It is politically exhausted too. It offers nothing new for the next election. Labour has progressed from being the know-nothing party to becoming the do-nothing party. The danger which a single-party majority for a Labour Government would present would not necessarily be that Britain would be pushed into an East European type of socialism; it is rather that Britain would continue to drift hopelessly in the direction we have followed in the last fifteen years, towards a centralised corporate state.Another possibility is an overall Conservative majority. They present themselves as a party of doctrinaire change, with their version of the capi­talist society into which Britain would be transformed. It is a mean-spirited prospect in which all human values are decided in the market place with democracy as a secondary consideration and social justice a mere after­thought. What is more, it is false.It does not fit the complicated problems facing an industrialised society in an interdependent world with finite resources. Indeed many of the best men in the Conservative Party know it to be false - and fear the consequenc­es of Thatcherism if it is given its head in a single party Tory government.When I first joined the party, Jo Grimond had argued persuasively that Harold Macmillan\u2019s government could not possibly carry through the re­forming changes which were necessary to stop the drift into decline until the chains of the two-party system were broken. Here we are, 20 wasted years of divisive government later, and Jo\u2019s conclusion is more than ever persuasive. Thankfully the Liberal Party is now far stronger, the strangle­hold of the two adversary parties on British politics far weaker. Another push, another massive effort and we will break the chains, we will create that new majority.The Assembly has helped to fill in the outlines of the Liberal society; our task now is to persuade the electorate that this is the vision which offers them hope. We have to create a new coalition among the voters, cutting across the lines of class, of industry, of regional prejudice and of race which now divide Britain.Given the backing of such an electoral coalition, we can then use the authority they have given us to make sure that any new government works to promote the common good, instead of following the dictates of ideology or of vested interests. Instead of tearing Britain further apart we want to start pulling it together again.But if I am full of hope for this country and what it might become I am also full of anger. I am angry with the phoney war between the Tory and Labour Parties.In the next few months the electorate will be hoodwinked into think­ing that they are watching deadly enemies locked in combat. But Tory and Labour are actually the cosiest of competitors. As long as the Tory Party\u2019s turn comes round, it doesn\u2019t really mind the Labour Party. In fact it needs it! What else but the dangling spectres of Mr Benn and Mr Mikardo could get people to vote Conservative at all? And what a gift to Labour Mrs Thatcher and Sir Keith Joseph are. What would these parties do without each other?Of course they don\u2019t want to change the system which puts them into power turn and turn about on the backs of their opponents\u2019 failures. They don\u2019t have any investment in Britain\u2019s success. Quite the reverse. They actually prefer a chronicle of disaster because it guarantees that they will get their turn at absolute power for four or five years.That\u2019s why Mrs Thatcher in her speech a few days ago in my constitu­ency declared that the choice of the British people ought to be confined to Toryism or Socialism.This isn\u2019t democracy. It\u2019s rotating dictatorship. And the relationship between the parties is like an illicit market-sharing agreement. It\u2019s a cartel!Mr Ronald Butt - one of the constant scourges of the Lib/Lab pact writing in the Sunday Times this week said: \u2018During the period of the Lib/Lab pact the Labour government was given something like security of tenure to do a crisis job. This it has largely done\u2026\u2019Agreed - another one who\u2019s seen the light - \u2018\u2026Something more radical is now needed\u2019 - even more agreed - and then he adds lamely \u2018whether it is to be done in the Conservative way or the Labour way.\u2019They don\u2019t begin to understand that both their ways have failed and that we must turn to something new.We are going to smash their cosy cartel. Why should we all have to put up with an arrogance which seems to assume the country belongs to the Tory and Labour parties. It doesn\u2019t - and the Liberals are going to prove it.It used to be said that a Liberal vote is a wasted vote. Events since 1974 should have disproved that. I say to you that a liberal vote at the next election will be the most effective vote that anyone can make.We are not just another political party seeking power. We are the force that will allow people to break the pattern of national failure. We\u2019re radi­cals out to change a corrupt system. May this force be with you.We have a candidate of our own for leadership of the next govern­ment: the British people! It\u2019s time they got a look in. It\u2019s time they took charge in their own Parliament. And we are on their side. But don\u2019t expect to be universally loved for what we are doing. There is a heavy investment in the status quo by Tory and Labour and their powerful friends. Be ready for sneers and misrepresentation. But, whatever you do, never, never give way! And if you ever quail at the prospect of still more hard work having so little reward to show for past endeavours, remember what it\u2019s all for:For the cause that lacks assistanceFor the wrong that needs resistanceFor the future in the distanceAnd the good that we can doAnd then the next election will be an historic opportunity.Each Liberal vote and every Liberal seat in the new Parliament could be crucial. We cracked the old order and the old way of doing things in the last Parliament. Now we must break it in pieces.This is a time for nerve and resolution. Let\u2019s go out from this hall and see that every voter knows and understands what a Liberal vote could mean for the new Parliament. An end to greed, intolerance and decline. The new Parliament must be a new beginning for Britain. The Liberals are the only way to get it. We\u2019ve now got extra time to convince the people that is so. Go out and use it.

aVThis has been a confident, united, inspiring and articulate Assembly. The Liberal Party is alive and kicking. That may seem so obvious to those in this hall that it is hardly worth saying. But I say it deliberately because a year ago and throughout last winter and spring so many com­mentators were forecasting our demise. This Assembly ought to have been simply a gathering of the tattered remnant to put the corpse of the Liberal Party decently to rest.The News of the World told us in an editorial in April that the Party would be \u2018surely consigned to oblivion\u2019 in the general election.The Daily Express told us in August 1977 in an editorial headed \u2018The Liberals are finished\u2019 that we could not hold any seats.Others more generously suggested that Jo Grimond would become leader of the Party yet again because he would be the only Liberal MP left.In the last few days much of the press has changed its tune - they tell us that we may be poised for a great revival. Like the Trojans of old, \u2018timeo Danaos et dona ferentes\u2019 - I beware of the Greeks even when they bring gifts.We are poised for a great revival - not because the press tell us so, but because of the determination and hard work which we are putting in all over the country. Last week\u2019s Euro by-election in London and yes­terday\u2019s result from Manchester gave us the foretaste of things to come.The truth is that we not only survived, we did remarkably well in both the Parliamentary and local elections on May 3rd. Never in post-war politics has the Liberal Party emerged so strongly after a period of Labour government.Just contrast the state of the Party when we last met here in Margate in 1972. Many of you weren\u2019t even in the Party then. We had lost more than half our MPs, had but a scattering of councillors round the country, and stood at 5% in the polls. Yet it was just after Margate in 1972 that our last leap forward started with the by-elections from Rochdale to Berwick.We began this decade with a general election in which we lost half our seats and polled two million votes. We ended it with an election in which we held eleven seats and polled four million votes together with a remarkable number of gains in local government.That result didn\u2019t happen by magic. I want to take this chance to thank all of you from my colleagues in parliament and the Party officers, to the constituency workers and the kids who delivered leaflets in the streets for the tremendous effort you all put in to the campaign.There has been a further significant change. When I came into the Commons in the 1964 Parliament not one of our nine constituencies was an industrial seat taken from Labour. Today Colne Valley, Rochdale and Edge Hill, together with local government advances in places like Tower Hamlets, are proof that the Liberal message has spread from Tory areas deep into the traditional urban and industrial heartlands of the Labour Party.  More important than our present electoral strength at the end of the \u201970s is the fact that the role and potential in contemporary politics of the Liberal Party is more understood and accepted than it has been for a long time. In my first speech to you as leader three years ago at Llandudno, I said that we could not build a solid political Party on the basis of being a nice debating society; that we needed to establish ourselves as the vehicle for change; that if we were to do that we should not be afraid to roll up our sleeves and risk muckying ourselves by grasping the greasy levers of power.And we did. For eighteen months we risked our collective necks in the effort to help pull our country on to a surer path. We learned a great deal in that period, including a lot from our own mistakes. But we achieved a lot.We showed that the Liberal Party meant what it said. When we made our agreement we stuck to it however rough the going. When we ended it and said it was time for an election we stuck by that too and defied the cries of \u2018chicken.\u2019 People know that they can depend on the Liberal Party.We also demonstrated that when more than one political party pulls together for the country\u2019s sake it can be effective. Of course much of the Lib-Lab pact was drowned in the cries of anguish from the Tories and their powerful friends who simply wanted a Conservative Government as soon as possible.Well now they\u2019ve got one, and after only five months many of those who voted Tory must be pining for the days when inflation was coming down; when mortgage rates were falling; when industrial confidence was rising; when doctrinaire politics were kept in check; all of which happened during the eighteen months of the Lib-Lab pact.People now realise that the Liberal Party made a significant contri­bution by putting the country first. We were not found wanting when put to the test. We stand ready to make the even greater contribution which will be needed from us in the future as the crisis deepens.We stand for an end to the long period of national failure demon­strated by the divisive class politics of the two Parties. They have ruled and misruled our country for thirty-five years. We offered a glimpse of what co-operation for genuinely national policies could achieve.But thanks to our loaded electoral system we once again find that we are back to one-sided partisan policies now that another minority has grabbed power. The Tories are determined to go it alone in the interests of their \u2018side.\u2019 In the face of that we should assert again that it is futile for Britain to go on swinging violently from failure to failure in search of success, from left to right in search of the way ahead. It isn\u2019t just that the pendulum is swinging again but that each swing goes further. The current movement to the far right will inevitably be followed by one to the far left - unless we stop it.Time is running short. Each successive failure weakens our whole society. When the new Conservative policies of greed and grab fail, as they most surely will, the need for a credible alternative becomes overwhelming. It will be no use going back to state socialism and bureaucracy again. There must be a real alternative.And it is no good looking to the Labour Party to provide that alter­native. No wonder they prefer to call it the Labour Movement for there is hardly any Party left, so great is their drop in membership. It is only kept alive by the life support system of trade union funds - and the price of that is the block vote.They are divided between their idiot left and their conservative right. They\u2019re even afraid of such a revolutionary idea as allowing the whole Party, not just those in Parliament, to elect the leader. Now don\u2019t think I\u2019m biased, but it\u2019s not such a bad idea, unless of course you\u2019re afraid of the result. A Party which cannot even manage to reform its own constitution is clearly incapable of reforming Britain.A Party in decline imbued with the problems and values of sixty years ago may suit a country in decline. But those who want to regenerate our economy and transform our society will have to look elsewhere. One Conservative party is quite enough for any country, but the brand of conservatism towards which Labour is slipping - protectionism, indus­trial stagnation and state control - is particularly unattractive and deeply illiberal.The Labour conference starts next week. Contrast the mood with which many Labour MPs and delegates approach that grim occasion with the mood here in Margate.Labour membership is declining. Ours is rising. We deliberate. They recriminate. They are introspective. We are outward-looking.The fact is that the Labour leadership no longer trusts the Labour Party - and they have reason not to. Many weak constituency organi­sations have fallen into the hands of the sour zealots of the left. The right by contrast is bereft of ideas and enthusiasm.I want to say this - not so much to Labour MPs and former Ministers - we all know that they have their careers to think of - but to the many people who have supported the Labour Party in the past as the party of conscience and reform. You know it is that no longer, and can never be again. Cut your losses - come and join us.We share many of your hopes and ideals. The difference is that we mean to do something about them. We need your enthusiasm and com­mitment. And you need us if we are not to have a decade of hard-faced Tory government.It is our job now to stake out the high ground of politics. There has been little affection for Mrs Thatcher in this Assembly, but we should at least recognise that she is a conviction politician. Convinced - but wrong! We have shown at this conference exactly the same strength of conviction except that we have nobler ideals of individual freedom and development within a responsible and neighbourly community. There is a majority in Britain yearning for a radical alternative. That majority has not yet found its political voice nor used its power. Our task in the next four years is to put together this new majority - to offer the country a prospect of hope after the long nightmare of decline.For a government to succeed in Britain it needs to be able to transform the atmosphere of politics, to create a different national mood, a sense of purpose, with three basic qualities.The first is the spirit of co-operation. A spirit of co-operation throughout our society is difficult to achieve. Yet we pointed the way in private industry with our introduction in last year\u2019s Finance Bill of the tax incentives for profit sharing schemes. The number of such schemes already in operation and in preparation already exceeds two hundred. As one city editor wrote this month with a note of surprise \u2018at this rate of progress it will not be long before the company without a scheme is the exception rather than the rule.\u2019I call on the Tory Government to improve on this modest start. They should double the amount which may be acquired to £1,000 and halve the length of time for which it has to be held to be totally free of income tax to five years.The concept of sharing the fruits of increased productivity among the workforce should be extended into the public sector and indeed should be the basis of a sustained and effective incomes policy. Trying to impose a 5% limit on everybody regardless of the success of their enterprise as the last Government did in its dying days was a desperate and failed substitute for a coherent incomes policy.The present Government has abandoned all attempt at controlling the inflation caused by unearned increases in wages. They say that incomes policies are unfair and arbitrary. That is just not true. It is certainly true of sudden and short-lived spasmodic incomes policies of the kind we have seen in successive governments. But no-one has yet tried sufficiently to construct a fair and continuous policy geared both to counter inflation and increase industrial efficiency. Sad though the loss of John Pardoe is from the Parliamentary Party I am glad that he is continuing his pioneering work in this field during his absence from the Commons.It is one of the more ludicrous features of this Government\u2019s economic policies that the only form of incomes policy they don\u2019t rule out is the most arbitrary and unfair of all, namely a complete wages freeze. Things will be allowed to let rip and then the brakes will be slammed on so that the wheels lock and the passengers - that is all of us - are thrown to the floor.There is no such thing as industrial relations, only human relations applied to industry. And they are appallingly bad in Britain. Whether it be in The Times newspapers or ITV or manufacturing industry we seem to be incapable of introducing new technology in a co-operative, efficient and commonsense atmosphere.At Hunterston the new £100 million investment in the oil terminal has lain unused while two unions battle for the allocation of just sixty jobs. These are scandalous breakdowns in human relationships which as a nation we simply cannot afford and which sap our morale as well as our economy.Here we must look again as Liberals at individual responsibility. It is no good waiting for the trade union movement as a body to reform itself centrally. Jim Prior is right to ask for certain modest reforms on secon­dary picketing and the closed shop but it is really not much use arguing endlessly with the central union leadership. They have become yet another group of out-of-touch bosses of giant institutions. The problems and the opportunities lie on the shop floor and in the branches. We need demo­cratic and decentralised unions.If you want a classic illustration of the difference between the Liberal approach to the greater distribution of wealth and power in society and the Socialist approach to the same end, you can find it in the argu­ment which ended the Danish coalition government yesterday. The Labour and Liberal partners had agreed on the objective of greater industrial democracy and the sharing of profits.But the Socialists wanted 10% of company profits to be set aside and paid into a fund to be administered by the TUC, the kind of industrial democracy favoured by Tony Benn in which corporate big brother knows best.The Liberals would have welcomed a scheme rather like ours where a percentage of the profits of a company are made available to the employees who helped create it.The objective is the same but the paths chosen have very different results. One leads to centralised socialist bureaucracy. The other gives people greater independence and involvement.We must press on with policies which encourage the maximum of harmony and co-operation plant by plant. It is no good trying to blame a minority of reds under the bed for hijacking their fellow workers into hastening the downfall of a free society. The blame lies just as much with the manager who doesn\u2019t manage and with the good decent trade unionist who having paid his union dues never bothers to turn up to a branch meeting - or stays silent when he should speak out.In housing, all the Tories offer us is the simplistic policy of selling houses to tenants. Nothing wrong with that in the right places, but far more serious are the human crises we have created, with private housing young couples can\u2019t afford, and with vast council estates administered from afar. Self-governing tenants\u2019 co-operatives must be the key to restor­ing self-respect, control and morale in these areas before it\u2019s too late and we find ourselves having to bulldoze more than just tower blocks.If we are to have a national spirit of co-operation the leadership, example and policies must come from parliament from the top as well as the grassroots. The Tories are just not capable of that.The second necessary quality in rebuilding Britain is a new spirit of thrift.I am glad this Assembly has made a start on debunking the idea which has dominated politics in my adult life that economic growth is an auto­matic cure-all.The fact of the matter is that in a world of finite resources high rates of annual expansion in the production of manufactured goods cannot continue indefinitely - and what is more, even if we wanted short-term economic growth, we aren\u2019t going to have it for some years.So instead of wringing our hands and saying \u2018if only\u2019 \u2013 let\u2019s face up to reality and start to adjust our economic and social priorities now. For instance both Right and Left in this country have hoped that continuing economic growth would allow them to avoid the awkward questions of the distribution of wealth and income. It\u2019s time we realised that an incomes policy and a philosophy of fair shares are not just a desirable extra but the key to holding our society together in the lean years ahead.A much better way of measuring our economic activity than crude calculations of growth is its effectiveness in using and re-using resources. This country has resources, natural, mineral and human. How well do we use them? - for waste is a real enemy of a stable and balanced society.Let me take energy first of all. Each successive oil crisis, like the advance symptoms of a heart attack gives us a warning. We are begin­ning to scrape the bottom of the treasure chest of stored energy accumu­lated over millions of years - and nearly exhausted by our civilisation over two centuries. In Britain we are relatively fortunate: oil, coal and gas give us a decade or two of extra breathing space.So what has been this Tory Government\u2019s reaction? Have they treated energy use as a priority? They have not. They have cut back 20% of the pitifully small budget on research into alternative clean energy sources. They have relied on price increases to cut back consumption of oil and petrol. They have done nothing about conservation except talk. The only positive movement has been a rush towards nuclear power which fills most civilised people with gloom and foreboding. Mrs Thatcher seems hell bent for Harrisburg. She insisted recently on having her photograph taken standing on top of a nuclear reactor core \u2018to show that it was quite safe.\u2019 The national debate on energy policy does not deserve to be treated in such a simplistic and trivial manner.What we must have instead of this mixture of inaction and rash impetuosity is a national energy plan for the rest of this century. It needs fuller information and democratic discussion but the main outlines are clear:First, a massive programme of conservation led and backed finan­cially by the Government, covering factories, offices and homes. According to a Parliamentary Answer I received just before the recess, 60% of council houses have no loft insulation and 29% have unlagged hot water tanks.Second, an expansion of energy-efficient public transport rather than its continuing run down. Third, large scale research and development into clean and renewable resources like wave, wind and sun.Fourth, a careful development of the coal industry as both extraction and burning techniques are improved. Fifth, a halt to the dangerous and unbelievably costly expansion of the nuclear industry.To develop a really imaginative plan along these lines which everyone can understand and play their part in would be a major step towards a thrifty and resource conscious society.Then there is the basic question of food supply. The petro-chemical age of agriculture with its indiscriminate destruction of nature has passed its peak. This means that we shall need to employ more people in growing food and to find more productive acreage as well. I saw for myself on a hill farm in Roxburghshire last week how barren land can be dramatically improved. We also need more smallholdings and allotments on derelict city sites and, perhaps most important of all, a halt to the seizing of prime agricultural land for endless urban development.As the North Sea oil bonanza runs out we shall have desperate trouble paying our way in the world. Any responsible government must ensure that our long-term food supply is secured with less dependence on imported food.The examples of waste are legion: the elaborate plastic packaging, the derelict sites in cities, the flaring of gas on North Sea rigs, the queues of cars each with one occupant, the washing machines that have to be replaced because they cannot be repaired. But there is one form of waste which makes me angry above all other.It is the waste of young lives in the dole queue. I find absolutely intolerable the attitude of free-market Conservatives who cynically see the unemployed as the necessary casualties of industrial war. Unemploy­ment could even rise to two million next year. We just cannot accept that.Of course employment is affected by the level of industrial activity, but it is affected far more by technology and industrial organisation. As Liberals we believe that more local enterprises on a smaller scale would not only provide a more satisfactory way of life but would produce more jobs as well.And isn\u2019t it time we faced up to a shorter working week, not as a way of creating phoney overtime but to make us all shorter-time workers instead of having two classes, the employed and the rejected. More time to grow food, more time to improve our homes, more time for our children, more time for continuing education, more time for recreation, the arts or sport. These are all part of a full and satisfying life, just as work itself should be.A thrifty country, one that uses and conserves its resources carefully and efficiently - its energy, its materials, its land and above all its people - could be stable and self-sustaining. A wasteful society such as ours is destined for the scrap heap.The third quality required in Britain today is a spirit of common humanity.In Northern Ireland the religious and political divisions represent a fundamental denial of that spirit. Since the problem of Ireland has be­devilled all British Governments in varying degrees for centuries it would be foolish to pretend that there is any instant solution. Our troops have been ten years in Ulster. In fairness to them we cannot contemplate a further ten years without any new political initiative. Sadly the recent talks between Mrs Thatcher and Mr Lynch appear to have concentrated on the important but in my view secondary question of security. If the men of violence are to be defeated the politicians must show greater imagination.There needs to be a new element introduced into the situation which has become rigid, with all the participants including Britain locked in fixed positions. Our common membership of the European Community should be used to move both parts of Ireland towards reconciliation. If the European Community is to be more than just a common market, as we believe it must, here is a great opportunity for it to live up to its name.Tomorrow the Pope arrives in Ireland. Let us hope it will mark the beginning of a genuine attempt by everyone to isolate the evil men by creating there this spirit of common humanity.Such a spirit is also glaringly absent in the field of race relations.One of the nastier elements in the Conservative manifesto, repeated in the Queen\u2019s Speech, was the pledge to tighten up the immigration laws, odious and Draconian though these already are. It was appalling to read of the Patel children deported from this country although their mother is a British citizen, because she in desperation had brought them in without entry papers.A white British mother doesn\u2019t need entry papers for her children or have to watch them deported. So what hypocrisy it is for the Tories to say that once here everybody is treated equally and to proclaim the virtues of family life when the Government's own legislation discriminates and imposes such appalling hardships and division on so many families.I have always had a very strong view of the right and responsibility of the individual MP to protect his own constituents. Naturally MPs find themselves disturbed and distressed at the harsh treatment of their con­stituents under the arbitrary immigration rules. Now the Junior Minister at the Home Office, Mr Raison, says he is contemplating removing the right of MPs to intervene in such cases because they cause too much work for him and his department.I have a perfect solution to this self-created problem - abolish these harsh rules and his overworked department may perhaps find some better work to do.In July, eleven Anglican Bishops, including the new Archbishop of Canterbury, issued a remarkably courageous and compassionate statement. They openly stated that Mrs Thatcher\u2019s remarks about immigration \u2018had the effect of fanning racial prejudice.\u2019 The Bishops then went on to say:'Existing legislation already strikes at the root of the family life of our coloured brethren. Further legislation can in the end only degrade the society which demands and enacts it even more than it does its victims.'But the only response that Mrs Thatcher and her Government are likely to have to what Bishop David Sheppard of Liverpool has called \u2018the hurt cries of the shut-out people\u2019 is to increase their suffering. But we in this Party must keep ourselves endlessly aware of them, and we pledge ourselves to fight unceasingly here for them and for all those who have no-one to fight on their behalf.In an article written just before the election, Professor Michael Dummett had this to say about the Conservatives:'Their policies fill me with alarm, but it is their instincts that I distrust the more; their instincts are always to favour the fortunate over the unfortunate, the important and respectable over the down­trodden and those of little account. Britain under the Conservative Government is likely not only to be a bitterly divided nation, but one that can be counted on to be on the side of injustice in almost every international dispute, and will earn even more merited hatred for being so.'All that Professor Dummett has to say about the instincts of the Tory Party has been amply borne out not just in race relations, but in the way their slashing of public expenditure cuts beyond the fat and deep into the muscle of our Welfare State. It was seen too in their belated and nig­gardly response to the desperate plight of the refugees from Vietnam and Kampuchia.And what supreme folly it is to make the miserable cuts in expen­diture on the work abroad of the British Council and the overseas service of the BBC, at a time when we are supposed to be fighting the battle for the minds of men.Even more squalid has been the cut of £50 million from Overseas Aid in the last Budget - to be balanced in exactly the way Professor Dummett describes, by huge tax reliefs to the wealthiest members of society.Truly the Prime Minister has reversed the words of the Magnificat. She has filled the rich with good things and the hungry she has sent empty away.So these three qualities are needed from our national leadership, a spirit of co-operation, of thrift and of common humanity. I said during the election that I believed neither the Tory nor the Labour Party was capable of solving the country's problems on its own. Neither of them is capable of adopting the sort of forward-looking national approach I have just described which cuts right across our industrial and social divisions.Everything that has happened since the election has proved the point. Conservative policy has not been established in a spirit of co­operation, it has not shown a spirit of thrift, and it is conspicuously short on common humanity. Conservatism has very soon come back to its essentials: greed and fear. Greed for the powerful and pushy - fear for the rest.If you earn £20,000 a year or you want to buy a villa in Spain or you are a speculator in agricultural land, this has been a good year for you. If on the other hand you are an average family trying to make ends meet it has got worse and worse. This winter it will get worse still unless you happen to be a member of a powerful union with an open invitation from the Tories to join the free-for-all. It\u2019s a far cry from the easy promises of that slick Tory advertising in the run up to the Election.So once again the national welfare is sacrificed to the ideology of one \u2018side\u2019 in the class war. And yet Ministers keep claiming they have a mandate:A mandate for 17% inflation.A mandate for widespread national bankruptcy.A mandate for higher unemployment.A mandate for selling off our national assets.Each successive divisive and dangerous policy is justified by this claim of a mandate from the people. It has a nice legal ring about it, but it is a fakeHave the Conservatives forgotten that this Tory Government has less public support than any other Tory Government since the war - and each one of them was elected by a minority?Have the Conservatives forgotten that their Parliamentary majority only exists because of a fraudulent and discredited electoral system?Mrs Thatcher used to be very eloquent about the iniquities of Socialism imposed on the country with the support of only 29% of the electorate. Presumably her 33% makes all the difference. She should stop waving her phoney mandate at us.She would do better to search for policies that have national support. But of course she will not. The best we will get out of this Government are some desperate U-turns when things go wrong.It is more and more apparent that we shall have to be standing by with a genuine alternative, around which all the sensible and progressive forces in Britain can unite.Right wing dogmatism supported by a public minority and backed by one vested interest is not going to succeed.Neither can left wing doctrines backed by another minority and another vested interest. They\u2019ve both been tried and found wanting.It is only by collecting together a new majority free from these class interests that we will have a Government with the strength to shake Britain out of the long record of post-war decline and introduce the necessary reforms.After the election I received very many letters. Overwhelmingly they supported our willingness to co-operate with other Parties in the national interest. We obviously struck a chord in an electorate which has become understandably suspicious of partisan politicians.The willingness is still there on our part. But our electoral system again and again allows Tory and Labour minorities to seize power without constructing a proper majority for their programme. Time is running perilously short. The whole political and economic situation continues to deteriorate.I believe that we must respond. In the past we have shown that we can be a responsible junior partner moderating extremism. But now we can and we must do more.We have to be the basis for developing the political and economic alternative which the country so badly needs. We have to provide a rally­ing point on the high ground of politics for all those weary of the swamps. We have to accept that the gravity of the situation needs more than just Liberal participation. It needs Liberal leadership.But that puts a heavy responsibility upon the Party. It means looking outward - it means bringing together men and women of goodwill, whatever their political persuasion in the past, who want to join with us in this historic task. We must be more than a Party, preoccupied with our own welfare. We must be the focus for a great movement of reform.We have to bring together this new majority. All those who will walk with us on this road are our friends and allies. We must get organ­ised. We must make them welcome.We have to recreate the great coalition of idealists, progressives and radicals which supported and sustained the Liberal Party of our grand­fathers. We have to bring together into one political movement those on whom the Labour Party has turned its back: the poor, the unemployed, the libertarians driven by opposition to socialism into the Conservative camp, and from the other side the moderates whose ideas the Conser­vative leadership has now decisively rejected. We have to gather in, as well, the trade unionists who want co-operation rather than confrontation in industry; those up and down the country creating new forms of co­operative enterprise; the new generation in the professions, in education, in the social services: and all those who care for our environment and our cultural heritage. Many of our natural allies are at present outside the boundaries of conventional politics, working in voluntary organisations, community bodies, and campaigning groups. I say to them: we are on the same side, let us work together.This new majority is searching for new policies, free from the narrow­ness of class and dogma. New policies but based on old values. The values of freedom and brotherhood. They want a society they can be proud to pass on to their children, where every man and every woman can lead life to the full. A life in which the secrecy, mistrust and bitterness of modern Britain is banished - and fear is replaced by hope. We should not hesitate to be ambitious. This Party has changed a great deal in the last three years. We\u2019ve learned a lot about hard politics.Some people have still to recognise the change. A well intentioned editorial this week expressed gratitude that the Liberals were around because we would keep the Tories on their toes. But that\u2019s not our func­tion. I don\u2019t want the Liberal Party to be just the political equivalent of going jogging.Putting over the Liberal case is not always easy. Like all of you, I have an occasional sense of exasperation bordering on despair. It must have shown fleetingly in a broadcast interview I gave in the exhaustion of the day after the General Election. Suddenly I received an avalanche of hundreds of encouraging letters from some of you in this hall and from complete strangers outside the Liberal Party. I was moved. I was grateful. I was encouraged. I\u2019d like to finish by quoting just one of these from a fourteen year old Manchester schoolgirl:'Please don\u2019t give up now. Keep fighting. You can still win. I know I\u2019m not the only one who is fed up with the insulting two party slanging match that goes on in this country. We rely on you to stop this and put us back on the rails. In five years I may be up there fighting with you. I hope this letter has not wasted too much of your valuable time. Lots of love to both you and your wife and family.'Then she added as a PS some words of an American President:'Nothing in this world can take the place of persistence. The watch­word \u2018press on\u2019 has solved and always will solve the problems of the human race.'That young girl unwittingly echoed the magnificent call of W.E. Gladstone:'Be inspired with the belief that life is a great and noble calling; not a mean and grovelling thing that we are to shuffle through as we can, but an elevated and lofty destiny.'My message is press on. Ours is a great and noble calling.

aVThe predominant mood of this Assembly has been confidence. This has been a good year for the Liberal Party. Nothing spectacular, but a year of solid advance. It has been the most successful post general election year we have had in modern times. After each of the previous half dozen general elections the Party has gone into decline for a year with dropping by-election votes and slipping opinion poll ratings. This post general election year saw our share of the poll rise substantially in all three Parliamentary by-elections, our poll ratings steady at around the 14% we polled last May, instead of dropping into low single figures. We had 76 net gains in the local elections in May, and in the four months since then we have won 15 seats in local government by-elections.So the answer to Cross-bencher\u2019s rhetorical question in this week\u2019s Sunday Express \u2018Is Mr. David Steel brim-full of bounce as he packs his bags for this week\u2019s Liberal Assembly?\u2019 is yes, certainly.I\u2019ve long since ceased to be amazed at our pre-assembly press coverage. One popular daily in its editorial said we had \u2018become the invisible men.\u2019 Now in the last six weeks of the Parliamentary session the Liberal MPs launched three debates on major issues in the Commons, on the Trident missile programme, on incomes policy and on the plight of small businesses. In the first two the official Opposition stayed away. And how much coverage did the popular press give to our debates? Precious little. One of the more insidious features of life under this Tory Government is the way in which the efforts of journalists to report our activities are frustrated. With a peerage to a proprietor here and a knighthood to an editor there the popular press is seduced into slavish obedience to the Tory line.This year Jo Grimond and Donald Wade each celebrate 30 continuous years\u2019 service to the Liberal Party in Parliament. What a transformation they have witnessed in the strength of the Liberal Party over that period and how greatly they have contributed to it; from being the remnant of the once great party of government (scoring only 2½% of the votes in a general election), to being the spearhead of a new and vital radical movement to change the shape of British politics.Let me dwell on our internal affairs for just a moment longer. It has taken three years of hard work by the party officers and our greatly reduced and overworked staff at headquarters but we have now ended the long period of deficit financing and we now face the public as the only one of the three major parties financially in the black.But there is no time for complacency. We will need to expand our organisation. So I want every constituency to take fund raising seriously but at least we can do so knowing that money raised is being put to good use and not for the demoralising objects of paying debts or reducing overdrafts.In other words, Mr. President, the Liberal Party in 1980 is poised in better shape, politically, financially, organisationally, to make the breakthrough which we believe must come during this Parliament.And never was the strong voice of Liberalism more required as we look at the state of Britain a year after the new Conservative Government took power. What I warned during the general election would happen, has happened. But the nation - or to be more accurate 32% of our people - decided to take the Tory gamble, and how bitterly many now repent it.The central issue in British politics in the next twelve months must be how to rescue the economy.Each of the three Parties has its own analysis of Britain\u2019s underlying economic problems. The Conservatives see the problem as too much state intervention and seek to bring back a free market model of capitalism. The Labour Party sees it as the failure of the mixed economy and prescribes state socialism behind high tariff walls. The Liberals see it differently. Why when the world catches a cold do we get pneumonia? Our crisis is peculiar to Britain. It is caused by the failure of our political system and the inadequacies of our political and industrial leadership. That is why we assert, as we did in last year\u2019s election manifesto, that \u2018economic and industrial recovery can only follow from a radical programme of political and social reform.\u2019The Conservatives\u2019 management of the economy in the last year has been ill-informed and incompetent. They\u2019ve said that their entire economic policy depends on control of the money supply. Yet in two months they\u2019ve used up their own target of a year\u2019s growth in money supply and so their policy lies in ruins.And Sir Keith Joseph was reported in the Financial Times as \u2018amazed\u2019 and \u2018incredulous\u2019 when he heard from his German opposite number that the German Government intervenes to support its own very successful industry. Here in Blackpool I met a deputation of workers from the apparently doomed Bowater newsprint plant at Ellesmere Port. It isn\u2019t just a case of losing 1500 jobs directly and up to 5000 indirectly because of this closure. If it goes ahead it will mean that in future only 4% of our country\u2019s newsprint will be made in Britain. Why? Partly because their competitors in Canada and Sweden have governments who believe in cheap energy prices for industry. Our own Government\u2019s slavish attachment to non-intervention is directly and permanently destroying parts of our economy.They have been selling off our public assets and closing down the private ones. A few years ago Ted Heath described asset stripping as \u2018the unacceptable face of capitalism.\u2019 I tell you where you\u2019ll find the nation\u2019s asset strippers now - round the Cabinet table in No. 10. How many Conservatives today faced with these grim economic theorists must sigh for the days when a Tory Prime Minister sat in a corner playing quietly, with his matchsticks. At least Sir Alec never threatened to burn down the house.The Labour alternative, of more public ownership and increased state control, is only the reassertion of an old solution which has failed before. They put all our problems down to the failings of the Keynesian mixed economy. That\u2019s astonishingly parochial. Has the mixed economy failed in Germany, or in France, or in Holland? Of course not.I believe that in the long run, we will not reverse Britain\u2019s economic and industrial decline without far-reaching political change. That\u2019s why a more democratic Parliament and a more open political system are central planks in the Liberal platform.But our immediate problems in Britain are so severe that their redress must start alongside political reform.We need an urgent programme of the kind called for at this Assembly to tackle unemployment. It will need positive government measures, not lectures. The Prime Minister\u2019s response to the unemployed in South Wales - let them move house - deserves to go down in history alongside \u2018let them eat cake\u2019 as one of the most callous failures by those in power to understand the problems of ordinary people.Time and again when I look at Mrs. Thatcher\u2019s personal direction of the policies of this government she reminds me of a First World War general. She has the determination to pursue her objectives at whatever human cost, and to go on pursuing them as the casualties mount and in defiance of all the evidence that the strategy has collapsed. It\u2019s not her courage that I question. It\u2019s simply her judgement.All of us as politicians naturally draw heavily on our own personal experience of life, but we have an obligation to examine and try to understand and sympathise with those who endure difficulties we never had ourselves. Because Mrs. Thatcher had the good fortune and undoubted ability to transform herself from a prosperous grocer\u2019s daughter in Grantham to an even more prosperous barrister in Chelsea does not mean that most of the nation can live the same way. How can she say to the unemployed school leavers on the street corners in Liverpool \u2018you\u2019ve priced yourselves out of a market\u2019? How can she grasp the very different problems of the one-parent families, the racially persecuted, the disabled or the squalor of our overcrowded prisons? She cannot understand them because they fall outside her own narrow experience of life.In a penetrating analysis a few months ago, the Scotsman journalist Julie Davidson wrote: \u2018When I asked her if she would feel any sense of historical responsibility towards women as the first woman Prime Minister she pondered politely then said: \u201cI think it will do a great deal for women at the top.\u201d Not women at the bottom, or in the middle, take note, but women like Mrs. Thatcher, dedicated meritocrats, who feel that there is no special disadvantage in being poor, black or female.\u2019Liberals reject such an attitude. While of course encouraging the strong, we believe it to be the duty of the Government to intervene to protect the life of all its citizens as skilfully as possible. In the short run the Government must adopt a programme to cut unemployment and revive our sick economy without feeding inflation. We demand action immediately in six areas:First, increase public investment where jobs will result and at the same time our basic infrastructure could be improved, for example, in the track and rolling stock of British Rail, in selective road by-pass building, in insulating houses and offices, in the coal board, and in a trial tidal barrage scheme such as the Severn to produce pollution-free power.Second, cut the level of the pound by reducing the bank rate and help business by introducing a two tier interest rate. If she won\u2019t listen to small businesses, at least let her listen to the CBI today.Third to encourage more youth employment, cut the employers\u2019 national insurance contribution for all those employed under the age of 21 and greatly expand both the public and private industry training programmes.Fourth, start a \u2018Buy British\u2019 campaign and give the lead by legislating this session for the clear marking of the country of origin of all imported goods.Fifth create without delay the machinery for a sustained policy on prices and income increases, including a rapid expansion of profit sharing schemes throughout industry.Sixth construct in every local authority area new plants to recycle and re-use waste materials such as metal, paper and glass.All of this is short term and immediate and it will require some government expenditure. But it will be much less wasteful than the 8 billion pounds which our present 2 million unemployed are costing the exchequer. It is a far better and more constructive alternative to the do nothing policies of the present government.But there are two basic longer term changes which Britain requires. The first is the introduction of widespread industrial partnership and the breaking down of the class divisions which bedevil not just industry, but housing, education, and the health service. I need not dwell on this at length in a Liberal Assembly but it is of crucial importance because these class barriers are reinforced by the other two Parties.The second is the structural modernisation of our economy using the one priceless and fortunate asset we have - North Sea Oil. Used properly this discovery will provide the transition from the old decaying economy to the new.We need not as Liberals be afraid of the new technology. Given the right provision of telecommunications an increasing amount of work done in both the manufacturing and service section of the economy could be performed in local shops or even at home. The scope for decentralisation becomes enormous. Even the obstacles to financial devolution for Scotland and Wales encountered by the last Government could be overcome. But this Government is timid in its investment in the micro-processor.It also sees North Sea Oil revenues in terms of tax cuts to win the next election. Liberals used to sing \u2018God gave the land to the people.\u2019 Why not \u2018God gave the oil to the people\u2019?The oil proceeds should be taken out of the Chancellor\u2019s annual piggy bank budget and used as a national development fund to invest in industrial modernisation, in education and in training.Such a major shift in public economic policy cannot be achieved without a major change in the political philosophy ruling our fortunes. But it is a real and better alternative to our present drift.We\u2019ve heard a lot of loose and dangerous talk from both left and right in the past year about \u2018conviction politics,\u2019 the need for confrontation and the end of consensus. Both sides insist, in extreme language, that there is no alternative to their policies - monetarist or Marxist.I want to remind you and them of the underlying principles upon which democratic politics must be founded. Democratic government must rest upon consent. Governments should persuade, not bully. This Government did not gain the consent of a majority at the ballot box. All the more reason to try and find policies which command public support.Yet like the last Labour Government, the Conservatives have hastily tried to bulldoze their manifesto proposals through within their first year - refusing consultation or compromise.What every democrat should really object to is the Government\u2019s explicit rejection of persuasion and compromise as a way of carrying the electors along with its policies. In Venice the Prime Minister said \u2018dialogue is not a word I like very much.\u2019 That\u2019s the problem. We have a Government which hectors - and an electorate which has decided not to listen. Every PM dictates the style of his or her administration. In this respect, I noted with interest the comments of the interviewer at ICI at Runcorn in 1948, who rejected the lady in her application for a job. \u2018This woman is headstrong, obstinate, and dangerously self-opinionated.\u2019 I must confess to a sneaking admiration for anyone who can remain utterly consistent over 30 years.This passion for confrontation in politics and industry is destructive and dangerous. It threatens to tear apart our social and economic fabric. The logic is inescapable. Violent language eventually provokes violent action. If government by consent is deliberately ruled out all that remains is government by coercion. The fine rhetoric of Tory spokesmen on law and order could turn bitter in their mouths if their political intolerance and economic callousness end up provoking direct action and protest on the streets.It is one of the worst evils of our political structure that it has encouraged such intolerance, to a point where in both the established Parties \u2018moderation\u2019 is considered weakness, \u2018reform\u2019 useless - where ministers and opposition spokesman now talk loosely of revolution and counter-revolution.Democratic government depends upon a careful balance between the three fundamental principles of liberty, equality and fraternity. This has been the core of the Liberal tradition, the basis for the consensus of liberal democracy which the ideologues of the Conservative and Labour Parties would now like Britain to reject.The Conservative Party claims to be committed to liberty above all. But theirs is a narrow and crabbed view of liberty, confined to economic freedom and the removal of the government\u2019s protective role in helping the poor and underprivileged. This new Conservatism explicitly rejects any concern for social justice and equality, any element of compassion for those not tough enough or lucky enough to survive in their Darwinian world.This ludicrous pre-occupation with the economic theories of last century completely ignores the positive role of the modern civilised state in providing what the Liberal Party Constitution calls the \u2018conditions of liberty\u2019 the freedom from want and from fear which Conservative policies are doing their best to recreate.Therein lies the basic fallacy of the new Conservative economics. It is a Victorian philosophy fitted only for a Victorian age. The free market philosophers did not have to cope with a world so dependent on oil that it is dislocated when OPEC bumps up oil prices; in which there are huge industrial corporations, many of them multi-national; in which trade unions have monopoly bargaining power; in which most governments subsidize food production; in which many government produce deliberate cheap energy policies for their industries against whom we have to compete. That is the real world of the 1980s. Britain requires a government whose policies face today\u2019s realities, not one which pretends they don\u2019t exist because the facts are inconsistent with their theories.Of course, there is an acceptable alternative to present Government philosophy - but it is not found in the official Opposition. The Labour Party emphasises its commitment to equality. A narrow view of equality, by and large, imposed and administered by central government. Labour politicians generally show less and less concern for liberty as a principle which must temper the pursuit of equality. Theirs was the Government which included a freedom of ­information bill in their manifesto; then in office they entirely concealed from Parliament and people their expensive decision to upgrade Polaris. The Tories have merely followed with the monstrous extravagance of the Trident missile proposals. The Labour Party\u2019s approach to public housing, to education, to trade unions and industrial relations, all place a high value on collective uniformity and bureaucratic control and pay little attention to individual wishes or the right of minorities to dissent.Their attitude to representative democracy itself is ambivalent and restrictive, both within their own Party, and in their resistance to all constitutional reforms except abolishing the second chamber. Their national executive\u2019s mid­term manifesto actually proposes a general nationalisation enabling act which would allow any future Labour minister to nationalise any industry by parliamentary order in an hour and a half.Many in the Labour Party are waiting to see what will happen at their conference. If the left further entrench their takeover some will find it no longer possible to stay. But I predict that that is not what will happen. Rather I believe that there will be a fudged compromise allowing the left to continue its attempts to control the Labour Party while those of publicly proclaimed tender conscience will be enabled to remain within it in the hope of picking up places in the next Labour Cabinet. All of this will be achieved by the undemocratic device of the Trade Union block vote at the conference. This will increase still further the financial and political hold which a handful of trade union leaders would have over any future Labour government.As Mr. Terry Duffy put it succinctly a few weeks ago, speaking of the divide among politicians in the Labour Party: \u2018At the end of the day the politicians have to remember that the unions are the paymasters - we pay the bill.\u2019How appropriate that the Labour Party\u2019s national executive should propose that the Trades Unions should have 50% of the votes in a new electoral college to elect the party leader. Why not give them 100% and recognise the reality that the Labour Party is becoming their wholly owned subsidiary?At the TUC Conference Mr. Callaghan called for the co-operation of the trade union movement in a prices and incomes policy for five years. Now I share his view of the need for such a policy, and of course any sensible government will seek the co-operation of the trade unions in it. But what is not tolerable in a free democratic society is that the contents of such a policy should be dictated by, or vetoed by, any one organisation in the state, however powerful. A Government representing a majority of the people and responsible to a freely elected parliament must be the final authority on any such policy.But the Labour Party is now in hock and that is why I believe that whatever happens at the forthcoming Labour conference the result will be profoundly illiberal and unacceptable.Neither of the two adversary parties cares much at all for fraternity. The Sunday Telegraph comparing Mrs. Thatcher to Ronald Reagan, rhapsodised on how each derived their strength and support from the expanding South, rejecting the urban and industrial areas of the North in their respective countries. What a way to divide Britain; to recreate two nations. As for Labour - the pursuit of the class war, with brotherhood for some and hostility for the rest, is becoming a more and more central part of the Socialist orthodoxy. And for both parties, brotherhood stops at the water\u2019s edge. Labour\u2019s deep veins of chauvinism and xenophobia come to the surface in their suspicions of everything European; while the Conservatives embrace Europe only at the expense of the Third World and the problem of world poverty.The inhuman and niggardly reaction of this government to the far reaching proposals of the Brandt report is not just a national but a global scandal. Our performance at the current UN special assembly on world development has been shameful and alone among EEC countries we are reducing our aid at a time the plight of the Third World is growing worse. But how can we expect a party which fails to practise brotherhood in this country to extend it elsewhere?We have incorporated into our legislative system discrimination which is blatantly and solely based on the colour of a person\u2019s skin; legislation which divides families, separates elderly parents from their children, discriminates against coloured British women as opposed to white British women, and then the Home Secretary talks about everyone lawfully here being treated equally and the Conservatives prate about the sanctity of family life. This is hypocritical and they know it.Obnoxious legislation is enacted and people like the wretched Filipino women workers soon find themselves in some technical breach of it. The government is making things worse by publishing a nationality white paper extending institutionalised racialism still further.This institutionalised racialism now pervades the whole field of race relations. Thanks to the infamous 1971 Immigration Act, the police have power to question and arrest anyone whom they suspect of being an illegal immigrant - this has led to the notorious fishing expeditions where British citizens, lawfully settled here for many years, find themselves in police cells until, and sometimes even after, they have produced their passports or other documents.Mr. Whitelaw may say that there is no need for any coloured person to carry his passport, but faced with the humiliating possibility of questioning, many now feel obliged to do so. A West London magistrate last month made adverse comment on the fact that a 22 year old student was arrested at 3 o\u2019clock in the morning and wrongly held in custody for three days because of a mistake on a Home Office computer. This is a disgrace in a civilised community.Now in spite of an all-Party recommendation to do so the Government is trying to wriggle out of abolishing the SUS laws. These are harmful both to community relations and to the image of the police, for whom it is utterly wrong to have such power.We have heard a great deal in recent weeks about the right of free speech in connection with National Front Marches. The right of free speech is one which is very dear and rightly so to all Liberals, but there is a right that must be dearer, and that is the right of minorities, already under severe pressure, to live peacefully in their homes without having Neo-Fascist bully boys escorted by the police marching past their homes shouting their hate-filled slogans and terrifying their wives and children.That is not free speech - that is Nazism and must be resisted by applying all the legislation that exists to ban such provocative activities, so that the terrible experience of Southall is never repeated. And to those who would say that this is not being liberal I would say that we have to avoid the danger of being tolerant in principle when other people are paying the price in terms of human suffering.But what can we expect of a Government led by someone who draws from the parable of the Good Samaritan the somewhat novel interpretation - and I quote her exact words: \u2018No one would remember the Good Samaritan if he\u2019d only had good intentions - he had money as well.\u2019The parable of the Good Samaritan is nothing to do with money - it is about a despised outsider showing love and compassion when supposedly respectable pillars of the community pass by on the other side.Let her try to understand the real lesson of the parable instead of trying to adapt it to her crudely materialistic political philosophy.There is a better and more wholesome alternative, and to all members of the ethnic minorities so cruelly intimidated and harassed I pledge my total and utter support, and that of every Liberal. We shall fight the obscenity of racialism wherever it presents itself inside Parliament or outside it.For Liberals, liberty can only be achieved within the context of a free and open society, in which there are no extremes of wealth or poverty, nor deep divisions of class, or religion, or race or creed.Constructive political leadership would work to generate popular consent, to bring people together; to change people\u2019s attitudes so that we can transform society. The Conservative and Labour leaderships are both turning their backs on these democratic truths. So it falls to the Liberal Party to reassert them, to bring them home to the electorate, and to persuade the men and women of Britain that this is the only basis which offers our impoverished and embittered society hope for the future.That\u2019s why I welcome the time and attention the Liberal Party has spent debating the foundation of our beliefs. It\u2019s right for a democratic party to step back, in the aftermath of a general election, to examine its values and their relevance to current problems, as a preparation for the next campaign. I\u2019m happy that we\u2019re able to do so constructively, rather than indulging in destructive infighting like the Labour Party.So there is an alternative, not just to the present Government but to a discredited system of politics.The question is \u2018How do we achieve it?\u2019 Or rather how do the people of Britain succeed in getting the alternative they so desperately need to the bankrupt policies of the past?I have no doubt that there is a substantial majority of our people in favour of the principles and policies I have outlined. We have to release that majority from the traps of the two doctrinaire parties in which they have been ensnared. We have to turn the commonsense majority into a new electoral majority.It will not be easy, but I believe our fate as a nation depends on it. It is our Party, the Liberal Party, which holds the key. It is we who have to call into being a whole new world of politics to redress the balance of the old. To all those of whatever persuasion who share our analysis we should wish success in their courageous efforts to break up the monoliths of the old parties. But they should also know that without Liberal leadership, a Liberal agenda and Liberal commitment their efforts are doomed. The trail of British politics is littered with the skeletons of well-intentioned breakaway groups who tried to go it alone. With us they could make a formidable contribution. Without us they will fail.We Liberals must develop our policies and put them forward vigorously as an alternative to the folly of this Government. The Tories say they will not change course but when they are heading straight for the rocks we say they must change course - even if it means dropping the pilot. Every parliamentary and council by-election must give them the same message. In particular the county council elections next year are the opportunity for people to demand a better future by electing more Liberals than ever before. Tory policies can and must be changed.But that in itself will be no more than another last-minute escape from disaster. Any long-term success for Britain depends on a far more fundamental change to our politics. It depends on stopping the ever more frantic swing between the two ever more desperate extremes. As John Stuart Mill wrote: \u2018When society requires to be rebuilt, there is no use in attempting to rebuild it on the old plan.\u2019That is why this Party must be more ambitious and self-confident than ever before. We must be able to offer the country at the next general election not just a Liberal minority influence but the prospect of a new government which will break this unrepresentative and divisive two party dictatorship once and for all.We intend to change the system of elections and government so that power is taken away from these two arrogant cliques and put back where it belongs in a democracy, in the hands of the people. We intend to reform industry too so that what is now a bitter battlefield becomes a prosperous partnership.Prime Minister, here is the alternative to what you are doing to our country.These are ambitious aims. It will need an effective, well-organised and adequately financed Party to realise them.To members of other Parties I want to say this. Break free from the past. It\u2019s time to think of the future. We need your help. Come and join us in this great task. We need many more thousands of enthusiastic workers and many more million voters. You could be one of them - and you could help find a new start for Britain working with us.To Liberals I say: go out and find new members and supporters and welcome them in. We must have an open door policy. I want to be quite candid with you. People are fed up with political parties. They hate the exaggerated promises and the easy way they are broken. They think the parties are narrow, smug and self-satisfied. They don\u2019t believe in parties who say \u2018we alone, have all the answers,\u2019 parties who are suspicious of newcomers. We must never be like that. We\u2019ve got to be different.While I want the Liberal Party now to be more ambitious, let us not be so arrogant and purist towards others who have come to share our vision of what could and should be that we behave like an exclusive club rather than give the lead to a broad radical movement. We must recognise that most of those who will join with us will have supported other parties in the past. Like many people in this hall they will have trod the hard path of disillusionment. It is up to us to give them hope - and the welcome to go with it. Let us say boldly to the people of our country at the next election:Ah the past is dark behind usStrewn with wrecks and stained with blood;But before us gleams the visionOf the coming brotherhood.If we can grasp the political initiative I believe the next general election could see the end of the old politics and the beginning of the new. I foresee a Liberal vote so massive and the number of Liberal MPs so great that we shall hold the initiative in the new Parliament. No government will be formed without us. I know that many unhappy MPs in the other parties will be ready to ally themselves with us once that moment comes.Liberals and their progressive allies would come together to form what the country has needed for so long. A Liberal-led government, a government of partnership and reconciliation, one which will judge greatness not in the outmoded terms of imperial grandeur, the pursuit of selfish and superficial wealth, but in terms of the excellence of our education, the quality of our compassion, the health of our country, the harmony of our industrial life, and above all the humanity of our society.By the next election we must give our people the chance they dearly want, the chance to elect a great government of national reform.

aVWhen we left Blackpool a year ago, it was in a mood of optimism and expectation. The year that has passed has fully justified that mood. The opinion polls during this year have been giving the Liberal Party our highest ratings since 1973; if you take poll ratings for the Liberal-Social Democrat Alliance these are far higher than those ever achieved by our Party alone since opinion polls were invented.And this year, we have enjoyed the greatest electoral advance of the Liberal Party since 1929, with the election of 400 councillors in every part of Britain and more victories every week. I congratulate all those who have contributed to that solid achievement. This has been an outstandingly good Assembly.  Don\u2019­t take my word for it, take George Gale in yesterday\u2019­s Daily Express: \u2018This is not only the best Liberal Party Assembly I have ever attended; it is the best Liberal Party I have encountered.\u2019 ­ Mind you, we\u2019­ll never convince some of the press.  Our optimism in looking forward to 1981 was not universally shared.  I give you this moving tale from \u2018Crossbencher\u2019­ of the Sunday Express:'Which politician peers into the future with most trepidation on this last Sunday of 1980?  Not Mrs Margaret Thatcher.  She is sure her policies will start to bear fruit in the coming year. Certainly not Mr Michael Foot.  He is convinced he is set firm to be the next occupant of Number 10.  Whose heart, then, is a-flutter with alarm?  I give you the Liberal Leader, Mr David Steel. Nothing, but nothing, is going Mr Steel\u2019­s way.  If ever there was a time, he knows, when the Liberals should be riding high, that time is now.  Yet gloomily he espies a steady slump, and that decline, he fears, could go from bad to catastrophic in 1981.'If the Liberal advance of 1981 can be described as catastrophic I hope Crossbencher will soon be telling us 1982 will be one long unmitigated disaster.\u2018The road over the last few years has certainly been a bumpy one\u2019It is five years since we were last here in Llandudno, when I made my first speech to you as the Party\u2019s new leader. What an extraordinary five years it has been for all of us. I\u2019ve been looking back to what I said then.'We are in being as a political party to form a government so as to introduce the policies for which we stand... I do not expect to lead just a nice debating society... we shall probably have - at least temporarily - to share power with somebody else to bring about the changes we seek ... I want the Liberals to be an altogether tougher and more determined force. I want us to be a crusading and campaigning movement, not an academic think-tank nor occasional safety-valve in the political system... the road I intend to travel may be a bumpy one, and I recognise the risk that in the course of it we may lose some of the passengers, but I don\u2019t mind so long as we arrive at the end of it reasonably intact and ready to achieve our goals.'The road over the last few years has certainly been a bumpy one. Life for the passengers has at times been very uncomfortable and worrying but we\u2019ve lost surprisingly few. Actually, life in the driving seat hasn\u2019t been all that smooth either. But you may have noticed we\u2019ve picked up some hitchhikers.Here again in Llandudno in 1981 we can see our party more tested, more organised, more mature and more prepared for the final electoral breakthrough.It is as well for our country that the Liberal Party is so ready. For just look at the state of the nation in 1981. We have the highest unemployment figures since the 1930s. We have an annual inflation rate, which in spite of two years\u2019 so-called priority fight against it, is nearly 12% and now rising again. This month\u2019s tax and prices index was announced this morning at 15%. We have a house-building rate which has sunk to its lowest level since 1948. In fact there are now more homeless people than when the Shelter campaign started. We have a commitment to the escalating costs of Trident which will make our expenditure on Concorde look like pocket money for Dinky toys. We have riots in our city streets with many young people, both black and white, feeling angry and shut out. The nation\u2019s tax burden has increased in the last two years, and yet our educational system is falling apart from the cuts in government expenditure. This government is so penny-pinching that it has even been prepared to cut back the overseas services of the BBC - in which we have justly taken world-wide pride for decades.It is a grim picture which Britain presents to the rest of the world in this last quarter of the twentieth century - tired, shoddy and mean-spirited - a picture made all the uglier because neither the government nor the official opposition hold out any prospect that they can solve our problems.Cabinet reshuffles cannot disguise the fact that this Tory government has proved a total failure. Our Prime Minister is a woman who has first turned her back on those who elected her and then had the nerve to claim that the people are behind her. Well, she still had seven per cent of them behind her at Warrington.Margaret Thatcher has portrayed herself as the nation\u2019s nurse administering nasty but necessary medicine in the belief that whatever short-term pain we may suffer, in the long run it will do us good. I am surprised that as a qualified chemist she seems to have forgotten the warning on every bottle: \u2018Caution, it is dangerous to exceed the stated dose.\u2019 When I listen to her I am reminded of Somerset Maugham\u2019s description of her predecessor Neville Chamberlain as \u2018sincere, no doubt, and honest, but muddled with self-conceit who put his party before his country, and by his ineptitude and stubbornness brought it to the verge of ruin.\u2019As for the Labour opposition, who should be riding high in the effort to turn out this government, they claim to be the party of brotherhood, but they seem to have taken their interpretation of it from the earliest biblical example - Cain and Abel. It doesn\u2019t really matter whether Denis Healey or Tony Benn is the bloodstained victor. Neither the bankrupt right nor the hard left of the Labour Party have anything to offer this country any more. Their slide downhill has gone too far. It is irretrievable and irrecoverable. The party\u2019s over.Michael Foot said the other day that if his party didn\u2019t come to its senses they would generate a decade of Thatcher government. But he\u2019s wrong, because at the next election we intend to provide the British electorate with a wider choice than that between the frying pan and the fire.It was inevitable that this 1981 Liberal Assembly should be dominated both by public debate and private discussion of our Alliance. This town used to be part of Lloyd George\u2019s constituency. Two years before the great Liberal landslide of 1906, the years which introduced the People\u2019s Budget, the old age pension, unemployment benefit, and the curbing of the powers of the hereditary Lords over the elected Commons, he gave advice which seems just as appropriate today two years or so before the next election. We have arrived at one of the most important stages in the history of the Liberal Party. I believe the future of this country largely depends upon the foresight, conviction, courage and devotion to principle of the Liberal Party during the coming years.Our debates have carried conviction, courage, principle and foresight in full measure in these last few days. The task of putting together our Alliance on the ground throughout the country is not going to be an easy one. We must secure a reasonable balance in our deployment of forces in every area. It will be immensely complicated. It will call for a high degree of vision, of trust and of forbearance both by our party and by the SDP.It will require trust between our two parties. The members of the SDP who have been here this week have been greatly impressed in their first close contact with the Liberal Party. They have also enjoyed the warmth of their welcome, and we were right to treat them kindly since they\u2019ve come from a broken home - the Labour Party. I hope they won\u2019t mind if I give them one piece of advice: as the ship of the Labour Party sinks, be careful and be discriminating about who you let clamber on board ours. Ours is a ship on a voyage of adventure. Don\u2019t let it become a lifeboat for those whose only real interest is saving their parliamentary or council skins.It will also require trust within our party. I want to thank you for the very considerable trust you have shown me in what I realise must at times have been a tortuous and anxious period. Now it is my turn to trust you as you proceed to give effect to our Alliance throughout the country. And I do trust you to make a success of it.The great reforming government I expect us to form with our Social Democratic alliesOur political situation is unique. Political parties normally seek to persuade the public to follow them. For the last few months the voice of the public as registered in the polls has been desperately pleading with our two political parties. Their message has been: \u2018get together for our sakes.\u2019 They know our country is at a low ebb. The years of mismanagement have destroyed confidence. Broken promises have bred cynicism. The taste of failure is sour and bitter. We don\u2019t simply face an economic slump in Britain. What we have to deal with is more complex, a crisis of a whole society which has lost its way and turned in upon itself.The challenge is daunting. It is a challenge to new leadership and new imagination. Four great tasks await the next government: industrial reconstruction - to get the factories, offices and workshops humming with activity again; social reconciliation - to bring together a people divided against each other and restore a sense of the common weal amongst all our peoples; a new constitutional settlement - which makes democratic and open self-government its guiding principle; an international role - which restores our influence abroad and makes us a force for peace and prosperity in the world. These are the four cornerstones of the great reforming government I expect us to form with our Social Democratic allies.Yes, government. You remember that truly remarkable speech on Tuesday by Jo Grimond. We felt the movement in the hall. But don\u2019t you feel the movement in the country? This Assembly has seen the Liberal Party discard its role of eternal opposition and face up to the realities of power. It is an awesome responsibility. Instead of criticising we must contribute. Instead of shouting on the sidelines, we must take over the game. For I tell you this. When our Alliance government takes office, it will represent the last, best hope for the British people. Our fellow citizens don\u2019t want another set of broken promises - followed by the usual search for scapegoats. They have seen enough of that from the Tory and Labour parties. They want honesty, commitment and imagination. Our Alliance can only succeed if it calls upon the greatest under-used resource of all, the people themselves. Our plan for recovery must depend upon creating a common purpose in which everyone has a part to play. That in turn depends upon us defining clearly what it is we are trying to achieve - and enlisting the help of every man and woman in these islands in our shared hope for the future.I turn first then to industrial reconstruction, for without that many of our other plans for Britain will remain but pieces of paper. First, an Alliance government will end the damaging nationalisation versus privatisation see-saw so beloved by the Labour and Tory parties. Our task will be to create conditions of maximum efficiency and morale in the public sector and maximum profit in the private sector, and to see each as complementary, not rival to the other. The remorseless trend towards unsuccessful merger, whether in the private or public sector, must be reversed. Smaller units can be more human, more imaginative and more profitable. The axiom that bigger is automatically better will find no place in the new government\u2019s industrial policy.Indeed, secondly, we must encourage the innovation of small businesses and co-operatives with positive fiscal discrimination in their favour. You remember the Tories\u2019 pledge to help small businesses? Experience has shown that the only sure way to run a small business today in Tory Britain is to start with a large one.Thirdly, in public spending we could reduce the waste of unemployment by selective forward investment on such essential items as our railways and telephone system and especially on home improvements which would help the building industry and increase our housing stock. I have in mind in particular the need to expand our programme of insulating buildings in the interests of saving energy. Far from saving energy, this government is determined to waste it. Already £500 million of North Sea gas has been burned off into the atmosphere. Another £25,000 million-worth is there to be exploited; and yet Mrs Thatcher has sacrificed the gas-gathering pipeline on the altar of the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement. That pipeline would have meant 3,000 jobs in British Steel, as well as assuring long-term supplies to British Gas and future revenue to the British government. What economic madness has gripped the Treasury, that it uses the revenues of North Sea oil to pay people not to work, but is incapable of devising a scheme which would not only put many of those people into work but would bring a profitable return to the Exchequer from one of the richest resources this country has ever possessed? This sheer waste of human and natural resources is downright immoral.It\u2019s the same story with the Severn barrage, which Liberals have long advocated. It was judged both feasible and economic in a study sponsored by the Department of Energy and published in July - which the government launched with a fanfare of one penny whistle. In contrast, Mrs Thatcher\u2019s nuclear obsessions continue to escalate in price, and the new Pressurised Water Reactor is sanctioned, while fears about safety remain unanswered.To change not just policies, but attitudesBut the fourth and greatest economic challenge for the Alliance government will be to change not just policies, but attitudes which have thwarted Britain\u2019s industrial progress. Remember the extraordinary levels of high productivity reached during the three-day week? Why do we assume that such successful communal effort is only possible in times of national adversity, be it war or power cuts? Labour and Tory governments have proved institutionally incapable of breaking down the class barriers which bedevil our country more than any other. 'If you live in what is probably the most advanced political democracy in the world, where individual freedom of thought and action is pursued and respected, how can you expect people to behave differently within the factory fence and office location? How can you expect that people will do things because you tell them to and not because they understand why?'These are not my words, but those of Sir Ray Pennock, President of the CBI, who is doing so much to try to change outdated attitudes there. But the next government must give a lead in creating a united and fulfilled commercial life in our country - and in this our proposed legislation for profit-sharing and industrial partnership has a major part to play. You remember the tax incentive scheme for employee shareholding we got through in 1978 in the Lib-Lab Pact? Well the figures for 1980-81 show that we've at least made a dent in the institutions domination of the stock market. We have increased by 25% the number of individual adults who own shares in Britain.Much more could be done to create harmony and therefore efficiency and therefore jobs. So, fifthly, I believe that one of our most important tasks in the next government will be not only to spread the sharing of increased wealth, but to relate our traditional policies of co-partnership to the difficult but crucial question of a prices and incomes policy. There is no need for us to get bogged down in a dispute between the merits of statutory versus voluntary policy. Clearly, we need to secure the widest national consent for it, but its operation must be flexible, not rigid, and adaptable to the different circumstances of different enterprises. If, for example, we recommend a policy involving tax incentives for organisations which settle within agreed guidelines, that is certainly both voluntary and flexible in character but would require statutory authority to operate.The importance of incomes policy in controlling inflation was the theme of a long study this summer by the American liberal economist J K Galbraith, in which he concluded: \u2018The purpose of an incomes and prices policy is to reduce the reliance on fiscal and monetary policy. Both of these work against inflation, but only as they create idle capacity and unemployment. It is one of Britain\u2019s great, useful and painful contributions to economic understanding that it has shown that this is not an economist\u2019s theory; it is a matter of practical experience.\u2019 The country is tired of being the unfortunate experimental model for Mrs Thatcher\u2019s economic advisers.The Tories said they could do without an incomes policy. Now they\u2019ve got a sort of policy, cobbled together like its predecessors; 4% for the public sector, fear of unemployment for the rest. We don\u2019t pretend that incomes policy is an ideal instrument of economic management. It is not. It involves difficult and frustrating negotiation. Its justification is not that it is agreeable. It is that incomes policy is far superior to unemployment and recession.Next I want to turn to the question of social reconciliation. There can be no reconciliation without a determined search for social justice. The other day Mr John Alderson, the Chief Constable of Devon and Cornwall, and incidentally formerly deputy commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, in a very courageous and forthright statement said: 'People who are poor and have a chip on their shoulders against society are inclined to say: \u201cI am getting nothing out of life so I am going to be angry.\u201d If society then says: \u201cOkay, you can get as angry as you like, but I have a well-paid fat-cat police force and if you get angry I shall just clobber you,\u201d then we are making a big mistake. One thing is certain - it is no answer to resort to brute force to try to control people.'Remember the havoc and terror caused by the police raids on Railton Road, Brixton, on 15th July, attacks which moved Lord Scarman to say the damage had caused him \u2018an immense amount of distress and that the question of compensation was no substitute\u2019? Remember that these attacks took place at 3 o\u2019clock in the morning, a time normally associated with totalitarian regimes and police states - the knock on the door in the night. The new Bishop of Southwark, whose diocese includes Brixton, said in the House of Lords: \u2018The way in which policing has been carried out in Brixton has been a major factor in the deterioration of the situation there.\u2019We must in the light of all this demand that police actions be made open to an independent complaints body, the present system having proved itself to be wholly and woefully inadequate. That\u2019s fair to the public and fair to the police. They have had a lot to put up with too. Much injury to our police in riots in London, Liverpool and Manchester was caused by outside agitators. I have no doubt that there are people whose main object is to exploit the grievances by fomenting unrest; but they could only have been successful because existing conditions were favourable for them. Mosquitoes can only breed if the water itself is already swampy and stagnant.I am against day-to-day police administration being interfered with by outsiders as some are advocating, but I do believe it is the task of the government in an elected parliament to lay down the broad policy for our policing - to choose between competing approaches - and I believe we should utterly reject the view of the secretary of the Police Federation that we should \u2018forget about the cosy image of Dixon of Dock Green.\u2019 The whole point of Dixon was that he knew and lived among the people he was policing, but you cannot resurrect Dixon of Dock Green if you have demolished Dock Green police station and retreated to centralised office blocks with motorised patrols.If community policing works in the city of Plymouth it can work elsewhere. In any case community policing is already practised successfully elsewhere - I've seen it in my own constituency, here in North Wales and even in a part of Liverpool. But I\u2019d like to see it everywhere. Liberals say put the policeman back into the community, not just as a law enforcement officer, but as a social leader working with the local people.\u2018You cannot dehumanise a whole section of society by taking away their rights\u2019But it isn\u2019t just policing or unemployment which we should blame for these disturbances. It\u2019s the attitude of successive governments, indeed in the end it\u2019s our own attitudes as well. Governments have propounded the myth that strict immigration laws are necessary for good race relations, whereas this is the exact reverse of the truth. Ever since the dishonourable Act of 1968, and the more squalid one of 1971 which gave the police the vast powers they now so wrongly have with regard to immigration matters, legislation has become steadily harsher, and very naturally community relations have equally steadily deteriorated. You cannot dehumanise a whole section of society by taking away their rights, dividing their families, subjecting them to police and bureaucratic interference and harassment, and then pretend as the Tories do - that great party of the family - that this is all done in the interests of good race relations.The new Nationality Bill has been brought in by this government very largely to satisfy the ugly side of the Tory Party and the nation - a side to which the Prime Minister herself has made a more than generous contribution. Yet when the clergy, who, being on the spot, are as good judges of the situation as any, voice their criticisms, they are immediately attacked by Tory MPs and the Tory press as \u2018trendy lefties\u2019 and told to go back to their task of preaching the Gospel. I noticed that during the debate on the Nationality Bill in the House of Commons, Tory racialism and Tory vituperation of the churches - to the great credit of the church - went hand in hand.Immigration itself is no longer the central issue. The era of massive immigration into Britain has clearly ended. An increasingly large proportion of the black and brown population of this country are native British, born and bred. We cannot allow them to grow up as second-class citizens. We need more positive action, in education, in employment, to ensure that they can enjoy the same range of rights and opportunities that the rest of us take for granted. A programme for citizen equality must begin with the rejuvenation of our inner cities, where so many of our more recent immigrant families still live; but must extend well beyond, to encompass recruitment and promotions within the government service, and encouragement for affirmative action in the private sector.The fight against racialism is one of the most important concerns of my political life, and I could not be a member of any Alliance that did not have as one of its major commitments not just the removal of present racist legislation, but a firm and unequivocal determination to establish racial justice, without which racial harmony is impossible.The third plank in the new government's platform will be constitutional reform. The British constitution was once a fertile source of inspiration for every nation which believed in democratic government and the rule of law. It stood for the will of the majority and the protection of minorities. That is so no longer. The source has dried up and we are left with barren institutions, ineffective and susceptible to take-over by arrogant minorities who want to impose their will on the rest of us.We need a new constitutional settlement - and I must tell you what an enormous cause of satisfaction it has been to me this year that our Social Democratic allies have come to share the Liberal prescription: the first step must be a genuinely democratic proportional representation system of voting. But we do not stop there. We need devolution of power to the regions and nations of Britain; an end to official secrecy; and far greater protection of the rights of the individual. We have to make real democracy work so well that the pretensions of the Labour left for whom democracy begins and ends with party membership are exposed for the power-hungry sham they are.A new constitutional settlement means freedom and democracy, but it also means better government, open, participative, and in touch with the people it represents. One of the aims of our constitutional settlement must be the reduction of government, not its increase - one of the fatal flaws in Labour's devolution schemes. This means recreating local government which the Tories seem hell-bent on destroying, first by their changes of 1973, and now by financial strangulation. We must be ready to reduce bureaucracy by streamlining local government, including the abolition of the metropolitan counties in England, the counties in Wales and creating single tiers out of the regions and districts in Scotland.Nor can we leave Northern Ireland in its acrimonious stalemate. We should take further some of the excellent ideas in our debate this week. Like the new Irish premier Garrett FitzGerald, we want to bring our islands closer together using the opportunities provided by our common membership of the European Community.This brings me to the fourth objective of the Alliance government, to restore our international influence.The European Community is wallowing in arguments about butter, fish and wine. My good friend and Liberal colleague, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the Foreign Minister of Germany, has put forward some imaginative proposals for reform. President Mitterrand\u2019s new administration, too, is formulating its ideas for a \u2018relaunching\u2019 of the European ideal. Yet this Tory government can only see the small change of Europe, not the wider vision. Britain ought to be a major influence on the development of Europe - and a united Europe should be a major influence for peace and security in our world. I applaud the European initiatives on the Middle East and on Afghanistan, but we should be doing far more as a Community to implement some of the major economic recommendations of the Brandt report.The Tories\u2019 attitude to the grim statistics of world poverty is an international disgrace. They are like the first-class passengers in the bow of a liner saying \u2018we\u2019re all right - it is your end of the boat that is sinking.\u2019 We can make no such divisions in our world. The decision to force up overseas student fees was an act of barbarism; in many parts of the world this year I found it one of the most short sighted and damaging from the point of view of Britain\u2019s own long-term economic and political interests.We have also failed to give united impetus in Europe to a new disarmament initiative. European Liberal leaders have made it clear that we must push the USA and the USSR towards nuclear disengagement. Of course, as we saw yesterday, Liberals have genuine and deeply felt differences on how we can best get disarmament. But if the Soviet Union can be persuaded to withdraw her SS20s, cruise missiles will not be required in Europe. That should be our objective over the next few years.Unfortunately, our Prime Minister too often gives positive tuition to President Reagan in cold-war rhetoric. It is time we got to grips with President Brezhnev, to get him to translate his fine-sounding speeches into positive actions to reduce the stockpile of terror in the world. For as Einstein once said, \u2018if the third world war is fought with nuclear weapons the fourth will be fought with bows and arrows.\u2019 Our commitment to collective western security in the defence of freedom must be maintained. The threat to Poland should remind us of the need for eternal vigilance. And our dedication to liberty means that we must oppose the indifference to human rights which the Reagan administration is showing by its support for such unsavoury regimes as those in South Africa and El Salvador.\u2018The expression of a profoundly moral view of human nature and its possibilities\u2019In selecting these four subjects for my address this year I am not of course attempting to detail all of Liberal policies. I welcome the publication of our mid-term programme, which does that far more adequately. What is important in our Alliance is that we are agreed on the main priorities for a new radical government, while each party is free to develop its own detailed policies.Liberalism is not just the creed of a political party. It is the expression of a profoundly moral view of human nature and its possibilities. For too long the Liberal values of tolerance, mutual respect and co-operation have been on the defensive against the zealots of right and left. Liberals themselves have sometimes been defensive, with the attitudes and concerns of a persecuted minority. There has even been a tendency to say: keep Liberalism out of politics.But that time is over. The relevance of Liberalism, which has sometimes been drowned out by the clamour of the extremists, is sharp and clear today. It is time to assert our Liberalism proudly - and nowhere more so than in this new Alliance. We must provide the heart and soul of the Alliance, proud of being Liberals and glad to work with those who have come to agree with us.The great debate we have had this week about our future has not just been of importance to the party, it has been of supreme importance to the country. There are those who say that the Liberals and Social Democrats are like two teams of people who find themselves on the summit of the same mountain, having got there from different starting places and by different routes. I am not sure that that analogy is entirely correct. Of course we have come by different routes, but I am not certain that the starting place wasn\u2019t in fact the same.Remember that the social democrats who worked within the Labour Party for years based their creation of the welfare state and the planned economy on the work of great Liberals like Beveridge and Keynes. Somewhere after we left our common starting point they lost their way. The Labour Party took the wrong path, to state socialism, bureaucracy, centralised controls and mandate by caucus - that perversion of democracy. But the social democrats have now found their way to rejoin us.Our Liberalism must be tolerant of those going through the travail of re-examining political allegiances often held since childhood. I was given a few weeks ago a set of leather-bound speeches of my great predecessor, William Ewart Gladstone. On his way to the historic Midlothian campaign he stopped at Hawick in my constituency and there delivered a short speech which with only a couple of words changed has an uncanny application to our party today: 'We are comrades in a common undertaking; we are fellow soldiers in a common warfare; we have a very serious labour to perform. The people of this country, and you among them in your place, have to consider what is the system upon which we ought to be governed. We should endeavour to bring about a great and fundamental change in regard to those dangerous novelties which have of late been introduced into the policy of this country, which have disturbed the world at large, and which have certainly aggravated the distress of the nation at home. I believe that in our efforts to return to the sound and just Liberal principles that have commonly distinguished in our time British administration we have in our charge a cause which is the cause of peace, which is the cause of justice, which is the cause of liberty, which is the cause of honour, and which, in the hands of the people of this country by the blessing of God will not fail.'Our Alliance has caught people\u2019s imaginations. You can see it in opinion polls and in the latest local by-election victories - six more yesterday. Warrington showed it and Croydon will show it again. The voters are responding to the sight of politicians of different tradition but similar persuasion getting together and sinking differences for the common good. They respect an alliance of principle because they can see that an Alliance is the way forward: the Alliance for Britain, where people can be brought together.An alliance between management and labour, a real partnership to restore pride in our work and confidence in our industry. An alliance between young and old, in which the young are given the chance they need and the old the respect they deserve. An alliance in the economy, between a private sector dedicated to productivity and a public sector committed to service and efficiency. An alliance between black people and white people, so that all the communities of Britain can make a contribution to the solution of our problems. In short, an alliance which pulls our country together - instead of the old parties which have torn it apart.An Alliance which discards the envy and pettiness of the past, which stands for all the people and our hope for the future. This has been the dream that has sustained the Liberal Party for so many long weary years. Now at last we have the reality in our grasp. We must have the nerve and courage not to let it slip. I have the good fortune to be the first Liberal Leader for over half a century who is able to say to you at the end of our annual Assembly: go back to your constituencies and prepare for government.
p202
aVLast year I asked you to go back to your constituencies and prepare for government. In the year since then, we have won Croydon and our allies have won Crosby and Hillhead with our full participation and support. In May we established a record win of 400 local council seats. We now have a solid base - our largest ever total of 1800 Liberal Councillors elected to authorities throughout the land.But a great deal of our energy and concentration has been devoted during the year to the cumbersome, complicated and contentious task of allocating the constituencies between Liberal and SDP candidates to make our Alliance effective. It is worth stressing again that the vast majority of these 600 individual decisions were achieved amicably and democratically between our two parties at local level.In about thirty cases we had real difficulty, the only surprise is that there were so few. At the end we have had to push through agreements with same acute disappointments in both parties, but more of course in ours where already adopted candidates have been asked to withdraw.I understand the pain which these decisions have caused, but they had to be faced sometime and I want to say something to those candidates and those associations who will not be fighting the next election: when I listened to the outstandingly generous speeches made by some of the candidates personally affected through the week, I was proud to be leader of your Party. The role which you will play in providing the campaigning lead for our local government effort next May and for our SDP allies in the next general election is central to the success of our endeavour and therefore crucial to a liberal future.A liberal future is now the alternative for our country. We have heard a great deal about there being \u2018no alternative\u2019 to the present policies. It is a proposition which defies common sense. It is quite simply. Conservative propaganda - and I want to nail it once and for all.Look around you. Is there no alternative to the silent factories with their machinery sold for scrap? No alternative to the dole queues and wasted lives? No alternative to the decaying cities and the shabby streets? Is there no alternative to the frustration of the young and the abandonment of the old? Is no progress possible? Is no change necessary?We will never accept this Tory counsel of despair. There must be a better way for Britain than selfishness, violence and decline, than greed among the ruins. Unused skills and resources can and must be matched-up with unfulfilled needs. We believe like Martin Luther King that \u2018what self-centred men have torn down, other-centred men can build up.\u2019 We must throw away the economic dogma of the monetarists and the Marxists alike and start again to use our own minds and imagination.As we do this we shall become the real opposition to the Tories. The Labour Party have forfeited all claims to be considered as an acceptable alternative government. We have to fill the vacuum left by the intellectual and political collapse of that once great party.Mr. Foot said Mr. Peter Tatchell would never be accepted as the Labour candidate at Bermondsey. Now he is. The militant tendency are condemned by an official report, yet their members are Labour parliamentary candidates in Liverpool and Bradford.Tony Benn this week made a direct appeal for those Liberals disillusioned with our Alliance marriage to run off with him, presumably to help put asunder the Labour Party. Well I have news for him; there is a world of difference between our commitment to the values of generous and open minded Liberalism where the individual comes first and his argument for a narrow socialism where the state is supreme. This is a free party. If he\u2019s watching let him see there are no concrete walls keeping people in as exist round some societies whose system he admires. People are free to go are there any takers?No, the truth is Tony you\u2019ve created a bit of a problem for us. So many people are now leaving the Labour Party because of the behaviour of you and your friends that we can\u2019t pack them all in here and for the first time at our Assembly hundreds of delegates have to watch on television in our overflow hail next door.The social democratic part of that once great coalition which made up the Labour Party has lost the struggle and abandoned ship. The ship is breaking up leaving the Hattersleys and Heffers fighting vainly for control of the wreckage as it drifts towards the shore.Let us leave them to their absorbing task. We have to pick up the baton of responsible opposition now, and of credible alternative government at the next election.I want today to read you a few choice sentences from a little book that I have enjoyed re-reading over the summer. It is a work laced with wonder, fantasy, excitement and promise. It is called \u2018The Conservative Manifesto, 1979.\u2019 The foreword is written by their leader and promises, that the rest of the pages \u2018set out a broad framework for the recovery of our country.\u2019Let us test their achievements against that promise. I begin by giving credit where credit is due. After three years of struggle, pain and sacrifice during which the rate of inflation went as high as 22% they have got it back to 1% less than they inherited. The Tories proudly claimed last week that they had got inflation in Britain back to the level of 1979.But that\u2019s not all they\u2019ve got back to the levels of previous years. Manufacturing output is now back to the level of 1967. Manufacturing investment back to 1963. And the level of unemployment is back to the level of 1933.When the Tories talked of backing Britain no one realised that what they meant was putting the entire country into reverse.They blame the world recession. But unemployment in Britain in the last three years has become twice the level of the rest of the EEC. Britain went earlier and deeper into the recession than any of our competitors pushed by the policies of the British government.The manifesto said: \u2018Our country\u2019s relative decline is not inevitable, we in the Conservative Party think we can reverse it.\u2019 A lot of people believed them. But no longer. All round, from the CBI to the TUC, from the academic world, from individual industrialists and economists, comes criticism which the Government refuses to heed. Typical is the latest Midland Bank Review: \u2018It is now becoming doubtful whether a significant recovery can be achieved without reflationary action in which the Government takes the lead.\u2019But the lady is, she tells us, not for turning. She\u2019s not for listening either. Her admirers liken her to Queen Boadicea. I regard her as a kind of Queen Canute sitting on the beach ignoring all advice as the tide of disaster rises around her.This Government has reduced profitability in British industry to an all-time record low, left its plant, capacity, research and investment in a more debilitated condition than anyone of this generation can remember. The so-called party of business has created more bankruptcies and liquidations than any government this century.Far from building a \u2018broad framework for recovery,\u2019 they have laid waste the economy with a ferocity unparalleled since Attila the Hun. They chose to ignore all the warnings that their cures would be worse than the disease. They have left our industries so weak that if the much awaited world up-turn comes we may become unable to respond, and be left as helpless spectators while our competitors mop up the business.And the most damning indictment of all is that this Government has squandered our national assets of North Sea Oil en the huge cost of our ever-lengthening dole queues.Unemployment cost us £15 billion last year. And that is only the financial cost. The human cost is appalling. We are breeding a young generation many of whom have no idea how to work because they\u2019ve never had a chance to do any. There is an older generation of men and women in their fifties too, who face the bitter realisation that they\u2019ve been thrown on to the unemployment scrap heap, possibly for ever.Amid this desolation, one group of people remains determinedly cheerful. The members of the Cabinet. Listen to what they\u2019ve been saying:Mrs. Thatcher told us in her New Year message that 1982 \u2018has all the signs of being a year of great opportunity.\u2019 I pointed out at the time that she mist have forgotten that her 1981 New Year message told us: \u2018there is real hope that a year from now things will be looking distinctly brighter.\u2019Every member of the Cabinet has been at it consistently over all three years: November 1980, Geoffrey Howe: \u2018the fall in output is bottoming out\u2019;December 1980, John Nott: \u2018I think we have reached the bottom of the recession\u2019;January 1981, Nigel Lawson: \u2018all the signs suggest that we have now more or less reached the bottom\u2019;May 1981, Michael Heseltine: \u2018there is tangible evidence that the worst is over\u2019;June 1981, Margaret Thatcher: \u2018the recession has just about reached the bottom\u2019;October 1981, Geoffrey Howe: \u2018there are some clear signs that the Government\u2019s economic policy is beginning to work ... we have passed the end of the beginning\u2019;January 1982, Norman Tebbit: \u2018we are beginning to see signs of our policies working\u2019;February 1982, Patrick Jenkin: \u2018we are on the verge of an export-led boom\u2019.Last month, Norman Tebbit, losing his sense of direction altogether in a television interview proclaimed: \u2018we are somewhere near the plateau - near the top.\u2019All this from his Cabinet colleagues so confused poor Sir Keith Joseph that his only contribution to this stream of bogus propaganda last year was: \u2018we are in the bottoming out phase, or very closely approaching it.\u2019The very last sentence of the Tory manifesto reads: \u2018the years of make-believe and false optimism are over.\u2019 What people have got to realise before it is too late is that make-believe and false optimism are the entire threadbare stock-in-trade of this administration.The bogus promises covered almost every item of policy. Take education.The manifesto said \u2018we must restore to every child, regardless of background, the chance for progress as far as his or her abilities allow.\u2019 Falling school roles provide a unique opportunity to raise the quality of education by reducing class sizes. Yet this Government has left more trained teachers paid to be idle than ever before.As for higher education they said: \u2018much of it in Britain has a world-wide reputation for its quality. We shall seek to ensure that this excellence is maintained.\u2019 Try telling that to the thousands of students with good A levels unable to gain places in college or university in these last two years. Even more try telling it to the poorer Commonwealth countries who because of this Government\u2019s fee increases can no longer afford to send students here, but send than instead to America, Japan or even Russia. What crass short-sighted political and commercial folly.On housing, tenants were told: \u2018we must try to achieve a greater take-up in rent allowances for poorer tenants.\u2019 Greater take-up? They\u2019ve abolished that altogether and are about to introduce a so-called housing benefit which will leave 2 million lower incomes tenants 75p a week poorer.On mortgages, they said: \u2018mortgage rates have risen steeply... our plans will lower them.\u2019 The average mortgage rate during their period of office has been consistently at least 2% higher than they inherited and has twice reached 15%.On energy, they said: \u2018we attach particular importance to measures to reduce fuel consumption by improving insulation.\u2019 They\u2019ve reduced fuel consumption all right, but by pushing up prices and shutting down factories. Their record on insulation is so bad that this summer the Commons Select Committee complained about \u2018lack of political will at the heart of Government which smothers the efforts of the Department of Energy\u2019s conservation division.\u2019In their manifesto, the Tories stated: \u2018the most disturbing threat to our freedom and security is the growing disrespect for the rule of law.\u2019 Never have there been so many muggings, break-ins and burglaries. Not even Buckingham Palace has proved safe. Throughout the past three years the crime wave has left an indelible mark on the lives of thousands of people.Mrs. Thatcher blandly asserted that this break-down of law and order has nothing to do with the scale of unemployment. She chose to ignore what Lord Scarman said in his report:There is no doubt that unemployment is a major factor in the complex pattern of conditions which lies at the root of the disorders in Brixton and elsewhere.The Conservatives have shouted order but have denied justice; sooner or later they must understand that without justice, the police will not be able to maintain that order without recourse to methods unacceptable in a free society. The Government deserves credit for improving pay and recruitment in the police; but law and order will improve only when policy changes.This Assembly gave overwhelming support to a resolution committed to community policing demanding a responsible and responsive police force.Let me say a word about responsibility. We all learnt with horror of the brutal attack by 17 policemen on an innocent West Indian couple who were wrongfully arrested and beaten up in their own home. They suffered such severe injury that in court, Mr. Justice Mars Jones was moved to describe the police behaviour as \u2018monstrous, wicked and shameful\u2019; the matter he said had been deliberately covered up for five years. During this time no action was taken to suspend any of the officers concerned.We in Britain have reason to be grateful for the high standards of the police. But that high reputation suffers if wrongdoing within the police force is swept under the carpet. It is just no answer to say that there are good and bad in every walk of life - and that therefore one must expect bad policemen. The custodians of law and order are themselves possessed of great. power, especially over ethnic minorities under our inhuman immigration acts. They must not be allowed to have their crimes covered up by obliging superiors. That is not law and order - that is legalised disorder. That is why we insisted on seeing the Home Secretary about the failure of Operation Countryman.If as speculated the Government\u2019s programme in the coming session includes random stop and search powers for the police, we will vehemently oppose them, because they would compound the sins of the past.And to our ethnic minorities I repeat my pledge of last year, that I will not be party to any government that does not have, as one of its priorities, a commitment to remove all our present racist legislation, so that they may live their lives in dignity and peace, in a civilised society to which they have already contributed so much.Returning to the Tory manifesto, the tax and social security section declared: \u2018we shall cut incomes tax at all levels and tackle the poverty trap.\u2019 In fact more people are now caught in the income tax net. A low paid couple on £80 a week find themselves paying in tax and national insurance 52% more than when this Government came to power.They said they would \u2018bring more effective help to those in need\u2019; - yet they have reduced unemployment benefit by 5%. And they have let Child Benefit drop in real value.Of the National Health Service they said: \u2018standards are falling; there is a crisis of morale.\u2019 So what have they done to improve morale in the Service? They have threatened to abolish it. And meanwhile they have put Norman Fowler in charge of it. With the other Norman in charge of the unemployed you have the two boot boys of British politics kicking in the windows of the welfare state.What has happened to the Conservative Party? What have they done with the one nation tradition of Rab Butler, lain Macleod and Edward Boyle? How have the decent Tories allowed their party to be hijacked by the heavy squad? How long will they put up with the unacceptable face of Conservatism?Whilst I realise that it does not do to be too fastidious in politics, I have to confess to a real sense of repugnance at the way the Prime Minister has tried to use the heroism of British servicemen in the Falkland Islands campaign to the greater glory of her self and her Party. As one Tory MP wrote candidly on Sunday: \u2018The party is high on the Falklands factor, the gift of the courage and skill of our servicemen, which has served to mask for a time the realities of politics.\u2019 I yield to nobody in admiration for the bravery, the professionalism and the effectiveness of the army, navy and air force in that campaign. We were all proud of them. We gave them our support then and we thank them again now for their efforts and sacrifice.But that is not enough for the Prime Minister. She has presided over a shambles of incompetence in her conduct of foreign policy and defence. Yet she has set out, quite deliberately, to cover up her Administration\u2019s nakedness by wrapping herself in the Falklands bunting, by belligerence of language, by a simplistic invocation of the Falklands spirit in the totally different sphere of industrial relations, and by a wish to turn a service of remembrance into a glorification of war. As she plans her parade she should learn that there is a difference between patriotism and jingoism.This Government has forfeited any moral claim to the allegiance of the people. It has broken faith with the electorate.If the Alliance is to provide new hope, it must restore faith in the capacity of the democratic political process. Our Alliance must provide new leadership, and fresh integrity. We start with a determination to put our country back to work.\u2018Back to Work\u2019 is indeed the title of the imaginative programme adopted enthusiastically by this Assembly earlier in the week: it signals a return to the economics of commonsense and ends the nonsense of paying people not to work when there is so much to do. Over three years we will take 1 million people off the dole queues and get this country moving again.First, we will start a selective programme of capital spending, increasing the public investment level which by this year has shrunk to a mere 2% of current Gross Domestic Product. We shall invest in the future as well as the present, with vital public expenditure; on homes in urgent need of renovation; on schemes of energy conservation; on long-overdue improvement and electrification of our railways; and on encouraging the emerging high technology industries.These will not merely be nationally inspired projects but will include a whole range of regional and local schemes. Take just one example. In Manchester, the city\u2019s sewerage system is falling apart, literally. There have been over 50 major collapses in the central area alone since 1975. There are 35 miles of tunnels that need replacing. This one urgent project would generate some 4,000 jobs.Second, we will reactivate the economy by cutting away the restraints upon our competitiveness and on business. We will bring down interest rates by operating a competitive exchange rate and joining the European Monetary System.We will scrap the National Insurance Surcharge - the iniquitous tax on jobs so loved by Denis Healey and Geoffrey Howe alike.But we will introduce also a series of measures designed to boost small businesses. In the short term that will provide the most realistic boost for jobs in the private sector.Third, we will initiate a massive training effort, to give all young people under 18 the chance of at least 8 hours a week training; and, at the other end of the scale, we will extend the Job Release Scheme to the over 60s.Fourth, we will greatly expand the programme of job creation, in particular for the long-term unemployed. There is much work to be done to improve our environment and our social services.Now of course, all this will mean spending more money and expanding the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement. After the savings on unemployment and social security benefit, and the increased tax revenue from those newly in work, the net cost carefully checked on the Treasury\u2019s own computer will be £3,000 million a year for three years.But there will be no long-term benefit to the economy if this extra spending merely fuels inflation. The fundamental difference between the Labour Party\u2019s proposals and those of the Alliance is our firm belief in the anchor which will stop this recovery drifting into the whirlpool of inflation. That anchor is a sustainable incomes policy.Establishing a fair, firm and sustainable incomes policy will not be easy. Without it we are lost. The Tories would accelerate the haemorrhage of job losses and Labour would put us into terminal decline, unable to hold back runaway inflation. As the Guardian put it, \u2018without wage restraint Labour\u2019s package spells inflationary disaster.\u2019We will have no truck with that pathetically familiar feature of British economic and political life: the pre-election consumer boom. Even now the cabinet is planning tax cuts next spring, sweeteners for the voters. The result of this electoral bribery will be to suck in more imported cars, more imported washing machines, more imported TV sets - and with each import more British jobs will be exported.By contrast, we are planning for investment-led recovery, striking at unemployment while resisting the corrosive force of inflation. We shall fight doctrinaire privatisation by the Tories as fiercely as we have fought doctrinaire nationalisation by Labour. British industry desperately needs a period of stability.It needs active and constructive help too. Yet as Liberals we know that however helpful government policy may be, nothing will be achieved without a change of attitude at work.Will the way in which management and employees face the future be positive, energetic and imaginative, adjusting to changes in technology and responding to our competitors? Or will it be surly and negative, concerned to protect the past and shut the door on the future.Of course all parties are concerned with this vital question. Yet Labour and Tories alike have come up with the wrong answers. Labour believe that the bureaucrats in Whitehall and Trade Union bosses at the TUC can change attitudes. Tories believe that it is enough to appeal to the profit motive of a few investors.Liberals have the right answer, the human answer. It is partnership. We need a revolution in industrial relations in Britain. The Nissan Company has said that they are reluctant to build a car plant in Britain because British workers couldn\u2019t understand that managers were human beings who wanted to mix freely on the shop floor. It would be difficult they said to introduce Japanese methods of communication between workers and management necessary for higher productivity because of the historical conflict between different classes that characterises British society.That is precisely what we Liberals have always said. I hope Mrs. Thatcher listened when she was in Tokyo instead of taking advantage of Japanese politeness to give one of her little homilies.To us partnership is not just a pious hope or a management technique. It is the moral basis of a Liberal society. Free people - sharing adversity when it is necessary. Sharing the rewards of their labour and sharing decisions. That is why we shall change company law to turn the limited concept of companies owned by capital alone into living organisations which represent a genuine community of interest of all who contribute to them.It must be the same with our politics too. When we talk about the new politics, we mean really giving democracy a chance. We want a government, ministers and civil servants alike, which is genuinely accountable to parliament and open to public scrutiny. We want a House of Commons which truly represents the people of this country. We want a constitution which protects the rights of individuals, which pushes power back to the communities of Britain and which guards the rule of law.It is a curious thing that this country which gave birth to parliamentary democracy has got stuck with a very limited nineteenth century version of it. Now we want to extend democracy and use it to breathe life back into our tired institutions.We are committed to a Scottish parliament and to devolution of per in the rest of the United Kingdom. We have reaffirmed our total commitment to the introduction of proportional representation. I do not want anyone to underrate our seriousness. Make no mistake, the Alliance will not compromise on this fundamental democratic reform.But we cannot be concerned with Britain alone. We live in a troubled world, and I fear that the instinctive response to its huge problems is isolation, mutual suspicion and narrow nationalism.We are beset by problems: of trade, of declining economic activity, of a dangerous fragility in banking and financial arrangements. Over everything looms the growing calamity of world poverty: of famine, scarce resources and over-population.The Brandt Report struck a ready and enthusiastic popular chord, yet the response of governments was frankly inadequate. At the international summit in Mexico the problems were tossed aside. A bland and pious communiqué was the only outcome. An even greater scandal of our age is the sordid traffic in conventional arms, and the insanity of the nuclear arms race. I understand why so many people have been moved by the build up of nuclear weapons to campaign actively for disarmament. But there has been little tangible result. This summer, five weeks of talks at the United Nations, including speeches from many of the world\u2019s leaders, culminated in the unmitigated failure of the Second Special Session on Disarmament.There are some things we can do on our awn. We can abandon the pretence of a British independent deterrent. We can and we will cancel the Trident project. But that is not enough. We need effective international agreement. That is why I place so much store on real progress at the multilateral disarmament talks at Geneva. Success there is not helped by those who talk of the possibility of fighting and \u2018winning\u2019 a nuclear war. That is a fantastic illusion and dangerous nonsense. It would indeed be a war without winners.But as we have seen in recent days nuclear war is not the only horror which threatens mankind.The terrible devastation of Beirut culminating in the unspeakable barbarism of last month\u2019s massacre, deserves more than mere condemnation of those directly responsible. It also demands a recognition by many nations, including Britain, of our own complicity - in fuelling the Middle East conflict by an unrelenting and cynical traffic in arms to both sides. We will lead a European initiative to dam the flood of arms to that unhappy region.On my own overseas visits last year, in particular Washington, Peking and the UN itself, I have became more and more convinced that we Liberals must work for a new International Charter, as fundamental and far-reaching as the post-war settlement, which included Bretton Woods and the foundation of the UN.In the United States the Democratic Party has proposed a mutual and verifiable freeze on the manufacture and deployment of all nuclear weapons, leading thereafter step by step to the creation of nuclear-free zones, the reduction of existing stockpiles and thence to general disarmament.This year too the Palme Commission has put forward a host of practical measures for real disarmament, including battlefield nuclear free zones.As we cut back on arms spending, the billions of pounds saved should be utilised for the development of the Third World. Growth and prosperity in those areas, which are so desperately poor at present, could provide a great engine to get the world\u2019s economy moving again.In parallel the Charter should define a new set of relationships to cover finance, monetary systems and resources in such away that equity and efficiency replace corruption and chaos.A new international settlement of this sort must involve the Soviet bloc and China. It is formidably difficult but no-one can seriously doubt that it is necessary.In working for this the European Community has a particular responsibility and opportunity. Britain should share the leadership of the community and our government will not behave like this one, complaining about them all being out of step with us lot for nothing is our Prime Minister known throughout the continent as la belle dame sans merci.Looking at the state of the world today and at Britain itself it is no wonder that so many young people have become disillusioned or disaffected. I want particularly to say a few words to them today:Standing aside, nursing a grievance, will change nothing. Care and join us. You need us to end the drift and shatter the complacency of the old politics, and we need you to help us do it. But I want to appeal as well to those who are older and more established: Don\u2019t write off a whole generation. Young people and their ideas must be given a chance. This generation should be of special concern. We have a generation of young people, who are bright, well educated and highly motivated. Yet the missing factor for them that was always there for those of us brought up in the post-war period is hope. We have bred a generation almost without hope, who can echo the poet:Ah what shall I be at fiftyShould nature keep me aliveIf I find the world so bitterWhen I am but twenty-five.Our embittered young see us spending billions on more and more sophisticated weapons while poverty and ignorance continue; they see us willing and able to fight a war eight thousand miles away, but unwilling or unable to find the same amounts of money and effort to tackle the things that matter to them: their education, their jobs and their chance for a decent life.The anguish in the voice of our young people is also a protest of individuality against uniformity; what Goethe called \u2018the deadly commonplace that fetters us all.\u2019 Our amorphous bureaucracy and our insensitive institutions are fetters which the young wish to throw off. We should listen carefully to their protest. We will be judged by our reactions.What they want is not the easy half-truths and euphemisms about \u2018bottoming out\u2019 or \u2018turning the corner.\u2019 They don\u2019t want lecturing or hectoring from a Prime Minister: they want understanding.We can link the idealism of youth to the fine liberal traditions of individual worth, of tolerance, of dissent, of democratic change. Let us make their demand for a limitation on the abuse of power ours as well; let us embrace their demand for a new politics which enhances the quality of life, gives the individual dignity, yet preserves our sense of community. They want a government that speaks directly and honestly to its citizens and one that listens as well, and that is what we are going to give them.We are a new force in British politics which is realistic, purposeful, and above all hopeful. We must campaign with all our strength and conviction between now and the election.We represent a new kind of leadership which is not imprisoned by class or ideology or sectional interest. We offer a new kind of politics which truly represents all the people.That is the real significance of the Alliance. Just as we have brought Liberals and Social Democrats together in a common cause, we must now bring people and government together in a new alliance. Partnership and teamwork are what we believe in. Equality of sacrifice in the hard times is what we shall insist on. Equality of reward when we win through will be the right of every citizen.Making this country a decent place to live in for all of us will not be easy. But if it is not done together it will not be done at all. Carry this message into every city, every town and every village of these islands. Don\u2019t despair. Cut free from the past.I have one last quotation from this discredited document. It puts in a sentence the prevailing philosophy of the Conservative Party: \u2018government strategies and plans cannot produce revival.\u2019You see, they abdicated the proper responsibility of government even before they took office. This is a do nothing, care less government.That was not the attitude of Lloyd George and the Liberal Party in our Yellow Book of 1929, \u2018we can conquer unemployment.\u2019 It was not the attitude of President Roosevelt when he adopted the same ideas in the New Deal which pulled America out of the slump of the Thirties. And it is not the attitude of the Liberal Party and our allies today.So at the end of this Assembly we say to the Government: There is an alternative. We stand determined, united.If you are not willing to act, we are.If you do not care, we do.If you will not give the people of this country the leadership they deserve, you should go.We are ready to govern.

aVThe task for our two parties is to increase our standing in the opinion polls before the general election starts in the near certain knowledge that we should be able to increase it further during the election campaign itself. It is a little understood fact that on average over each general election since 1964 the Liberal Party has increased its share of the poll during the actual campaign by about one quarter, indeed at the last election by more than a half.The last published national poll (MORI in the Daily Express) put us at 27%. We should not be surprised or dismayed by fluctuations in that figure between now and the next election, but taking that as a base even if our Alliance performed no better than the average Liberal increase during the last six general elections we would end up with 33% of the vote. In other words, we are on course right now to break the 40-year-old two-party duopoly in British politics.But 33% under the lottery of our existing electoral system would not be enough to guarantee us the largest number of seats in the House. We must during the next election try to increase our support by more than the previous average Liberal increase. But we have only to put on as much as the last Liberal campaign to be home and dry. And it is my belief that we could and should, because of the construction of our Alliance, do a great deal better than previous. Liberal advances.The Alliance of our two parties can do something which the Liberal Party on its own - and dare I say the SDP on its own - could not do: that is offer a credible and strong third choice of government to our people. Separately our two parties can achieve significant influence in our politics. Together we can achieve the power to put our ideals into effect. That is the significant difference.This position could not have been reached without the formation of the SDP. It would not have been reached without the courageous step taken by David Owen, Bill Rodgers and Shirley Williams in putting their own considerable public careers at risk in leaving active Labour politics. It would not have been reached without that magnificent seizing of public imagination which Roy Jenkins achieved in his Dimbleby lecture. The lead which he gave us all then has been carried through in his seemingly unlikely, arduous but triumphant campaign at Warrington and Hillhead.This has been a difficult year for both our parties in the putting together of our Alliance. I believe that the mood of this conference like my own at Bournemouth is overwhelmingly to tell all our local parties to settle down and accept whatever disappointments there are inevitably on both sides in the final allocation of seats and now to turn outwards on to the attack.When we began the process of seat allocation I said that it had all the potential for 600 first class rows. We haven\u2019t had 600 rows \u2013 we\u2019ve had perhaps 20 - some larger than others. But what new marriage doesn\u2019t have its tiffs? The truth is that in the vast unpublicised majority of constituencies our two parties negotiated and co-operated astoundingly well together.I want to quote to you a letter typical of many I received from one of our prospective candidates who is standing down:'It would be wrong to pretend that I am not bitterly disappointed, but when I voted in support of the Alliance at Llandudno I knew that I might have to stand aside as a Parliamentary Candidate - but of course hoped it would not happen to me. I know I do not have to rehearse to you the pleasure and frustrations of being a Prospective Parliamentary Candidate but this decision will be particularly hard for my family. Seven years ago when I became PPC for this constituency we sold a home we all dearly loved to move to live in the constituency, our youngest left her school and all three children eventually went to school locally. My wife changed her job to teach in the local comprehensive school and we accepted the upheaval because we both believed that for me the only way to nurse the constituency was to live in it and become part of it. I have in my Association the usual band of dedicated Liberals, some of whom kept the flag flying in those lean political years after the war and it will be harder for them to accept this decision than it is for me. I will do everything to sustain and strengthen my association and to develop the excellent relationship we have with the Social Democrats here. The negotiations on seat allocation in our region have gone on for far too long and I will speak in favour of accepting the package at the Chairmens\u2019 meeting this evening. I believe that the Alliance must be a wholehearted commitment and be seen to be one of unity in pursuing a common political goal. This must take priority over what will be very real disappointments in some constituencies not only for Liberals but for Social Democrats as well. The success of the Alliance is that one rare opportunity in several generations to win some real measure of the political power we are all seeking to bring about radical changes in society.'That letter contains the authentic voice of Liberalism - and I hope it will be heard in those few remaining places where some well-publicised members in both our parties have still to raise their sights beyond their own constituency preoccupations to the wider horizons beyond.We now go forward together as two parties sharing common objectives and determined to organise to achieve them. Let me say that does not mean that we should pour the ingredients of our two parties into a mixing bowl so to speak. That way we should merely produce a blancmange. The real strength in our Alliance lies in linking of two separate parties each with its own distinctive characteristics and constitution. We should learn from the strength and weaknesses of each other and so emerge all the more capable of providing together a united alternative government.The Alliance is not a party. It is a movement combining two parties, a movement of conscience and reform which can capture people\u2019s hearts as well as their minds. If we are to achieve fundamental change in our society we will not do so by turning back into the dead end of party chauvinism. The time of laborious preparation is over. We must call the Alliance to battle stations.Our dialogue with each other is now one of mutual understanding and acceptance. So it is time for us to open a new dialogue with the electorate - and I mean a two-way dialogue, talking and listening. If there is one quality above all which characterises the new politics and which the Alliance stands for it is openness. We want to listen to what people tell us. We want to frame our politics together with them. We want to be open to new ideas.The old class politics have shut the electorate out. Tory and Labour alike have become so self-obsessed, so consumed by ideology, that they cannot hear the true voice of public opinion.Real leadership involves people in a common enterprise. Our Alliance has become such an enterprise, showing a common purpose and working together. It is the same pattern of hope we must now offer for the factories, the offices and the communities of Britain.The choice at the next election is simple: continue downwards on the Thatcher/Foot path of division and decline, or work together with the Alliance and thrive.We are not a cold coalition of calculation. We represent a true meeting of minds. We are a close partnership of equals. We must become a movement which runs the length and breadth of this country, transforming the dark days of despair with the warmth and brightness of our conviction.          The Labour Party meantime is not only producing the old unworkable solutions of extending state control of the economy, but by threatening to withdraw from the European economic community they will pile the biggest ever disruption to our trade and commerce on top of the calamity left by the Tories. There is no surer recipe for extending the dole queues than this.But it is not so much Labour policies that are unacceptable as the Labour Party itself. In all the argument over the right and wrongs of Sid Weighell\u2019s resignation there has been exposed to the public the sheer indefensibility of Labour\u2019s organisational methods. One man could decide how to place thousands of votes for the Party Executive, a quantity of votes based entirely on the amount his union decided to buy through their affiliation fee. These votes are cast on behalf of union members who may not even be supporters of the Labour Party at all.The Labour Leader is now in charge of a party so eroded in grass roots membership, so infiltrated by the far left in its constituency branches that he has had to mobilise the lumbering union tanks to maintain his authority at all. No one could seriously trust the future government of this country to a party composed partly of Trots and Militants and partly of such undemocratic manoeuvres. It is time for any of those left in the social democratic wing of the Labour Party to recognise the rot is too deep to be eradicated. They should leave now and join up with           us. Because at the next election the British people will no longer be faced with the limited choice of the frying pan or the fire. There will be a third positive and attainable choice.At the Conservative Party Conference we heard grim warnings that a vote for the Alliance might in fact do something else and accidentally facilitate the return of a Labour Government. This sudden concern for the distortions and lunacies of our fraudulent electoral system is touching - the spectre of a Labour government elected with 37% of the vote. Yet I hardly see that the 44% support for Mrs. Thatcher\u2019s present administration at the last election can be regarded in any way as morally superior.Having played the loaded dice, Mrs. Thatcher and Mr. Foot now see the truth: the more substantial the Alliance vote the more certain will it be that the House of Commons will never again be hijacked by an artificial parliamentary majority without a real basis of majority popular support. Our aim is a people\u2019s parliament \u2013 at the very least with the Alliance frustrating the dogmatic instincts of the two class-based parties - but at the most breaking once and for all the failed political system with fundamental parliamentary and constitutional reforms.In international relations our task must be as a government for the first time to give a British lead to the European Community, and transform it from being merely an economic club to a politically powerful force capable of ushering in a new world order. A linkup between such a united Europe and the uncommitted countries of the Third World could have fresh impact on the problems of development, international trade and finance, and disarmament.On the quest for peace let me say how strongly I agreed with the point made by David Owen yesterday that disarmament in one nation alone would do nothing to increase our security. Our determination to give real impetus to multi-lateral nuclear disarmament is designed not only to achieve a Europe free of the need for the deployment of cruise missiles, but a withdrawal of the Russian SS20s pointed in our direction as well.The other two main areas of economic reform are more difficult. The Tories are planning the traditional consumer-led boom of tax cuts before the election. It is they who are the peddlers of the easy solution, not us. It will do nothing to restore our industry because it will boost ready imports still further.Ours is a more difficult solution. It is not a consumer-led boom, but an investment-led boom. We have to kick-start the nation\u2019s economy again by a series of prudent and carefully costed public investments improving our economy in the long run, and through contracts to private industry, providing jobs in the short run. We shall press ahead with railway and telephone modernisation, with improving homes with insulation schemes and the routine tasks of replacing worn out city sewerage systems. We can go for new items like the Severn Barrage to use tidal power and we can aid the emerging high technology industries.All of this can only be achieved without causing inflation if we have a sustained prices and incomes strategy to control it. And that in turn will in my view only succeed if it is embedded on a whole new partnership deal for British industry.We are not only going to give, in your apt phrase, unions back to their members, we are going to re-state company law to give employees a new status in how their place of work is run and a share in profits from their labours. The way open to us is to introduce a complete industrial revolution of the mind. No longer will there be two sides of industry aided and abetted by the Labour and Tory parties, we shall be united in a common co-operative effort to rebuild the British economy.That will not mean just tinkering changes, but a radical prospectus as relevant to our age as was the constitutional reform package of the great 1906 Liberal Government and the welfare reforms of the 1945 Atlee Government. These two were 40 years apart. We are now 40 years further on. We are at a new watershed in our political history. The class divisions of the two stale parties must be abolished. The co-operation and alliance between our two parties must become the pattern we transfer to our society as a whole.Ours is not just an Alliance for government, it is an Alliance for a new spirit of effort, of unity, of hope. We are now in Alliance for victory - not for ourselves but for our people. To those throughout the country distressed at Britain\u2019s continued decline and fear for our future we say hold on, don\u2019t despair, our forces are now mustered, we are coming to your rescue.

aVAs you may have heard I took a few days off this summer. But I\u2019m back now and I must say you\u2019re all looking a good deal better for it.I did notice that during my absence my own rating in the Gallup poll reached record levels. There must be a moral in this somewhere.I saw this week that another party leader was asked by a reporter whether her hectic day trip to Holland had been too much for her. She replied, and I quote: \u2018It might be too much for a normal person, but after all it is me,\u2019 or as Miss Piggy would say, \u2018C\u2019est moi.\u2019Talking of \u2018The Muppet Show\u2019 reminds me, I must thank Alan Beith for looking after the parliamentary party in my absence.But seriously, I am sure you will agree from what you have seen at this Assembly how lucky Alan as Chief Whip and I as Leader are to have such talented new additions to our team.This 1983 Assembly meets three months after a general election which has seen the return of the largest Liberal Party in the House of Commons since 1935. For our Alliance it was the largest third party vote since 1923. We have made a remarkable climb back from our seven hundred thousand votes in the 1951 election to our seven and a half million votes on June 9th this year.So my first words must be of warm congratulation to everyone in the party who has contributed to this achievement. I have had a chance to thank many of you personally in the last few days. But for those outside this hall who supported us so magnificently during the campaign - my heartfelt thanks. Of course we still have a long way to go to reach power - the power to implement Liberal policies - but another leap forward at the next election, of the same size as this last one, will see us there.For let this be clearly understood, the scale of our achievement has been masked only by the cruel distortions of our electoral system. In what other democracy could the official opposition poll 27.6 per cent of the popular vote and get 209 seats while our Alliance polling just 2 per cent less got only 23? In what other democracy could the Government suffer a loss of support of 1½ per cent of those voting, polling the lowest Conservative vote since Bonar Law, and yet end up with such an increased majority capable of being described wholly incorrectly as a \u2018landslide\u2019 in their favour?I warn Tory and Labour politicians as they sit and manipulate a House of Commons which is now wholly unrepresentative of popular opinion that they go on doing so at their peril. A democracy which is deliberately insensitive to the real changes in public feeling sows the seeds of its own destruction. As I found on the doorsteps in the Penrith by-election, and as our remarkable vote there showed, there is now an enormous wave of public sympathy and support for the cause of electoral justice.And I also warn them that while we fully support the all party Campaign for Fair Votes, we Liberals are not going to sit around whingeing: \u2018we was robbed.\u2019 It is my intention that we regroup and mobilise our forces to go on to win the next election under the present system and then to change it.It has been said that the weakness of our Alliance is that our vote was evenly spread; that we piled up 313 second places throughout the land but that our vote was insufficiently concentrated in specific areas. That may be a short-term weakness but I believe it to be our long-term strength. We do appeal to all ages and classes and regions.That is something neither of the other parties can any longer claim. How can the Tory party possibly pretend to be a genuinely national party when with their inflated majority they cannot muster a single MP in the great cities of Glasgow or Liverpool?The Labour Party has been almost wiped out throughout the whole of the south of England below the London to Bristol line. There is one other feature of the last election which is highly significant and merits greater recognition. Ever since 1950 the Liberal Party has been caricatured as the lost deposit party. In that election we lost 319 deposits and Labour lost none. At this election we lost just five deposits - the same number as the Conservative Party. But Labour candidates lost their deposits in 119 constituencies. The mould of British politics many not have been smashed at this election, but we have cracked it beyond repair and it will not be used again.What does that mean for us?First and foremost it means we must start to look like a potential government. It means that without question our Alliance with the SDP must continue. The sight of two parties working together for the common good for the first time since the war has had dramatic impact. It must not only continue but develop organically and democratically at every level. Inevitably at the beginning of our Alliance a lot of ad hoc decisions had to be made at the top. Now we must move on from that.It means developing policy with our allies over the next few years instead of waiting till the manifesto drafting period. We have set an example already in Parliament by creating groups to co-ordinate policy.We must let the local friendships and partnerships, forged in the election, grow stronger. But at the same time, our proper commitment to decentralisation should not go so far as to leave us looking like a loosely-knit rag-bag with people free to act against the spirit of the Alliance in their region, city or constituency. The Alliance has meant and will mean taking and accepting some tough decisions.We have worked out a way of fighting European seats together which will require us to respect each other\u2019s rules but which I am sure will be successful. In the coming discussions on Westminster seats we must be careful not to upset the excellent local understanding which now exists in the great majority of constituencies by initiating any attempt at a general reshuffle.In the relatively small number of constituencies where either Liberals or Social Democrats seek change, it is essential that both parties face up to the obligation of sorting things out together fairly and locally. That is the way to avoid another round of national involvement and intervention.But important as \u2018who fights which seat\u2019 may be to the two parties of the Alliance, it is not what matters to the voters, They want to know and they are entitled to know whether the Alliance has worked out answers to the growing problems of Britain.That means that, we must think together and we must campaign together on the great issues of our country\u2019s future. I want the Liberal Party to be a Thinking and Campaigning Party. I want us to be a Thinking and Campaigning Alliance.Between 1974 and 1979 the Tory privateers captured the political debate. They imposed their ideas upon the national agenda.Now it is up to us to recapture the intellectual initiative. Their ideas have proved impractical and their ideology barren, but it is up to us to show that we can do better. We must redefine and sharpen up our policies in a way that is both adventurous and responsible. We must command the debate.Our policies must be developed step by step with our allies over the coming years. We must not be afraid to hammer out our differences. We must be willing to advance new plans and ideas which draw upon the traditions of Liberalism and Social Democracy to solve the crisis of our time. Like Keynes and Beveridge in their day we must be innovative and ambitious. The Tories believe they have so cowed the British people that all sense of confidence has ebbed away. \u2018A frightened nation is a conservative nation,\u2019 they say to themselves.We must prove them wrong by being prepared to put forward bold and radical plans for the renewal of Britain, and we must campaign vigorously upon them. I am determined that the very special style of campaigning which Liberals have developed so successfully over the past two decades should not be confined to local issues.The Party in the Alliance must take its case to the people. We must take our campaign for the renewal of Britain into every home in this country with a message that will rekindle the hope which Tory policies have done so much to destroy.It is to the contents of that campaign that I want to divert your attention today. Over these next four years we must work together in five key areas of policy, to sharpen our impact.I begin with the economy. In a speech during the election Sir Geoffrey Howe had the nerve to claim \u2018we have created and will maintain a stable economic environment. Business confidence and employment opportunities are growing.\u2019 Scarcely a day of the election passed without some Tory minister assuring us that recovery was just round the corner or that light had been sighted at the end of the tunnel. We now know that the June recovery was an illusion. How bitterly I find CBI members resenting that their leaders were swept along in the Tory euphoria.This month the National Institute of Economic and Social Research told us that the growth expected in the economy over the next 18 months would be \u2018too low to make any mark on unemployment.\u2019 This Government, faced with the problems of a world recession, has deliberately used unemployment as its sole means to control inflation. By cutting public expenditure they have reduced productive economic activity and added an extra British recession on top of the world one.The Government\u2019s financial targets for 1983 are the most restrictive of any of the big seven Western economies. The Tories cannot deny that since they took office in 1979 our industrial production has slumped seven times faster than the OECD average. Over the same period Britain had by far the worst record on overall output of all the 24 OECD member states.The National Institute\u2019s report goes on to say, \u2018it is difficult to see a significant and national reduction in unemployment taking place without a fairly substantial stimulus.\u2019 That is precisely what we called for before and during the election and we do so again today.I must make it clear that when we oppose Tory economic policies and present our own alternatives we are not just talking of detailed changes here and there. We are saying that the present economic policies stem from a crude political philosophy that we Liberals find socially irresponsible and wholly unacceptable. Today\u2019s Tories are fired with the Friedmanite view that human improvement can only be achieved by unrelieved competition. We reject that view.So do a long list of Tories who nowadays sound like a roll call from distant history: Soames, Gilmour, Carrington, Pym. The Prime Minister instead surrounds herself with the new hard-faced men who share her failed dogmas: Lawson, Brittan, Parkinson, Tebbit. I hear the BBC is trying to negotiate for a series of documentaries on the workings of cabinet. I have a title ready for them if they succeed: \u2018Yes Prime Minister.\u2019But it is a tragedy, not a comedy. The new Thatcher Tories are like the Prime Minister herself totally out of touch with the harsh reality of the life they have created for many of our people. I say they are out of touch because I believe that is true of leading Tories today. The only other and much less charitable explanation is that they do know and don\u2019t care.The number of families caught in the poverty trap has doubled since they came to power four years ago. The Government\u2019s lack of concern about this reminds me of the Victorian Archbishop of Dublin who suggested to the Poor Law Enquiry Commission that all paupers should be tattooed on the foot or some other place so as to deter them from begging or receiving additional relief. He also suggested that any female receiving relief should have her hair cut off, pointing out with true devotion to the market economy that a good head of hair would fetch from 5 to 10 shillings, which represented a fortnight\u2019s maintenance. These are the Victorian values we can do without.Whole areas of our great cities are so riddled with unemployment that we now have a law and disorder problem of serious proportions. Our newspapers week by week bring us reports from the courts of suicides brought on by failure to find work. NHS prescriptions for sedative drugs have shown an alarming and costly increase in areas of high unemployment. The picture of despair among the young who\u2019ve never had a job is matched only by the prematurely retired people in their 50s who fear they will never work again.Let the Prime Minister listen to the words of her great predecessor Disraeli instead of the false prophets she has been following: \u2018It is community of purpose that constitutes society. Without that men may be drawn into contiguity but they still continue virtually isolated.\u2019 It is that community of purpose which is so devastatingly lacking in the philosophy of this Government - leading to the creation of two nations between whom Disraeli saw \u2018no intercourse and no sympathy; who are as ignorant of each other\u2019s habits, thoughts and feelings as if they were inhabitants of different planets.\u2019 That is the main achievement of the Thatcher philosophy today. She and her advisers have perverted the Liberal concept of liberty. We believe that unless participation in the fullness of life in our country is treated as a right for all, liberty remains an empty word, a pretty veil behind which privilege may thrive.So our first duty as an Alliance must be to advocate constructive ways of putting people back to work. And so the second priority of the Alliance is the maintenance and revival of our country\u2019s public assets. The way they have been eroded by the Tories is a scandal. Because of our Liberal inheritance from the days of Lloyd George we are particularly incensed at the erosion of our health and social services.The Tories have partly succeeded in persuading our people that as a nation we have been living in the lap of luxury, enjoying benefits in excess of other countries and which we cannot afford. This is just not true. I found when I was in Canada during the summer that our Liberal colleagues there spend more of their Gross National Product on health than we do. They have more doctors and more hospital beds than we do per 1000 population. The same is true of Australia.What economic and social lunacy it is to have empty wards, longer waiting lists, and nurses and ancillary workers drawing unemployment benefit. What a tragedy that at a time of falling school rolls and empty classrooms we should have teachers in the dole queue instead of improving the quality of our education by reducing class sizes.The crude and intermittent financial attacks on our universities and colleges have meant the abandonment of the right to higher education which all post-1960 governments until this one supported. We have been failing to invest in our material infrastructure and in private industry. To add on top of these the failure to invest in the skill of our people for the future is disgraceful.Mrs. Thatcher claims to be a disciple of Winston Churchill, but she is highly selective in her knowledge of him, for in his book The People\u2019s Rights he dealt at length with the need for the public utilities and went on to say that \u2018the State must increasingly and earnestly concern itself with the care of the sick and aged, and above all, of the children.\u2019 Today\u2019s Tories are doing the very reverse, and in the process frittering away the benefits of our greatest contemporary asset, North Sea oil. Let us therefore in our Alliance renew our faith in the public assets of this country - our railways, airports, road network; our coal, gas, electricity, steel and shipbuilding, to replace public shoddiness with public pride.The industrial world may be running out of jobs in the ordinary sense, but it is certainly not running out of work. There is plenty waiting to be done - enough to restore everybody\u2019s self-respect and give meaning to their lives.There is a lot of nonsense talked about the wisdom of growth, about this country having to choose between jobs and the environment. Mrs. Thatcher has proved that isn\u2019t true. She has succeeded in destroying both at the same time.On the contrary, the right investment in the repair and rehabilitation of this country we could get the economy moving, get people back to work and enhance and conserve our precious physical environment for future generations.There is a massive job to be done in reclaiming our inner cities, in repairing, insulating and refurbishing old housing stock, in cleaning up urban wastelands and building new parks and playing fields.That\u2019s the way to get the construction industry moving again, not by building a new rash of commuter towns deep in the Green Belt.Yet Mrs. Thatcher cannot escape from the prison of her own ideology.  For her, energy use can only be limited by putting prices up. For her, land is a commodity to be bought and sold by her friends in the City, not a precious national asset. For her, public investment is anathema - even if it helps encourage private industry to get going again.So we have been condemned to another four years of these squalid and short-sighted policies which will leave a landscape of dereliction behind them, with concrete where there should be green fields and city slums where there should be thriving communities.The opportunity to use this time of economic crisis to create a more sustainable society is there for the taking. We must do it before the North Sea oil runs out, poured away by a deeply irresponsible government on a wave of imported foreign goods.I want future generations to look back and say: This, our generation of political leadership, had the sense and foresight to build a country which is fit for us to inherit.My third theme is that we must search for an enhanced role for the individual in our society. \u2018Less government\u2019 is a legitimate demand in our over-bureaucratic society. It. means more autonomy for individuals, groups, regions, businesses, organisations, decentralised groups of all kinds. We Liberals have long proclaimed the need for partnership in industry. The message is catching on slowly but surely, yet we have still not given this subject the priority it deserves. We should spell out the advantages of our policy in far more dramatic terms.Why for a start should we not require all nationalised industries to operate genuine industrial partnership? One of the most original speeches at the TUC this year was made by Bill Sirs, the leader of the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation, when he said that the labour movement had with the best of intentions created monsters out of the public industries. \u2018Under nationalisation,\u2019 he said, \u2018we the shareholders have no mechanism for controlling them at all.\u2019 He is absolutely right. I believe the whole public sector would be much more efficient if those who work in it were given a proper say in its running. Indeed where possible, as in British Leyland, a cash share in its increased productivity and success. That is the way to greater prosperity for the nation and satisfaction for the workforce.In the private sector the government should not order industry into new forms of organisation but it should give far larger tax carrots for those who switch to approved partnership schemes. We should as a movement study and publicise those firms like Baxi Heating who have in recent years successfully adopted partnership principles, and look at experience overseas. In America for example the airline People\u2019s Express makes it a prior condition of employment that you own at least 100 shares in the company and if you haven\u2019t got the money they will let you pay by instalments out of your wages. The chairman of the company declares that everyone in his company is a. manager. Everyone makes between a quarter and half their basic salary through profit sharing. The firm operates with half the usual ratio of employees to aircraft and the result is lower fares for the customer.Let us inject some zeal into our advocacy of these policies. It is only through them that we can for example get an incomes policy generally accepted as a more civilised method of controlling inflation than unemployment. It is only through industrial partnership that we will break down the class barriers which so bedevil our national life and which are in the interests of the Conservative and Labour parties to maintain. It is only in an atmosphere of co-operation that we will get people to face the necessary reappraisal of work in the face of the new technologies.One of the central issues of the world of tomorrow is how do we transform our dependence on jobs into a wider dependence on activity, including part-time work, education, leisure and voluntary assistance in developing the otherwise costly personal social services in an ageing society. Our Alliance parties still have a great deal of thinking to undertake in this area.My fourth theme is that our Alliance demonstrates a coherent and well thought out concern for our future human environment, and especially the health of local government as the main agency for securing this.A deep concern for the individual is the heart of our approach. But that means safeguarding his liberties and rights from bureaucratic intrusion; it means exercising a firm control over the pace of technological change so that the new technology remains our servant and not our master; it means giving the citizen rights of access to information; it means proper protection for ethnic and other minorities - giving equality before the law, providing equality of opportunity, whether in education or in work, and welcoming cultural diversity. Let us live up to our Party\u2019s constitutional aim that none should be enslaved by a narrow mass conformity.And it means rejecting those who would impose a set blueprint of what constitutes human happiness whether that be the product of Tory paternalism or State socialism.That is why a responsive, open and alive system of local democracy is so important.But over the last four years we have seen a relentless assault on local government, with a procession of White Papers, legislative proposals and a maze of mind-numbing and unworkable financial formulae. These financial controls are imposed with no regard to the human consequences, and are constraints which central Government would not dream of accepting in Whitehall.Of course there may be provocation from authorities controlled by the Labour left. I have a peace proposal to make. Mrs. Thatcher should promise to stop trying to run the GLC if Ken Livingstone will stop trying to run the country.The greatest damage has been caused to local government by forcing it to be an instrument of the Government's monetarist obsessions. My own regional council earlier this month warned me that maintenance of services in the Borders - our roads, bridges, school buildings - is gradually disintegrating.There is a desperate need to spend more merely to get back to the standards of 10 years ago. But instead, the Government permits only a ludicrous 2.6 per cent for inflation next year. We all know that inflation is going to be much more than that. Therefore inevitably there will be a serious reduction in real terms in local authority services.Now we have the latest proposals for rate-capping - hitting at the remaining power local authorities have to raise their own funds and set their own level of services. So my Regional Council cannot even remedy this disastrous position by its own actions, Is it any wonder that councillors feel there is little point in giving up their time in service to local government when it\u2019s so hamstrung by central government?If we believe in local democracy, we are going to have to fight for it. We have our shock troops on the ground, 2,000 Liberal councillors ready to take the argument into their council chambers and on to the Government itself.Together our MPs and councillors must unfurl the banner of local freedom.I now turn to the last of my five points, but by no means the least - the assertion of a new international role for Britain. Some say we found that role in the Falklands. We did not. I have been unstinting in my praise for our military achievement. We backed the expeditionary force because we backed the rule of law and the United Nations charter so brusquely ignored by the Argentine Junta. We paid a heavy price for those principles and for rescuing the Falkland Islanders from the cruel invasion. Some of our fellow citizens paid the ultimate price. The triumph was one in which we all shared.But the ugly jingoism which once or twice surfaced in the Prime Minister\u2019s vocabulary during that war has led to the most outrageously futile policy in peace - that of Fortress Falklands. Here we have a Government which at every turn tells us how it must limit public expenditure in every direction, seriously proposing to spend (on the garrison, new airports and other services in the Islands) one and a half million pounds per Islander.And what for? Such expenditure will not lead to permanent security or immunity from attack - only a political settlement can achieve that. And in any case, as a report I have just received from the Islands privately confirms, the conversion of the Islands into a military fortress threatens to ruin the very way of life of the Islanders which we are meant to be protecting.Common sense must prevail. The Argentine is due to return to democracy next autumn. We are alienating Latin America, the United States, and indeed the whole United Nations by our obdurate policy. Instead we should be making it clear that when democracy returns we will of course resume direct discussions with the Argentine for the long term future of the Islands. In the meantime, we should welcome any help from the UN or the Organisation of American States to establish international guarantees of their security. We are now paying too high a price for Mrs. Thatcher\u2019s vanity, and we shall say so loud and clear.The international role for Britain is not and cannot be that of Britain ruling the waves. It should be of a Britain using her world-wide Commonwealth connections, her special relationship with the United States, her membership of the EEC and NATO, as a major force for peace, stability, arms control and a just distribution of resources in our troubled world. There is no need to be hesitant in assuming such a leadership. The background of mutual paranoia of the two super-powers rules them out of this task. We could assist in reducing these global tensions, suspicions and distrust by promoting political dialogue between East and West. It is scandalous that the Prime Minister prevented Francis Pym from doing that. Political summitry may have gone out of fashion but I believe it is the quickest way to increase understanding and create a better atmosphere against which disarmament talks can operate.We as a people have a common interest with both the Americans and the Russians in achieving major reductions in expenditure on nuclear weaponry. The Soviet Union spends two or three times as much of its gross national product on military purposes as the NATO powers. It does so inevitably at the expense of progress for our citizens. Military expenditure throughout the world over the last four years has been increasing at a rate of 4 per cent a year twice the rate of the previous four years. This is an insanity which must be stopped, for as President Eisenhower once remarked, \u2018Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired, signifies in a final sense a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, from those who are cold and not clothed.\u2019That is even more true of today\u2019s expensive hardware. Every week three hundred thousand people die of starvation, a death toll equivalent to two Hiroshimas a week. Assuredly the Brandt Report was correct in saying that the twin causes of disarmament and world development go hand in hand. Far from adopting its proposals, our Government has brazenly lopped a further 2 per cent off the already-declining overseas budget since June. Governments which go round penny-pinching from the arts and overseas aid tell you something about what kind of tawdry values they have.If they want to penny-pinch they might look instead at the fact that Britain has almost four times as many brigadiers, admirals and above for every 1,000 troops as the Americans, and all of them with increased salaries protected under this Government\u2019s special pay policy for top people.But serious disarmament is not just a matter of economics, it is a matter of survival. Both sides build increasing numbers of nuclear weapons and stockpile them to prevent their use. There is a logical malfunction here somewhere. Nuclear war is unlikely in my view to come about because of political confrontation between the two superpowers. It is now much more likely by accident. The ill-fated Korean airliner had its course set by computer. The communications systems set between it and the Russian fighters were different. If tragedy occurred after a 2½-hour flight, how much more likely is error on the short missile flights between East and West. To err is human, but for a real cock-up you need a computer. So the stakes are high and getting higher, and the need for a sustained impetus for nuclear disarmament becomes the highest priority for the peoples of this world.I am not saying that the creation of a new concept of common security is easy. I hope that those who think those nice Russians can lightly be persuaded to abandon their SS20 deployment programme will have thought again after the callous destruction of that airliner. Even the latest Andropov proposals would leave the fire power of three thousand Hiroshima bombs directed at Western Europe.But today the talks at Geneva stand at a critical point. The British Government\u2019s attitude and activities in the days and weeks ahead could make all the difference. There have been some hints of movement on the Soviet side in the talks recently. Our European Allies would welcome British pressure for constructive disarmament counter proposals from an American Administration which has too often seemed frozen in its own cold-war rhetoric. The trouble is that Mrs, Thatcher seems to be content to be President Reagan's echo rather than his ally. I don\u2019t want Britain to be the East Germany of the Atlantic Alliance.One of the major obstacles to agreement at Geneva is the refusal of Britain to put Polaris into the Geneva equation. There has been no flicker of response from Britain to this not unreasonable suggestion. Why?It is easy to see one reason why the Government is reluctant, If allowance is made today for the 192 Polaris warheads, allowance will have to be made tomorrow for the 896 Trident warheads. It would then become embarrassingly clear to everyone how this misbegotten Trident project would give a. vicious upward twist to the nuclear arms race worldwide. We know already that this subject has become an obstacle to agreement in Geneva and yet, rather than abandon Trident, Her Majesty\u2019s Government is willing to put the Geneva talks at risk.If we are confronted with the deployment of Cruise missiles this autumn, it will not only be the position that the Russians and the Americans have taken in the negotiations that will affect this Party\u2019s attitude. It will not just be the presence or absence of a dual key system. It will also be whether this Government has helped or hindered the prospects for peace by their conduct and policies over the coming crucial weeks.There is a further major risk of nuclear war. It lies in the lesser powers indulging in conventional wars which get out of control. It is high time that we took the lead in saying that the developed powers stopped whetting the appetites of these countries with arms sales promotions. The world is sadly full of Galtieris, Ghadafis, Begins, Bathos or Khomeinis whose aggressive concept of their national interest is to trample on the rights of others. That during this summer France should sell jet fighters equipped with Exocet missiles to Iraq, or that we should have sent a cross-Channel car ferry loaded as an arms sales exhibition round the Middle East is unforgivable. We seem to have learned nothing from our arms trade with the Argentine.And as candid friend to President Reagan it is time the Prime Minister told him bluntly that we do not regard the harassment of Nicaragua or the propping up of El Salvador as being the first line in the defence of human freedom.Britain is in a unique position to be a new and vital force for world peace. We are determined to make her so.If I try to sum up my five themes, they amount to a plea for us to listen to what people are telling us in Britain today. To listen to the cry of men and women who feel themselves the victims of blind economic and political forces beyond their control. To recognise the frustration of people excluded from the process of making decisions even over their own lives, the feeling of hopelessness and powerlessness to shape their own destinies.The duty of our political movement is to display such conviction, imagination and responsibility that we establish ourselves as the mainstream reformers in touch with the feelings and aspirations of ordinary folk. We have to restore faith in democratic politics, and invite new recruits in to help us.In my first speech to you as leader in 1976, I said that the road I intended us to travel back to power would be a bumpy one. And indeed we have climbed some rough terrain together. But look where we\u2019ve got to. We have established for the first time in fifty years a really secure base camp. We are ready to begin the final assault on that summit.First we must be confident. Confident of our cause and our chance of success. Confident in each other and in our allies.Second we must be united. Healthy debate is essential. The party needs new ideas and vitality. But the time has come for us to operate more as a team, now and especially during the next election itself.Third, and most important, we must be far-sighted. Liberals have always led the way in responding to new political opportunities with vision. That has never been more needed than now.A timid, divided and short-sighted Party would fail, and would deserve to fail because it would have lost its nerve. A confident, united and far-sighted Liberal Party will give the lead to the Alliance.Politics is so often just about parties chasing after votes. Yet in contrast today we have the extraordinary phenomenon of the public seeking a movement worthy of their support. We must respond. We have clearly touched a chord in the hearts of the British people.Now we must build a new consensus, with an honourable role for our country. As we\u2019ve seen in these last two years, to die for one\u2019s country is still recognised as noble. But to live and work for its best purposes is noble too.We must redefine true patriotism. A Britain famous once more for its civilisation, competence and compassionate domestic leadership could be a forceful example in the quest for international order and justice.Our party and our Alliance have an historic role to play in the renewal of Britain. It is our duty. It is expected of us. There is no limit to what we can achieve together if we believe in each other and in our cause.I commend to you the words of Oliver Cromwell: \u2018know what you fight for and love what you know.\u2019

aVWell we\u2019ve had an interesting week. No one can say it has been dull.Even meetings of the parliamentary party have been enlivened by the babble of the bookies and the shouting of the odds. It\u2019s felt more like Newmarket on race day.I don\u2019t want to dampen anyone\u2019s enthusiasm but we won\u2019t be putting the runners under starters\u2019 orders yet. We have other important races to win first, the most important being that against Mrs Thatcher.I had a phone call last night from David Owen. He\u2019d been watching television all afternoon.He said we didn\u2019t seem to be a one man band, though whether he thought that was an improvement I\u2019m not sure.I tackled him bluntly on one thing he mentioned at his conference last week. He instructed his members to tell him when he is talking nonsense. I said I thought that was my job, and anyway I thought the SDP was supposed to be different from the Liberal Party.Yesterday we had a debate of high quality on defence and disarmament. We have one area of disagreement among us on the best strategy for getting rid of Cruise missiles and I do not seek to minimise it but, with that exception, we have agreed what I believe is the only party policy in Britain today which genuinely seeks to combine the needs of defence and disarmament. That is a policy for real security.And I was delighted that we so overwhelmingly rejected the call to come out of NATO and remove bases from the UK. Unlike the Labour Party, we have fully committed ourselves to NATO as our defence shield. But this week we have also shown how NATO should take the way forward on disarmament and become an Alliance for Peace. We will make our full contribution to that process by putting Polaris into the arms negotiations.Unlike Labour and unlike the Conservatives we are internationalists committed to working with other countries and I welcome the strong emphasis in the resolution on strengthening the European pillar of NATO.We have agreed that by 1986 we will draw up our priorities for government. Meanwhile the military and political scene will have moved on but I am confident that, looking at the principles of common security and positive progress to peace agreed here this week, we shall be successful, and that we shall go on to convince the electorate that it is possible to combine hope and realism in defence policy.It is that combination of hope and realism which we should have in all our policies, but it is not my intention to speak this afternoon about detailed policies. Instead I want to concentrate on the sort of leadership Britain needs to take us out of the long spiral of decline.Let us look at our country in 1984. We are rich in natural resources of coal, oil and gas. Our Government has had at its disposal a unique cash bonanza from North Sea Oil, yet it has not been used to fund major changes in our industrial prospects, but instead to finance a dole queue of persistent and growing length and to disguise our real balance of trade figures.For the first time since the industrial revolution, Britain last year imported more manufactured goods than she exported - this for a country proud of and dependent on our trading abilities. A great nation is judged on its ability to create wealth not on its ability to consume it.We are a nation careless of our environment. Only a handful of the 300 recommendations over the years of the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution have been implemented. Acid rain pollutes lakes and forests; highly mechanised agriculture has, in Eastern parts of England, destroyed much of our natural wildlife and countryside.Protection of green belts has been relaxed in favour of new speculative development while many of our inner cities present a picture of destitution and decay.Above all there is the continuing and worsening bloody battleground which is laughably referred to as British industrial relations.Our national crisis is not just an economic crisis, it is a social crisis.It is not just miner against police. We live in a country where miner is set against miner, miner against steelworker, steelworker against docker, docker against lorry driver.There is a general breakdown in law and order, confirmed by the Government\u2019s own crime figures. This is in part a consequence of high unemployment and enforced idleness among a growing section of our population. Another side effect of the same social stress is the increased use of sedative drugs in the NHS. Yet another is the 50% increase in juvenile illegal drug abuse in one year and the doubling in the number of registered drug addicts in Britain since this Government came to power.The welfare state itself is cracking as it tries to cope with demands and numbers its founders never foresaw.It may be argued that since this Government has altered the balance of advantage between rich and poor in favour of the rich, then at least there should be one section of society which is content. But have even the rich really benefited? Can their quality of life be said to have improved when during the period of this Government, the chances of their houses being broken into have increased by 48%, the likelihood of their cars being broken into increased by 52%, the risk of their teenagers getting hooked on heroin has doubled? But what can you expect when there seems no place in this harsh society for so many of our young people.Britain is a country which has lost its way. We\u2019re a country where each interest group or family has been encouraged to concentrate on painting the walls of its own cabin as the ship of state founders.That is the Britain of 1984.It is appalling but not yet beyond hope - if we have a sufficient commitment to changing it.The Prime Minister repeatedly declares her commitment to change - of a sort. But one of the fundamental failures of this Government is that it does not see the real extent of the problems we face, or of the obstacles to change. There\u2019s a horrifying reek of complacency and self-satisfaction in the face of despair and decay. How else could you describe Nigel Lawson\u2019s claim in the last major Commons debate before the summer recess that Britain has benefited from \u2018four years of non-inflationary recovery\u2019? If that\u2019s how they define recovery I\u2019d like to know what they imagine decline is like.But it\u2019s more than complacency which affects this Government; it\u2019s ignorance as well: ignorance about whole sections of British society. The most revealing sentence uttered by any minister this year was by Patrick Jenkin on visiting slums in Liverpool: \u2018I had no idea people in Britain were living like this.\u2019 Why not? What a disgraceful statement from the cabinet minister in charge of housing.We shouldn\u2019t really be surprised. Mrs. Thatcher has told us all along that she believed in a kind of social Darwinism. Survival of the fittest. Government can\u2019t do everything, we are constantly told, so it should settle for taking care of the strong and hope that financial ambition and charity will do the rest. Make the rich richer and what falls from their table will be enough for the rest of us.We too believe in encouraging the talented. But that is not the same as the survival of the fittest - the law of the jungle. Civilised government has a higher purpose to fill the gaps left by chance or misfortune.We believe as Liberals that a society like ours must find work for all who can do it, shelter for the homeless, care for the elderly and infirm, and hope for the despairing.There is despair in the eyes of millions whom Mrs. Thatcher and her ministers never see. Not just the people in damp and overcrowded homes. The young couples who struggle to pay their higher mortgages, the students turned away from college or university; the elderly afraid to turn on the heating; above all despair is in the eyes of the one and a quarter million long-term unemployed.Of the plight of all these people Tory ministers seem determinedly ignorant.The attitude of Mrs. Thatcher and her colleagues towards large sections of the British people can best be described in a phrase historians used of the regard in which the citizens of ancient Rome were held by some of their less desirable emperors: \u2018oderint dum metuant,\u2019 \u2018let them hate me, so long as they fear me.\u2019There are plenty who have good reason to hate and fear her in a Britain whose enviable record of tolerance she has so successfully destroyed.It is not just the competence of this Government which I question. It is their whole sense of values, the direction in which they want to take Britain.Mrs. Thatcher gave an interview a few weeks ago when she said of our desperate situation in Britain \u2018I do not know any other way.\u2019What a confession. And what a contrast with that great statesman Franklin Roosevelt, who, faced by the Depression of fifty years ago and adopting Lloyd George\u2019s ideas said \u2018We will try something, and if it works we will keep it. If it doesn\u2019t, let\u2019s try something else.\u2019Mrs. Thatcher\u2019s version of that would be \u2018If it doesn\u2019t work, let\u2019s keep it and whatever happens let\u2019s never try anything else.\u2019 Unhappily I believe the Prime Minister. She doesn\u2019t know any other way. Had she been a pharaoh in Egypt the slaves would not only have been ordered to make bricks without straw but to pay for the mud as well.Yes, Prime Minister. We know your way all too well. It is away of division, of bitterness, and, in the end, of defeat for Britain.During the mining dispute we have seen the Thatcher way at its very worst. She appointed as Chairman of the National Coal Board an elderly American company doctor whose reputation at British Steel had been made by cutting back rather, than building up.She has effectively torn up the Plan for Coal and replaced it with nothing except a general sense of hostility to what is one of this country\u2019s major assets. She has set up a confrontation which suits her Marxist opponent Arthur Scargill very well. She has allowed attitudes to harden on both sides.Then this week she has the nerve to talk about the strike going on for a year and demands \u2018victory\u2019 over the \u2018enemy.\u2019 It may be the Thatcher way but it is not the way to conduct industrial relations - and it is deeply damaging to the national economy.There is a better way. I want to use this occasion to make a .firm proposal to break the deadlock. It has three elements and it will require the recall of Parliament next week, which is perfectly possible since there are no party conferences.The first element is that Mr. McGregor should step down immediately. He is now an impediment to a settlement. His replacement should be someone like Eric Varley who has the personal skills and the knowledge of the coal industry. The fact that he is not \u2018one of hers\u2019 is a positive advantage. A new Chairman of the NCB is the first pre-requisite to break the log-jam.The second element is the establishment of a new Community Rehabilitation Programme, funded by the Government. It should undertake the environmental restoration of run down mining communities to create worthwhile jobs for former miners and to get the local neighbourhood thriving again. This Programme would be loosely modelled on the excellent Villiers scheme in British Steel but will concentrate particularly on the physical environment.This scheme should be jointly managed by the NCB and the NUM but there is one big IF. There must be a ballot on the coal strike. The Alliance will put a short Bill to the House of Commons allowing 10% of miners, to trigger a national ballot. This trigger will be pointed at the head of Mr. Scargill and his dictatorial ways. As the Yorkshire working miners\u2019 letter said \u2018he is only a servant of the union.\u2019 We must enable them to tell him what to do rather than the other way round.I call on the Government and the TUC to put all their weight behind this scheme to set the coal industry on a new course. It is their duty to save the adversaries from themselves.The obstacles to change in Britain are considerable. We will not carry through the changes the country needs unless we can carry the country with us.You cannot bludgeon Britain into accepting change. That way provokes embittered resistance or nervous protectionism. The democratic way, is to win change through consent. That requires a different sort of political leadership, open to ideas, quick to learn and sensitive always to the human dimensions of decisions. That is not what we have had in Britain. Successive governments have failed in the most basic political skill of all, persuasion. They bully, and sometimes they bribe, but they do not take the whole country into their confidence, do not provide a long-term sense of direction.Unless there is a general sense of fairness, of social justice, a sense that we are all in it together, the delicate process of managing change will come unstuck. That means reconciling the necessities of industrial modernisation and technological innovation with the human needs of understanding and security. That requires democratic leadership, not authoritarian hectoring.What leadership is the country offered?We all know what divides Mrs. Thatcher and Mr. Kinnock, Tory and Labour. They tell us often enough. But since Britain\u2019s steady decline has continued under Tory and Labour governments perhaps we should also look at what unites them. That could be an important clue to what has gone wrong.Both their parties have come to represent the triumph of ideology over humanity and commonsense. Of course we need leadership with a strong sense of values and a clear sense of direction, but that is different from rigid ideological politics. I believe we have had it up to our necks with ideology in Britain, whether it is the half-baked Marxism of the left or the fanatical market-ism of the right. It is the enemy of change by consent \u2013 and unfortunately it has now taken over both the old Parties.They both also stand for a class struggle which most sensible people hoped had been finally put to sleep in Britain after the second world war. But no, the class war is alive and prospering in the Tory and Labour Parties. It is no coincidence. Their electoral prospects depend on keeping it alive. They are united in wanting to keep the nation divided.A third point of resemblance. They are both the loyal agents of special interests, big business for the Tories and the unions for Labour. Ask yourself why the City has done so well out of the Tories; with Lloyds protected from scandal; the Stock Exchange profitably re-shuffled at the expense of the private investor; and a rich stream of privatisation deals, crowding out more worthwhile investment in new industry.I suggest unequivocally that it is for the same shameful reason that the Labour Government of 1974 bent over backwards in its first two years to make life easier for the unions. It is because they both have to keep their paymasters happy. For both of them the old adage is true: \u2018whose bread I eat, whose song I sing.\u2019But the country as a whole pays for these insider deals - and the price Britain has paid for this ideological class\u2011based sectional leadership is immense. The special interests get looked after - but too often it has been at the expense of the public interest.There is another way of describing the public interest which I have always liked: \u2018the common weal,\u2019 the common good. That is what has been allowed to languish and decay while the sectional interests have grown fat.Yet we desperately need to recreate the sense of the public interest. We shall need new leadership which instead of acting for its clients, like the Tory and Labour Parties, speaks for the country as a whole - a partnership between all our citizens working together for the common weal.You know, Mrs. Thatcher and Mr. Kinnock like to talk about \u2018our people.\u2019 We all know who they mean. \u2018Our supporters, our friends, our class, our backers.\u2019 I can promise you that if you ever hear me or David Owen talking about \u2018our people\u2019 we shall mean something very different. We will mean the British people: poor and prosperous, North and South, worker and manager, black and white, men and women, young and old; all of the people.For only the public interest is strong enough to restrain the vested interests. Mr. Gladstone said it one hundred years ago: \u2018All the world over I will back the masses against the classes.\u2019The rock on which the public interest stands is our constitution, the only protection of our ancient liberties against the arbitrary power of the State.Alone among democratic countries Britain has an unwritten constitution. It rests upon a number of assumptions, the first of which is that those who hold power will not abuse their authority.The second is that Parliament is sovereign and government, accountable to it.The third is that the civil service owe their ultimate loyalty to the Crown, not simply to the government of the day.The fourth is that civil liberties are sufficiently safeguarded by Parliament and by an independent judiciary.The fifth is that public education to inform the citizen is adequately provided by a free press.The sixth is that government itself will remain limited: that the balance between the state and the individual, between the public and private sector, between central and local government, will not be overthrown.All these assumptions are now in jeopardy. The government\u2019s contempt for the principle of Parliamentary sovereignty is becoming more and more clear in its refusal to give adequate or accurate information on crucial questions either to the House of Commons or to its committees. Indeed, as we have seen over the Belgrano incident, ministers are prepared to engage in active misinformation to Parliament.As I hear each new twist of government justification on that matter, I cannot improve on the words Mr. Asquith used of the War Office during the First World War: \u2018They kept three sets of figures: one to mislead the public, one to mislead the Cabinet, and one to mislead themselves.\u2019The civil service over the past five years has been bruised and battered by a government which puts loyalty above objectivity and competence. The cry \u2018Is he one of us\u2019 shows the same attitude which led to the disastrous blunder of GCHQ.Whether it is bans on Trade Union membership or the abuse of the Official Secrets Act - there is a systematic and despicable attempt to intimidate public servants which, when it is coupled with repeated instances of misleading Parliament, is pushing us towards an authoritarian state.Liberals have never been satisfied that Britain\u2019s existing law and judicial system provides sufficient protection for the individual against the state. The accumulation of information in the hands of the state\u2019s agencies, as computer networks and files are centralised, provides a new threat against which the Government has so far offered only the weakest of safeguards.What of our free press? Well, it\u2019s not all that free.  Millions are being offered in circulation-boosting competitions; tens of millions pass hands as newspapers are bought and sold, without any reference to the balance of opinion or of free expression in an increasingly Conservative national press; it is money that counts, not freedom or democracy.On the face of it, television should be able to present a more balanced view. But in a sombre lecture given to the Edinburgh Television Festival earlier this year, Sir Denis Forman, Chairman of Granada TV, warned of \u2018the pressures that come filtering down from most employers in ITV - and even more within the BBC - to reflect the government view.\u2019He added that \u2018The protection of government information has become indiscriminating and obsessional, the motive not so much to protect the security of the state as the political comfort of ministers.\u2019Democratic institutions do not exist to make ministers comfortable. That is why in this session I reintroduced the Freedom of Information Bill.On a slightly less serious note, I sometimes wonder if the Prime Minister is a secret supporter of freedom of information. You used to have to squeeze information out of civil servants. Now the leaks are more like a burst water main under Whitehall gushing all the way to Fleet Street. I merely wish to make her disorderly process legal and open.But it is what the government is doing to local government which is perhaps the most worrying of all. Here is a Tory party which used to be firmly committed to the principle of limited government now pushing into effect the most massive centralisation of power in the hands of the executive.If a Labour government was introducing rate-capping and replacing the metropolitan councils with a new collection of nominated bodies under ministerial control, Conservative rhetoric would flow; it would be correctly, attacked as state socialism, imposing on every town and village in Britain the rule that the men in Whitehall know best.Here is a government which set out to redeem Mrs. Thatcher\u2019s pledge to abolish rates, which is instead stumbling blindly towards the virtual abolition of local democracy.And now if the documents leaked to us at the start of the week are correct they are turning their guns in precisely the same way on the administration of the nationalised industries.The virtue of an unwritten constitution, it used to be said, is that it is flexible. But if the flexible conventions on which our democracy rests are bent too far, they will break.There is one further constitutional safeguard we will introduce - repeal of the 1981 Nationality Act. Some of the strongest opposition to the Act came from the leaders of the Churches who unequivocally condemned it. In February the General Synod of the Church of England passed a motion pressing for substantial changes in the Act which members described as \u2018racist, unfair, divisive and repugnant to the Christian conscience.\u2019 That well known pillar of the Synod Mr. John Gummer prudently decided to stay away - so much for the Christian principles which he so ostentatiously parades at the slightest provocation - or even without it.The Act gives enormous discretion and huge powers to the Home Secretary. Fine if you are a prosperous and Christian family living in a Tory village in a county where a by-election is pending; the Home Secretary will then be graciously pleased to listen to all the representations which have been made and allow you to stay. I was delighted for Mr. a Mrs. Pereira, but equally I am appalled to consider what happened to an unemployed Bangladeshi woman, Afia Begum, who with her child born here, was ruthlessly deported, only because her husband died before she could be registered. And there are far, far too many similar cases of hardship inflicted on innocent people because of a vicious circle of oppression. We enact unjust racist laws, the poor and the powerless are trapped by them, and then when they appeal against them, we wash our hands, and piously declaim that the law must be obeyed.Those individual cases, and they are countless, which the Home Secretary so callously dismisses, are suffering human beings, victims of the inhuman laws which he so ruthlessly administers. And now, in a new departure from former practice, even MPs are not to be allowed to raise questions of immigration appeals, except in their own constituencies, and the whole tenor of Home Office attitudes is that all representations will now be considered counter-productive.This is doubly shameful for the Home Secretary; for he comes from a community which has known horrendous persecution and racial discrimination down the centuries - on this issue, at least, one might have hoped that a sense of humanity would triumph over conservative prejudice.So constitutional reform must be a central issue in the Alliance campaign. We aim to open up British government, to force ministers to justify themselves and their proposals before the public. We aim to give Parliament effective control over the executive. We aim to free the civil service from the covert pressures of executive secrecy, and to redraw the boundary between political advice and administrative discretion.We will introduce a Bill of Rights, to protect the citizen against the state; and we may need to reform the structure of the legal profession and judiciary. We will revitalise local democracy, cutting away at the spreading tentacles of nominated bodies and return local and regional decisions to democratic control. And we will, of course, give Britain what every other democratic country in Europe already has: a representative electoral system.The Thatcher economic experiment has failed. Look at the evidence: investment down, the economic indicators pointing down, manufactured trade in deficit, and unemployment inexorably creeping up. No wonder the pound is sliding to an all-time low, unable to resist the challenge of a strong dollar, No wonder that the flow of private capital out of Britain has become a flood.You remember the economic recovery we were promised, the recovery that would make all the hardship worthwhile. Well, we just had it - and most people didn\u2019t even notice.A change is of course essential. North Sea Oil production is at its peak. As it runs down, our economy will be exposed in all its weakness.Of course competition has its place. But the blind gods of the marketplace alone are not going to show us the way out of this industrial crisis.The only possible way forward is the Liberal way. It is actually to treat the talented people of this country as the precious resource they are, and to liberate their energy and enthusiasm to work together to rebuild a derelict economy.How do you do that? You do it by changing the tax system, tackling the poverty trap, reducing national insurance charges to encourage employers to take people on, especially the young and the long-term unemployed.You do it by educating and training people, developing and renewing each person\u2019s skills, as the Germans already do and the new French Prime Minister plans to do.You do it by a total government commitment to the new technology, with special education centres and training, tax incentives and credit-free loans for companies switching over to British technology,You do it by an incomes strategy which ends the Conservative policy of taking money from the wage-earner and handing it to the rich, and substitute a sense of fairness in which everyone shares in success rather than scrambling for paper wage increases. You relate that strategy to the greatest possible extension of shared profit and shared ownership, and the smaller units of the new industries are the ideal spawning ground for shared control and ownership.You build a partnership of private and public capital through regional development agencies and local enterprise initiatives. That will fertilise the economy at the grass roots, creating new companies and new jobs.You ensure that the government, on its own account and through nationalised industries, buys and invests in Britain - and you persuade large British companies to do the same, encouraging and developing a multitude of smaller companies who supply them. Like Marks & Spencer, each large company should recognise its responsibility for developing British supplies and raising their standards.Basically what you do - and what an Alliance Government will do - is to make people partners in a common enterprise. Partners in changing their lives, their neighbourhoods, their workplaces, and in the end their country. We need a new industrial revolution in Britain, but it won\u2019t happen without a profound change in attitudes. That means putting people first. Then we shall have a successful revolution by consent.For it is our aim to form an Alliance Government. And that is a realistic aim. We should not underestimate the strength of the foundations we have already built.The tide is more than ever running our way. In the six by-elections of this year, we have won one, and come within a whisker of two more. In these contests, almost 37% supported the Alliance - only 32% the Conservative Government and even less - 29% - the official Labour opposition.The Gallup Poll ratings have averaged 22% throughout that period - again, an unusually good indicator of our underlying strength, and broadly reflecting our performance in the European elections. Last week\u2019s Gallup Poll put our rating at 25.5% - back to our strength in the General Election.And of course our force in local government grows daily. At the beginning of the last decade, Liberals had only begun to break into the municipal strongholds of Tory and Labour.But it is in this decade that we have moved on - holding and sharing power in an increasing number of Town Halls. The two-party system may hang on in Westminster - but locally, it\u2019s being knocked to pieces. And only this last Thursday, Liberals won an astonishing 12 seats in local council by-elections. No wonder we look with confidence to the County council elections next year.Our electoral base is therefore strong - and growing. We are vastly more experienced and hard-headed - in our campaigning and in our determination to achieve victory.What this Assembly signals is nothing less than the start of a three year election campaign, not a three week one, to offer our people an alternative government. In a real sense the Labour Party has become an obstacle in the way of defeating the Conservative government. They may still be the official opposition. But we are the effective opposition. Because no one can take seriously a party so deeply divided on every major issue. I do not blame Mr. Kinnock personally. He, like Michael Foot before him, is trying to do a hopeless job. They cannot reconcile the irreconcilable.The loony left are taking over in the constituencies, in the council chambers, in some of the unions and already among the back benchers of the Commons.They are already stuck with a new programme less acceptable than the last. Nationalisation without compensation and an economic policy described by Roy Hattersley during his quest for leadership as \u2018literally incredible.\u2019Our task in the Alliance is to finish the job we began at the last election of elbowing Labour out of the way and going for Government in 1987 or 1988.Of course if we don\u2019t achieve that we may have to use our second or substantial third place to secure both electoral reform and stable reforming government. We must in that event declare our readiness to work with others for these objectives.But make no mistake, our purpose must be to offer the British people at the next election a choice of government which will take us in a major reforming direction. That was a primary objective in forming our alliance with the SDP. We must have no lesser aim.When I say that, the Tories sometimes say, \u2018that\u2019s all very well, but who have you got?\u2019Who have we got? What a nerve! What is it they think we cannot match?The judgement of Patrick Jenkin?The humanity and charm of Norman Tebbit?The modesty of Michael Heseltine?The charisma of Geoffrey Howe?The down to earth common sense of Keith Joseph?Or is it the sheer weight of John Selwyn Gummer?Perhaps it is just the sharp shooting of Willie Whitelaw?I tell you this, the Iron Lady\u2019s team is in fact no match at all for that of the Steel Man.I lead a team of highly talented young MPS and of experienced peers. Together with the formidable ministerial record of many in the SDP and the wealth of talent among the candidates of both parties I have absolute confidence that we would provide as fresh and able a government as took power in 1906 after nine years of Conservative rule.Who would have thought five years ago that we would have taking part in our Assembly a former Chairman of the National Coal Board, a former Chancellor of the Exchequer and a former Chief of the Defence Staff. Who would have thought that we would have grown from 1000 to 2000 councillors.We have developed a maturity that allows us to face the challenge of entering government - and the difficult negotiations that go with it - with great confidence.We now have less than three years to prepare for that decisive test. The dramatic victory at Portsmouth South illustrated the potency of a united and integrated Alliance.The Alliance has continued to grow together since last year\u2019s general election. And campaigning together, we will grow yet closer.Our first priority in the year ahead is to build up our membership and strengthen our local and national organisation. Next week you will be out on the doorstep, seeking out new members in a determined drive. Work at it. We know the potential is there. It is vital to our challenge.Our second priority is to get a complete slate of first-class parliamentary candidates into the field, Candidate selection must be settled amicably and quickly, Every month that passes shortens the time which we have to prepare for the coming fight.Our third priority lies in refining our policy, Abiding by the unchanging principles of Liberalism - yet developing new ideas to meet the challenge of the 1990s.I have a message for every Liberal and Social Democrat throughout the country. You represent the only hope of saving Britain from the disaster of a third-term Thatcher Government.If we are to succeed over the next three years we will have to surrender small parts of our individual interests, to build a platform we can all stand on, comfortably, proudly, singing out the truth for the nation to hear, its message so clear and commanding, that no slick advertising campaign, no amount of press bias, no amount of unfair broadcasting coverage, will be able to muffle it.I want to make a special appeal to the young to come in and join us now in this three year crusade.The policies of this Government and their political allies the Reaganites have not made this world a safer or a better place.They have done nothing to solve the problems of the Middle East which as I saw for myself again last week remains a highly dangerous flashpoint of world tension. With their money and political support they have in many parts of the, world backed the wrong people. It is not Communism that is the enemy in Latin America it is injustice and poverty.We have totally lacked in Britain in these last years any real commitment to our friends or to our ideals, or any consistent priority for basic human rights. We Liberals champion equally the Refuseniks and the Sakharovs, the Bishop Tutus and Nelson Mandelas struggling for freedom in South Africa.And how long can we go on turning our backs as this Government has done on the international responsibilities imposed on us by our own history, our own wealth and the crying needs of others.I spoke at the outset of the sort of country we want Britain to be. A country is not strong because of the size of its armies and it is not powerful because of its world wide investments. A country today can be influential in the world by the size of its heart and the breadth of its mind, and that is the role I want for Britain. We must give the lead in ending the condition described in Housman\u2019s lines where:Envious of heart, blind-eyed, with tongues confoundedNation by nation still goes unforgivenIn wrath and fear by jealousies surrounded,Building proud towers which shall not reach to heaven.This country itself is not like a grey blanket, a piece unbroken cloth, the same colour and texture throughout. I see it more as a quilt, many patches, many pieces, many shapes, all woven and held together by a common thread. The white, the black, the industrialist, the trade unionist, the small businessman, the farmer, the unemployed, the peace campaigner, the environmentalist, the disabled, the mentally handicapped.Even in our fractured state all of us count and all of us fit in somewhere.When I was at university there was a particularly odious but short-lived student society called P.L.U. - People Like Us - which existed to wear certain old school ties and scarves. In their very different ways the Conservative and Labour parties exist only for people like themselves.A society which as they do emphasises uniformity is one which creates intolerance and hate. They want others to conform to their view of how we should live. Our standard in all activities should be one of excellence, but our routes to its achievement may be as numerous as there are Britons who pursue it.In a true sense, neither the Conservative nor Labour Parties can any longer claim to be national parties. There are admittedly still some places where our Alliance parties are not thick on the ground. But look at the Tory party: in the great industrial cities of Glasgow and Liverpool they have no longer a single MP.You will search the entire country south of the line from London to Bristol and not find a single Labour MP. Yet we are building everywhere.One of the great figures of my constituency, John Buchan, wrote of early seventeenth century Britain that: \u2018the old world was crumbling and there was no unanimity about the new.\u2019 Britain today needs to decide whether to stand still with the past or move forward. And at the moment we simply lack the national leadership capable of creating a coherent framework of \u2018unanimity about the new.\u2019How can they, when the very raison d\u2019être of the Tory and Labour parties is against the search for consensus or unanimity?Unlike these parties, we genuinely embrace men and women of every condition, of every economic class, or every creed, of every orientation, in every part of the country. In our family are gathered everyone from the abject poor in the slums of our great cities to the enlightened well-to-do in the suburbs. White collar and blue collar, young professional, the teenaged unemployed. They\u2019re all there.We are proud of this diversity which you won't find next month in the Labour and Tory conferences. The different people we represent have many points of view. We have debates, even arguments. Some criticise us for it, but it is part of our strength.At the end we are stronger for having listened to each other. If we need any inspiration to set aside our small differences all we need do is reflect on the Tory policy of divide and rule to see how grievously it has injured our land.I spoke earlier of our commitment to the public interest against special interest. We have an obligation to each other to build a finer democracy, one in which our fellow citizens have the chance to work, to make the world better for their children and to be protected in these moments when they would not be able to protect themselves.The young of this generation must exercise the right to dream. You must face the reality that is, but then dream of the reality that ought to be, that must be. Live beyond the pain of reality with that dream of a bright tomorrow.Use hope and imagination as tools for survival and progress.I see a Britain in our time where greed, self-interest and division are vanquished by the common good, and the national interest.We believe that government should be a positive force to solve problems, and that public service is a worthwhile vocation.We believe in only the government we need but we insist on all the government we need.Our bold strategies are rooted in our basic Liberal values and we have the courage to carry them out. What is called for is an exercise in government at its best.We believe in government of fairness and reason, a government that doesn\u2019t promise to do what it cannot do.A government strong enough to use the words \u2018love\u2019 and \u2018compassion\u2019 and capable of converting our hopes and dreams into practical reality.If you share our vision of what Britain could be, come with us on this three year haul.It will happen if we make it happen, and we are determined to make it happen.

aVThe whistle has blown for kick-off in the second half of this parliament. By half-time we had built up a good score. We must keep our nerve as the government team starts to use rougher and dirtier tactics in the second half.They have good reason to be afraid. We are playing up-field. We surged forward in the county council elections in May. In large parts of Britain Alliance councillors are giving people the experience of a new sort of open and effective local government. Since May, in local by-elections across the whole country, voters have given victory after famous victory to Liberals and our SDP allies. And not just at the expense of the Tories. We have been making inroads into Labour heartlands such as the Nottingham coalfields and Inner London.In fact our lead has been widening. You don\u2019t have to bank on the opinion polls. If you add up all the votes cast in council by-elections over the last three months we have polled 37%, Labour 32% and the Conservatives only 29%. Here in Scotland we have reduced Labour control in Aberdeen to a knife-edge and across the silvery Tay we control North East Fife District Council.Our steady march forward in local government has been matched by the great parliamentary triumph of Brecon and Radnor. But as we have seen so vividly in these last two weeks Brecon was no isolated beacon of hope.It\u2019s not surprising that the other parties feel threatened by our success. Last week I warned the SDP to expect a furious campaign of misrepresentation by the Tories and their tame Press lords. It has already started.It is obviously going to be noisy and squalid. So I wonder if, in the public interest, I might make a sort of political Noise Abatement proposal to the new Tory Party Chairman: \u2018Norman, if you stop telling lies about us, we\u2019ll stop telling the truth about you.\u2019Incidentally I notice Norman Tebbit has acquired a new assistant, Mr. Jeffrey Archer, who, I am told by Debbie Owen, writes books. A novel appointment. Looking at them together, I found myself thinking of the old axiom that truth is stranger than fiction.Internally we have made good progress too: together with out SDP partners we have reached agreement in almost 600 of the parliamentary seats and many candidates are already chosen and campaigning.My message to them is this: you are our \u2018MPs in waiting.\u2019 You have the support of a team of regional organisers, of a newly-formed campaign unit in Parliament and of the joint policy programme \u2018Priorities for the Nineties\u2019 which the Alliance will publish in 1986. We shall also have a streamlined Party Headquarters in a new suite of offices in the National Liberal Club. Sadly, the man who has done so much to build this electoral fighting machine, John Spiller, has had to retire through ill health. John, we thank you and hope you will be fit enough to join us at the next election. That\u2019s one that nobody should miss.When that election comes, the Alliance will be the only credible alternative to Thatcherism. We are established everywhere and growing everywhere. By contrast Labour is a party in retreat, driven back to its traditional class and regional fortresses.I don\u2019t propose to waste the time of this Assembly by dwelling on the so-called Official Opposition. Yet spare just one thought for poor Mr. Kinnock, leading a party in long-term decline. He has accused me of putting the hype into hypothetical. Posing as an alternative Prime Minister he has certainly put the babble into the impro-bable. I say poor Mr. Kinnock because the leadership of the Labour Party has become a position of responsibility without power.The power belongs to the trade union paymasters, like. Ron Todd, Ken Gill and Arthur Scargill, and to the town-hail militants like Ted Knight in London, Derek Hatton in Liverpool and Alex Wood in Edinburgh. They, for their part, have no sense of responsibility to anyone, certainly not their members or electors. Power is all they care about. But let me tell you this. Come the election the British people will refuse both responsibility and power to Labour\u2019s warring factions - and they will be right to do so.So we must very seriously prepare ourselves for government - and incidentally, William, I think you got your proposition the wrong way round. I wouldn\u2019t say that Liberals are not ready for government. It is government that isn\u2019t ready for the Liberals. Whitehall is going to have to come to terms with a different way of working - from a reforming Alliance, with a more open style.But preparing for government is not just a matter of having effective administrative machinery and the right policies. I want today to concentrate on the values and attitudes which make good government possible in a complicated modern democracy like ours. The values and attitudes of this government are plain wrong, which is why their policies are wrong and why they cannot succeed in introducing many of the changes which are needed. The old politics are running out of steam because they are running out of consent.Good government works with the grain, not against the grain. That is the trouble with Thatcherism it goes against the grain.You sometimes get the feeling that the Prime Minister\u2019s definition of the enemy within has not been expanded to include most of the British people. We are all \u2018moaning ninnies\u2019 now. Her highest ideals are the shabby values of Dallas or Dynasty, where the poor are kept safely off the screen.In pursuit of the fast buck, Thatcherism has been prepared to leave a trail of destruction behind it, but this radicalism of the right has been strangely selective. Thatcherism hasn\u2019t tackled the real obstacles to progress - the professional closed shops, the lucrative old boy deals in the City, the excessive overtime that puts people out of work, the cover-ups in Whitehall, the inefficiency in Parliament or the concentration of half the nation\u2019s wealth into the hands of the few.No, the target of the new wreckers of the right has been the wealth of institutions that embody the basic British values of fairness and tolerance; institutions which are admired abroad as at home, and which best express what I call the British genius, that makes our country special. Just look at a few examples.Take the BBC. Now Aunty BBC is by no means perfect but nevertheless we all have reason to be grateful for its existence. It is a strong and respected pillar of liberal democracy in Britain, admired and envied in other countries throughout the world.Yet this government, irritated by the independence of the BBC, has set out to commercialise it, to control it and to dismember it. Friends of democratic pluralism should be friends of the BBC, determined to defend it from the Prime Minister and her philistine friends.Aunty is our guarantee that Nanny does not get things all her own way.Take another manifestation of the British genius, the scientific research on which our future depends.In this century British scientists have won more Nobel Prizes than any country except the USA. Our scientists command immense international respect. Yet through indiscriminate cost-cutting, the Government has been attacking them and their prospects in a way which makes me tremble for our commercial future. Laboratories are closing, entire research units are being disbanded and vital equipment is not being purchased. The Medical Research Council, the Agricultural Research Council, the Natural Environment Research Council and the Scientific and Engineering Council are all under pressure. You can see the results. The overseas brain-drain of able young scientists is accelerating. Unfortunately this is part of a wider pattern of neglect of higher education of all kinds. The contraction of universities and colleges at the very time when we should be investing in our future files in the face of common sense. A further expression of the British genius has been our history of local democracy. We ought to be building on that tradition. Our people should have and wish to have more say in the decisions affecting their lives. The process of government has become too complex. We aim to simplify it.To that end, within two years of winning the General Election, we are determined to introduce the legislation needed to provide for the setting up of Scottish and Welsh Parliaments - assemblies fashioned to meet the distinct needs and aspirations of their respective nations, and with local government streamlined in both countries into a single tier of effective, multi-purpose authorities, close to the people.That pattern of decentralisation, once established in a legislative framework, will also allow us to shift power to the people and regions of England as the demand takes shape.The dead hand of centralisation must be resisted wherever this Tory government extends its grip; not only here in Scotland but increasingly over local authorities throughout Britain; for the Alderman\u2019s daughter has attacked the very principle of local government itself.Liberals have long been critics of both the GLC and the metropolitan counties. But we have never been attracted to the idea of tearing down without putting something better in its place.Moreover; a mixture of political prejudice and administrative frustration cannot justify her unconstitutional abolition of elected authorities without consent. Abolition, rate-capping, financial penalties, the remorseless reduction in rate support grant, the freezing of £6,000 million capital receipts \u2011 in fact the endless stream of interference with local government does not defeat the government\u2019s political opponents. What it does is to destroy local democracy itself.Voters turn away in cynical despair from the powerlessness of what should be their Councils; and fewer and fewer men and women of goodwill feel it is worthwhile freely giving their time and energy in the service of the local community. The genius that inspired Chamberlain\u2019s Birmingham or Morrison\u2019s London, which made the boroughs and the shires the first flowers of British democracy, is being snuffed out. Now the grey wastes of the \u2018republic of mediocrity,\u2019 in which the \u2018woman in Whitehall\u2019 knows best, threatens to replace the local autonomy and variety which once were our pride. Another element of what makes this country unique is our matchless countryside - William Blake\u2019s \u2018green and pleasant land.\u2019 In the 1930s Green Belts - and her example of British genius - were first introduced to stop the ruin of the land by the uncontrolled sprawling development of the towns and cities. Yet incredibly this government is now moving in to attack the Green Belts at the behest of a consortium of building developers who want the easy profits from developing green field sites. At Hook in Hampshire earlier this year I supported those protesting at having 6,000 new houses dumped next to their village. They won that fight but now the threat is aimed at a 720 acre green field site at Tillingham Hall in Essex.The government\u2019s own figures show that over 18,000 acres of derelict land are currently held by public authorities in the South-East alone. Certainly we need more houses but our priority should be to build them in our run-down and neglected cities, not in our precious countryside.Another expression of the British genius has been to look outward from these islands to the world. That quality has never been more badly needed than today but under this government Britain\u2019s influence for good around the world has been dissipated. We may be only a middle-ranking power nowadays but our history and international experience give us a unique opportunity to be a force for justice; for human rights; for peace and disarmament. The present British government has become identified with the most narrow-minded and conservative elements in the world.In a European Community, which is seeking greater political unity and completion of the internal market, the Prime Minister\u2019s contribution has been broken-bottle diplomacy, hectoring our friends and abusing her colleagues. She has lagged behind the civilised community of nations again and again: on disarmament talks where she refuses to put Polaris on the negotiating table, frustrates the prospects for a Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and the renewal of the Non-Proliferation Treaty and pursues the blatant unilateral nuclear escalation of Trident; on Central America where the government has ranged itself consistently with the forces of reaction; on the Middle East, where she looks for what Britain can gain from the conflict, not for what we can contribute to its solution; and on South Africa where she overrides the Foreign Office in seeing \u2018positive aspects\u2019 in President Botha\u2019s stonewalling speech and where we now stand isolated in our refusal to support sanctions.Martin Luther King once spoke of \u2018the appalling silence of the good people.\u2019 Because Mrs. Thatcher cares more for Britain\u2019s investment in South Africa than for the basic civil rights of the majority people of that country, the good people of Britain have been silenced. Gagged by their own government.Mrs. Thatcher mistakes the attitudes of the good British people. She thinks they share her slavish devotion to Ronald Reagan. She thinks they believe with her that everyone who opposes the tin-pot dictators and millionaire landlords of the Third World must be a communist. Our Prime Minister under-rates the tradition of imagination and generosity in Britain towards the poor and wretched of the world. We saw it when people crammed into village and town halls to hear about the Brandt Report - and more recently when the famine in Ethiopia was shown on television it was the people who led the way. After Band Aid, Live Aid demonstrated that the spontaneous outburst of concern had deep and enduring roots. The good people led the way while the government found its extra aid for Ethiopia and Sudan by raiding other parts of our already reduced aid budget. The people put the government to shame. Within twenty-five years four out of five people will live in the developing world.If the nations of the North cannot speak to those of the South: if the international economic crisis, and the huge rise in indebtedness is not tackled imaginatively; if trade withers as protectionism and chauvinism grow, if we continue to see growing expenditure on arms in both East and West, we shall fail. There will be no world unless we find the way to one world.The ideal of public service is central to the British spirit. Yet this government has set out to denigrate public servants and the whole public sector. The damage that has been done to the morale of the civil service is reflected in the rising numbers of men and women leaving, and in the leaks which continue to seep from disillusioned civil servants despite draconian efforts to maintain official secrecy.I am not just talking about senior civil servants. Top people have been well looked after. It is the dedicated ordinary public servant wham we take for granted, clerical officers who struggle to deal with the mountains of government paper, customs officers trying to stem the flood of hard drugs into Britain, the social security staff who find themselves caught between their clients and an uncaring government, the inland revenue staff operating an inequitable and over-complicated tax system, the nurses, who are expected to work for love and loyalty; the teachers, undervalued by a government which cares far more about private education than public education, and by a Secretary of State who would scarcely survive for half an hour in a secondary school classroom. It isn\u2019t just the holding-down of salaries which has depressed the morale of so many of those who work for the common good of our community. It is the government\u2019s evident lack of respect for the contribution they make.Sir Robert Armstrong, the senior civil servant in the land, himself the recipient of a 48% increase in pay, circulated a civil service memorandum last year which blurred the boundary between official loyalty to the government of the day and the wider loyalty to the crown. It\u2019s a dangerous development to suggest that officials must in all circumstances obey the instructions of their political superiors; we put people on trial in Nuremberg for doing that. And with real vindictiveness the government is still pursuing those staff at GCHQ who are right to insist that the defence of a free society must mean the defence of free trade unions.And so at the end of eight years of Conservative government, Britain will be a poorer country in every way - less prosperous, meaner in spirit, with less to be proud of. Yes, the rich will be richer - but this is the only respect in which the Thatcher revolution will have succeeded. The next government - and I believe it will be the Alliance next - will face the grim reality of the post oil era with a weakened economy, a more divided society and widespread pessimism about the future. The legacy we inherit will be a heavy mortgage on Britain\u2019s future.So what will we do about it?We must embark on a revolution of our own, a revolutionary shift in values and attitudes.First, we must rekindle the British genius. We must junk all this monetarist and socialist ideology and get back to basics. And for any Liberal the basics are very simple - they are the potential of each individual. We must liberate all the wasted energy of the people of this country by finding new ways to work together rather than against each other. We must create a new partnership in every company, in every community and in the nation as a whole.The role of government is not to command - as Conservatives and Socialists both believe - it is to enable: to enable each individual to use his or her talents to the full - and incidentally what sort of country is it that fails to use all the talents of half its people, its women - to enable industry and commerce to thrive; to enable the arts and learning to flourish; and to enable political decisions to be made at the level of the people most affected by them.An enabling government, which treats each citizen as a partner, which shares its ideas instead of imposing them, is going to be essential in the difficult decades ahead.But at the same time, we need sane positive new ideas from government. Who cares if we mix up socialism and capitalism a bit if we can get things moving. Let me illustrate what I mean by sketching out three proposals:First, partnership in industry.The key to industrial recovery in Britain does not lie in the vaults of City banks but in the capable hands of the managers and employees of our companies. There is a wealth of energy, enthusiasm and inventiveness waiting to be unlocked.How do we turn the key? By transforming each employee from a wage-slave into a partner in his or her enterprise. As John Stuart Mill put it, \u2018by accustoming them to the comprehension of joint interests, the management of joint concerns - uniting them instead of isolating them from one another.\u2019Partnership is an idea whose time has came, and only our partnership of the Alliance can introduce it because it threatens the whole basis of Conservative and Socialist ideology. They want a struggle between the two sides of industry. We want a successful joint concern, a share economy.The Conservative government remains firmly opposed to legislation for employee involvement. They thought they could get away with a vague requirement for companies to report on their employee involvement policies each year.However, a recent study of 100 company reports by the Institute of Directors has demonstrated convincingly that even this limited approach is not working. The survey found that only 9% of the companies provided any information.I cannot help wondering why the Government is dragging its heels.Employee involvement not only improves business efficiency, but also improves employee responsibility and job satisfaction. But we want to go further. I\u2019ve spent some time in the last year visiting companies who\u2019ve been a bit bolder in this field.At Jaguar in Coventry I was impressed by the remarkable recovery the company has achieved in the last few years. The introduction of an incentive scheme, an employee share ownership scheme and improved communication, were central to their recovery plan.At the National Freight Consortium, an organisation which spans the country, more than 82% of all shares are owned by the workforce - and two-thirds of the employees now have some stake in their company. Trading profit has more than doubled since the buy-out in 1981.The Baxi Heating Company near Preston - one of whose works council meetings I attended last month - is even more remarkable. They have long believed in employee participation. They operate a cash profit sharing scheme and in 1983 the old family company was converted into a partnership, making Baxi the largest manufacturing group in Britain to be wholly owned by its employees. The entire workforce from top management to the shop floor have become owners. Supervision is kept to a minimum. Jobs are rotated on a regular basis. Everyone eats in the same canteen.Independent researchers have been consistently surprised by the strength of the commitment and morale within the company. Labour-management relations are good, job satisfaction is high and the company is successful financially.Firms like these should be an example to us all. Employees should everywhere be treated as full partners, their contribution valued and respected and this way the trench between labour and management can be finally bridged. The CBI this morning has warned that pay rises in the private sector should be held to about 4% and they are probably right, but what about profits? They say employees are \u2018showing an increased understanding of the need for profits.\u2019 Wouldn\u2019t the employees show even more understanding, if on top of the 4%, a share of those profits was going into their pockets?For the nation\u2019s economy profit sharing could reduce our susceptibility to wage-push inflation. Our Alliance government will insist on it as part of our comprehensive incomes strategy and so help to create jobs.All this sounds plain commonsense. But don\u2019t think you\u2019ll get industrial partnership out of a Labour government or a Conservative government. They won\u2019t do it because they can\u2019t do it. Second, a partnership to regenerate our inner cities. If ever there was a problem which needs sane new thinking it is their plight - as the events in Handsworth last week so tragically reminded us.I have no doubt there were criminal acts and they should be dealt with by the law. But criminals alone do not produce riots. The riots in British cities which we have seen too often in recent years, whether sparked off by criminals, agitators or simply by aggressive and frustrated young men, depend on the dry stubble of despair to get the blaze really going.My eyes were really opened this summer. I spent a week in Liverpool. I saw its sunny side and its slummy side. On the sunny side was a cellar jazz club in a renovated dockside warehouse. On the slummy side were boarded up shops and broken glass. On the sunny side was the housing co-operative in Vauxhall who invited me in to one of their community meetings planning the next stage of their development for 200 families. On the slummy side were the semi-abandoned tower blocks; on the sunny side was the cheerful welcome of the black self-help group; on the slummy side was the devastation of hard drugs.One drug addict I talked with put it bluntly. He said they saw no reason for giving up drugs. What was there to give up drugs for? Where was the job? Where was the hope? For them rather the unreality of drugs than the reality of the life on offer.What is needed in our inner city areas is a ferment of new ideas. I found some on the sunny side. People working together to get things done for their own communities. And that must be our starting point. It is no good telling them to get on their bike and go elsewhere. It is precisely the people with initiative, the self starters, who must be persuaded to stay if these communities are to thrive. Otherwise, we shall be left with a permanent underclass of those who cannot escape - the single parents, the unskilled, the ethnic minorities, the elderly - eking out a frightened existence in the twilight zones.We must make the inner cities fit places to live in, to encourage back the talented who have left and to bring in new blood. It is not the faceless concrete monuments to municipal socialism that we need; not the Eastern European-style banners disfiguring the finest public buildings in Liverpool or Edinburgh or Islington; it is a programme of detailed small scale investment in renovating and brightening up run-down housing, in planting grass and trees on the waste sites, in building low cost housing that young people can afford and in incentives for the creation of thriving small businesses.We must also give the people a stake in their communities with elected neighbourhood councils; we must bring together the police and the public in a combined effort to defeat criminals and protect the community. I believe it is the local community itself which, if democratically organised, will be the best planner for its own needs.Most important of all, we must give people something to do. The unemployed individual becomes bored and frustrated; television brings into the home a world which is full of enticing goods and lifestyles which the unemployed cannot afford. No wonder bitterness sets in and sometimes boils over.Our Alliance government will match the people waiting for something to do with the tasks waiting to be done.I now turn to a third area where the partnership approach will help us. Using new ideas to solve old problems is nowhere more relevant than in generating capital investment for our run-down economy. Make no mistake, if we win the election our Chancellor will find the public expenditure cupboard is very bare indeed. Government borrowing will worsen by the £3 to £4 billion per year of privatisation asset sales no longer available. Nigel Lawson is currently cooking the books by calling these reduced spending. In Richard Wainwright\u2019s memorable phrase he has been selling the furniture to pay the housekeeping bills.The massive oil revenues, worth nearly £13 billion during the Thatcher years and so tragically frittered away, will be falling fast.The strains on the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement will be immense. The Alliance must not over-promise.As we showed in our excellent economic motion yesterday, we do not propose to solve our economic problems by massive commitments to extra public spending.We must find ways instead to use public funds to unlock private investment. There is a wealth of private investment money, both here and from abroad, looking for a secure return. Socialists turn up their noses at private investment and Tories, as we have seen, are opposed to public investment on equally doctrinaire grounds.What the Alliance must do is to discard these shibboleths and initiate a new partnership between public and private investment, using public funds to prime the private pump. Relatively small investments by the government can stimulate massive private investment, creating hundreds of thousands of new jobs.For instance Industrial Development Bonds in the United States offer tax relief to the private lender on the interest paid on loans for construction and other industrial investment projects. This incentive also serves to lower the rate of return the project has to yield and thus encourages risk-taking.In the State of New Jersey alone billion dollars of new private investment has been stimulated in this way, creating around 100,000 new jobs. A recent study in Massachusetts found that annual growth in new jobs in companies using IDBs was over 24%. More jobs.This is the sort of gearing of public and private money we need. Government grants to regional and local enterprise agencies. More jobs.Last year the government turned down nearly 100 million pounds in Derelict Land Grants. Yet every pound of grant produces £6 of new private investment. We will use those grants to the full. More jobs.Home Improvement and Repair Grants should be expanded yet the government is cutting them back - a curious decision in all conscience when new housing starts are at such a low level, and half a million homes in Britain lack sanitation. Even more indefensible when you reflect that each pound of home improvement grant can generate up to £30 of private investment. More Home Improvement Grants, more jobs.Government could help our exporters too by an effective partnership, where soft loans and guarantee finance were readily available for large overseas orders. What about the government paying for feasibility studies, as the USA did in Hong Kong before winning the order to build the new airport, with lucrative orders for a consortium of American companies? Here of all places Britain should have been on the inside track. More help to exporters, more jobs.This partnership approach between government and the private sector is the way to generate investment. It is the Alliance approach. More financial partnership, more jobs.The Alliance government will roll up its sleeves positively to help regenerate the economy, rather than stand back and wring its hands like this government.The Alliance government will work with industry instead of threatening them with direction and penalties as Mr. Hattersley would like to do. In short, the Alliance government will be an enabling government, not, like Labour would be, a disabling government. That is what I mean by becoming partners in one nation.The Alliance is not static and it cannot be so. We are moving closer, working together better and sparking off ideas on each other.We have substantial joint policy efforts which are now feeding into the deliberative processes of the two parties. Joint economic and constitutional proposals; a thoughtful and well-considered document from the joint commission on Northern Ireland; and next year we expect to have the Report of the joint commission on Defence and Disarmament before us.Do not imagine, as you sometimes read in the press, that the purpose of these Commissions is to find the lowest common denominator of agreement between two inflexibly opposed positions. Their purpose is not to negotiate but to reason together. It is to deploy new thinking and new expertise with the help of distinguished Commission memberships from inside and outside the parties. We need that stream of new ideas and we should welcome it. It will strengthen the Alliance.And don\u2019t undersell one of the greatest virtues of the joint leadership of our Alliance. A Prime Minister with a deputy PM who is leader of his own party will bring to an end the quasi-Presidential system of government where one person\u2019s views, prejudices and constant meddling interfere with the judgement and collective responsibility of a strong cabinet team.When we win power you will have to go back to 1906 to find a parallel occasion when the cabinet consisted of so many people who had not held office before. Yet what was the verdict on that government? \u2018There has not been throughout British history a more talented team of men in government,\u2019 wrote one historian adding: \u2018four became Prime Ministers\u2019 - that should be enough to keep everybody happy.There should be no confusion about the Alliance aim: we want to take power, to share power, and to use power.That is our aim. The recovery of the country now rests with our Alliance.When the French revolutionaries raised the battle cry of \u2018liberty, equality and fraternity,\u2019 they stirred the whole of Europe.Since then many millions of words have been spoken and written on liberty. It is a central concern of ours.Volumes have been produced on equality. It too is a concern of ours.But what has happened to fraternity? That is what has been trampled underfoot in Britain for so many years. That is what we alone can recapture.John Stuart Mill - in what might have been a premonition of Thatcherism and Socialism alike - wrote:'A state which dwarfs its men in order that they may be more docile instruments in its hands will find that with small men no great thing can really be accomplished.'Our task is to enable every individual to flourish, to grow tall, to join us in achieving great things. We will have to redouble our efforts. I say to those who\u2019ve been watching over these last two weeks at home \u2013 don\u2019t just sit on the sidelines and cheer us on. Come in and join us now becauseThere is a tide in the affairs of menWhich, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune;On such a full sea are we now afloat. The tide has been out - for Liberalism and for Britain - for too long. Our nation has been beached, strewn with the rocks of class conflict, our economy left high and dry by our competitors, our institutions stagnant and our people stranded. But now we can all sense the change and take heart. Our message to Britain is:Here comes the turnHere comes the turn of the tide.

aVOne of the traditional sports of party conferences is guessing the length of the Leader\u2019s ovation. I don\u2019t advise anyone to take a bet on that this afternoon.I had planned to address my speech to a wider public on the serious social and industrial problems which confront Britain today. I shall do that anyway, but that part will now have to be shorter - because I want to address some very particular words to the Liberal Party and our allies in the SDP. People outside understand that applause is no substitute for getting the programme right. There has been a special urgency to our deliberations this week. An election cannot be far away. The destructive years of Thatcherism are drawing to a close, and a very large slice of the electorate are undecided how to vote.We will be ready for that election just as soon as the Prime Minister nerves herself to call it. For us campaigning is a way of life.Our opponents are both aware and frightened of our strengths on the ground. Whatever the ups and downs of the national polls, we have been the election-winners of this Parliament. We have polled more votes in parliamentary by-elections than the Tory or Labour parties. This year we have achieved the great triumph of Ryedale, and we gave the Conservative and Labour parties the fright of their lives in West Derbyshire and Newcastle-under-Lyme. Yet again we have shown that there is no such thing as a safe Tory or Labour seat against the challenge of the Alliance. We are ready to join battle in Knowsley North.In local government elections our performance has been even more impressive. I say \u2018even more\u2019 because the absolute consistency of progress and success in local government in every part of the country cannot be written off as a flash in the pan. In over 250 by-elections since the general election Liberals and Social Democrats have swept the board. Those are the polls that matter, the real polls. In every part of Britain we are advancing and the other parties are retreating. In many authorities, for the first time for many years, local people have been getting a sample of Liberal government, and they are coming back for more.And note something about our 3,000 elected councillors. We have a higher proportion of women than the other parties and a very much higher proportion of councillors under the age of 45. Now that this Assembly has changed our selection procedures, I expect to see more women among the MPs who will join us at the general election. Let us be clear what that election will be about. It will be about who will form the next government, of course, but it will also be about the sort of government the country needs. As well as the choice between Tory, Labour and Alliance, Britain will also be choosing between bad government and good government.I hardly need to explain what bad government is. We have had bad government for decades, from Labour and Tory governments alike. Rather confusingly, they call it strong government.What does this \u2018strength\u2019 consist of? It consists of a highly ideological minority party of one variety or another, using a corrupt electoral system to grab the whole power of the state. That isn\u2019t strength, it\u2019s fraud.When I look at that vast Tory majority in the House of Commons, when I see those serried rows of smug faces, I like to remind myself how they got there. Not by their merits but thanks to the distortions of the electoral system, and I think of Tennyson\u2019s line, \u2018Their honour rooted in dishonour stood.\u2019Real strength in a parliamentary democracy doesn\u2019t consist of imposing a minority view on the majority, it consists of finding the policies and giving the leadership which can unite the nation. Democratic government is about consent, not domination.The essential prerequisite for good government is the introduction of a fair voting system. Proportional representation is the way to get the strength of the majority behind the government, and of ensuring that minorities are protected at the same time.That is why we are committed to electoral reform. Not for short-term party advantage but for long-term fair representation and good government.Our opponents must be under no illusion. Our commitment to a reformed electoral system is unqualified and absolute. We shall use all our weight and power at the earliest opportunity available to introduce PR. It is the key to the door to good government.Let me define what I mean by \u2018good government.\u2019 First, it should be constructive. Governments should build on the achievements of their predecessors, however few and far between they may be. For instance, we should build on the trade union reforms of this government, which are one of their few positive achievements. It will be a tragedy if Labour are allowed to revert to a cosy carve-up with the union bosses, against the democratic interests of their members.Good government should be far-sighted. It is a disgrace that the British economy is being manipulated to help the prospects of the Tories winning the next election. Assets are being sold, investment is depressed, money is being printed, consumption is being boosted and taxes are to be cut, not to help the long-term future of our economy, but to buy votes. And Nigel Lawson, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, is the ringmaster of this election circus. There is no government strategy in any of the policy areas that matter most: energy, industry, education, housing or welfare. The long term and the future of the next generation are being mortgaged by this moral myopia.Good government should be decentralised. We are told by the Institute of Directors that ministers are overloaded, staggering under the burdens of office. So they may be, but the obvious reason doesn\u2019t yet seem to have occurred to them. Central government is trying to do too much. A very great deal of what is being forced through the Whitehall machine should be done at local level, at regional level, and in Scotland and Wales by their own elected governments.Good government should be open, not secretive. The point of a Freedom of Information Act and repeal of Section 2 of the Official Secrets Act is not to punish Civil Servants who make mistakes. If we want better government we have to learn from experience, see what works and what does not work, avoid making the same errors again and again. We would never have got so far down the path with the Trident missile, for instance, if full information had been available and if the Cabinet and Parliament had been able to review the double escalation, in both warheads and in expense, which it represented.Good government should be in the general public interest, not in the vested interest of one section or class of the nation. As long as the Tory and Labour parties are bound hand and foot to the two sides of industry, Britain will be badly governed. As long as both the old parties continue to stir up class envy and suspicion because it suits their electoral interest, they cannot claim to speak for the public interest. As long as Mrs Thatcher and Mr Kinnock continue to refer patronisingly to \u2018our\u2019 people, they show what they think about everyone else.And lastly good government should help people to help themselves. Our idea of government as enabling or empowering people to run their own lives successfully is miles away from what the other parties believe in. There used to be Tories who believed in helping people, in a rather superior paternalistic sort of way. But Mrs. Thatcher has made them an extinct species. She believes in sink or swim. Labour on the other hand like to keep people dependent rather than giving them the tools to become as independent as possible. That is the difference between Labour and Liberals in local government. They like to keep the power to themselves so that local residents have to come to them for everything. We are never happier than when they don\u2019t need us any more, when a local housing association, or tenants association, has got off the ground with a bit of help from us, and we can move on to help others towards self-reliance.Just ask yourself whether the sort of government I have described, far-sighted and constructive, open and decentralised, enabling people rather than controlling them and governing in the public interest, is possible in Britain today?I will tell you this much. It is not possible as long as the power of the British state is bounced between the Tory and Labour parties. They like things just the way they are because it suits their party interest. The result for the country has been decade after decade of decline and degeneration. If you want good government only the Alliance can provide it.But we aren\u2019t going to get an Alliance government unless the Alliance is credible. That brings me to Tuesday\u2019s debate.Before I turn to the subject of defence and disarmament itself, I must tell you bluntly that two related characteristics of our debate on Tuesday disturbed me. One was the sight of the Liberal Party reverting to a habit which I thought we had kicked ten years ago, of being seen sitting in a corner polishing and burnishing our policy to get it nice and pure and shining in the context of the ideal world we would all desperately like to see, rather than dealing with the real harsh world in which we live. It is one thing to declare our goal of ridding our country, our continent, our world of nuclear weapons. That we must assert with all the passionate intensity at our command.But if we are ever to be in a position to influence our destiny in that direction, we must also convince the electorate that we have carefully thought through the painful steps we must take to reach that non-nuclear goal. Declaring the objective is not enough. The objective is not a policy. The Chernobyl cloud drifting over Europe and over parts of Britain carrying its dread fall out in the wind should have taught us, if we didn\u2019t know it before, that you cannot create nuclear-free zones by putting up signs on the lamp posts of Lambeth. Our Assembly resolution as amended is the equivalent of one of these signs and it will convince no-one that we are capable of advancing from where we are now to a genuinely nuclear-free world. So there is no point in trying to blame what happened on the press. As Jo Grimond wrote on Wednesday: \u2018for Britain alone to abandon nuclear weapons would be to retreat from those doctrines of international collaboration and collective security which have been a main aim in Liberalism.\u2019 I too want intellectual consistency and integrity in our policy.One delegate said yesterday that the trouble with this Assembly was that it had too much heart and not enough head. Well by God after seven years of this benighted government the country needs a party with a lot of heart, and I am proud to lead it. But it needs its head as well.The second point which troubled me was the no doubt well-intentioned but completely misguided belief that in some way it was this Assembly\u2019s task to accentuate the few remaining points of difference with the SDP in order to \u2018strengthen my hand\u2019 in manifesto discussions with David Owen.That is a breathtaking misjudgement. We are either in alliance or we are not. We must live and breathe the alliance. It is unthinkable that we enter the election with two defence and disarmament policies. But neither David Owen nor I are prepared to arrive at any election policy as a result of some botched up bargaining process. We wouldn\u2019t convince the country. We wouldn\u2019t convince you. We wouldn\u2019t convince ourselves. We will arrive at our election policy by applying our common judgement to the problems which will face the next government on taking office. We will have our repeatedly stated goals firmly in view as we do so.I am reported as being angry with this Assembly. My emotion is not that of anger but of profound frustration that what you hope for and what I hope for, namely electoral victory for Liberalism and the Alliance, may have been temporarily and unnecessarily put at risk.Yesterday, two events took place which sent a clear signal to the electorate that we are on our way again. The first was your overwhelming endorsement of our joint Alliance document, \u2018Partnership for Progress,\u2019 and your massive vote of confidence in the democratic procedures by which we will determine our manifesto for the election - involving the policy committee, the parliamentary party and the candidates. Both David Owen and I are well able, to move forward on all policy issues including defence on the basis of that document - that is a clear message I give to you, the SDP and the electorate.The other event of yesterday concerns David Owen. We had what the Sun would call secret talks in London - watched by about 7 million people. It was a good meeting, confirming my belief that the bonds of our Alliance will hold. Neither of us subscribes to the doctrine of infallibility of party leaders - at least I don\u2019t, but nor does he. No one should be worried by differences in style, or even occasionally of opinion between David Owen and myself. The reality is that this relationship will work and will hold. The two leaders and the two parties are growing steadily closer.Turning now to defence and disarmament policy itself, let me reiterate the fundamentals on which we are agreed.We are firm in our support for the NATO Alliance - full support, not the lip-service the Labour party pays to it while undermining it with their actual policies of chucking the Americans out. That\u2019s agreed.We want a moratorium on any further deployment of cruise missiles in Britain, and indeed expect to see a negotiated reduction of those already here before we get to a general election. That\u2019s agreed.We\u2019ve accepted that we want to put Britain\u2019s Polaris system into the next round of the strategic missile reduction talks. That\u2019s agreed.We will strain every sinew to make these talks succeed, but it will take some time, and we would be in a hopeless negotiating position as an Alliance government if we went into them with the Russians believing that all they had to do was to drag out the negotiations over the years - as they could - until the Polaris submarines rusted away. If we are to get reductions in the missiles pointed at this country as well as those based in it, the Russians must know that we would be able to maintain, and if need be update our nuclear capability, until such time as these negotiations succeed.If we are not so prepared, we might as well follow the Labour party\u2019s logic and abandon the nuclear deterrent system unilaterally, hoping that out of the goodness of their hearts the rulers in the Kremlin will kindly destroy theirs. In the 70s there was a party leader in Denmark who achieved some limited success for a while by arguing that he would save costs and reduce taxes by withdrawing his country from NATO and installing a taped message in Russian at all his country\u2019s airports saying \u2018we surrender.\u2019 Denis Healey\u2019s tape is a good deal longer but its message is basically the same. Liberals place a higher value on the defence of liberty than that.We are agreed that we will oppose the replacement of Polaris by the Trident system because it represents an enormous escalation of nuclear firepower from 64 to 512 warheads. That escalation is unacceptable to both our parties. We are seeking to contribute to disarmament. I want the Tories to have to defend their commitment to Trident on every doorstep at the next election. The public are on our side.But they won\u2019t support us unless we are prepared to retain a minimum deterrent capacity no higher than the present Polaris force. I believe we can achieve this through collaboration with our European neighbours.Nothing in that is designed to create a new European super-power, or a Eurobomb, or a committee of fingers on the button, as some have sought to suggest. Securing greater European co-operation to get better value for money in defence, to promote world disarmament, and to switch global resources to development, is wholly in tune with the European ideals of this party, which we have proclaimed consistently since the 1950s.My two parliamentary colleagues who spoke against the policy resolution, both said that a non-nuclear Europe was a final aim and that their amendment was not intended to frustrate the efforts we are making to find an effective European policy. Very well, we shall go on doing so.But I fervently wish that the texts approved by our assembly would more often match the speeches made in their support.The international context in which we have to make defence policy does not stand still. There are some hopeful signs of lessening tension. I welcome the agreement in Stockholm last weekend. I hope that we will see further progress towards the control of armaments at a US-Soviet summit in the next few months. But there are also less hopeful signs. Mr Gorbachev, for all the freshness of a new face in the Kremlin, has not yet abandoned the old militarism or the old police state. And we have to accept that the Americans, who have been Western Europe\u2019s protector and ally for the past 40 years, may not remain as committed to European interests or to European defence. The American troops are not likely to be around in their present numbers in five or ten years\u2019 time. That means that we Europeans must take much more responsibility for our own security. We all know that defence will be an important issue in the next general election. With Labour having nothing credible to offer, the choice will therefore be between Conservative defence policy and the Alliance alternative. Let me spell out that choice.The Conservatives will make an eightfold increase in Britain\u2019s nuclear firepower. The Alliance will maintain a minimum deterrent and only until the success of arms control negotiations renders it unnecessary. The Conservatives will starve conventional forces of the equipment they need in order to find the money for Trident. The Alliance will safeguard the real interests of our army, navy and air force by sharing costs and equipment with our European partners.The Conservatives will lock Britain into US technology for another generation, through the purchase of Trident and through British participation in the star wars project. The Alliance will contribute to a stronger European effort in high technology, from which Britain as well as our partners will benefit.The Conservatives will leave Britain over-dependent on the judgement of whoever occupies the White House. We haven\u2019t forgotten the bombing of Libya. The Alliance will place defence within the wider European context, through which we will also pursue concerted economic and industrial recovery.The Conservatives will continue to frustrate every initiative for disarmament as they have for the past seven years, particularly if British nuclear weapons are involved. The Alliance will use the whole weight of British government power and influence to bring about comprehensive arms reductions.Some people seem to see the issues of defence and disarmament as purely a discussion of hardware - of missile technology. But a fixation with hardware also betrays a wholly distasteful, macho obsession with nuclear firepower. Such is Mrs Thatcher\u2019s inexhaustible enthusiasm for it. This obsession, often serves to disguise the contraction of what should be the real power of Britain - the power of a nation at peace with itself, the power of a nation fully employed, the power of a country with civilised standards, caring for its old, investing in the education of its young people, providing for proper housing and medical care.I do not doubt that when the Spaniards of the 16th century planned their Armada there were many who discussed in the minutest detail the galleons and guns that were to reduce England to servitude. These preoccupations hid from them the truth of Spain\u2019s national weakness - the sterility of its social order, the bankruptcy of its economy.We in Britain need a defence which is appropriate, which guarantees our safety. Our burning concern is to tackle - in power and in government - the real causes of our national vulnerability, and it is to these that I now turn.You will have seen that education is given pride of place in our draft programme. A far-sighted government which wants to enhance opportunity for its citizens by giving them the skills for success could do nothing less. Economic recovery and our future prosperity depend upon education. We can\u2019t go on wasting the human talent of Britain the way we do at present.One in fourteen British youngsters goes on to university.In Holland it is one in seven, in West Germany it is one in five, in Japan and France it is one in three. The chances for a young person to go to university in Britain are spectacularly lower than in any other major industrial country. It isn\u2019t just the individual who loses out but our whole society which is impoverished. In education, too, the Thatcher years have been the destructive years. At every level British education has been starved of resources, from pre-school and nursery right through to the training, retraining and continuing education which are essential. But the main debate concentrates inevitably on the schools.What an indictment it is of past governments, Labour and Conservative, that at the very time the schools could be taking advantage of lower pupil numbers to improve the quality of education we have been plunged into a crisis: a crisis of low teacher morale, low standards of achievement and low investment of resources.An Alliance government will initiate a new partnership in education. We need first of all a new partnership between the government, and local education authorities, to ensure that teachers are properly paid, that their professional status is enhanced, that their views are respected. Just like the repair and renovation of school buildings and the provision of adequate books and equipment, that will take more resources. It may take time, and it may create pressure on other spending priorities, but we shall not begrudge the extra resources because this is a long-term investment in Britain\u2019s future. We cannot afford to continue to lose over 100 qualified teachers every day of the school year, particularly when so many of the losses are in maths and science.Mrs. Thatcher has been ready to break cash limits for the police and armed services, arguing that the quality of the men and women was vital. The quality of the people who teach our children is vital too.Only the Alliance is ready to introduce an incomes strategy. And only an incomes strategy can protect large and important groups of public employees like teachers from losing out. That is the way to keep morale high in the profession. There is no future in a pay free for all, where the only way to protect teachers\u2019 incomes is by harming pupils\u2019 prospects.The Tories, in a panic at the mess they have made of public education, are talking of centralising the whole service and putting the man in Whitehall in charge of local schools. That would be a disaster. Certainly minimum national standards of excellence should be required, but the local accountability of education should be made stronger. That is why the second element of the new educational partnership must be much greater parental involvement in schools. As those schools who have taken the plunge can testify, far from being a problem for the teachers, partnership with parents in the education, not merely of their own children, but of all the children in the school can create entirely new resources of enthusiasm and commitment on all sides.We have to invest in the future of education. And we also have to invest in housing.I can think of nothing more demoralising than bleak sub-standard housing, nothing that makes people feel more degraded than to have to eke out their daily lives in conditions which deny any possibility of a good life.The facts are deeply disturbing. In the seven years before the Thatcher government came to power, over two million houses were started. In the exactly comparable period of seven years since Mrs. Thatcher became Prime Minister, only 1.3 million houses have been started, a fall of nearly 40%. It is our policy to match the sale of council houses with replenishment and renovation of the stock of houses available to rent.Over 1 in 4 homes in Britain are sub-standard and the Government\u2019s own report last year showed that 18 billion pounds are needed to bring local authority housing up to an acceptable level.And what do these figures mean in human terms. Over a million families and individuals on council waiting lists. A doubling in the number of homeless in the Thatcher years. Artificially inflated house prices which stop young people from purchasing their on homes. Half a million homes without a bath or an inside toilet.I don\u2019t know what effect statistics like this have on you, but, twenty years after Cathy Come Home and twenty years after I became more personally involved with the problem as Chairman of Shelter in Scotland, they fill me with fury. Fury at successive governments whose neglect has created this mess. Fury above all at this government whose policies have made the mess and misery so much worse.But what we must do is to turn our fury into positive action. I promise you that an Alliance Government will deal with this growing problem as a matter of urgency. A nation that does not house its citizens properly is not entitled to be called civilised. All too often the people degraded by poor living conditions are also without jobs. This combination creates levels of human wretchedness which Mrs Thatcher in her tours of the Tory luncheon clubs of Britain never even bothers to see. That is why she simply does not understand how this lethal cocktail of unemployment and squalid housing has led to the explosion of vandalism, crime and drugs.There are four immediate steps we will take to create both jobs and houses:1.  Councils will be allowed to spend the 6 billion pounds locked in their bank accounts. Those capital receipts came mainly from the sale of council houses and they should be spent mainly on housing.2.  More money must be made available for home improvement grants, which are enormously effective at attracting private investment into housing, encouraging people to tackle the problem of deterioration for themselves.This government has actually cut home improvement grants since 1984 at the time when it should be increasing them.3.  We will introduce a Tenants Charter which would give tenants the right to run their own estates and manage their own affairs. This as I have seen can transform the quality of life for millions of people.4.  We will carry out a long-term plan to galvanise building activity, using partnership schemes like housing cooperatives, housing associations and neighbourhood trusts to encourage private investment in new homes.When our economy is languishing, when 400,000 workers in the building industry have been rendered idle, when resources are under-utilised, it is not only unacceptable in human terms, but it is economic madness not to build and renovate houses.Don\u2019t let people tell you we can\u2019t afford it. The most significant Commons vote this parliamentary session was in my view on the 24th of March when the Alliance MPs divided the House against the Chancellor\u2019s giving away one billion pounds from his budget by taking 1p off the income tax.Of course all of us paying income tax like such reductions. But we voted against it because we believed that available money should go where it\u2019s really needed, to projects that would provide work. The Labour Party makes speeches about doing that, but when it came to the crunch sat on their benches and abstained during that division rather than face the possibly unpopular stance of denying the taxpayers their penny. Our words and our actions match each other squarely and honestly. Theirs don\u2019t.The Alliance is about to launch a great housing campaign. Let\u2019s all support it. We must act to end this national disgrace.I\u2019ve been talking about the internal condition of Britain. Abroad this government has chosen isolation and impotence.Timothy Raison, in an open letter to his successor as overseas aid minister, wrote the day after his sacking:'The Prime Minister has many qualities but I can\u2019t say that over-enthusiasm for the aid programme is one of them. I couldn\u2019t help thinking as we had our amiable farewell chat last Wednesday that it was about the first time that I had ever had a conversation with her about what I\u2019d been up to as Overseas Development Minister.'What a commentary on the real values of our Prime Minister.Her values are seen at their worst in dealing with South Africa. Even through a shackled and muzzled press, the horrifying and violent realities of apartheid have come home to the British public. They understand the special duty to the majority - a duty to act - which arises out of our historic and commercial links with South Africa.Mrs Thatcher, on the other hand, prefers to enjoy the remaining short term profits of that link. In response to the call for action, she talked gloatingly of accepting no more than \u2018teeny weeny sanctions.\u2019 When the Commonwealth Group of Eminent Persons reported no prospect of the South African Government being prepared to dismantle apartheid, she prevaricated.Sanctions - the only peaceful form of pressure on Pretoria left - she describes as \u2018immoral\u2019; but that is not a phrase we ever hear from her about the apartheid system itself: - about the infant mortality and the malnutrition of the \u2018homelands,\u2019 or of the 60% of black Africans currently unemployed; or of a system which, by virtue of their colour, condemns the overwhelming majority of the people to scratch a living on 13% of the land area.The Dallas-style affluence of white Cape Town or Johannesburg lies alongside that other sub-world of the black townships.William Gladstone\u2019s famous phrase, \u2018the negation of God erected into a system of government,\u2019 applies to South Africa - but the overwhelming impression left by our Prime Minister is sympathy, not for the oppressed, but for the oppressor. But of course the Prime Minister\u2019s attitude to South Africa is the mirror image of her profound racism at home. I am glad that our Assembly condemned the proposed visa system for visitors from Third World countries with the closest family connections here.Successive governments, but especially this one, have imposed the most repressive and inhuman restrictions on all visitors from the New Commonwealth, treating them as potential law breakers, and not as genuine visitors - inevitably then long queues are the result when they arrive, imposing strain on immigration officers, but inflicting enormous hardship on thousands of innocent people. Instead of humanising the laws, making them even slightly more in harmony with those principles of family life which the Tories claim to uphold, they merely compound their inhumanities by removing the victims of it out of public view.This is part of the growing racism of officialdom in Britain. The occasional racist taxi driver is a minor social irritant; any racist policeman is a major social menace. There is now an appalling, ever-increasing number of cases of police harassment of innocent coloured people. Even journalists of the right like John Junor, Bernard Levin and Peregrine Worsthorne have been scathing in their condemnation.We know that there are thousands of dedicated policemen working to promote racial harmony and to protect our minorities from racial attack. Their task is made more difficult by the failure to discipline and eradicate the racists within their ranks. This country needs and values the quality of its police force. That quality has got to be maintained, unblemished. But Mrs. Thatcher remains impervious to criticism and reality - cosseted in a cabinet from which she has removed all independent minds.She is candidate for No. 10 again. Or is she? On November 14th last year she gave a much under-noticed interview to the Financial Times in which she said she needed another five years to complete her task. \u2018After that,\u2019 she said, \u2018someone else will carry the torch.\u2019 Even if the Tories won the next election she\u2019s going by 1990. If she leaves the election till autumn \u201987 that would give her only three years. If she delays till \u201988 it would be only two years. At least when they vote for us the electors know they\u2019re getting Steel and Owen for the full four or five years.But who will they be getting if they vote Conservative - Thatcher and Howe? Thatcher and Tebbit? Thatcher and Gummer? Thatcher and Cecil? - or a truly well-matched duo, Thatcher and Currie? I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s quite what John Biffen had in mind when he called for a balanced ticket.At the next election the Tories will have the handicap of promoting not only Mrs. Thatcher but a successor best kept unidentified, a joint leadership of a truly mysterious kind.The country hungers for a change of government.The Liberal Party has advanced from the fringes of politics to the very centre of the stage, to the heartlands of Britain, to the very edge of power, thanks to you, the people in this Hall, and to tens of thousands of people who are not here today.In town, city and county halls Liberals are grappling with the realities and problems of power, bridging the gap between the ideal and the real, especially in the harsh reality of the government\u2019s restrictions on local government finance.Many Liberal ideas are no longer just in pamphlets. They are visible on the ground. Here in Eastbourne I opened a partnership housing scheme last year at the invitation of the Liberal Council. Last week in Rochdale I visited a tenants co-operative in a scheme of 300 houses started by the Liberal led council three years ago. They\u2019ve reduced vandalism by 80% in that time. I\u2019ve visited several industrial partnerships inspired by Liberals. There is living proof of Liberalism working all over Britain. But Britain as a whole is not a Liberal country, and we cannot convert it to one until we achieve power.I am not interested in power without principles. But equally, I am only faintly attracted to principles without power. Without power all our resolutions, all our idealism, and all our passion will remain mere intention, mere hope, mere dream.We have so much to do, so much to change, such great tasks to achieve. But we will do nothing, change nothing, achieve nothing unless we can first gain power and then use it wisely. Ten years ago I became Leader of this party - the first leader of any party to be directly elected by its members throughout the country.When I became leader there were a number of promises I did not make:I did not promise to be a new John Stuart Mill and re-write the party\u2019s philosophy.I did not promise to be a new Lloyd George and raise the wealth and resources of our organisation.I did not promise to be a new Gladstone running four administrations to the age of 85.What I did promise was to lead the party to the achievement of power for Liberalism in our generation. I made this commitment to you - and I will keep it. But you made a commitment to me - and I require you to keep it. Beyond this hall people are waiting and willing us to win.You and I - together;The parliamentary party and the party in the country - together;Liberals and Social Democrats - together.The British people - together.My commitment is to turn hope into fact, intention into achievement, dream into reality and I will honour that commitment.Together we have made a commitment to the people of our country and they require us to keep it.

aVI have read that this great meeting today is all about the Alliance. So it is, in one sense. We came together as two separate parties six years ago this summer. We meet here together today, Liberals and Social Democrats, in unity. Together. With one team of spokesmen speaking for us all. With one set of policies agreed between us and amongst us. With almost 600 prospective parliamentary candidates selected together in a spirit of amity and common purpose.Let no Tory or Socialist think they can divide us before, during or after the election. Our Alliance draws closer each day. Our unity of principle and purpose is complete and indivisible. We are setting out to tackle two Goliaths and we have two Davids to do itBut in the wider sense today is not primarily about the Alliance. It is rather about our country, about Britain.The coming election will be deeply negative, with fear of Thatcherism and distrust of Labour sweeping the country in two confused tides. Our role is to provide a positive focus for the future, a beacon of hope to penetrate the gloom and confusion. But hope depends on realism. It is realistically impossible, for instance, that the Labour Party can win a majority of seats at the next election.We know it, because we see how soft Labour support is on the ground and how much the Party has been damaged by municipal megalomania. But what is more to the point, the voters know that Labour cannot win, and so ultimately does the Shadow Cabinet. Labour are losers.With a fair voting system it would be easy for us to replace this government.Without proportional representation, we shall just have to try harder. We shall have to work even longer hours, canvass even more doors, put out even more leaflets and persuade millions more of our message.There must be a progressive alternative to Thatcherism. There must be a government which gives ordinary people a chance to make a success of their own lives and which ensures they are cared for when things go wrong. The ideologies of Thatcherism and Socialism must be driven out - and the people of this country must be enabled to take power for themselves.Government statistics out this week have thrown the spotlight on the reality of life for so many of our citizens. Britain in the eighties is becoming an ever more divided nation. True, the majority still enjoys a comfortable existence in prosperous areas; but a growing minority is trapped in the twilight zones of our old industrial cities or the bleak overspill council estates. The bottom forty per cent of households saw their share of the national income fall by 25% between 1981 and 1984.Long-term unemployment has soared: over 40% of the unemployed have been out of work for over a year compared to only 25% when Mrs. Thatcher took office. Crime and drug addiction have spiralled up while hospital beds and university places have been cut. The shot in the arm that Mrs. Thatcher promised Britain has turned out to be a shot through the heart.British institutions no longer guarantee freedom and justice as they once did; worn out, they offer only a pretence that all is still well. State power grows, while protection against it shrinks. There is a retreat from kindness and tolerance, a new sense of public unfairness.Compare the perspectives of the parties.Our plans are for the long term future of Britain, whether it is our plan for closer European co-operation, for a proper national conservation policy to save energy, or for investment to provide real jobs in construction and other industries. Their plans are for the short term - income tax cuts to buy the election and fiddling the unemployment statistics to take people off the dole queue for little more than the duration of the campaign.One long-term change we seek and in which I take particular pride is our consistent emphasis in \u2018The Time has Come\u2019 on an enhanced role for women in society.If anyone needs evidence of that commitment just look at the line-up of women candidates, adopted by the parties for the next election.The Alliance has adopted the most women candidates. 81 will be fighting and winning constituencies for us. Not enough but Labour have 73 and the Conservative Party, for reasons I can only speculate, has only 16. Mrs. Thatcher seems to have done for women in politics what the Boston Strangler did for door to door salesmanship.You can tell a lot about parties by what they practise rather than by what they preach. All the major British parties say they believe in democracy. We in the Alliance parties certainly do. We go in for an open and accountable way of working. It isn\u2019t always comfortable - but that\u2019s democracy.The Labour Party professes the same beliefs. But look at what actually happens in so many local authorities. Closed caucuses. Militant minority rule. Accountability not to the people but to the local Labour Party bosses.As for the Tories, if you look at their national and regional organisation you can tell how keen they are on democracy. Their whole hierarchy, from the Chairman down, is appointed not elected. But this week there has been some good news. Somewhat surprising proposals that party office-bearers should be elected in future. Promises that there will be a choice of candidates. Democracy is creeping into the system.No, not in the Tory Party. In the Soviet Union! At this rate of reform, General Secretary Gorbachev will be democratically elected before Chairman Tebbit.The Tory party never changes. Let me ask you:What do Morgan Grenfell and Ansbacher have in common? No, not simply an involvement in Guinness and a resignation of their top men.They both contribute substantially to the funds of the Conservative Party - 30,000 between them in 1984.Of course they are not alone. Year in, year out, the City, lavishes hundreds of thousands of pounds on the Tories.But how can it possibly be in the interests of democracy and good government that the party which forms an administration is dependent for its election on the hand-outs of those it regulates?Just as Labour\u2019s relationship with its Trade Union paymasters has persistently corrupted its legislative programme, so the Tories are bound to be less than whole-hearted in cleaning up the City. Of course they claim to be horrified and shocked now, but their horror is more a reflection of political embarrassment than a consistent determination to be tough. Until the current scandals have been cleared up and a proper regulatory framework has been agreed, Mrs. Thatcher should not accept donations from the City. Now, our opponents sometimes suggest that we may have the ideas but what about the people? \u2018Who do they have?\u2019 they say.What is it that we are supposedly unable to match?The charisma of Geoffrey Howe?The humanity and charm of Nigel Lawson?The judgement of Jeffrey Archer?The commonsense and common touch of Nicholas Ridley?Or is it just the quiet dignity of Edwina Currie?Our Alliance team outshines that lotWe are successfully challenging head on the values of the Government we are seeking to replace.What sort of society is it which treats the electorate as donkeys to have tax-cut carrots held in front of them to catch their votes? People would prefer the government to invest in the future: in our housing and education. That\u2019s what we voted for at the last Budget and people respected us for it.What sort of Government have we which, at a time of real hope of nuclear weapons reduction by the Soviet and American leaders, seeks unilaterally to multiply Britain\u2019s nuclear arsenal.What sort of society have we created where the disparity of wealth and opportunity between the South-East triangle and the rest grows year by year?How far are we from a just society when the Government can spend 30 million advertising the sell-off of an asset which belongs to us all so that a quick killing can be made by a lucky few while the same government cannot find 20 million for dialysis machines to save lives and relieve pain?What kind of Government have we which can stand by watching magnificent voluntary efforts to relieve global poverty and famine, whilst their own official aid slides downwards, further away from the minimum UN target? The qualities which mark out the Thatcher Government - arrogance, stubbornness, lack of understanding, greed and prejudice - are all illiberal. The starting point of our radical programme is a deep revulsion of these values and a burning commitment to change them.We have had our ups and downs during the six years of our Alliance, and moments of triumph and moments of despair.I doubt if there has been a single person in this hall who has not at some time stopped and pondered whether it was all worthwhile. I don\u2019t mind admitting that my blackest moment came just last month with the shattering blow of David Penhaligon\u2019s death. It affected us all in the Alliance family. Yet after some days I remembered the lines of Archbishop Darbyshire:Not names engraved in marble makeThe best memorials of the dead,But burdens shouldered for their sakeAnd tasks completed in their stead:That spurred me on as it should spur us all. David wanted his children, to grow up in a country which was not riven by divisions between rich and poor, between capital and labour, between black and white. He wanted to see, as we all want to see, a country united.Neither the Tory nor Labour parties is capable of uniting Britain, because by definition they each represent sectional interest. We stand for the public interest.The Conservative Party of One Nation of Harold Macmillan has gone for ever. Whatever Mr. Tebbit claims he did or didn\u2019t say, everyone knows the modern Conservative Party is without conscience and compassion.The Labour Party, weighed down by the baggage of the past and under siege from its own extremists carries no credibility as the alternative government for Britain.That is why the responsibility, the duty laid on us is such a heavy one.But we need not take it heavily. Millions outside are willing us to win. Look at that poll yesterday showing 43% will vote for our candidates if they think they can win in their constituencies. It is up to each of us to go out from this hall and campaign with such vigour, such determination, to show that we can indeed win, that we will indeed win.And our message to the people of this country is very simple: if we win, it will be a victory for you. If the Tories or Labour win, the country will be the loser.If the Alliance wins, you win.

aVSomething very remarkable has happened here this week. We came here concerned about merger. We shall leave to create a new party. We came here fearing a loss for Liberalism. We shall leave confident of a gain for Liberalism and for Social Democracy. We came here thinking about separate negotiation; we leave about to embark on joint deliberation. We came here in uncertainty. We leave here with confidence and determination.All credit to this Assembly for the maturity and wisdom it has shown. Many thanks too to Robert Maclennan and the other members of the SDP who have joined us during the week. It has been good to welcome them, not as visitors from another party but as friends, participants and co-architects of one shared new party.Mind you, you\u2019ve got to watch these Social Democrats. They\u2019ve got an eye to the main chance. When I eventually got here from Canada on Tuesday morning I found that Shirley Williams had been sleeping in my bed. I\u2019m going to check my hotel bill because I think she ate my porridge as well....On Tuesday I said that the electorate will want to know whether we are a credible alternative to the government and whether we are determined to win power. To capture the goodwill towards us which undoubtedly exists throughout the length and breadth of the country, and turn it into votes, we need a clearer strategy, bolder themes and a sharper identity. At the election the agenda was dominated by Thatcherism. Now we must move on from Thatcherism. We must set the new agenda. We must be the party of the future. Our approach must be positive. Where there are successes we must build on them. Where the debate has become stark and sterile we must come up with imaginative new ideas. Where the ills of society are manifest, we must remedy them. We are the natural alternative to Thatcherism, the only force which can replace it.Nobody can truthfully say the same of the Labour Party. How could Labour build upon success when they are committed by ideology and by the very nature of the party, to turning back the clock? \u2018Back to the Future\u2019 should be Labour\u2019s slogan, set to the music of Brahms perhaps, as Mr. Kinnock and Mr. Hattersley, shoulder to shoulder, stride fearlessly towards the Fifties, or is it the Thirties? Who can imagine Labour coming up with new ideas? Socialism exalts the rule, Liberalism exalts the individual. Their trade union financiers don\u2019t pay them for new ideas, but for the same old platitudes and the same protection of their controlling interests. And I notice the amount of protection money goes up by millions of pounds at each election.    And as for acting to remedy the ills of society - just remember that in many towns and cities of Britain, Labour extremists are still part of the problem, not its solution, promoting crisis and division.No amount of slick advertising can change the reality of Labour: a party which the voters do not trust, on the defence of freedom, on the creation of wealth, or on anything else. Now there are Labour intellectuals who want to work with the Alliance. I have to say to them: if Labour could abandon class and collectivism, if they could cut free from union control, if they could eliminate extremism and if they could start putting their trust in people rather than the power of the state, they might be on to something.But as it is, in the real world, pigs don\u2019t fly. Neither is there any alternative available from within the Tory ranks. The Prime Minister has so debilitated the old Conservative Party that when she goes it will be convalescent for a very long time. Learning to walk again, after so many years spent on their knees, is going to take the Conservatives quite a while. So it will be for us to deal with the after-effects of Thatcherism.The bright spots are there. Our government, any government, should learn from them and try to promote the spread of success. Yes, investment is at last moving up, but in construction and manufacturing new investment is still, incredibly, below the level of 10 years ago.Productivity has improved, but we are still bottom of the industrialised league table.Yes, the economy is growing but from the very low base of the early 1980s. This week it was announced that output has increased but it is still only just back to the level it was when the Tories came to power.No one could possibly claim that the Thatcher years have been marked by good economic stewardship. The enormous once-and-for-all benefits of North Sea Oil and privatisation, together amounting to over 80 billion pounds have largely been consumed by current expenditure. They should have been used to rebuild our capital base of infrastructure, equipment and technology.The commercial hero of Thatcher Britain is the money man in the Porsche shuffling assets on the car telephone, not the scientist or the engineer, the designer or the software programmer, the builder or the entrepreneur.Under this government research and development have been starved, while the perspectives of the City have been foreshortened to weekly, daily, and even hourly fluctuations in prices. Indeed, the President of the British Association for the Advancement of Science was forced to warn last month that unless we grasp the opportunity for better products and processes that stem from scientific advances in the new technology, \u2018we must accept the consequences of becoming a second- or third-class nation.\u2019Meanwhile Mr. Nigel Lawson has been discovered working the printing presses down in the basement of No. 11 Downing Street. Election year is always the time when Tory Chancellors are happy to get their hands dirty. A lot of printer\u2019s ink under the fingernails. So this year the money supply has gone through the roof.Consumer credit has quadrupled from 1979 giving the false impression, especially to the young and vulnerable, that taking unlimited credit is natural and costless. The price is paid in higher interest rates, higher house prices, more cases of personal credit problems than the Citizens\u2019 Advice Bureaux can cope with. High mortgage repossessions are another indicator. In 1979 2,500 homes were repossessed. Would you care to guess at last year\u2019s figure? A staggering 22,000.I have to say that Mr. Lawson has been ideally equipped by character and ability in his role as the bridge between monetarism and cynicism.When the froth of this consumer boom is finally blown away, it is the rocks beneath that will become obvious. Our industrial base has dwindled, our assets have been depleted and our skills have been run down. Profit sharing and participation are still the exception in British companies rather than the rule.Without change our industrial base will continue to contract, our national options will narrow and more of Britain will eke out an existence of unskilled labour and idleness.The national balance-sheet shows an equally grave deficit in social terms.Yes, there has been a healthy swing away from collectivism, and a growth in opportunity for those fortunate enough to have the right skills or to live in the right part of the country.But for too many of our people, the door of opportunity has slammed shut. Young people face a bleak future, older people have not been retrained, the cities have been neglected and the communities of Britain have been weakened.In essence Tory individualism has turned out to be about personal selfishness. It hands the prizes to the fortunate few. It destroys the bonds of mutual care and concern. It assumes that one person's success can be founded only on the failure of ten others.The great American Liberal J. K. Galbraith summed up current Tory attitudes as follows: \u2018The rich, they say, need incentive to greater economic effort; the poor need release from the debilitating effect of welfare. The rich have not been working because they have too little money; the poor have not been working because they have too much.\u2019 Liberal individualism means opening the doors of opportunity and success to everyone.It is the unique task of liberalism and social democracy to draw the connection between the individual and the community. In the words of T.H. Green, \u2018the self of which a man forecasts the fulfilment is not an abstract or empty self. He seeks a well-being in which the well-being of others is included.\u2019It is that wider well-being which has been so much diminished. We are all paying the cost, in the crime, the violence, the drug-taking and the callousness which disfigure our society.At last the Government has discovered the inner cities. \u2018Praise Be,\u2019 as the authors of Faith in the City might say. But they have never shown the slightest interest before. Why this conversion on the road to Teesside? The Prime Minister in her forthright way explained, contemplating her new majority over a glass of champagne at three o'clock in the morning on June 12th. \u2018From Monday,\u2019 she said \u2018we have got a big job to do in those inner cities.... because we want them too next time.\u2019Not a thought for the people who live there, who have suffered from decades of decay, poor housing and government indifference. It\u2019s not the people that count, only their votes.It is accepted that these conditions breed unrest and violence. But there is more than one form of violence in Britain today. There is cool violence - that subtle and all-pervasive aggression built into the fabric of a society or of a world which is concerned merely with economic prosperity and security. It is a form of violence because, on the one hand, it maintains two thirds of our world in subservience and hunger, while on the other hand it deadens the consciences of those who benefit from it. Take, for example, our so-called \u2018firm and fair\u2019 immigration policy. Last year a Nigerian woman living here with her three children, twins of eight and a boy of five, all born in Britain, was killed in a car accident. Their father, who was in Nigeria, and separated from the mother, came here to look after them. Because his status in the view of the immigration authorities was flawed - something which can easily happen - they refused to allow him to stay and look after his children in their flat in Hackney. He was told he must be deported, and his children put into care.The Prime Minister is always talking about the sanctity of family life, but even sanctity is now selective. What an appropriate guest Monsieur Le Pen will be at the Conservative conference. Our concern for the individual is universal; not only in the social but also in the economic sphere. Choice for the consumer and opportunity for the individual are the mainsprings of a healthy economy. We need more competition and fewer cosy cartels.The effect of present policies is too often anti-competition. Since 1979 over 4,000 companies have been taken over - seven hundred of them disappeared last year alone.Of course, a minority of takeovers are in the public interest, but very many are not. They are simply the product of financial manipulation. And it is worth noting that the City\u2019s initial reaction to the election result was to mark up the value of shares, in anticipation of a new round of takeovers and new piles of paper profits. They have not been disappointed.At the end of the money-go-round, investment is no higher, jobs have not been created, competition has been reduced and the customer is no better served.Liberals and Social Democrats know what the market is for. The real purpose of a vigorous market is to create wealth by serving the customer better. That means our united party must stand for a new combination of competition and consumerism.Thatcher economics is for me best illustrated by the medieval tale of two water-carriers in a besieged town bearing buckets through a crowd, crying \u2018water six sous a bucket, water six sous a bucket,\u2019 when a cannonball suddenly flattened one of them. Unperturbed the other continued along the street shouting \u2018water, twelve sous a bucket.\u2019Never mind the customer; the profit is made, the monopolist is happy.We must not tolerate the sort of privatisation which merely replaces a public monopoly by a private monopoly. British Telecom is a warning. The City got the .pay-off, not the telephone user. The other day at home I complained to Judy about our telephone. I was always getting wrong numbers or incomplete calls. She pointed out somewhat acidly that the trouble with party leaders, government ministers, and other self-important people was that they only rarely dialled calls themselves. There is nothing wrong with our telephone, she said; it happens to everyone nowadays.Our approach is clear. We will oppose the creation of a monopolistic private airline or a private electricity monolith. We shall not tolerate mega-mergers which are against the public interest. That calls for much stronger monopoly and merger rules in a strengthened Office of Fair Trading.In the public sector also, we shall not tolerate the complacent lack of internal competition. That benefits bureaucratic management, not the citizen who uses the services. We should be developing more ideas like our proposal for an internal market in the Health Service. Nor must we tolerate restrictive practices at work, whether by trade unions or the professions. Take the lawyers. The delays and high cost of justice are too often injustices themselves.If we really put the interest of the customer first and take consumer protection seriously, that means refusing to accept second-best. We shall not tolerate shoddy goods which do not last or second-rate services, whether they be provided by the public or the private sector. We cannot condone public service unions repeatedly putting the interests of their members ahead of the interests of the public. If we are to have a genuinely competitive market going flat out to serve the customer, then the government has certain unavoidable responsibilities. Its role is not to act as broker to the plutocracy but as the guarantor of higher quality goods and services for everybody; fighting monopoly; insisting on better consumer information; pursuing no strike agreements in the public services; and setting high standards which benefit everybody.What is needed is a government commitment to the quality of life by setting those standards. High standards in education, so our children can grow to their full potential. High standards for the environment by insisting on non-polluting policies and technologies.In all spheres, our united alliance will take its stand on excellence. It is by creating high added value for the customer at home that we shall create new success for our exports abroad. That is the best way to get Britain back to work, and back to more satisfying and worthwhile work as well.We British are a very patient people. Why else would we put up with a system of government which could have been designed expressly to be used and abused by an authoritarian administration? We put up with an electoral system which gives a different value to votes depending on where they are cast and for which party. The result on June 11th with its disgraceful misrepresentation of the wishes of the electorate was another in a long series of denials of basic democratic rights. We put up with the archaic working practices and untelevised inaccessibility of the House of Commons. Why should backbenchers be so shackled by the cynical manipulation of the two party whips, who are both, incidentally - government and opposition - paid extra salaries by the taxpayer?Why is the third force, already cheated of fair parliamentary representation, further denied its proper procedural in the House of Commons itself? The contrast with the rights accepted as normal in other democratic chambers from the Canadian House of Commons to most local councils in this country and even that non-elected chamber, the House of Lords, shames our mother of parliaments.We put up with the growing centralisation of power in Whitehall. Does anyone really believe that Mr Nicholas Ridley knows what is best for people rather than their own local councillors? We put up with the encroachment of state power on the life of the private citizen. The Spycatcher episode would be laughable if it were not so serious. It has cost a million pounds of public money to make Peter Wright as wealthy an author as Jeffrey Archer.But behind the charade is the shadow of something more ominous: unaccountable intelligence services; British judges who are over-respectful of the Executive and too little respectful of the freedom of expression; concealment and cover-up of murky misdeeds by those who are supposed to be our servants. Our fragile liberties are too often unprotected. We demand a Bill of Rights. We put up with Conservative place-men being pushed into our public institutions, putting party loyalty above independence of judgement and even basic competence. The Prime Minister has created a web of power. It is what that great radical William Cobbett attacked in an earlier age: patronage and promotion for those who toe the line. Profit and preferment for those who put up the money. Secrecy and silence around the decisions which properly belong to us all.Why do we put up with all this?We need a new constitutional revolution. It\u2019s time we opened up democracy in Britain, and that means self-government for Scotland and Wales. It\u2019s time we stopped Parliament being the creature of the Executive. It\u2019s time we protected the civil rights and liberties of each and every citizen.  It\u2019s time we allowed information to circulate freely, and it\u2019s time that local government started to fight back against the dictates of the centre. The poll tax saga demonstrates just about everything which is wrong with British government.The poll tax is being pushed by the Prime Minister against the wishes of most of the Cabinet. It is on her orders that the poll tax, dreamed up in London, has been imposed in Scotland without consultation. Those who have been consulted in England, including all those bodies concerned with local government, have been overwhelmingly hostile. Local income tax, which was recommended by the Layfield Committee and was our preference in the Alliance, has been dismissed out of hand.The poll tax will be regressive: the rich man in his castle will pay the same as the poor man at his gate.It is a tax which is being introduced because the Prime Minister doesn\u2019t trust local government. She could reform local government by PR to make it more representative and responsive but instead she is doing everything in her power to weaken vigorous local democracy.Finally, and it is all too typical of this government, it is a tax which will take a veritable army of snoopers to enforce; no doubt a private army.Our councillors are already campaigning against the poll tax and we shall fight it in Parliament.On these economic and constitutional issues Liberals and the SDP go into the new party totally at one.On defence and disarmament, there is still some common deliberation required. Let me try and help that process.We must never forget that NATO has a. political as well as a military purpose. Collective security, so long as it is necessary; but common security - the removal of the sense of threat on both sides - as the long-term political aim. And now, this very day, at, last we see a chance to move: to reduce nuclear weapons and missiles on both sides, to lessen the sense of threat, to move some more steps away from armed hostility to real detente. That\u2019s an exciting prospect, but it is also in some ways an unsettling one. There are bound to be some who prefer the old certainties of cold war confrontation to the new uncharted territory of arms reduction and political dialogue.But if the Conservative German Chancellor Helmut Kohl can be brought round to the view that reducing the level of weapons is more important than the military pessimism which clings to every weapons system, then I have hopes that Conservatives in other allied countries will also come round. We must not allow the pessimists and the ideological hardliners to destroy the opportunity which we now face. The East-West relationship is dynamic, not static. And we should all put our weight behind the pressures for change. An INF agreement is a great prize, but it must not be the end of a process, a moment for self-congratulation and resumed inactivity. It must instead be made the beginning of a larger process of global arms control and strategic reduction. We must press on to diminish tension and develop confidence in the overarching idea of common security which potentially links the real interests of East and West.We in Western Europe need to resist erecting unnecessary national obstacles to international arms reduction.A nuclear element in NATO defence for as long as it is needed to deter a perceived Soviet threat - that we must guarantee. Equally, we accept that we must continue to make our contribution to NATO\u2019s nuclear strategy, for so long as it is needed.What we cannot, and will not, accept is the Gaullist doctrine that in all circumstances any self-respecting nation needs its own nuclear weapons - and that such a commitment is absolute, regardless.On the contrary, we must be ready to use positively the leverage of Britain\u2019s independent nuclear capability, by putting it on the table to promote the next and more comprehensive stage of the disarmament process.The British Liberal Party has always made this careful distinction, as did the Liberal/SDP Alliance at the last election. We should continue to support a British contribution to NATO deterrence but we cannot and will not tolerate any attempt by this Conservative government to make its commitment to an independent strategic deterrent a barrier against further reductions in the level of armaments on both sides.One imperative which drives us on is the need to transfer some of the resources of the developed world - East and West - away from the wasteful folly of the arms race and into the more clamorous task of assisting world development. One distinctive contribution Britain has made - but which it has been throwing away over the last seven years - is its capacity to provide students from developing countries with further and higher education. Instead, we have been putting up the shutters, stripping away that opportunity and, through penal and discriminatory overseas students\u2019 fees, driving even Commonwealth Government-funded students into the welcoming arms of the French, the Japanese and the Russians. That is immensely damaging to our unique point of influence in the Commonwealth - and to the third world.It was said of Montesquieu that humanity had lost its title deeds and he had recovered them. That is the new internationalism which will inspire our united party.At the last election the Prime Minister and her friends in the Press tried to blight the middle ground, and attempted to represent the heartland of this nation as a no-man\u2019s-land where only the weak and indecisive would wander - the droolers and drivellers.This was the strategy of those who sought to replace compassion and consensus with dictation and dogma, so-called conviction politics.But I tell you that compassion for and understanding of the needs of others is conviction! I tell you that civilised values are held instinctively and valued strongly by millions of the British people. The middle ground is there; the middle ground is a heartland already settled by our seven million homesteaders. This gentle yet sturdy landscape is the centre of our nation. It will be re-tilled and re-sown. It will welcome back with generosity those prodigals who left to seek the fool\u2019s gold which the lady offered. In this middle ground, wealth will be created freely through the initiative and energy of the many, and will be distributed in fair measure to the deprived, the dispossessed and the despairing.But this heartland must have a constitution and governance which ensures that those at its gates are convinced that what we are offering is real and attainable, not a mirage.Our country at present offers the good life to some. Conservative individualism is always selective. Liberal individualism is about the prospect of a fuller life for all. My message today is that this fuller life must be founded on wider opportunities and more choice; competition and consumer satisfaction; better education for our young people; breaking down class barriers and restrictive practices wherever they stifle people\u2019s chances; making a reality of our democracy. That is our vision. That is our agenda. The agenda derives from the intellectual heritage of both our parties. It found inspiration at that first great meeting in Llandudno, with those two to whom we all owe so much, Jo Grimond and Roy Jenkins.It is the hope of that fuller life for all which places an obligation on us to work together over these next few months so carefully and with such judgement and dedication that we are able next year to launch a new and yet stronger vessel to carry forward the values of Liberalism and Social Democracy. Comradeship will be as invaluable as will-power.I have been pressed to make clear my personal position on the leadership of the new party. But this is not the time for us to decide that. I am in no doubt about my task over the next few months. To complete the formation of the new party is itself a profound responsibility. When the spring comes it will be for those of us in parliament to discuss the leadership frankly and openly and for the membership to make its choice. What I do assure you is that my future active commitment in the new party is total.I have always been driven by the conviction that we will be able in our time to practise in power the values which we have evolved and evidenced in the long years of opposition. This has been - almost certainly - our last annual Liberal Assembly. It has been - almost certainly - the first assembly of the movement that will take Liberalism to power.These months of turbulence will have been a price well worth paying if we are able to offer at the next election a government of vision and capability.During this turbulent summer I came across these lines:So what, though a great wind shake the mightOf the tree of heaven...There\u2019s not a tremor in the root,No loss, and after blossom, fruit.The tree of Liberalism has its roots secure and it will bear fruit.

aVBenjamin Disraeli was once asked to define the difference between a misfortune and a calamity. He said: \u2018If Gladstone fell into the Thames, that would be a misfortune, but if anybody pulled him out, that would be a calamity.\u2019I can well understand that there might have been Liberals last week who wished to update the political reference. All I want to say about that is that some political leaders - I mention no names - believe they are infallible. She of course never makes mistakes. I do not subscribe to the doctrine of the infallibility of party leaders, and perhaps that\u2019s just as well in the circumstances.In 1906, our party leader Campbell-Bannerman offered the public a succinct and hugely successful manifesto, namely: \u2018to undo the mischief wrought in recent years.\u2019 I think we can agree on such a commonsense approach. I want this Assembly to look forward not backward. Yes, the last six months have been arduous. But what did we expect? Yes, the birth-pangs of our new party have been painful. I frankly cannot imagine that anybody but Liberals would have had the generosity of spirit to undertake this difficult process. We have not sat at home jeering from the sidelines like some. It has been hard, but now we have come through. We should look forward to the new life we are about to create. During the twelve years that I have been leader, I have been sustained by a vision of a centre-left party, free of the dogma, the class hatred, the arrogance, and the extremism which have haunted British political life since the War. We have never lost sight of the great principles on which this party was founded, which are no less needed in the Thatcher age than they were over a hundred years ago.I have had a vision of a Britain which is very different. Not the tawdry Britain of today, motivated by greed and stifled by autocracy.If a radical government had wasted public money on a case such as Spycatcher, manipulated the truth over an affair such as Westland, produced as cock-eyed, unpopular and indefensible a measure as the poll tax, and steadily accrued power to itself away from local government, imagine what the public outcry would have been.As it is, much of Fleet Street is servile, corrupted by the combination of honours and monopolistic ownership, reserving its scorn only for critics of the government, whether in the other political parties, the churches or the universities. The slide to autocracy over this last decade is alarming more and more sections of the population. It is our prime duty to organise effectively to prevent it.And during these twelve years, I have been sustained by the knowledge that many, possibly even the majority of our fellow citizens, were willing us to succeed. When the Alliance was formed I saw, and many of us saw, that this great longing for a new and fundamentally better society based on partnership, cooperation and consensus, was now a possibility. The Alliance was not formed simply as a marriage of convenience. I repudiate this view utterly.It was my belief, and that of Roy Jenkins, that the Alliance was the thin end of the wedge in achieving our shared aim of a fairer, and in a true sense a more successful, Britain. Today I must tell you that experience has reinforced that view.The Liberal Party founded in its present organisation 110 years ago has so much to its credit. It was we who laid the foundations of the welfare state introducing old-age pensions, sickness insurance and unemployment benefit. It was our Keynesian policies which first showed how to manage an economy so that we could maintain our basic freedoms while effectively tackling unemployment; between the wars we backed the doctrine of collective security and supported rearmament in the face of a supine government; yet we retained the valued Quaker tradition in our midst; we have advocated genuine industrial democracy as opposed to trade union oligarchy; and consistently through our history the need for constitutional reform and devolution within a federal framework.We are all proud to be Liberals. Duty to our neighbours and good citizenship are for us the mainsprings of social reform.No government of which we were a part would tolerate a Chancellor of the Exchequer grasping buoyant revenues and failing to provide increased resources for our hard-pressed National Health Services, especially for our underpaid and overworked nurses.No one understands better than I the deep feelings throughout the party about the decision we have to take. I will be a Liberal to the day I die. I feel myself clothed in the aura of the word Liberal and all the associations which that has. Liberalism is not a creed, a dogma or a fixed ideology. It does not prescribe how people should live or limit what they can become. Liberalism is about developing people\u2019s potential and enlarging their freedom. It is the spirit which sustains the adventure of progress.Last year I spoke to the students at Cape Town University, urging them, in the face of increasing intolerance of left and right, to hold fast to their liberal traditions. I did it because being a Liberal is not simply a title, it is a way of life. Liberalism is an attitude of mind. It has a noble past, and, I believe, a noble future.During that visit I met the writer Alan Paton, who was President of the Liberal Party of South Africa when it was closed down because it was multi-racial. He wrote this:'If Liberalism died, if those sentiments that we call liberal were no longer cherished by men and women then the countries of the world would soon become tyrannies, whether of the left or right. The joy of being human would disappear from the earth.'For twenty-three years I have been in the House of Commons fighting for this great party of ours, not to further a career in politics, but because I believe in those Liberal principles. My fellow Liberals, the people of Britain need them now more than ever. Perhaps not the complacent rich, or the arrogant powerful, but the weak, the needy, the sick, the struggling minorities, the young, the unemployed.The Liberal Party more than any other party is like a great family. Sure, we have our occasional rows and our upsets, but we are held together by a great sense of belonging, of tolerance, and dare I say of warmth.As a family in recent years we have enjoyed moments of great success, triumph and elation. As a family we have suffered times of setback, despair, and even, at Christmas a year ago, tragedy. We have laughed together at times and we have cried together at times.Many of the commentators find us difficult to understand, so easy to poke fun at. It\u2019s a lot easier to base a political party simply on the haves, the get-rich-quicks, the self-appointed establishment on the one hand or the organised trade union votes and funds on the other.The great strength of our party is that it has never been exclusive, but always comprehensive. The Liberal Party has throughout its history included those who believe fervently in one or two particular aspects of Liberalism, and this party has never sought to crush colleagues who happen to think differently from ourselves. The new party of Social and Liberal Democrats must sustain that tradition.There is another tradition which it must sustain - our more recent but impressive dedication to practical Liberalism. So many have pounded the dark, wet streets. Others have been up to their elbows in printer\u2019s ink - working week in week out to help people improve the communities where they live. The very fact that Liberals and Social Democrats are already united in groups in so many local authorities is itself a powerful argument against now attempting to put them asunder.But we must not wallow in our own longevity, history and traditions to the extent that we ignore the qualities of the SDP. The freshness of their approach and the strength of their ideals brought many into politics whom we had failed to attract and enabled a large slice of talent to abandon the fruitless struggle to reform the Labour Party. They have taught us the modern techniques of direct communication with their membership. They care about the same things we care about. They have become our brothers and sisters in an enlarged family. The assets of the two parties taken together will provide the basis for a formidable force. Our new party will have to be realistic. Of course it will. We shall need sound policies, based on sober deliberation. But we shall need something else even more important if we are to succeed. We shall need commitment. The soul of Liberalism must shine through.The commitment to restore Britain to self-government; to insist on freedom of information and a bill of rights; to let people make their own decisions locally. It is Liberalism which gives people a voice.The commitment to tackle poverty and squalid housing, not as an act of charity but as a recognition of the common humanity we all share. It is Liberalism which will unlock the trap of deprivation in which two million families are locked in this prosperous country.The commitment to usher in a society prudent in the use of its resources, not profligate; in harmony with the natural world, not at war with it; caring about what we hand on to future generations. The commitment to end discrimination between people based on the colour of their skin. It is Liberalism which stands against the street bullies mugging Asian Britons, it is Liberalism which reunites families divided by cruel immigration laws, and it is Liberalism which says there is no hope in South Africa until Nelson Mandela is free.The commitment to international interdependence, and the recognition that the nation-state is obsolescent. It is Liberalism which believes in one world. It is Liberalism which strives for international peace and security based on mutual respect and confidence and it is Liberalism here in Britain which helped get us into the European Community, helped keep us there, and which alone wants the Community to develop and integrate as far and as fast as possible.It is Liberalism which will awaken the conscience of the developed world to the famine, disease and hunger of the poorer countries. And it is Liberalism which knows we cannot enjoy our freedom while half the world is enslaved.I speak now, not as leader but as a member, an activist member, of the Liberal Party. And however great the majority in this hall today - and I believe it must be 2:1 or more - let us not forget that the final decision is up to each and every member of the Party throughout the country.There is no shortage of tasks for brave Liberals. There are still giants to be slain, the ogres of war and fear, intolerance and prejudice. There are still mountains to be scaled, the grim peaks of poverty and privilege. There are great prizes to be won as well: peace and prosperity, freedom and justice, opportunities for each and dignity for all.At the end of my very first speech as your leader in Llandudno in 1976 I described the kind of country I wished to see. I have returned to many of these themes today. In some ways we are actually further removed from a Liberal society now than we were then. I have spoken this morning as a Liberal about liberalism. That is as it should be. Opponents of merger sometimes talk as if the Liberal Party is going to be abolished, that the new party will not be Liberal. If that were so, I should be voting against merger. I don\u2019t consider every aspect of the constitution to be perfect, but like everybody else I know we can amend it in the light of experience.But it is precisely because we shall carry our Liberalism proud and intact into the new party, because our chance to achieve Liberal aims will be increased and because the SDP are our natural partners that I do support merger now.The choice is a simple one. Yes, for the chance to put Liberalism into practice, or No, for decades of division and a diminution of Liberalism. I say YES, for the next step in the adventure of Liberalism and to provide a new hope for Britain.Our Assembly has been required over these years to make many vital decisions, but none so crucial as the one we are called upon to make today. Yes, it is going to affect us in our constituencies, in our councils, in parliament.But today\u2019s decision affects more than us. It will affect the millions beyond this hall who have been yearning for us to get together and provide a truly effective party able to challenge the Tories at the next election. Let Labour remain the official opposition. Our people want us to become the electable opposition. The country demands it. We cannot fail them now.

aVFellow Liberal Democrats.Our party conference today ends in the middle of one of the most serious crises in our modern history: a crisis not just of currencies and the economy; not just for Britain and Europe; but a crisis of confidence in our entire system of government itself.When people find that they can no longer trust the most solemn words of our national leaders, that the pledges of our Prime Minister are worthless, that the Chancellor of the Exchequer is a man of straw, small wonder that they feel betrayed.The Conservatives promised us that if we re-elected them, they would put things right.The Conservatives promised recovery was around the corner. The Conservatives promised they\u2019d never devalue.Empty words.Words, words, words. We\u2019re so sick of Tory words.And in every town and city and corner of our land today, people are paying for those words with their jobs, their businesses and their homes.We warned them this would happen. We told them that unless they took the action to stimulate Britain\u2019s economy; unless they reassured the markets with an Independent Central Bank; unless they lifted the uncertainty about our long-term intentions in Europe, then the markets would not have confidence in the pound, industry would have to pay more in interest rates and the pressure on sterling would rise and rise.But instead of action, we have had a long summer of complacency.Instead of firm government, we have had a Tory party wracked by division and conflict.And instead of leadership, we have had inertia.One thing is now abundantly clear. From this moment onwards, this Government is on borrowed time.They have lost the confidence of the markets. They have lost the confidence of our partners. And above all, they have lost the confidence of this country.I shall weep no tears for them, and neither will those who have paid such a high price for what they have done.For now we know them for what they are. The Tory Party - the party of devaluation.They will be held to account for what they have done. But, for the moment, our first concern must be for those who are the victims of their failures.The next hours and days will decide the fate of tens of thousands of jobs, thousands of home owners and thousands of businesses.The markets are in turmoil and the Government seems to have lost control.Here are three things the Prime Minister should do now.First, he must make a full statement about how the Government views the current situation, and what action they intend to take. It is drift and inertia that got us into this crisis; it is clarity and action that will get us out.Second, he should make it clear that, even if it takes some time, it is the Government\u2019s firm intention to re-join the ERM. He must scotch the growing opinion in his own party that there is any refuge for Britain outside a strong currency system used by our main trading partners. This would condemn our country to a permanent position on the periphery of Europe - a cork bobbing in the wake of an ocean liner.And third, he should take steps today to enable the Bank of England to act as an independent Central Bank and thus give powerful reassurance to the markets.I give the Government this undertaking.If he does these three things, then he can be assured of the support of this party until this crisis is over. But the problems which now face us are greater than this immediate crisis - bad though it is.We seem suddenly beset by long-term problems which confront our country, our continent and our world. Even today\u2019s crisis is not just the result of a cyclical event, compounded by a government\u2019s bungling. It is the consequence of a deep, deep malaise which now threatens both our economic success and our social cohesion.Unless Britain can recover from the present crisis and then quickly rediscover the will to invest and build for the long-term, then we are in grave danger of slipping into permanent economic decline.And in Europe, what we observe - the return of racism to our cities and the reappearance of Nazi slogans on walls from Rostock to Marseilles - these are not just a passing problem springing from the technical deficiencies of the Maastricht Treaty. They are a challenge to the very concept of a civilised and united Europe.Unless we can now rescue Europe from the clutches of its bureaucrats and the failure of its politicians, and make the European concept live in the hearts of ordinary European citizens, then the cause of Europe will falter and we shall enter the next millennium once again wracked by the old division and conflict which has infected our continent for the past two thousand years.And what Russell Johnston and I saw in the eyes of the people of Bosnia - and what we all see in the emaciated bodies in Somalia - these are not just another routine call upon our compassion. They are a direct challenge to every Government and every nation to find the instruments of peace and succour which will halt the contagion of famine and war which otherwise threatens us all.These are difficult times for optimists.And yet, despite the problems, despite even today\u2019s crisis, I still remain, at heart, an optimist.I know that there is in this country the strength and ability to rise to our challenges; that there is, amongst our fellow citizens of Europe, an understanding of the importance of the moment we face; that there is, in the world, both the means and the opportunity to create the new institutions that we need.What we lack is not the means to solve these problems. What we lack is only the will.What we miss is not skill, or understanding or compassion. These the world has in abundance.What we miss is leadership.I do not pretend that the long-term solutions will be easy. And I do not believe that we Liberal Democrats will have them all. I do not even think that all the people who will be needed to meet these challenges here in Britain will belong to our Party. But I am certain of this: that the new ideas and the new energies we need are all there, waiting to be uncovered, waiting to be unleashed.And I believe that it is the role of this Party to unleash them.That is why, yesterday, we were right not to get lost in the atmosphere of this hall, but to respond to the realities outside it.That is why, yesterday, we were right to decide that our ideas, so desperately needed by our time, are nevertheless worthless unless we seek and use the opportunities to put them into practice.I want them to say of us that we were practical people at a time when a world, in crisis, had too many dogmas and too few solutions. In this speech I want to tell you how we can achieve that.But first, I want to tell you where I think we are, and what I believe we should learn from the last year.It has been, for me personally and for our Party, a tough year.But it has been a year when we showed our strength and proved our cause.Not a year to replay. But a year to build on.So, as we knew before we fought it, the April General Election was not a destination, but a port of call. A chance to check our bearings and prepare ourselves for the next part of our journey.Thanks to you and your campaigning, our team in Parliament is strong.And our party in the country is strong too - a record number of Councillors, our largest ever share of the youth vote, a growing membership, sound finances.Yes - we are now strong.And, as yesterday showed, we now stand ready to make that strength count where it matters.One thing will distinguish us now as it distinguished us during the election - we will not duck the issues. Nor will we pretend that there is no price to be paid in facing them.We were right in the election campaign.We were right to put at the very heart of our message the need - the overwhelming need - to invest in education. And we were right to say that we\u2019d do it, even if it meant paying more from our own pockets.We were right - so right - to point to the dangers to our environment - to the air we breathe and the water we drink - and to the complacency of so many when our planet itself is in deep distress.And we were right, daily we are proved to have been right, to say what needed to be said about Britain\u2019s economy. We didn\u2019t pretend that there was a recovery around the corner. We didn\u2019t promise we could get it right overnight. We said it would be tough to pull Britain round after forty years of relative decline.We said what the country is now discovering - that there are no quick economic fixes. That a strong economy can only be built, slowly and patiently, by a government with the will to invest in skills, with the strength to plan for the long term and with the determination to encourage enterprise and competition.In all these things we were right - and people knew that we were right.And yet, in the end, despite our success in that campaign, a crucial number still didn\u2019t put their vote where their heart was.But if this April was not yet a vote for change, neither was it the vote of a contented Britain - as some have claimed.It was, rather, the vote of a nation which has been persuaded to cling to nurse because they had been warned to fear for something worse.This was no victory for Conservatism. It was a victory for fear.Fear \u2013 that\u2019s the Tories\u2019 only weapon. It always was. And it always will be.So we, who want to build a new future for this country, must now find the means to banish fear and teach the British people how to hope again. As Roger Roberts said, we must persuade people to vote, not against their nightmares, but for their dreams.That was the real tragedy of 1992. Change was - is - so much needed. And yet we end up, again, trapped in the ice-pack of inertia, indifference and indolence which is the hallmark of the Conservatives after thirteen years in power.This is the first Government in history which, at the start of a new Parliament, hit the ground ambling.The opponents of electoral reform say that it would produce governments which were indecisive, unable to act, unwilling to innovate, incapable of clear leadership.But we now have a Government which has shown itself so paralysed by inactivity that they make Sir Geoffrey Howe look like Linford Christie.Back in 1979, the Conservatives said that all Britain needed to break out of the spiral of economic decline was an extended period of Conservative Government. Well, that\u2019s what we\u2019ve had - for 13 long years.And the result? Two recessions, then a slump, and now a sterling crisis. Do you remember what John Major said? His exact words: \u2018Vote Conservative on Thursday, and the recovery will continue on Friday.\u2019.... Be fair! He never said which Friday!And so there he stood, our Ancient Mariner Prime Minister, on the deck of his ship, becalmed, alone, save for the loyal Lamont, the albatross of Thatcherism around his neck, his Government paralysed by inaction. Day after day, Day after day,We stuck, nor breath, nor motion. As idle as a painted shipUpon a painted ocean.But where is the crew?Hands up the last person to see Michael Heseltine!Remember him! When he wasn\u2019t in the Government he was always making speeches; always on the TV; never a week without an article in a newspaper with some bright idea for getting the economy going again.Then he became Minister for Trade and Industry. Since when - silence!Come out Michael, we know you\u2019re in there somewhere! Yes, I'll bet you\u2019re in there somewhere.Was there ever a Government that cost the people so much in jobs, houses and businesses, then so confidently claimed they would put it right and then so swiftly admitted that they couldn\u2019t?Was there ever a set of promises so blithely made - and so cynically betrayed?So here we are again, in 1992, with manufacturing output lower than it was in 1974.Here we are again, with unemployment, today, climbing inexorably towards three million - the millions who pay with their jobs, their homes, their futures for the Government\u2019s mistakes.Here we are again, with a Prime Minister who responded to a crisis by pretending it wasn\u2019t there.Who took no action, when action was available.And who left the country to pay the price.Yet again, a Prime Minister who said: \u2018Crisis, what crisis?\u2019 Well, today, we say: \u2018Leader, what leader?\u2019The Prime Minister claimed that there was no alternative. Well, he was wrong. There was an alternative!It is the alternative first proposed by Alan Beith - supported by the CBI and put into practice by Japan.You see, our membership of the ERM was not an excuse for doing nothing.It made action all the more necessary.If monetary policy could not be employed as an economic stimulus, then the Government should have acted through fiscal means to improve the real economy.It isn\u2019t as though we lacked the means.There is now in Britain a sum of around eight billion pounds from the sale of Council Houses locked up, unused, in Council bank accounts. Liberal Democrats say, unlock that money and use it!Use it to stimulate the construction industry, to create jobs and to provide homes for the thousands upon thousands in Britain who so desperately need them.What a scandal. So many homeless; so many out of work; so much money lies idle and unused.And instead of cutting capital expenditure, we could have brought forward capital spending and invested it in what Britain needs - in railways, in telecommunications, in energy efficiency.And, if the Government could have found the courage to spend just 1% of what they wasted on the Poll Tax, they could have funded the mortgage to rent schemes Liberal Democrats have been proposing for a year, saving thousands from the misery of repossession and giving the housing market the boost it needs.And, instead of having had to rely on the Chancellor to interrupt his breakfast whenever sterling faltered, we could have given the markets permanent confidence in our money by giving Britain an Independent Central Bank.No! We did not lack the means to get Britain moving again. We just lacked the leadership.And one of the reasons for that, was that Britain lacked an effective opposition.They simply joined the Government in their summer slumber.It was not John Cunningham who led the opposition on the tragedy in Bosnia - it was Russell Johnston and David Steel. It was not Labour who challenged the Government on Europe \u2013 they\u2019re too divided themselves - it was the Liberal Democrats. And, while Gordon Brown was complaining about the economy, it was Alan Beith who proposed the alternatives.Labour now stands at a crossroads.Can Labour become part of the force for change in Britain, or will they continue to be the obstacle to change in Britain?Can Labour join those who fight for new ideas in Britain, or will they remain the defenders of the old causes in our country?Can Labour join us in the fight against vested interest, or will they remain, like now, the puppets of the vested interest of the Trades Unions?That is the challenge for Labour. Having shown that they cannot beat the Conservatives, will they continue as the road-block which guards the Tories from defeat, or are they ready to play their part in the new politics of Britain?Look at this simple contrast from the last election.The more that people believed Liberal Democrats could win, the more they said they would vote for us. But the more that people thought that Labour might win, the more they ran straight back to the Conservatives.Britain lost its chance to have Fair Votes at the last election, not because of Liberal Democrat campaigns, but because Mr. Kinnock couldn\u2019t drag himself off the fence. On this vital issue, Labour couldn\u2019t say yes and they wouldn\u2019t say no.Thank goodness the modern Labour Party weren\u2019t around in the last century, or we should still be waiting for next year's Labour Conference to report on the advisability of universal suffrage!And so, for four General Elections in a row, the Conservatives have gained an absolute monopoly of power on only 43% of the vote.A minority with all the privileges of the majority.That is why, at this conference, I repeat this simple pledge.Our enemies may misrepresent the cause. Opinion polls may vary. Other parties may shift. But until Britain has a system of election which faithfully reflects the will of its people, we Liberal Democrats will never, never give up our fight for fair votes!And here is a small piece of advice for John Smith.Do not treat Fair Votes as an issue on which you move only grudgingly and reluctantly after the last iota of Party gain has been measured. The Great Reform Acts were not carried by narrow Party advantage; but by justice, democracy and the national interest.So the question for John Smith is this: Where will you be when it comes to the final battle for fair votes?Sitting on the fence with Neil, or standing in the front line with the Liberal Democrats?And let me tell you why this issue of fair votes is so important.It is because democracy itself is now facing a challenge. We saw it in the phenomenon of Ross Perot; in the rise of Le Pen; in the rebellion against all parties in the Danish referendum; we will see it again on Sunday, when France votes on Maastricht.And the reason is simple. It\u2019s because, today, when politicians speak, they are seen to speak, not for those they serve, but for themselves. They speak, not for those who need, but for those who already have; not for those who are shut out, but for those who are in the system and know how to use it for their own ends.Well, I want to find a new sort of politics. Westminster has become cut off, separated, its eyes closed to the conditions of ordinary people and its mind shut to the solutions that exist.It\u2019s time we bridged the gap between those people who claim to speak for Britain - and those people who are Britain.And that\u2019s why, starting next month, I shall be spending less time in Westminster listening to the politicians of the old parties, and more time out in our communities listening to the real voice of the new Britain. But we must do more than that.Already, around the world, new thinkers are experimenting with referendums and other instruments of direct democracy. Liberal Democrat councils have been doing the same, consulting people directly about the services they use and the taxes they pay. Now some tell us this is folly. They say you cannot trust the people to take the right decisions about their future. They tell us that the people are too dim, and the problems are too complex.Well, I\u2019ve never believed that and neither has this Party.So I want us, the Liberal Democrats, to find new ways to involve people in the decisions which affect their lives so that our democracy can be reinvigorated.Britain needs change.Britain, who led the world in political and scientific change in the last century, must now find the confidence to change again in order to prepare ourselves for the next century.We need change to turn back the rising tide of unemployment, which is hitting homes, and blighting futures.We need change to provide effective economic management.We need change to face up to the challenges of global pollution.We need change to raise the standards in our schools and colleges and training institutions.We need change to enable Britain\u2019s industry to compete in the world, to win in the single market and to liberate the skills, talent and natural resources of our people.We need change to guarantee equal chances and new opportunities for women.We need change to end the centralisation of power, the division of our communities and discrimination against individuals on the basis of their colour, gender or sexual orientation.We need change to offer hope and achievement to those who see no hope on the run-down estates of our cities and no achievement for the jobless young who live there.So here is the cause that I want for our party. It is the cause that will dominate our politics in this decade. It is the cause that will mark us out as a party for the future.I want us to be the Opportunity Party in an Opportunity Britain.Now, there may be some who think that opportunity is a Tory word.Well, if that is so, then our first task is to reclaim it for the truth.For opportunity is not a Tory idea.They talk of opportunity. Yet for millions in Conservative Britain opportunity is stifled from the very day they are born - by bad housing, poor health care, under-funded education, lack of training.In Conservative Britain, too many are locked out from success.In Conservative Britain, too many miss out in education and training, too many trapped by welfare, too many imprisoned by poverty.Too many talents wasted. Too many good ideas lost. Too many opportunities blighted.So, I don\u2019t favour the Conservative sort of opportunity, which increases the power of the already powerful, and the riches of the already rich.Conservative opportunity means giving occasional opportunities to the few.Liberal Democrat opportunity means giving continuing opportunities to all.That means giving every employee in Britain the right to own a part of their job and to share in the profits they help to create.It means giving every person in Britain the chance to choose when and how they will retire at a time to suit them in a flexible decade of retirement.It means creating a welfare system which doesn\u2019t trap people, but frees them. Which provides dignity for those who would otherwise not have it and second chances for those who would otherwise never get them. It means giving everyone the right to second chances and third chances and fourth chances to education and training at any time in their life.It means giving people who want to own their own house the chance to have a home to live in, not a millstone round their neck.It means giving those who wish to rent the chance to do so.And above all, it means giving our citizens the power to be the master of their Government, not its slave.In the last decade of the last century, our forbears, the New Liberals, people like Hobhouse, Haldane, Churchill, laid down the new ideas of citizenship and opportunity which gave this country the Old Age Pension and laid the foundation for power for the great reforming Government of 1906.Let them say of us, in this last decade of our century, that it was the Liberal Democrats who found the means to strike the shackles of poverty, of ignorance and of blight from those left out millions who have paid the price for the last thirteen years of Tory Government.But if we must create opportunity at home, then it is our task to help Britain rise to the challenge abroad.Our case for internationalism is not just a moral one; it is a deeply practical one, too.All around us, people strive for justice, for liberty and for their identity.We cannot be neutral in that struggle.We cannot stand by while the people of the Balkans suffer under the tyranny of the war-lord and the slaughter of the heavy guns.We cannot stand by while Somalia starves, or while the authority of the United Nations is flouted by the arrogance of Saddam Hussein.We cannot stand by while the poor of the world suffer the pain of famine and the lash of injustice.Their interest is our interest too.And we do not lack the means to help them.While every day, more in Somalia starve, we in Europe are paying to store a grain mountain large enough to feed Somalia for twenty-seven years! Will somebody, in the name of humanity, please explain to me why?Every day, 200 aircraft patrols are flown over Iraq to keep Saddam Hussein down and George Bush\u2019s poll ratings up. But, for months, we could not find the will to put even a single plane over Sarajevo to protect its defenceless people from slaughter.Will somebody, in the name of justice, please explain to me why?We provided safe havens for the Kurds. But we cannot, I am told, give UN protection to the miserable human victims of the Bosnian war, who we saw huddled in indescribable conditions in the refugee camp at Trnopolje.They will start to die by the score and by the thousand when winter comes in a few weeks\u2019 time - and the old and the women and the babies will be the first to die.Will somebody please explain to me why?We do not lack the means to save these people. We only lack the leadership.Britain should be leading the way in creating the new institutions which the world needs in the post-Cold War era. Instead we seem to celebrate our sour-faced scepticism in the face of almost every international initiative.In the 1940s, this country helped to create the United Nations. Fifty years later, we should be giving it the power to act, not just as peace keeper, but as a peace maker, to protect human rights, assure humanitarian aid and preserve peace. But peace will not just come through the United Nations. Peace will also come through a united Europe. And it is that Europe which is currently at risk, as we approach the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty.As Uffe Ellemann-Jensen told us on Monday, Maastricht has its faults. Too much power for Brussels, too little for the European Parliament. Too centralist. Too interventionist. Too much for the politicians, too little for the people.But Maastricht was never intended to be the final destination. It is a staging post.The faults of Maastricht can be put right.But if Maastricht falls, there is a real risk that the journey ends. And, then, the momentum of Europe will be lost, and the cause of European unity may even go into reverse. And then, for us, what shows every sign of being the nasty nineties, will be much, much, nastier still.The problem, once again, lies, not with the cause, but the leadership.Look at the debate in Britain. A cautious Prime Minister. A silent leader of the opposition. A General Election that never even discussed the issue.Is it any wonder that the people are sometimes reluctant to follow, when leaders in Parliament are so reluctant to lead?So now it is up to the French to decide our destiny. And not, it appears, just ours. Bryan Gould\u2019s as well.John Smith tells us that, if the French vote yes, Bryan Gould will have to go.You know, it\u2019s one thing for the people of France to decide the future of Europe. But it\u2019s pretty extraordinary to let them decide the composition of the Shadow Cabinet!I know that we have been urging on the Labour Party one person one vote. But it was the Labour Party we had in mind, not the French.But to be serious. If the French vote \u2018no,\u2019 then we face a moment of profound danger for Europe.And we will need clear leadership and iron will to ensure that progress towards unity is maintained.There is a real danger that the force of nationalism and the Right - not least in this country - will use this moment to reassert themselves and throw Europe into retreat. A French no vote on Sunday must be swiftly followed by a reaffirmation of our will to continue progress towards unity in Europe. If the French say no, then the Prime Minister as President should call a summit of European leaders and, through them, issue a clear declaration that the fall of Maastricht will not stop the progress towards unity, that another vehicle will be found, and that, in building it, the faults of Maastricht will be corrected.If this is what the Prime Minister does, then he can be certain of our backing. And if the French vote yes, then we will require the same determination and the same leadership from the Prime Minister - in the House of Commons and with his own party. Again, I give him this assurance - that if he shows the leadership that is necessary to get Maastricht ratified, then he can count on our support.You see, on this crucial issue, as on the current crisis, it is the role of our Party to lead the process of working with others to assure our country\u2019s future. And the stronger we are, the greater will be our effect. So we must now work to make our party stronger still.Build up our membership. Win more council seats. Plan for the campaigns to come.And we must continue our pursuit of new ideas, radical solutions, fresh thinking. And we must mark out with ever greater clarity our message the message of opportunity which separates us from every other Party. But we should also strive for something more.We know how to compete; we must also show that we know how to co-operate.We Liberal Democrats decided yesterday to be at the heart of a great new movement for change in our country. We will be the focus of this new majority, its cutting edge. We will show the self confidence in our own ideas to test them against those of others. We will reach out, to some in other parties, and to many in none, in order to create an agenda for reform, a coalition for change, a wider community of conscience.Our task will be, as John Maynard Keynes put it in a previous age, to change our times: \u2018by setting in motion those forces of instruction and imagination which change opinion. The assertion of truth, the unveiling of illusion, the dissipation of hate...\u2019For that\u2019s what matters in politics - not just party, though party is important. What matters are principles and progress: principles that we stand by - and progress that, together, we can achieve.And I say to those who will be watching us today from outside:If you want to see a different sort of politics, help us in that fight;If you want to see a positive sort of politics, join in our campaigns; And if you want to see a politics that faces up to the future, act with us to change the way that Britain works. No political leader can ever guarantee success, particularly at a time as storm-tossed as those we live through. But what I can promise is that as we started, so shall we go on, challenging ourselves and the British people to face up to the real issues and, by so doing, offering hope and opportunity to our country.We have decided what we must do. It is time to embark on the second stage of our journey.We cannot know yet where all the shoals and reefs will lie, nor what storms may cross our path.But this is now a strong vessel, with a tough and tested crew.And our sails are set to the winds which will blow through this decade and into the next century.There is a new political world to be discovered for those with the courage to seek it.It is the Liberal Democrats who have that courage.It is the Liberal Democrats who will make that discovery.

aVThe State of Britain \u2013 and the Future for BritainI want to start by telling you about a little girl I met this year.Her name is Shahina Khan.  She is four and a half years old.  She is British.I spent the first night of the feast of Ramadan with her and her family in their flat above their shop in one of those inner city areas of our country so poor, so neglected, and so overwhelmed by crime that it made me feel deeply ashamed.The police say there are two shooting incidents a week there \u2013 the residents say you can hear gunfire almost every day.  There is a local industry, and it provides lots of jobs \u2013 it is drugs.The pay is very good.  You can earn forty or fifty pounds a day as a lookout\u2026 at ten years old.And there is a career structure, too.  You can progress from lookout, to dealer in a fast car, to supplier living respectably in the leafy suburbs.  On the other hand, you may not live that long \u2013 they\u2019d gunned down a fourteen year old in a takeaway queue not long before I arrived.  I can state the purpose of our Party quite simply.  It is to provide for the children of our country, and especially for children like Shahina Khan, a future of which we can all be proud. I have spent much of this year out of Westminster, living and working with people around the country.  And these past months have left me with some powerful impressions.The first impression is this.  That our country today is depressed and bewildered.  There is a sense of a hope that has died and a leadership that has failed.The second is that people are now looking for a new lead \u2013 and they are not getting it from their politicians.One man in Suffolk said to me, \u2018Why don\u2019t you ever get your act together?  You are all as bad as each other.  You are only in it for what you can get.\u2019 My third impression is of a whole political class grown distant from those we are supposed to serve.  A dangerous gulf is opening up between government and governed in Britain, sapping people\u2019s faith in their politicians and confidence in the political process.Westminster has become, not one of our country\u2019s solutions \u2013 but part of our country\u2019s problems.But my final impression is in many ways the most important.  It is this.  That there is still hope to be found in Britain \u2013 and new ideas \u2013 and energy \u2013 and individual potential \u2013 and solutions to problems that Westminster has so far failed to find. But where there is hope, it does not lie in our national politics, or in our public life \u2013 it lives in our towns and villages, in our enterprises and communities, and in the personal commitment and endeavours of individual citizens.The Liberal Democrat ChallengeFrom these impressions I identify two tasks for our Party in the run-up to the next election.First.  We must become the breath of fresh air blowing through our democracy, reviving it, opening it up, putting it back in touch with the people we serve. And second.  Where we win power we must use it to give opportunity to people and power to communities.Over the last five years we Liberal Democrats have, I believe, laid strong foundations.And this year we have built on those foundations.  This year, people have given us something which is more valuable than gold and rarer than diamonds in our politics today \u2013 they have given us their hope.They gave it to us in Newbury; they gave it to us in Christchurch; and they gave it to us in the county elections, when hundreds and thousands of people \u2013 many for the first time \u2013 invested their hope in the Liberal Democrats. But here is a warning.  Hope is a fragile thing.  It will be as easy for us to lose as it was hard for us to win.So our job in the next year is to turn that hope into trust; to turn support into confidence; to turn protest into power.I want people to understand that Liberal Democrat is not just something you vote, it is something you are.That is why it is imperative that none of us should ever betray our principles in the battle for votes.  We have to understand in this Party that there is a difference between populism and winning popular support for our ideas.As a result of the last year we have, I believe, put ourselves in the big time.  But as we know, the big time is a brightly lit place.  We will now be subject to scrutiny, and we will be subject to attack.  If you make a mistake in your Council Chamber, it will hurt wherever we seek trust and power.  If we, in our campaigns, do not adhere to the highest standards for which our Party stands, we will suffer everywhere.The stakes now are very, very high.  That is why the Tories and Labour are attacking us so hard.If we now fail to live up to this opportunity, then this year\u2019s success will be no more than just another third Party surge which rises and dies again, as our country goes on declining under the two old parties.  But if we can rise to the challenge, if we can seize our opportunity, then I promise you there is no \u2018glass ceiling\u2019 for the Liberal Democrats.Mr. Major knows that we are the threat \u2013 that\u2019s why his first act of the new political season was to go to Taunton, to visit the West Country, to rally the troops. The Financial Times reported it in full.  This is the headline: \u2018Major rallies party against threat of Liberal Democrats.\u2019It was clearly effective.  A week later we took control of Dorset! But then sending John Major and Norman Fowler to rally the troops is a bit like asking the body-snatchers Burke and Hare to take charge of the local hospital.All I can say is \u2013 we hope you\u2019ll come again soon \u2013 the sooner the better!In fact, given the state of the Tory Party\u2019s finances, I have taken the liberty of buying a couple of tickets for you \u2013 on British Rail.One first class \u2013 and one ordinary class \u2013 for the Chairman of the Conservative Party.Yes, the Tories know that they are fast becoming the past in large areas of our country, and we are fast becoming the future.The Global Challenge \u2013 and Liberal Democrat Internationalism Which is why we have been right this week to look ahead.To look first at how we can create peace in an increasingly unstable world.We have shown this week that we have come a long, long way in how we address these matters.  You know, it is almost exactly forty years ago that David Steel\u2019s predecessor, Foreign Affairs Spokesman Sir Arthur Comyns-Carr QC, complete in wing collar and side-boots, opened his speech at the Liberal Assembly here in Torquay with the immortal words\u2026\u2018I do not wish to say anything which might endanger the security of Quemoy and Matsu off the coast of China.\u2019Well I hope that the large number of foreign diplomats and visitors we have at our Conference today is an indication that what we say today is perhaps taken rather more seriously.What we see emerging today is not a New World Order, but a New World Chaos of regional conflict, ethnic tension, re-emergent nationalism. The Collapse of Communism was not the End of History.  The latest events in Russia are a timely reminder of how fragile democracy still is in the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.Now there are those who say that, despite these threats, the United Nations needs to be no more than a glorified aid distribution agency and a facilitator for occasional lake-side talks between warring parties. Well we in this Party do not think that is enough.  In a world in which even petty dictators will soon own weapons of mass destruction; in which tides of refugees can destabilise whole regions; in which every small nation will be able to hold the world to ransom over the global environment; in which the scramble for resources and food will itself become a growing cause for conflict \u2013 in this kind of world, if we do not have a strong United Nations, then we will not have peace.And if a just peace is our aim, then Bosnia has been a disaster \u2013 not only for the innocents who have suffered and died there, but for the future of us all.This Balkan tragedy has been a tale of timidity, weak leadership and bungled opportunities.What will history have to say about the fact that ordinary people were prepared to do so much in Bosnia, when their governments were prepared to do so little?What will history have to say about our Prime Minister, who as President of the European Community last autumn seemed more interested in fiddling with the meaning of federalism than stopping the burning of the great European city of Sarajevo?What will history say of a Conservative Party that once felt humiliated by withdrawing from East of Suez, but which now seems uninterested in anything East of Margate?The truth is, the danger to Western Europe in the 1990s that comes from the disintegration of Eastern and Central Europe is quite as great, in its different way, as the danger posed to the western democracies by the rise of fascism in the 1930s.What we increasingly hear in Tory foreign policy is a sound from sixty years ago \u2013 Halifax, echoing in Hurd.  It is cynical.  It is short-term.  It is lacking in honour.  And it is called appeasement.Britain needs to face the facts about our national interest in the modern world.  Britain\u2019s interest is to see international law upheld, if necessary by force, because it is only through international order that Britain\u2019s peace can be secured.War \u2013 when it has to come to war \u2013 is a serious business, and the UN had better start taking it seriously.  If the UN is to be an effective force for peace-keeping, let alone peace-making, there will have to be some changes. First, we will need to redefine the criteria for UN intervention.Second, we should establish an effective structure for the payment of peace-keeping operations.Third, we must reconstitute the UN military staff committee to plan and command UN operations.Fourth, we must establish a standing force of well-trained, high-quality troops for international peace-keeping.Fifth, we should establish a UN staff college to develop the techniques of international peace-keeping and peace-making.And sixth, we should set up a UN international information agency to provide unbiased intelligence on military conflict, potential threats and the state of the world\u2019s environment.Now, here is a real opportunity for Britain.  Remember what Dean Acheson said, a generation ago: Britain had lost an empire, but had yet to find a role.Well here is a role.  Britain should take the lead in setting up an effective UN framework for the control of conflict.  We have the experience of half a century of peace-keeping in the brush-fire wars of post-colonial conflict.  And as I saw in Bosnia, we have the most professional army in the world, setting the standards in this kind of operation.Britain should be the first country to earmark troops for a UN standing force.  We should open a course at the army Staff College to provide training for the UN in international peace-keeping.  And we should propose that a new UN Peace-keeping Agency be established, with its headquarters here in Britain.This is a new proud role for Britain and for our armed services in the future. Britain\u2019s European FutureAnd this is the moment when Britain must begin to play its proper role in Europe, too.Before we meet again at our next Autumn Conference, we will have had the European Elections.Make no mistake, the Liberal Democrats will fight those elections as the only party in Britain which has been consistently committed to Britain\u2019s future in Europe. We shall be attacked for this.  But we will not give way.  For this is one of our enduring principles.  And it is the only practical future for our country.Let us respond to attacks positively by asking three simple questions.First.  What will most help Britain\u2019s frail economy and Britain\u2019s jobs?  Being left out, or being an integral part of a single market powerful enough to win trade and jobs in a fiercely competitive global economy?Second.  What will best protect Britain\u2019s security and interest?  To loiter palely on the periphery, divided, impotent, voiceless in an increasingly uncertain world, or to speak with a powerful united voice in concert with our friends?Third.  What will most effectively protect Britain\u2019s environment?  Becoming an offshore dump, unable to stop pollution from abroad, unwilling to prevent it at home, or setting high European-wide environmental standards for us and our neighbours?So let us be robust about our European future; and let us ensure that our opponents are not able to fool people with their fantasy of a right little, tight little Ruritania-on-Sea.But at the same time, let us be prepared to admit the truth \u2013 that Brussels is not always right; and that a great deal of hard nitty-gritty work has to be done before the Liberal Democrat dream of a democratic, decentralised, diverse but united Europe is created.Let us acknowledge that we need power-sharing at every level; that monetary union can only emerge from economic convergence; and that we need, not just a Europe of government, big business and the Commission \u2013 but a Europe of citizens, consumers and regions.Britain has so much to give Europe, and so much to gain from Europe \u2013 if only we could lift our heads from the poverty of our \u2018little England\u2019 vision and narrow sense of national self-interest.Instead, it is Britain\u2019s misfortune to be saddled at this moment of opportunity with a Party of Government that neither wants to be in Europe, nor out of Europe\u2026 but, to coin a phrase made famous by Spitting Image, \u2018somewhere in-between\u2019! Time and again the interests of the nation are subordinated to the interests of the Conservative Party.  You cannot get lower than a government that, to save its own skin in the Maastricht debate, was prepared to do discreditable deals with sectarian politicians in Ulster, in order to deny British people their rights at work.Conservative BritainBut that is the way of the modern Conservative Party \u2013 no dishonour too great, no deal too shady, no price too high to pay, provided they can stay in office and their Party can stay in power.As the Tories cluster around the honey-pot of public contracts and appointments, buzzing with greed, I can\u2019t help being reminded of the Prudential \u2018wannabe\u2019 advert.  You know the one?What does every budding Young Conservative say to himself?  Not, I fear, \u2018I wannabe a Minister and govern wisely.\u2019 More like:\u2018I wannabe Chairman of the Planning Committee, and help the developers.\u2019 \u2018I wannabe Chairman of the Area Health Authority and hand out computer contracts.\u2019 \u2018I wannabe Secretary of State, privatise an industry, and then join the board.\u2019 \u2018I wannabe Chancellor of the Exchequer, wreck the economy, humiliate the government \u2013 and join a bank in the City.\u2019 \u2018I wannabe a Tory, because it\u2019s the quickest way to get rich.\u2019The Conservatives have steadily eroded the boundaries between public service and private interest \u2013 and it could not have happened if there had been some leadership at the top.It is as if we now have an empty room in Number Ten Downing Street, as though we have a phantom Prime Minister. How strange it must feel in Downing Street today.  Three years ago, when She was there, the House rocked and buzzed with manic energy \u2013 lights on, rooms full, doors slamming, Ministers cowering, furniture jumping, as She rushed from one room to another like some demented poltergeist.But now \u2013 empty.As I was going up the stair,I met a man who wasn\u2019t there.He wasn\u2019t there again today,I wish, I wish, he\u2019d go away!Policy-making in this Government has now degenerated into a mess of crisis management and free market fixes to appease the Right.I give you just one example \u2013 the privatisation of the railways \u2013 probably the craziest piece of legislation to come from the Tories since\u2026 well, since the Poll Tax! Now, of course, there are sensible ways of getting more private finance into our public railways \u2013 even John Prescott has recognised that. But all we will get from Mr. MacGregor\u2019s muddle will be higher fares, a greater burden on the taxpayer, more closed lines, more vehicles on our roads, and miles and miles more motorways.This dogma of privatisation has now become an ideological millstone that stands in the way of any rational decision-making about the future of our public services.Privatisation has become the Conservative Party\u2019s Clause 4.Privatisation is the dogma that ties the Conservative Party to the 1980s, when we should be looking forward to the next century.The Challenge for LabourWhat Britain needs is modernisers. And Labour do not yet seem up to that test either.  They still do not understand what a modern Britain needs.Labour will never be taken seriously on democratic reform, until they have reformed their own internal democracy.Labour will never be taken seriously as managers of the economy, until they understand the importance of the market. Labour will never be taken seriously on Europe, while they remain unclear and divided. Labour will never be taken seriously on the environment, while they duck the issue of environmental taxation Labour will never be taken seriously on constitutional change, while they refuse to change our rotten voting system. Labour has now wasted a year and shows every sign of wasting another.  I warn them that the great movement for reform in our country cannot wait for them much longer.The Crisis of Politics and Democratic Renewal It is no wonder that people have lost faith in our political system and our political class. Britain now faces some very, very tough decisions.  We cannot, for instance, ignore the challenge of the impending resource collision in our welfare services.  We cannot ignore the challenge of building a competitive economy that can win in a total global market.  We cannot ignore the need to alter our lifestyles in order to save our environment. And there are no easy solutions to these problems. Unless we can find the ways to involve people in confronting the tough decisions ahead; unless we can enable them to feel a shared responsibility in the choices that have to be made; unless we can bind them more firmly into the actions that have to be taken, then we risk blowing apart the whole democratic system. So rebuilding that confidence, reinvigorating our democracy, reviving our political system is the essential first step to putting Britain back on track. That is why we need a truly representative voting system, so that our democratic institutions reflect the will of the people.That is why we need a decentralised political system with power dispersed, and decisions made as near as possible to the people. That is why we should be looking, as we have done this week, at other ways of opening up government.And that is why we need to foster a new style of politics in our country.  The new politics of pluralism and partnership that Liberal Democrats are now building in councils across the country where we are in power.   A politics that is open instead of closed; a politics that values co-operation as much as we are now dominated by confrontation; and a politics that replaces dishonesty with candourTackling Tax: \u2018No Taxation without Explanation\u2019Nowhere is this more desperately needed than in the debate about taxation.  For the question of tax lies at the heart of the new economics of progress, and at the heart of the dilemma for progressive politicians. Politicians who stand for progress seem to have lost the ability to win the positive arguments for tax.People are angry about cuts in the NHS, angry about the state of our schools, angry about the condition of our public transport \u2013 and rightly so \u2013 but so far they have seemed unwilling to pay the tax needed to improve these services.Why?  I believe one reason is because they no longer trust politicians with their money. If progressive politicians are to win the case for the investment that is essential for our future, we are going to have to find a new language which expresses taxation not as a burden, but as an opportunity.That means being honest about our tax plans; fair in our tax policies; and guaranteeing value for the taxes we collect.And it means tackling waste.  I would like the Liberal Democrats to be known throughout the country as the scourge of waste \u2013 attacking over-manning in Whitehall, the overblown schemes of municipal socialism in town halls, and the scandalous overspending on government ministers\u2019 pet projects.Here is a motto for the 1990s - \u2018no taxation without explanation.\u2019 That means making clearer the connection between what we pay in tax, and the services we receive in return.That means telling people on their tax demands what their money will be spent on \u2013 just as local government is now required to do.That means finding new ways of involving people more directly in determining the levels of local tax, consulting people and using local referenda as some Liberal Democrat councils already do.And it means investigating what further scope there is for earmarked \u2013 or hypothecated \u2013 taxes, as we proposed with our penny for education at the last election.One hundred years ago, in the 1890s, our forebears the New Liberals began the historic shift towards progressive taxation. I believe that what we have embarked upon this week is just as revolutionary and just as fundamental.  We have begun to make the shift towards environmental taxes.  We have begun to establish how we ensure value-for-taxation.  And we have begun to develop the new language that is needed if we are to win the argument for the investment our country so desperately needs.Britain\u2019s Economic FutureThis new fiscal programme is a central part of the distinctive economic policy our Party is now developing. One of the mistakes we consistently make in Britain is to pretend that we have all the levers of our own economic destiny in our own hands.  This is simply untrue.The power of governments over their own macro-economies is being progressively diminished by the pressures of an open, global economy and global currency flows.  As we saw on Black Wednesday.So the role of government is not to pretend that it can shape any and every aspect of the macro-economy \u2013 it is rather to create the conditions for success in the micro-economy.This means that economic policy in the future should concentrate more and more on the supply-side and on micro-economic matters \u2013 internal competition, encouragement for enterprise and small business, creating flexible labour markets.Success and prosperity for Britain in the future will come from a high-skill, high-value-added economy, producing high-quality tradable goods \u2013 an economy in which Britain\u2019s greatest single asset will be the skills and ideas of our people.That is why we must begin now, investing in people and knowledge \u2013 in the education and training to give us the foundation of flexible, broad-based skills upon which our future prosperity will depend.That is why we should be acting now, to build a partnership between the public and the private sector to invest in research and development and in infrastructure.  And incidentally, not just in transportation, but in modern telecommunications that will allow Britain to make the most of the opportunities that new global markets will present.You see, in the end, it is the initiative and effort of individuals that creates wealth, encourages improvement, fosters innovation, drives progress.Look where Britain has succeeded.  Did governments do it?  Did governments invent the spinning jenny, or build our manufacturing base, or invent the computer, or discover DNA?  No, the people did.So what is the role of the State?The Labour Party, I am afraid, still seems to think that the State can do everything.Well I do not believe governments can do everything \u2013 and I do not believe they should.  That is the great flaw in socialism.Government\u2019s prime function should be to help individuals and communities make the most of their potential \u2013 not big government, not small government, but active government.And that means government based on partnership.Partners against CrimeAnd nowhere is this more important than on the issue that is blighting so many lives in Britain today \u2013 rising crime and fear of crime.Let me give you a sense of the scale of the problem.  For every 100 crimes now committed in Britain \u2013 only 41 are reported, only 26 are recorded, only 7 are cleared up, and only 3 result in convictions.A third of all offenders are under 17, and two-thirds are under 21.  The average age of a housebreaker in our country is 16 and a half years old.And the Government\u2019s response?  More tough talk from Michael Howard \u2013 and the Sheehy Report.  Proposals that will cut police numbers, damage recruitment and sap morale.  These are proposals that we will fight at every single opportunity.But statistics do not tell everything.  Behind every single statistic is an individual tale of misery. One lady on a South London estate told me recently that her flat was her prison after dark.  \u2018In the evening,\u2019 she said, \u2018we close the door and try to forget about what is outside.\u2019  I just do not believe that people should have to live like that in Britain in the last decade of the twentieth century.And nowhere now is the fear of crime greater than among the ethnic minority communities of our country \u2013 communities that are an integral part of our social fabric and a source of strength in every part of our national life.It is intolerable that individual citizens in our country are taunted, and beaten, and stabbed for no other reason than the colour of their skin.What is needed now is for all democratic parties in our country to come together to show the leadership to fight this obscenity.And here is one proposal.  A new Racial Attack Squad capable of fighting the menace of racial violence wherever it occurs, in whatever corner of our land.And that is what is needed if we are to fight rising crime \u2013 practical action.That is what is at the heart of the Liberal Democrat Campaign for Safer Neighbourhoods, launched this week \u2013 policies that get to the root of the problem and stop crime taking place. These are not airy fairy ideas \u2013 they are extremely practical measures, many of them already working, on a small scale in different parts of the country \u2013 and working successfully, as I saw in Solihull earlier in the year.There they understand that crime is not just a problem for the police \u2013 it is a problem for all of us.  They have mobilised the whole community and started to tackle crime at its very roots, in the school and in the family.They have concentrated \u2013 as we do \u2013 not on theory, but on what works.  And it is working \u2013 crime is slowly beginning to come down in the area.This is the kind of initiative the Government should be promoting and supporting, not just here and there, but in every single local community across the country. It is in building successful partnerships like that one that the future role of Government lies, and on which the future of our country depends.Self-reliant Individuals, Strong Communities, Active GovernmentFellow Liberal Democrats, we have come a long way together in the last five years.  But there is a long way still to go.  At the end of this Conference, as we continue on our journey, we might remember the words of Winston Churchill \u2013 this is not the end, it is not even the beginning of the end, but it is, for us, the end of the beginning.What we can say, today, is that we are now a force in British politics that cannot be ignored.We have the vision; we have the principles; and we are building the policies.Self-reliant individuals.  Strong communities.Active government.  Dynamic markets.Public investment.  Private enterprise.A society of higher quality and greater opportunity for all.Of enterprise and initiative.Of active, responsible citizens.A government that is honest, just, and trusted by people, because it is ready to put its trust in people.Our task now is to turn hope into trust; trust into confidence; and confidence into power.

aVBefore I start, there is one thing I want to say to the Conference.The papers tell me that the Party leadership has been embarrassed once or twice this week by the antics of the activists. Well thank goodness we\u2019re not the Tory Party, where the activists are constantly embarrassed by the antics of the leadership!You know, Jeremy Hanley says you\u2019re the \u2018loony left\u2019... Oh, it could have been much, much worse. He could have accused you of youthful exuberance! I want this speech to go down really well. So I have asked all my Parliamentary colleagues to read it first. And I want to make it absolutely clear to the Conference that they disagree with every single word of it! But seriously, thinking back over the last six years since this Party was formed - and we\u2019ve come a long, long way together in those six years - I cannot think of a better year of electoral success... though I have to say I can think of one or two Conferences that have gone better. OK, so I may not have got my way once or twice. And as you all know, I like to get my way. But I am certain of this. The quality of our democracy in this Party is more important than the occasional discomfort of the Party leadership. But this Conference has TWO responsibilities. One IS to send messages to the leadership. And you do THAT very well. The other is to send messages to the voters. And I believe that we all need to think very hard about how we could do THAT better. What concerns me is that every time we are seen to take our mind off the big picture, we risk missing a great - perhaps unique - opportunity which we have created for ourselves.This is the time when our ideas are becoming the currency of debate. We must not allow ourselves to risk becoming distracted. A Peaceful RevolutionIn this speech I want to tell you why this moment must not be wasted. Why we must create a new kind of politics. And what I believe are the issues which the politics of progress must address. Note. I am not going to waste much time telling you how awful this Government is. Everyone in Britain knows that. Their view could be summed up quite simply in the words of a man I met when I was campaigning in Eastleigh.He said: \u2018Paddy, what\u2019s the difference between this government and a Lada?\u2019 And I said, \u2018I don\u2019t know, what is the difference between this government and a Lada?\u2019 \u2018Well,\u2019 he said: \u2018One\u2019s a clapped-out embarrassment from the 1980s, and the other\u2019s a car from Russia!\u2019 Well that says it all. So instead, I want to concentrate not on how bad the Conservatives have made things in the past, but on how much better we can make them in the future. People don\u2019t always realise how deep is the change which we Liberal Democrats seek. What we are fighting for is nothing less than a peaceful revolution - the most fundamental turn-round in our politics since the Great Reform Act of 1832. Our aim is nothing less than to overthrow the paternalism which has ruled the destinies of the British people, under BOTH Conservative and Labour.To shatter a system which presumes that governments know best - and replace it with the dangerous and dynamic doctrine that it is PEOPLE who know best. It is time for Britain\u2019s democratic revolution. It is time to dismantle much of the central state. It is time to put power back where it belongs, in the towns, in the cities, in the regions and in the nations of our United Kingdom. It is TIME to overturn the barriers that still stand in the way of 52% of our population - to liberate the potential of the women of this country.It is time to release the energy of the tens of millions who are shut out from the decisions which affect their lives. To root out the cosy corruption and bureaucratic waste of these last days of Conservatism.Let me say why. I believe there can be no regeneration of Britain - neither economic, nor social, nor political - unless people take back from the system the power that is rightfully theirs.The historic role of this Party - of we Liberal Democrats - is to make that possible. To rediscover the latent energy in Britain. To give everybody a chance to be a somebody.To see our people flourish with a government that is their servant, not their master.To let us - each of us - become a responsible citizen, not a resentful subject.Education That is why Liberal Democrats put education first. Of course, putting education first is easy to say, but it\u2019s tough to do. And the way you prove you put education first is by making education the FIRST call on the nation\u2019s investment resources. Putting education first means having the courage to give people the tools to think for themselves, to do things for themselves. Putting education first means fostering self-reliance, responsibility, tolerance and respect.And it\u2019s about giving people the skills for Britain\u2019s future economic success. Because Liberal Democrats understand that the only source of future prosperity for Britain lies in the minds and brains of our people - each and every one of them. Unleashing those skills is what the Japanese call \u2018mining the gold in people\u2019s heads\u2019 -and that\u2019s what we have to do. THAT is why every single British child must have the best possible start with guaranteed pre-school education. And I say to the Conservative and Labour parties, when it comes to nursery education, \u2018this year, next year, sometime, never\u2019 will not do.We need that investment now. WE prove it by saying how much it will cost, where the money will come from. And we challenge you to do the same.Second, putting education first means raising standards in schools. Yes, we need education strategies set by the LEAs. But individual schools should have the freedom to develop in their own distinctive ways.Yes, we need to improve the way we assess pupil achievement. But parents do have a right to meaningful information about their child\u2019s performance and this Party should see that that happens.Yes, teachers must be valued. Fifty, a hundred years ago, this country was a lot poorer than today. But one group that was respected was teachers. We want teachers to have that respect again.That\u2019s why the Liberal Democrats say YES to a General Teaching Council. YES to sabbaticals. YES to extra back-up for teachers and decent, well-equipped classrooms in which to work. But NO to poor teaching standards. That is the deal we offer teachers.And putting education first means more choice and opportunities for everyone after fourteen.It means two days a week quality learning and training for everyone between sixteen and nineteen.And it means an education \u2018entitlement\u2019 for every adult, which they can claim when they choose, at any time of their life. The Economy You see, what we should be preparing for is the sort of Britain we want in twenty, thirty, forty years\u2019 time. Look at successful modern economies. They all have one thing in common. They invest for the long-term.But Britain is locked into a short-term culture. Held back by a government that sells off our national assets to pay today\u2019s bills. Why? Because what interests this Conservative Government is not Britain\u2019s long-term future, but the Conservatives\u2019 short-term survival.And so the price we pay in Conservative taxes today is not the price of investment for the next century, it\u2019s the price of Conservative incompetence in the last decade.The taxes we pay are not to create better jobs in the next few years. They are to pay for the jobs which have been destroyed by the Tories over the last few years.You know, if unemployment had been reduced by just half between 1984 and 1993, we\u2019d have had enough money to build the Channel Tunnel rail link, to modernise London Underground, and to set up an information superhighway, all at the same time.And here is a WARNING. They\u2019re at it again. The sole aim of government policy now is not to fund investment in Britain for the next century, but to fund tax cuts, to save Conservative jobs at the next election. Well, Liberal Democrats say that money should be used, not to bribe the voters, but to build the future.And as the Conservatives once again prepare to dangle pre-election tax bribes before us, Britain might remember the old Russian proverb \u2013 \u2018free cheese only comes in mousetraps\u2019!We Liberal Democrats want to see a strong, highly competitive, flexible, enterprise economy.An economy founded on skills and innovation, sustained by long-term investment. An economy driven forward by vibrant small businesses.An economy supported by a government which acts to create stability - not just through the independence for the Bank of England, but also through savings and investment targets for steady long-term growth.An economy which is sustainable and clean, because that means efficiency and a better quality of life - and that means shifting tax away from the things we want, like jobs and wealth, and onto the things we don\u2019t want, like dirty air, congested roads, pollution.Tax and BenefitsNow tax has been a big issue this week. And in a moment, I want to say a word or two about it. But first I want to talk about promises.The country\u2019s become very wary about politicians\u2019 promises. After this Government\u2019s betrayal, that\u2019s hardly surprising.I don\u2019t believe people will be ready to believe promises unless we are prepared to be honest about the costs. THAT is why the Liberal Democrats will go into the next General Election with a clear, costed, \u2018menu with prices.\u2019And that is why we are going to have to decide what are priorities and what are long term goals. And it isn\u2019t going to be easy. But only if we can make those decisions can we become the fulcrum of trust that can make this Party the turning point of change. And only if we are clear about what we will spend will the voters accept what we will tax. This week we have established some of the principles of our tax policies.The Liberal Democrats will not be a high tax party, but we are determined to be a FAIR tax party. We will not penalise enterprise or self-reliance - we will encourage it. And we understand the special role in our economy of those on middle incomes. But we are determined to start making the investments all our children need for tomorrow, and creating the opportunities to get people into work.Opportunities cost. Of course they do. But so does ill-health, crime and poverty. And the Liberal Democrats will not take your money without telling you where it is going. We\u2019ll give tax payers more control over how their money is spent. So, here are Ashdown\u2019s four laws of taxation: One. Not high tax, but fair tax.Two. No taxation without explanation.Three. No promises, unless the bill is attached.And four. No way will the government ask YOU to do with less, until the government has first shown that IT can do with less. There are millions of pounds thrown away on ministers\u2019 pet schemes and the feather bedding which surrounds our bloated system of government. Last year I said our Party should become the public\u2019s watchdog against government waste. Since then, at Westminster we Liberal Democrats have exposed the scandalous waste of government advertising; the 60 million pounds wasted on unoccupied government offices; the severance payments to failed Tory ministers. What a scam! When people like Norman Lamont and John Patten get eight thousand pounds just for being sacked.I guess that\u2019s what the Tory party would call Performance Related Pay-Offs! And on the subject of scams, I want to turn to the Tory Party\u2019s very own soap opera - an everyday story of country folk - the Archers. Yesterday the world\u2019s most respected financial paper devoted a whole page to the unanswered questions of the Archer affair. Those questions require an answer. Doesn\u2019t the Conservative Party understand that simply asking Lord Archer to stay away from their Conference isn\u2019t a sufficient response?This matter will not go away until Michael Heseltine publishes the full facts. And he must do so now. The SystemBut we\u2019re talking about something much bigger than the failure of the Conservative Government. We\u2019re talking about the wider failure of our political system itself.That is why we have to turn the whole system on its head, to say to people - this is your country, your future, you take responsibility for it.Politicians must stop encouraging people to believe that government can do everything - or even should do everything.Let\u2019s just for a moment consider the Health Service.The most difficult question in the Health Service today is the question of health care priorities. \u2018Rationing\u2019 has always gone on, and it probably always willBut the people who are doing it are bureaucrats meeting in secret. And the people who are suffering are the patients who pay for the Health Service through their taxes.So why not let those who pay for the Health Service, and who depend on the Health Service, have a say on the priorities for the Health Service?These are serious issues and they need to be considered seriously.Why not set up a cross-Party Commission, involving health service professionals and outside experts, to lead this debate, and see if we can build a new cross-party consensus on the Health Service? - So that it really can become again the National Health Service, and NOT the National Political Football. You see, the Liberal Democrat task is to open up the system, help people to take and use power for themselves, empower people with information, access, involvement.That\u2019s why we need a new Great Reform Act in Britain.Why we need Freedom of Information.Why it\u2019s right to experiment with direct democracy.Why we need to break up the power of central government, give local communities more control over their own affairs, so the English regions have more power, so the people of Wales have their own Senedd, and so the people of Scotland can have their own Parliament. What we have been watching in Britain is the long slow death of pluralism under one-party rule.I am delighted that the Labour Party seems at last to be recognising the IMPORTANCE of pluralism. I just wish they practised it in some of their rotten inner city boroughs.TALKING about pluralism is fine. But there is only one GUARANTEE of pluralism.Fine words are meaningless unless they are backed by fair votes.But no programme of reform could possibly be complete without the reform of the most antiquated institution of them all - the House of Commons itself.Isn\u2019t it extraordinary that the House of Commons has imposed reform on almost every other institution in Britain while resisting any possible reform of itself? Isn\u2019t it extraordinary that the House of Commons is STILL dominated by white men in grey suits, when everyone agrees it should be properly representative? Isn\u2019t it extraordinary that, to conduct the nation\u2019s business, we have to behave in a way which would not be tolerated in any classroom in this country? Success in a modern society is based on partnership and teamwork - look at successful businesses. But the House of Commons is based on institutionalised confrontation and would rather die than share a decision with someone else. The long string of catastrophes, from the Poll Tax, to the arms-to-Iraq scandal, to the Criminal Justice Bill, proves only too clearly that the House of Commons comprehensively fails to hold the government to account.The House of Commons is out of date, out of tune with the country and out of touch with the people it is supposed to serve. But watch Labour in the House of Commons and you will see that they love it just as much as the Conservatives. The Labour Party want to inherit the House of Commons, not change it.So, let it be the Liberal Democrats who make it clear in our next manifesto that we are determined to drag the House of Commons, kicking and screaming if necessary, out of the last century and into the next. EuropeAnd if you want an example of just how the House of Commons has failed, just look at how the Maastricht Treaty was handled. One of the most important issues of our day - reduced down to arcane arguments, shambolic procedures and silly hats.We have to treat Europe more seriously in this country.The European Union is one of the success stories of this century. But as we approach the NEXT century, the challenge is to revitalise Europe by making the idea of Europe live for people.We must never forget the importance of Europe to us in Britain. Europe offers British people and British businesses great new opportunities, and great long-term benefits -prosperity, peace and progress. That\u2019s why this Government\u2019s behaviour over Europe is so incredible. I mean, what is Mr Major on about - a \u2018multi-speed Europe.\u2019 This is a community of nations we\u2019re talking about, not a Kenwood mixer. Instead of talking about \u2018variable geometry\u2019 - whatever that is - we should be putting down concrete proposals that reconnect Europe with its people - opening Europe up to public scrutiny; strengthening the European Parliament; and yes, responding to peoples\u2019 concerns about the power of Brussels by making sure that the Commission keeps out of areas where it has no business.But there is still more work to be done. What is being created in Europe is a unique federal structure. That does not mean a monstrous super-state - Liberal Democrats are not interested in that. But the essence of any federal structure is a clear definition of who does what at which level. Vague notions of \u2018subsidiarity\u2019 will no longer do. The central task of the Inter-Governmental Conference of 1996 must be to define the settlement and scope of powers which should be exercised by local councils, regional assemblies, national governments and the European Union institutions.I want the Liberal Democrats to prepare and publish our own proposals for the IGC - spelling out what powers should be exercised at which level; setting out reforms to the structure and functions of the Union. And when we have published our proposals, we shall discuss them with the voters of this country. Our future in Europe is far too important to be treated as a private quarrel within the Conservative party. So I ask John Major to do the same. Will he publish his own ideas for the IGC well in advance of 1996, and will he consult the British people on them? Foreign AffairsAnd nowhere is leadership in Europe more important than in striving for a safe, secure future in the world.We all hoped that the collapse of communism would usher in a new era of peace, stability and declining military budgets. I fear we could not have been further from the truth. In fact, I think there are now all the signs that the next decade in Europe could be as turbulent and dangerous as any we have seen in this most turbulent of centuries. The last three centuries of conflict in Europe have been between nations and about borders. Future ones will be between ethnic, tribal and religious groups and across borders. Bosnia writ large in the chaos of the collapsed Soviet Empire. Only the difference will be that this time, the war lords will have access to nuclear weapons. I am glad that, at this Conference, we faced up to that possibility and the impact it could have on military spending and European integration. That was not an easy thing for a Party like ours to do - but it was the right thing. And incidentally, if the events I fear come in the East, then all the petty fears of Maastricht will vanish overnight. Western Europe will lock itself together to create a tight island of security and stability at the Western end of a sea of chaos and war.And even if this does not happen, it still remains the case that every penny we spend on defence will be better spent in co-ordination with our European allies and to support a strong framework of international law.The only way to tackle these great issues is through a new style of politics. I want to see more consensus and co-operation on some of these great issues which cut across party barriers. That will continue to be our approach to Northern Ireland for just so long as the Prime Minister sticks to the national interest. This is one of those moments, like the Maastricht Treaty, when both government and opposition parties must rise above party politics.The Shape of the New PoliticsYou see, working together lies at the heart of the new style of politics we must create in Britain.And there are other issues that must also be faced by those who claim to stand for progress and a modem Britain. In the economy - to recognise that a market-based economy, built on enterprise, investment and skill, is the only way to meet the global challenge.In public services - not to reverse, but to build on reforms where they have devolved power, and concentrate on increasing accountability.In politics - to open up our democracy, to put people in control and to give people fair votes so that everyone has a say.On the environment - to put the green imperative at the very centre of all our policies, especially the economy. On Europe - to recognise that we can only safeguard Britain\u2019s future by working with our European partners - and be clear on the opportunity of a single currency.And underpinning all of this - to put education first.After the Next ElectionSo, the key question is, what sort of Britain, and what sort of government, should we be striving for after the next election?What a moment of new hope, of new opportunity that could be. And yet, if we Liberal Democrats are not strong and resolute, what a let-down it could become.Just think how damaging it would be for democracy if the disaster of this long period of one-party rule was followed by disillusionment with what follows.How damaging it would be if, instead of hard analysis, concrete solutions and honest costs, one-party rule was overthrown by candy-floss visions and candy-stick promises that turn sour in the tough reality of office. How damaging it would be if, instead of a sure step forward, our country continued to slither down in the long decline from world-class status to marginalised failure.Let me tell you first what I fear after the next election. I fear a government empty of ideas and devoid of reforming radicalism.I fear a government which does favours for its friends, because they pay the Party\u2019s bills - rather than being responsive to the voters who pay the country\u2019s bills.I fear a government which continues to avoid whole-hearted commitment to our European future.I fear a government which still tries to do things FOR people, rather than helping them to do things for themselves. What I hope for is a confident, reforming government - capable of creating a thriving Britain, a proud Britain.Where government works with people for their individual achievement and the common good. Where excellent education makes everyone employable. Where the environment is cared for like the nation\u2019s garden.Where at last we become citizens in our own land, not subjects of the State. Where we have strong communities - thriving on ethnic and cultural diversity. And do you know what will make the difference between these two contrasting futures for Britain? Of course you do. It is the Liberal Democrats. We will make the difference. Liberal Democrats have a proud heritage. Deep roots. A powerful vision. The Liberal Democrats\u2019 APPROACH is different from Socialists and Conservatives.And we DO things differently from Socialists and Conservatives. But we also have enough confidence in our own strength to make common cause with others to achieve the best for the future. So our task in the next two years is to build on our record of success. Our mission is to show people, when and where we have power, what the Liberal Democrats can do. And our purpose is to take our message of hope - our hard-headed plans for action - to every town, to every street and to every home in Britain.That is the only way we can build a better future for all of us. That is the task ahead.

aVOliver Cromwell, speaking on the eve of battle to his russet-coated captains, said: \u201cKnow what ye fight for - love what ye know.\u201dToday, in no more than forty minutes, I\u2019m going to spell out just what it is that we fight for, what unites us as a party, and what we believe.Others, on both Left and Right, may have cast off their anchors of belief, to drift on the tides of opinion, scavenging for bright ideas.But I\u2019m going to remind you why we continue to hold to the beliefs we have always held ... why a changing world has given them new importance ... and why, I believe, they will be at the centre of the new thinking and the new politics.I\u2019ll explain why it\u2019s no accident that we Liberal Democrats can be clear and specific about what needs to be done in Britain - because our ideas are anchored in a cohesive, deep-rooted set of values that we haven\u2019t had to abandon in a changing world.I shall call upon some strange witnesses. I shall touch on the first Henry Ford, on chewing gum, on holidays in the Galapagos Islands. I shall ask you to think about sun-dried tomatoes, and stone ground flour, and Singapore. And I\u2019ll be drawing lessons from George Soros, South Korea, Ralf Dahrendorf and the Ryder Cup!I begin with the politics of today; which means, as so often, starting with Mrs Thatcher.Because I do not believe that it is yet fully understood just how much - and just how permanently - Mrs Thatcher changed things.She was the great destroyer.Her thousand bomber raids on British institutions and much of our way of life were painful and destructive.Some of them, history may say, were necessary.But in the end, she failed.She failed because, although she could knock things down, she had no talent for construction.And she failed most, those to whom she promised most.In a recent pamphlet, John Gray, the distinguished political philosopher, described the failure of Thatcherism as \u201ca narrative of our times yet to be fully chronicled: the poignant irony of Essex man and woman struggling up the economic escalator, only to meet the bedraggled figures of the professional middle classes staggering down.\u201dThere was energy in Mrs Thatcher\u2019s time - even if most of it was destructive.But today, even that\u2019s gone. Today, all that remains are a few sad refugees of the Right, repeating her slogans and hoping to frighten us by invoking her name.Thatcherism has not so much ended, as flickered out - in the long, sad, grey twilight of the Major Government.All that is left is the casualty list.Our precious democracy, infected by greed and self-interest - slipping further and further into disrespect.Our economy: - bloated with bouts of consumption, but undernourished with sustained investment.Our public institutions demoralised.Our public services commercialised.Our public spaces neglected.Our civic society in ruins.And over all, the dark stain of poverty, hopelessness and crime spreading out from our neglected inner cities to contaminate almost every community in the land.What Mrs Thatcher left us is a bomb-site Britain.The question for the country at the next election is this: what should we build on it?Some say that we should reconstruct the past - build a better yesterday. More modern, of course: but a re-creation of old values, old institutions, old ways of doing things.When we leave Nottingham later today, I want none of us to be in the slightest doubt about the Liberal Democrat view: that option - the option of a better yesterday - is no longer open to us.Let me explain why.When national governments worked in the past, they worked because the nations they governed were manageable entities: self-contained and self-determining; able to establish their own laws, control their own economy, shape their own destiny.Governments could, by-and-large, deliver what their people wanted; and so people, by-and-large, believed in government.This was the understanding that sustained the old establishment consensus in Britain - and which underpinned the social market which has dominated the politics of Europe since the war.But those with eyes to see can see that this old order has failed in Britain - and even now, it is failing right across Europe, too.It is failing because its time is over. And it\u2019s time is over, because of two great, irreversible changes which have affected every developed country in the world.And they are these:First - least recognised, rarely talked about in Westminster, but relentless in its all-pervading force:- the globalisation of power.And second, the explosive growth of individualism - of individual autonomy and individual choice.The phrase \u201cthe globalisation of power\u201d is not a pretty one. But its effects, both frightening and liberating, are enormous. Here are a few examples.- A board of directors in South Korea can now have a greater influence on jobs in Wales than its own Secretary of State.- An international satellite broadcaster can now have a greater influence on opinion than the most respected national newspaper.- A single currency speculator - say George Soros - can now have a greater influence on the value of the pound than our own Chancellor of the Exchequer.- Acid rain produced in Britain can destroy the pine forests of Norway. And corrosion in a nuclear power plant three thousand miles away can contaminate Britain\u2019s grasslands and threaten our children\u2019s health.All this is with us now ... is with us forever ... and it has changed everything.Yet politicians, of both Left and Right, continue in their furtive conspiracy of pretence and promise.They pretend that all power still rests in their hands. And they promise us that which they can no longer deliver: - taxes that always go down, living standards that always go up, jobs that last for life.The politicians promise. The public rightly doubts them. And politics sinks still lower in public esteem.But there is a good side to all this.The age of deference, if not quite dead, is dying on its feet.And the age of the individual is coming along famously.We\u2019re seeing the beginning of the end of the politics of class and nation.And that\u2019s the second reason why a return to a better yesterday is impossible.People don\u2019t pull their forelocks any more. They don\u2019t want their lives to be laid out for them by well-spoken persons of superior breeding They want to think for themselves, choose for themselves ... be themselves.Now, the market understands this very well.Go into a supermarket, a newsagent\u2019s - even a building society. What is on offer, is choice.Not just white flour and brown flour - but stone-ground flour, too. Tomato ketchup and sun-dried tomatoes. Not just one computer magazine, but twenty-three. Four kinds of mortgage; fourteen different personal pension plans; Bali, Benidorm or the Galapagos Islands for your holiday.The market believes that the individual has the ability to choose ... and the right to choose.The market dislikes elitism. It promotes choice and welcomes pluralism.The market respects the individual as consumer.But when it comes to the individual as citizen, politics in Britain denies us all of these.The first Henry Ford once famously offered his public any colour they liked, as long as it was black. Today, eighty years later, the British political Establishment offers you any colour you like - as long as it\u2019s blue or red.The assumption is this: if you\u2019re not in one box, then you must be in the other. Don\u2019t offer people wider choice: they wouldn\u2019t know what to do with it.So, two things have changed for ever. The state has less power; and individuals want more power.The state that claimed the power to please the masses no longer exists.And the masses that the state once tried to please no longer existSo a return to a better yesterday is not an option. We need to build something new in its place.Two propositions are now put before us: one from the New Right and the other from the New Left. Each addresses one half of the problem but ignoring the other.The New Right says this: if the unlimited power of the global market is the problem from abroad, then the uncritical embrace of the free market must be the solution at home. The answer, they say, is to re-create the United States in Britain.But with US solutions come US problems: exclusion, fracture, deprivation, lawlessness, greed. Ghettoised poverty for many. A citadel life-style for the few. And armed security guards protecting one class of citizen from the embarrassment of the other.There are already signs in this country - too many signs - of widening social rifts and growing social tensions. To take further steps along this New Right path is to risk certainly the cohesion, and perhaps even the civilisation. This is not the path for Britain to travel.The second and more recent proposition comes from the New Left - and emphasises the dangers of unfettered individualism; those who claim all rights but shrug off all responsibilities. The answer here, they say, is to create a new morality - a new state-sponsored morality. To reshape Britain in the image of Singapore.To start with, the ideas are perfectly good ones: community based projects; residents helping older neighbours, the promotion of social cohesion.But it ends by telling people how to live their lives. By limiting freedom of speech. By spot fines for chewing gum and neglecting to pull the lavatory chain.It ends in policies which punish the sinner, but ignore the sin. Policies which have more to say about driving beggars from the streets, than housing the homeless and helping the poor.It reminds me of the old medieval rhyme at the time of the enclosures:\u201cThey hanged the man and flogged the woman/ That stole the goose from off the Common.\u201cBut they let the greater thief go loose/ That stole the Common from the goose.\u201dThis is not an acceptable solution in a free society, either.Cohesion perhaps: but this is organised cohesion - state cohesion. Whatever the aim, this kind of thought-police centralism will be intolerable to those who are hungering for greater personal autonomy.So we need another solution. A solution that takes account of both these two new irreversible trends: the growth of global power at one end, and the growth of individual power at the other.And there is such a solution. Listen to this:\u201cWe champion the freedom, dignity and well-being of individuals and their right to develop their talent to the full\u201d, so that no-one is \u201censlaved by poverty, ignorance or conformity\u201d.It comes, of course, from the preamble to our Party Constitution.Now, cynics might seek to dismiss those twenty-five words as no more than apple-pie and motherhood: as admirable sentiment but with not a lot of substance.But to read them like that is to read them wrong.Because, if a government really did champion the freedom, dignity and well-being of individuals; if it really did encourage them to develop their talents to the full; if no-one really was enslaved by poverty, ignorance or conformity: what sort of society would we have?We would have a society not just of individuals - but of self-reliant individuals.And that, fellow Liberal Democrats, is the clear, central purpose of this party. To create a better society in this country, founded on the self-reliant individual.The concept of the self-reliant individual is now the only political idea that makes sense for this country, for now and into the next century.It is that understanding that must fire our imaginations.Individuals: responsible; fully-equipped; making choices; taking power; using power.Each valued. Each different. Each respectful of each other.Each entitled to be heard. Each required to bear responsibility for their actions. Each contributing to the creation of this country\u2019s wealth and this country\u2019s own self-confidence.Now, if we start, clear-eyed and confident, with that objective in our sights:- then what does it mean for policy?What it means, above all, is that policies and priorities become almost self-determining.We are not born self-reliant. We have to be equipped for self-reliance.That means, not the end of government, but a changed focus for government - a changed role for government.Government which empowers and enables.Government which is on the side of the citizen, not in charge of the citizen.Government whose first duty is to ensure that every single person goes through life, fully equipped with knowledge, skills, rights, self-confidence.Spend a moment or two now, just contemplating with me, the full and extraordinary significance of that which we call education. Because education is much, much more than reading and writing and arithmetic, and having to go to school every day.Education is the one gift we can give our children that no-one can ever take away again.It is the source of that rough curiosity of spirit that is the wellspring of true liberty.It exists in all circumstances.It endures in all conditions.It is self-contained.It is self-perpetuating.It equips the individual throughout life to rise to the unknown challenge and cope with the unforeseen change.Education won\u2019t guarantee you freedom or fulfillment - but without education, you will be denied both of these.It is education - and only education - that makes possible a tolerant and civilised society.And of course, it is only education - liberating and nourishing the brains and talents of our people - that can provide sustainable national economic prosperity - and without such prosperity, let there be no misunderstanding, all other objectives become nothing but self-delusion.The surprise, therefore, is not that we Liberal Democrats make education and training the cornerstone of our proposals. The surprise is that others do not.Some say that our willingness to put a penny on income tax to pay for education may be electoral suicide. What I know for certain, is that not to do so would be national suicide.That is why we are right to fight the school cuts, right to fight for investment, right to put our children\u2019s education first.And this commitment to a society of self-reliant individuals makes other decisions inevitable.We need to change our welfare system: from one which breeds dependency and discouragement, to one which lifts people out of dependency and into work. And we need to recognise that a welfare system will be respected and supported, only if it is seen to favour those who can\u2019t help themselves, above those who won\u2019t help themselves.But ultimately, what distinguishes the society built around the self-reliant individual is not people\u2019s entitlements from the system, but the power that they exercise over the system.And from that perception, many other actions flow.Self-reliant individuals must have access to information and democratic influence.That\u2019s why we need a Freedom of Information Act. Why we need a voting system that gives people more choice and influence and power. Why we need referendums on issues like Europe. Why we need a Bill of Rights to protect our freedoms.And that, it follows, is also why parliaments for Scotland and Wales are essential; why local government must have its autonomy and pride restored.And why a campaign of destruction worthy of Mrs Thatcher herself must be waged upon the quango.I can think of no part of our sick system that has done more to distance individuals from their democratic rights than these unelected, unaccountable, over-protected, over-rewarded, self-perpetuating groups of anonymous meddlers.(From which, you may safely conclude that I am, in the main, more often than not, intemperate though it may seem, not overly fond of quangos.)And certain other things also follow from a society built around the self-reliant individual.The first is that fairness is not just desirable but essential. Without fairness, justice is impossible, social cohesion unsustainable.And for Liberal Democrats, fairness is not a simple absolute. Fairness is rooted in local understanding, the product of agreement within a community, not imposed from outside. Accountable and open to change as circumstances change.The second is that, in the society of the self-reliant individual, the enemy is exclusion.I have already praised the market and it has many virtues - but compassion is not one of them.Only very rarely, in the discouragement of monopolies, for example, should governments interfere in the operation of the market. But Government\u2019s can - indeed must - be ready to help the market\u2019s human casualties. If they do not, the excluded will in the end destroy the system that excluded them.The Dahrendorf Commission said last year - and I quote:\u201c ... wealth is more than GDP growth; economic development has to be sustainable, not only in environmental terms, but also in social terms; inclusion is not an optional extra, but a condition of long term wealth; stakeholders are as important as companies, communities and shareholders; the public domain, with its values of service, continues to have a significant place, even in a globally competitive economy\u201d.What this describes is the beginnings of a new economics and a new society whose centre-piece is that self-reliant individual.What will it be like, this new economy?It will encourage small businesses and self-employment - rewarding initiative and allowing everyone to make their economic contribution.It will be strong on competition and brutal with monopolies.It will invest for the long-term.It will have a flexible labour market, creating for people employment choices, throughout their working lives.It will equip its people with skills and rights and knowledge and self-confidence: so that they see this flexibility not as threat but opportunity.It will recognise pension provision as deferred wages over which the holders have absolute right of disposal.It will share profits.It will understand that quality of life, clean air, clean water, are not impediments to prosperity, they are part of prosperity.And it will recognise that there is a level of unemployment above which a stable society becomes unsustainable.We will not promise jobs for all - for that is as much a lie as promising permanently lower taxes.But we do recognise that work - the esteem, the wages, the fulfillment, the prospects that come with work - these are fundamental to self-reliance.I suspect that in the future redistributing work will be more important than redistributing wealth. And goodness knows, there\u2019s enough that needs doing.So we need better childcare to enable parents to work, and benefit reforms to help the long-term unemployed back into work.We must change absurd Treasury rules to kickstart major investment projects. That\u2019s the way to get people working, building new homes, creating new nurseries, modernising our railways.And we need a myriad of innovative, small-scale initiatives, like community enterprise and local trading systems, to give people a stake where at present they have nothing.But the implications of a society built around the self-reliant individual stretch well beyond jobs.A society which respects people\u2019s choices will encourage diversity. It will accommodate different life-styles. It will be heedless of gender or sexual orientation. It will value people\u2019s abilities, not penalise their disabilities. And it will cherish pluralism and the wide richness of ethnic traditions and cultures in Britain today.And that means tolerance - because the only kind of social cohesion which can endure is not the kind imposed from without, but the kind that comes, willingly, from within.So I don\u2019t mean token, condescending tolerance - I mean a tolerance strong enough to live contentedly with conflict.Some political theories believe you can abolish conflict and contention. We Liberal Democrats welcome them. We know that conflict, disagreement and debate are indissolubly part of choice, pluralism and diversity:- and when shrewdly channeled can provide a dynamo for change and a force for understanding.You see, to live with conflict, you must understand your neighbours and their differences. If you cannot live with conflict, then you will seek to obliterate those differences. That is the way that starts with discrimination and ends up with ethnic cleansing.So, here we have the self-reliant individual: the cornerstone of our new society. Autonomous, self-confident, equipped. An owner of opportunities, a possessor of skills, a maker of choices. Strong enough to accept responsibility; to welcome challenge; to resolve conflict.But is that enough? Is that all we need?No.Because no man is an island. The individual is an \u201cI\u201d - but there is also the \u201cWe\u201d.And from the beginning of civilization - indeed, it\u2019s one of the defining characteristics of civilisation - humankind has recognised the need to be more than singular; to be a part of something more.Now there are some who believe that \u201cwe\u201d is a singular concept, that it can refer only to one group, define only one identity, fix only one position.But just use the word yourself - and see how many \u2018we\u2019s\u2019 there really are.\u201cWe\u2019re having Christmas at home this year.\u201d That\u2019s we the family.\u201cWe\u2019re getting up a petition to save the school.\u201d That\u2019s we, the parents - the local community.\u201cWe got a new export order this morning.\u201d That\u2019s we in our place of work.\u201cWe\u2019re playing away this Saturday.\u201d That\u2019s we the team - we the supporters.\u201cWe\u2019re meeting in Nottingham in March.\u201d That\u2019s we, this party.And when the Ryder Cup is being played against the Americans, millions of people in England, Scotland and Wales will cheer as Bernard Langer or Seve Ballesteros sinks the winning putt and shout, \u201cWe\u2019ve won!\u201dAnd what\u2019s that \u2018We\u2019? Michael Portillo, please note: That \u201cwe\u201d is Europe.We do it quite easily and quite naturally. We belong to, and identify with, all at the same time, an almost infinite number of groups and communities.For the self-reliant individual, the \u201cwe\u201d of the community is absolutely vital.It\u2019s within our communities that we most readily identify ourselves, understand our responsibilities, and recognise our interdependence on each other.It is within the community that we can both serve and preserve the spirit of voluntarism that\u2019s still so strong in Britain.It is within the community that much of the present power of Westminster and Whitehall could more fairly and more efficiently be exercised.It is also, as we have seen so movingly this week, within our communities that we share sorrow, find courage, and give consolation.And it is within the community that we can begin to reconstruct what Ralf Dahrendorf calls our \u201ccivic\u201d culture, which has been so systematically destroyed these last seventeen years.Because it does not matter how many individual choices we may have, or how self-reliant we may be. If our lives draw nothing from, and contribute nothing to, a public culture, then they will still be impoverishedSo, we Liberal Democrats see the community as a framework for recreating a powerful public culture, diverse in its range, rich in its options, strong in its common institutions.Now let me return to that \u201cwe\u201d, and use it in a different - wider context.And I will take myself as an example.If someone asked me what I am, there may have been a time when I would have replied, \u201cI am British\u201d - and that would have been enough.But today, I have to give you a rather more complex answer.I would have to say: I am Irish by birth. I am a West Countryman by choice and love. I am British by nationality - and proud of it. And now, if I am lucky, I may have French grandchildren - and I will be proud of that, too. For I am also a European, by culture, heritage and history. And beyond that, I must recognise ties of duty and love right out to include the great wide circle of every human being living today.The point is this: I cannot identify myself adequately, unless I do so with reference to all these things.To say only that I am British diminishes the identities to which I feel entitled and limits the space I want to call my own - and which I want my children to call their own.It is this understanding that drives our Party\u2019s internationalism.That\u2019s why, when others have dithered and dodged, we have been clear, united and firm on Europe. That\u2019s why, when others ignored it, we understood the importance of Bosnia right from the start. That\u2019s why, when others turned their backs, we were the only party to stand by Britain\u2019s moral duty and stand up for the rights of the people of Hong Kong.So this is our vision for our country in the next millennium.The self-reliant individual, living in strong communities; equipped and supported by an active and enabling government,It has always been there at the heart of our party. We have always been the party that puts the individual before groups, classes, cliques or factions. For that reason, it can belong to no other party.No, what\u2019s new is not the idea itself, but the circumstance of time and social change in which we hold it.Those two surreptitious newcomers, the forces of global power and the drive for individual autonomy, have changed our world already and will change it much more.The idea of individual self-reliance is now not only the way to liberate human potential - it\u2019s also imperative for economic success.So it is time now to make that which today lives only in our imaginations a reality: a nation of tens of millions of individuals, astonishing in their diversity, reveling in their own abilities and achievements, coping with conflict, working together in groups and communities, exploring and conquering the opportunities which now open up before them.It is time now to remember who we Liberal Democrats are, what we are, what we stand for ... to take risks, seize opportunities and keep our eyes on the big things ... to reject the politics of the safe harbour in favour of the politics of the open sea ... to make this next year the most eventful and significant in our short and crowded history.It is time now to prepare for the battle ahead.It is time to drive this discredited, sleazy, rotten government out of power, out of office and out of our lives.But there is something even more important for us to do. Even more important than getting rid of this government.It is to act as the catalyst for the deep changes which I have been talking about this afternoon.Without that fundamental shift, without creating communities of self-reliant individuals, without transforming government, we could change Britain\u2019s leadership and still not change Britain\u2019s fortunes.Once in every generation or two comes the liberal hour, when our enduring values and the needs of a changing society come together in a burst of creative reform.Fellow Liberal Democrats:That opportunity lies before us.That responsibility is ours.That hour is now.

aVExactly a year ago, I was addressing your local election rally in Perth, a week before your local elections.A month later I was back for your Spring Conference ... to celebrate your successes!You might remember that I also used that opportunity to spur on my English and Welsh colleagues, on the eve of our elections, to follow your example!And in Liberal Democrat successes, as in so much else, Scotland leads the way!You beat the Tories into fourth place.We in England beat them into third place.Across Britain, the Liberal Democrats are now the second party of local government in Britain.Providing first-class service and first-class government, right across the country.And I'd like to take this opportunity to say a big thank-you to all the Liberal Democrat councillors who've been struggling over recent weeks to set new local council budgets without the resources to meet the tasks you're being required to carry out, let alone anything else. Trying to square the circle is tough work!Since that Spring Conference a year ago, I've been to Perth again; we've had our highly successful Federal Conference in Glasgow; I kicked off my Britain-wide tour in the Scottish Borders; and I joined Donald Gorrie for a great public rally in the heart of Edinburgh West.And now, for this year's Conference, I join you in Aberdeen - next door to Malcolm Bruce's seat - in a corner of Scotland where at the next election the Liberal Democrats are the only realistic challengers to the Conservatives, and where that Liberal Democrat vote will harry the Conservatives out of office, out of Scotland, and out of our lives.Right across Scotland, from Stewartry to Shetland, from Kelso to the Kyle of Lochalsh, Liberal Democrats are a strong, independent force, growing in strength, and making a difference.In Westminster, Scottish Liberal Democrat MPs are a team of real quality and real standing - an asset to the Liberal Democrats, not just here in Scotland, but right across Britain.And if quality is what shows in Scottish Liberal Democrat MPs at Westminster, it's quality and quantity which shows in Liberal Democrat councillors in the council chambers of Scotland.Liberal Democrats now have a record 125 councillors in Scotland. The Conservatives only 80.In Scotland's three biggest cities we have twenty-one councillors. The SNP have two.And when the unitary councils start their work on Monday, Liberal Democrats will not only be the main opposition to Labour in councils like East Dunbartonshire, Fife and here in the City of Aberdeen, we will be helping to run the Highlands, the Borders, Aberdeenshire, Dumfries and Galloway, and Shetland.By contrast, the Conservatives will have power and influence on not one single council. The only place where the Conservatives will have a seat of power in Scotland will be in the chair in the Secretary of State's office in St Andrews House in Edinburgh! A seat he holds, not because of Scottish votes, but because of a minority of English voters, who gave the Conservatives a majority in Westminster at the last General Election.Where else, but Scotland, in the whole democratic world, could a Party winning 7% of the seats in an election still end up exercising most of the power?!Yet such paradoxes are nothing new in Scotland.After all, where else in the world do you find a country with its own legal system that does not have its own Parliament to legislate for that system?!But I believe the paradox of Tory power without mandate, Tory power without representation, Tory power - almost - without responsibility - has now become a paradox too far for Scotland.Unrepresentative Westminster rule in Scotland has now become unsustainable. The hour for Home Rule has at last come. And the Scottish Liberal Democrats, whose historic mission has been to deliver Home Rule, are the guarantee that the Scottish people's claim of right to their own Parliament at last becomes a reality.A Parliament with teeth. A Parliament with real power. And a Parliament that maintains Scotland's place in a Union that the majority of Scottish people support and enjoy.What the Scottish people do NOT self-evidently support is this Government. What they do NOT enjoy is confidence in anything this Government says or does.But let's face it, the Scottish people aren't alone in THAT! The British people have now lost all faith in this Government.You only have to look at how the BSE catastrophe now engulfing the country has been handled, to see why.Our rural communities are facing their biggest crisis for thirty years.Like me in Somerset, and my colleagues in other parts of the country, Malcolm Bruce here in Aberdeenshire has been besieged by cries for help from people who are simply desperate - not just farmers, but thousands of people whose livelihoods are hanging by a thread in industries that dominate our rural communities.Already in Aberdeenshire, 3 cattle markets have closed for good, 200 jobs have been lost already, and thousands more are hanging in the balance. Malcolm is not here now, because he is taking the Scottish Agriculture Minister round the farmers and meat companies in this area, showing the Government why immediate emergency intervention is so vital.I have been saying since last weekend that what is needed now is clear, decisive action to meet explicit, defined aims: to clear BSE from the British cattle herd and food chain, re-establish the reputation of British beef, and restore consumer confidence.Prime Scotch beef has always been in great demand on all the best tables all round the world, and we must strive to get it back there as soon as possible. Painful though decisive action is, without it the industry will collapse, and our rural communities will just bleed to death.I have told the Prime Minister that he can rely on our support if he produces a package of measures that has that effect. This is a time when politicians have to work together to restore confidence, and rescue livelihoods that are being destroyed.That doesn't stop us criticising the Government. It means that when it comes to action, then where we can agree we should work with them to save jobs, business and farms.So here are our proposals. To restore confidence, and ensure that we are able to promote a "BSE-free" national herd, we need four actions.First, we need to take out of the food chain all dairy cattle which could have had access to BSE infected feed in the late 1980s. That requires a selective cull of older cattle, and there is no point ducking that.Second, as soon as this first action is taken we need to have in place a Quality Assurance Scheme that guarantees the quality of beef on our shelves.The failure of successive governments to invest in and promote such a scheme is one reason why producers of quality beef, like the beef this part of the world is famous for, feel unfairly tarred with the brush of poor-quality beef.Third, we need to work WITH our European partners on this. As I predicted on Monday, there is a real danger that in fashioning a stick with which to beat Britain, our European partners create a stick with which they themselves will be beaten in the future, as their problems emerge.This is not only a British problem - it's a Europe-wide one, which needs a Europe-wide solution.Finally, we need to recognise that for as long as one department is responsible for both food production and food safety, for both the producer interest and the consumer interest, a conflict of interest is inevitable.We must, now, separate responsibility for food safety from MAFF's responsibility for food production, establishing a new Food Commission to represent the consumer interest in the same way the US Food and Drug Administration does in America.That's not a piece of hindsight after the BSE crisis. That's what we established as Liberal Democrat policy back in 1993.These then are four immediate steps the Government could and should take. And if the Prime Minister brings forward plans along these lines, then he will have our support. This is what co-operative politics is all about.At the same time, there is no getting away from the lessons of this BSE crisis for the way that Britain is being run.For the BSE affair reads like a medieval morality play on modern-day Conservatism.It encapsulates the failures of this Government. It contains in a single issue, all the British people's fears about the Conservatives. In the BSE saga we see all the failures of this Government and of modern Conservatism:It begins with an obsession with low-cost, profit-driven deregulation.It grows through a market-knows-best, the-people-know-nothing philosophy.It is compounded by weak and indecisive leadership.It festers with the reputation for broken promises and trust betrayed.And it contains within it all the bitter fruits of a European policy so damaging to our national interests that it amounts to one of Britain's greatest foreign policy failures since the Second World War.Think, first, about deregulation.Every six months the Government launches new deregulation drives, to get rid of "red tape". You see, anti-bureaucrat, "get-of-our-backs" deregulation makes easy, populist headlines - though it makes you wonder who's been in office for the last seventeen years!But politicians should remember, when they call for new bonfires of controls, that the very purpose of these controls is to prevent bonfires of people in tragedies like the Phillipino disco two weeks ago, or the bonfire of cattle carcasses we are likely to see in the weeks ahead, or the bonfire of jobs that is already starting to engulf rural Britain.And anti-regulation has been part of a wider agenda - geared to intensifying production and maximising profits in every sector of our economy and national life - not just in our private industries, but in our public services, too.Tighter regulation on animal feed stuffs was called for in the late 70s - and rejected.Then, once the BSE problem was first identified in the 80s, tighter controls were rejected again.Then, in the 90s, once the link between BSE and CJD was increasingly clear, tighter regulation was rejected once again.In the end - catastrophe, as consumers finally lost confidence in both British beef and the British government at the same time.The reason we were given was expense. Well, whatever the cost of action earlier, in 1979, in 1985, in 1989, it would have been less than Britain's farmers, Britain's meat industry, and Britain's rural communities are having to pay now.This brings me to the second failure of the BSE crisis. A failure of leadership.What we have seen is a copy book example of Majorism in action.What was needed from this Government was clear and decisive action to restore consumer confidence in the beef market. Instead, we've had nothing but prevarication and indecision.The Government first took refuge in scientific opinion, while shouting "don't panic"! A sort of cross between Dr Strangelove and Corporal Jones!But scientific opinion is not a substitute for judgement. As Mrs Thatcher once famously said: "Advisers advise; ministers decide".Then the Government said the decisive programme of action proposed by the Liberal Democrats at the start of the week was unnecessary. Then the National Farmers' Union produced similar proposals. And finally, the U-turn. Not with grace and confidence. But in chaos and confusion - most notable for the undignified attempts to shift responsibility onto everyone and anyone else - Opposition politicians, the media, Europe, Macdonalds, and lastly and most desperately, the poor long-suffering public themselves.On Wednesday, Mr Dorrell, the Health Secretary, told us: "it's not the cows that are mad, it's the people". The Prime Minister joined in, accusing the nation of mass hysteria.I am reminded of Berthold Brecht's famous comment of 1930s Germany: "the government has decided that the people are wrong, and the people will therefore be abolished".The collapse of consumer confidence stems, too, from a broader crisis now enveloping this Government - a crisis of trust.The last election was won on a fraudulent prospectus, and its record ever since has been a record of broken promises and betrayed trust.VAT on fuel. Devaluation. Cash for questions. The Scott Report. These are just the tips of an iceberg of broken trust upon which the Conservative ship of state is now impaled as irretrievably as the Titanic.People have not believed the Government on BSE because they no longer believe this Government on anything. This is not just an issue of confidence in British beef - it's an issue of confidence in this Government.Finally, with the crisis at its height, the country has had to pay the heavy, unnecessary, price of British European policy over recent years - our alienation of all possible European allies.On a day when our Prime Minister is meeting with his European counterparts on the first stage of this crucial Inter-Governmental Conference on Europe's future, just reflect on the failure of that European policy as it now affects Britain's farmers and Britain's rural communities,. Britain's industries and Britain's consumers.Take British policy towards Belgium as just one example.Do you remember, a year ago, the triumphant breast-beating of Tory backbenchers and the right-wing press when John Major refused to accept Belgian Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene as President of the European Commission? They loved it.Eventually, of course, we ended up with the Prime Minister of Luxembourg, Jacques Santer, as President of the Commission - a man whose views, by his own admission, were identical to those of the Belgian Premier we rejected.So the sole achievement of this conspicuous, futile, counter-productive, tub-thumping wielding of our much-vaunted veto was ... nothing more than the alienation of the Belgian government.And who said the art of diplomacy was dead?Twelve months on, will someone give me one good reason why, on the issue of British meat, the Belgian government should give any support to a British Prime Minister who humiliated their OWN Prime Minister for no better reason than the appeasement of his own back-benchers and right-wing media puppeteers?The reality is that the most notable achievement of British foreign policy over recent years has been the comprehensive alienation of every possible European ally by obstruction, insult and childish jingoism.Or look at the Dutch, with a government with whom we have always had close ties, which stood out most firmly for British membership against de Gaulle's opposition, and which has always done its best to help Britain.Nothing more powerfully demonstrates how profligate this Government has been in offending our natural allies than the comment, in a recent Dutch Government report, that that only thing to do about British obstructiveness was "just to carry on without them".And you know, you can just imagine what the headlines would have been like in the Times or the Telegraph, let alone the Sun or the Mirror, had, for instance, the Spanish been appealing for European aid in the face of a collapse of their fruit market because they'd all been using the wrong pesticide.I can see the gentle headline in the Sun now: "Brussels Bureaucrats Waste British Billions on Stupid Spics".The point is this. If you've spent the last seventeen years deliberately making enemies in Europe, it is hardly surprising when you turn for friends in a crisis, that they are difficult to find. And for that, British farmers, British workers, British consumers and the British countryside are now paying a very heavy price.The Conservative Party still talks about Europe as if our partners are our enemies. But Britain's real enemy in Europe is the rise of protectionism.We saw it this week, as Euro-sceptics like Edward Leigh jumped up and started demanding trade retaliation. Britain needs a trade war like a hole in the head.And that danger - the danger of protectionism - is at the heart of our case for closer European co-operation, on the table at the Turin summit today.Sir Leon Brittan put his finger on it when he wrote last year: "The European market is not an achievement that Britain can assume will never unravel, for the forces of protectionism and narrow national interest will always seek to gnaw away at it".Markets will always be at the mercy of protectionist pressures, and the European single market will be especially vulnerable for as long as it operates with a collection of different currencies.The speed and enthusiasm with which other European countries have been prepared to use Britain's BSE problem to gain a trade advantage shows the extent of protectionist sentiment still present in Europe and the dangers, by erosion or crisis, which threatens the unravelling of the Single Market itself, unless it is secured by a single currency.That's why the Liberal Democrats' policy towards EMU combines economic realism with political commitment. Above all, and alone in British politics, Liberal Democrats say, unequivocally, that a Single Currency would be good for Europe, and if Britain can be part of it, then Britain should be part of it,But if this crisis has told us everything about the Conservatives - and quite a lot about the Labour Party - it has also told us a lot about the Liberal Democrats.What the Liberal Democrats have done from the very start of this crisis is to put forward practical proposals to rebuild consumer confidence and stop the devastation of our rural communities.The reason for our clear position and clear policies is two-fold.First, as I said when I addressed the Rural Forum Conference in Ayrshire in 1994, the Liberal Democrats, unlike the Labour Party, "are a Party rooted in the countryside ... aware of the complexities of rural disadvantage, as well as the seriousness of the problems".But at the same time, the Liberal Democrats are the only Party in Britain free of vested, sectional interests. Unlike the Conservatives, for instance, we can address this crisis from the perspective of consumers and rural communities alike, without being in hoc to the farming lobby or the food industry. And that means we can be open and fair.And that perspective - that position - goes to the very heart of what this Party has to offer the Scottish people and the British people.Values, policies and an approach that puts people first - wherever they live and whatever they do.We are not for one group of people against another group of people. We want everyone to have the best opportunities, and the best support, to make the most of their lives.The policies to get us there flow from the same values we have always held - policies to foster self-reliant individuals, in strong communities, supported by active government.Education to equip people with skills, and to bring out their talents.Empowerment to give people more say and influence - be they tenants on housing estates or voters wanting to make a difference or have their say on Europe.Policies to tackle exclusion, help people back into work, and to invest in Britain's long term future.Fellow Liberal Democrats, this may be your last Scottish Conference before the General Election.We go into that campaign in a very strong position.We had a terrific boost at the start of the year when Emma Nicholson left the Conservatives and joined the Liberal Democrats. We have had further boosts with some terrific local election results over recent weeks.But underpinning all this has been eight years of steady growth since our Party's formation, which give us terrific momentum for the campaign ahead.For the good of the country, this Government must go. And Liberal Democrats, in Scotland and across the country, are determined to see them go.Go out there, after your Conference, keep up your stirling work, and make sure that when that election comes, you send even more Liberal Democrat MPs to Westminster, to make a difference, to put liberal democrat values into practice, to change our country for good.

aVThere you are - there is life beyond Westminster.You\u2019ve seen the film - now, buy the book. Good value at £9.99! And still available at all good bookshops.But actually, that experience travelling the country, meeting people where they live and work, was one of the most valuable of my life. It has changed the way I see politics and what now needs to be done for our country.That\u2019s why this year, in rather a different sort of way, I\u2019ve done the same again. I\u2019ve travelled another six thousand miles, campaigning with you - and talking and looking and listening in every region of our country.Today, I want this speech to be another sort of tour. I want to tell you the kind of country I\u2019ve seen - and how it differs from what we see at Westminster.I want to take a long hard look at some unfashionable subjects; such as courage and leadership and patriotism.I want to spell out for you the kind of future this country could have - how Britain can succeed again, and how people can feel secure again - but only if we have the courage to invest in that future and to return to the decent values of our country.I want no one to be in any doubt that this party - your party - has a unique role to play in shaping those changes and making them happen.I may also, of course, mention the General Election.My first big discovery was actually a rediscovery. How easy it is - and how dangerous it can be - to judge a country by its leaders.Many today look at Britain and see a weak and faltering government - and they assume a weak and faltering country.But that is not the Britain that I found.I found bewilderment, yes. I found impatience and anger and real hardship. But I found no sense of national despair.I found diversity and tolerance and humour. I found people and communities quietly solving problems Westminster doesn\u2019t know how to solve.This is not new for our country.In the First World War, a German general was describing the British army - the ordinary Tommy. \u2018They are lions,\u2019 he said. \u2018But they are lions led by donkeys.\u2019In 1939, Hitler was less perceptive. He saw a weak and faltering British government - and was foolish enough to assume a weak and faltering nation. He was fatally wrong. We were a strong and resolute nation - but with no voice, no leadership. No one to tell us the truth, no one to present us with the challenge, no one to release the untapped energies of the British people. Until Churchill.Looking back, Winston Churchill said this: \u2018It was the nation that had the lion\u2019s heart. I had the luck to be called upon to give the roar.\u2019Today, we have no one to give the roar.For fifteen years - perhaps for fifty years - we have been poorly led. We have been weakly led - or sometimes strongly led in wrong directions. Only the innate enterprise, resilience and bloody-mindedness of our people has kept us in the race with that growing list of impatient world competitors.In one way, of course, this analysis is a hopeful one. The strength of our nation is already there. We only have to decide where we as a nation want to be.It\u2019s time now to take that decision.We are within a few months of the most important choice for this country since the war. We could, of course, go on ducking the issues for a little longer.We could decide that more money in our pockets is more important than more knowledge in our children\u2019s heads.We could stagger on with our discredited system of government.We could carry on polluting our environment, and postpone living more lightly on our planet. We could carry on fooling ourselves about our place in Europe and the wider world.But deep down, everyone knows that the longer we duck these decisions, the higher the price we pay in the next century.My fear is this.That we shall see an election, and maybe a change of government - but we shall not see a change of direction. We shall still be starved of clear vision, a commitment to change, the courage to face up to what must be done.It is the first crucial role of this Party - to see that that does not happen.With the Liberal Democrats strong in the next parliament, Britain will face the challenges that confront us. Without, they\u2019ll continue to be ducked.What this country desperately needs now is leadership - modern leadership.If you\u2019ve worked in a company, if you\u2019ve served in the forces, if you\u2019ve played in a team, you will know what modern leadership is and what it is not.Leadership today is not about putting your trust in giants. Because those who believe in giants, must also believe in dwarfs.Leadership today is not about saying I know best. It\u2019s about bringing out the best in others.And it\u2019s not about sitting on high, issuing instructions. It\u2019s about getting out and listening and learning and motivating.Modern leadership means identifying fears and hopes and aspirations and giving them vivid expression: because when privately held, hidden away in the hearts of a million individuals, those hopes can never be realised.But brought out into the light of day and given a common voice and a public force, they can inspire a whole nation.When people know they\u2019re not alone... when they hear their inner hopes expressed in words they recognise... then they know they\u2019re part of something bigger - then the remote and hopeless becomes attainable.The country that Churchill led was not miraculously converted from indifference to valour. The qualities were already there.I believe the same to be true of Britain today.I know it is - because I\u2019ve seen it.There is purpose, determination, talent, principle, and an impatience to get things done - hidden, untapped, in our country.And there is decency, too. I now know one thing with absolute certaintyThis country is not the mean, selfish, uncompassionate nation the Tories have tried to make us these last seventeen years.But that true spirit of our country will remain hidden, if the only choice we are offered is the choice between fear and timidity.Fear.Fear is the Tories\u2019 trademark. It is what makes them tick.It runs out at every corner and it bubbles out of every crack.They fear change. They fear experiment.They fear diversity. They fear dissent. They fear foreigners. They fear the press.They fear the truth. They fear the future.They fear us. They fear each other.But most of all, they fear for their jobs, they fear for their power, they fear for their skins. Fear is their only weapon.Now there is only one antidote to fear - and that is hope.But Labour seem to have chosen timidity.They are wrong.Imagine Henry V before Agincourt:When the blast of war blows in our ears,Then imitate the action of the tiger;Stiffen the sinews, summon up the blood...And wait until your private opinion polls appear somewhat more propitious.The result is a campaign, not about policies and ideas, but about sound-bites and spin doctors, insulting posters, negative attacks.The Tories have chosen to start this election in the gutter.But listen to this wise advice.\u2018Being negative can be an addictive drug. It\u2019s easy ... But like any drug it corrodes and destroys the body in which it exists. And one body it runs the risk of corrupting is the body politic of the nation itself.\u2019Wise words.Not my words. The words of John Major two years ago, when John Smith died. Pity he\u2019s forgotten them.We saw this negative campaigning in Littleborough and Saddleworth. We know where it\u2019s come from. It\u2019s come from America. And it should be sent straight back again.And if John Major still believes negative campaigning is an addictive drug, then he should send Dr Brian Mawhinney, Lord Maurice Saatchi and the whole of Tory Central Office back to America with it - not for another fix on the campaign trail, but to clean up their act at the Betty Ford Clinic.This sort of nonsense has no place in Britain. And there are only two people who can stop it \u2013 Mr. Major and Mr. Blair - and today I urge them to do just that.And for my part, I make this commitment. Whatever they do, we Liberal Democrats will fight this election with a positive campaign, on the issues, and on what we stand for.We will fight to stamp this debilitating drug of negative campaigning out of British politics for good.With the Liberal Democrats strong in British politics we can start to rebuild the politics of hope in Britain. Without, we will stay stuck with the politics of fear.But you know, there is another sad by-product of all this.As the Tories desperately seek to cling to power, they will scaremonger about the break-up of the UK, they will bluster about the threat of Europe, they will wrap themselves shamelessly in the flag, and they will claim for themselves a monopoly on patriotism.But theirs is a false patriotism.A true patriot would not have applauded Michael Portillo\u2019s grubby attempt to conscript our armed forces into a Tory Party Conference.A true patriot would not tolerate the poverty and division which now infects so many of our communities.A true patriot would be ashamed of the broken promises, the cash-for-questions, the arms-to-­Iraq scandal.A true patriot would not pander to the Tory press by pretending that love of this country depends on hating others.A true patriot would condemn out of hand the Asylum and Immigration Act as a betrayal of our centuries-old tradition of tolerant welcome for the persecuted.A true patriot would know that the abuse of patriotism behind which the Tory Party now cowers is deeply insulting to all the true things this country stands for.And that is why a true patriot would know that, for the sake of all that is decent in our country: They must go!I count myself to be a patriot. I have served this country as a soldier. I have represented it abroad as a diplomat. I love it and I am proud of it.But the battles we must fight for our country in the next century are different to the battles we have fought in this one - and as a country, we have just got to stop wallowing in the past - in past glories, past conflicts, and past illusions.We have to look ahead.And some important aspects of our future are already, it seems to me, in sharp focus.The next century will witness a revolution as overwhelming in its implications as the industrial revolution.Look at this machine.With this little machine I can read the Wall Street Journal from cover-to-cover.I can plan a journey through France or book an airline ticket to anywhere in the world.I can talk with you all on email. And I do.I can get instant information from a friend in Sarajevo or a businessman in Hong Kong.I can even listen to President Clinton\u2019s cat - though however hard I try, I don\u2019t seem to be able to get a squeak out of Downing Street!This machine, and millions like it - they are the nuts and bolts of the information revolution. Charles Handy described that revolution as: \u2018A modern alchemy, the ability to create wealth out of nothing... Modern economies will not be constrained by lack of resources, but only by lack of imagination, of creativity and ideas.\u2019Fellow Liberal Democrats: you and I have always known that this country\u2019s greatest resource - infinitely adaptable, infinitely renewable - is the talent of our people.But talent cannot thrive on barren land. Like any harvest, it needs preparation, nurturing, tending and encouragement.Call it education if you will. But I\u2019m talking about something much, much bigger than going to school.I\u2019m talking about a new Renaissance - the wealth of this nation flowering once again through the liberation of minds and energies, skills and aspirations.I\u2019m talking about a culture of learning, questioning, creativity - pumping through the arteries of our nation - for our nation to become the world\u2019s number one learning society - to which others come to look and learn, just as they came to marvel at the technologies of Lancashire in the last century.That is the opportunity ahead. For us, a nation with an astonishing record of inventiveness and creativity, whose language is the language of the information revolution, this is an opportunity of breathtaking, limitless potential. That\u2019s why every single Liberal Democrat policy is part of one central policy - with one central aim: to help the fifty-six million people of this country to fulfil themselves; to find the hero inside themselves; to become self-reliant and self confident; to make, together, such a contribution to society that the nation as a whole becomes more self-reliant and more self-confident.A more prosperous nation with a more generous heart.So that is our vision: to make Britain the number one learning society in the world. Now, how do we turn that vision into reality?Let me remind you of some of our key commitments, and you will see that they are consistent, and coherent, and together they are immensely powerful.Do not judge them by the jargon of Westminster or by those massive tables of dehumanising statistics. Judge them instead by their impact on the every day lives of individual people that you know \u2013 that\u2019s what I have tried to do.When I wrote that book Beyond Westminster, I wrote it for and about the people I worked and lived with. Here are my wishes for them, and for our country.My first wish is for an eleven year old girl called Shaheena. I stayed with her family in Manchester.My wish for her and her generation is that they will never be trapped in the ignorance, poverty and hopelessness that imprisons too many young people in Britain today - and that they will hold the key to their own freedom in their own hands - though their own skills, their own confidence and their own ability.And it is education, above all else, that gives them that precious key - the key that no one can ever take away.And yet today, Britain is 35th out of 48 in the World Education League, and falling every year. Do you know that one in seven of Britain\u2019s 21-year olds is illiterate and one in five is innumerate?That is a national scandal.And it will be made worse because of the Conservative cuts in education funding.But under-funding education is not a saving. It is a sentence which condemns the whole nation to second-class, low-income status for years and years to come.That is the truth that neither of the other parties will face up to.Britain\u2019s education system needs higher standards - of course it does. But it also needs more money.And only we Liberal Democrats will provide this.An extra two billion pounds, every year.Hard cash. Hard commitments. Reversing the Tory cuts that have done so much damage.And if there is no other way to pay for that, then we will ask people for an extra penny on their income tax. It\u2019s just that important.And in return, here\u2019s what Britain gets.Smaller primary classes.More money for books and equipment.Guaranteed education or training for everyone between sixteen and nineteen.A chance for every person in Britain to learn again, at some point in their adult lives.And for every child in Britain a flying start in life - two years of high quality, free, pre-school education.You know, Mrs Thatcher first promised that in 1972 - a quarter of a century ago. We cannot wait another quarter of a century until someone delivers it.No.With the Liberal Democrats strong in the next Parliament, that investment in education is guaranteed. Without, it\u2019s back again to the never-never land of empty promises.My next wish is for Sally, who I met on the Hartcliffe estate in Bristol.She is a young mother stuck, like thousands of others, in the poverty trap between benefits and work. She was desperate for a job. Eventually she found one, earning £45 a week. But after they\u2019d taken away her benefits and she\u2019d paid for travel and childcare, her family was worse off with her working than with her on the dole.She took the job - she told me she wanted the self-respect.But why should she and her children be worse off as a result?There are thousands and thousands of women in Sally\u2019s position. I want her, and everybody like her, to be free to work, to use their talents, supported by a welfare system that helps them, not holds them back.William Beveridge\u2019s great scheme of welfare was designed to do that. But it no longer does. Because the world has changed since 1945. Ours is an age of fractured families, insecure jobs, chronic unemployment. We must now do for our time, what that great Liberal did for his: fashion a new system of welfare to meet the needs of our new age.Here are the principles that should guide us.First, provide a safety net for those who truly cannot help themselves.Second, free people from dependency and encourage self-reliance.Third, focus less on redistributing wealth, and more on widening opportunities.And fourth, increase the role of the community and reduce that of the central State.If ever there was a case for partnership politics in Britain, it is here. Beveridge\u2019s great scheme was only possible because politicians worked together to build it. Reforming our welfare state for the next century will only be successful if it, too, is taken out of the day-to-day battle of party politics. So I make this commitment today.In our manifesto, we will call for a comprehensive review of our welfare system - and we will commit ourselves to building a new national consensus, between the parties and beyond the parties, for welfare reform.With the Liberal Democrats strong in the next Parliament, there will be a force to lead the reshaping of our welfare system. Without, the welfare state will remain just a bone of contention in the old two-party dog-fight.But meanwhile people like Sally need our help now - and this is what we will do.Instead of paying money to keep people like her out of work, we will turn their welfare benefits into working benefits - giving businesses a new incentive to employ and train the long-term unemployed.We will increase childcare, and reform the benefits system to remove the poverty traps, so that people like Sally are not worse off in a job than they are on welfare.And we will take low-paid jobs like Sally\u2019s out of tax altogether, making them more attractive than the dole queue, and cutting Britain\u2019s huge benefit bill.How will we pay for this? By raising the upper rate of tax on earnings over 100,000 pounds to 50%.750,000 people will be freed from income tax altogether.99.5% of all tax payers will benefit directly.And just 120,000 - the real winners of the Thatcher years - will be asked to do their bit to help those who lost out. And they\u2019ll still be taxed at a lower rate than their equivalents in Japan, Germany or France.Clear, specific, costed. The tough message on tax as well as the easy one.Now some people tell me all this is dangerous. Most people know it\u2019s just common sense. We must get this issue of tax away from the auction of fantasy promises into which it has been dragged by the other two parties.The Tories tell lies on tax, hoping to win again.Labour dodge the truth on tax, hoping not to lose again.And there is a reason for this. There is a secret both Parties are desperate to keep from us. The British Government is now up to its neck in debt.The Tory Party has become the Party of Debt and Devaluation.Remember Mrs Thatcher and Grantham Grocery Economics?Forget it.Despite record tax increases.Despite 130 billion pounds from North Sea Oil.Despite 80 billion pounds from privatisation.Britain has continued to sink deeper and deeper into debt under the Tories.And now the cupboard is bare - well, almost!Admiralty Arch. Greenwich Naval College. The stationery office. Even the homes of our service men and women. There is nothing the Tories won\u2019t flog off to their friends, to pay for pre-election tax bribes, to save their skins.And still Britain sinks deeper and deeper into debt under the Tories.The national debt - going for almost 300 years - has trebled under the Tories since 1979. And it has doubled in the six brief years since John Major became Prime Minister.That\u2019s right. In just six years, Mr. Major has added more than 160 billion pounds to the national debt - and he was trained as a bank manager!I tell you, I wish mine was like that!But the serious point is this.Paying the interest on that John Major Debt now costs us 14 billion pounds a year.That\u2019s 650 pounds a year for every household in Britain - just to pay the interest on the John Major Debt. That\u2019s the equivalent of 7 pence on income tax - just to pay the interest on the John Major Debt.That amounts to more than we spend on our police, our prisons and our universities put together - just to pay the interest on the John Major Debt.That\u2019s the real legacy of the Tory Party - the Party of Debt and Devaluation.This country now faces a real problem - perhaps even a crisis - with public borrowing after the next election. That is the real tax bombshell in Britain - the one that both of them are trying to hide. And that is the reason why no responsible party can truthfully say they would never increase taxes as a way of getting Britain back to responsible public finances. And no one should believe them if they did.So we Liberal Democrats will not engage in that auction of fantasy promises.But we can guarantee this. We will never let Britain return to the punitive tax rates of the last Labour government. We will wage war on government waste.We will see that every taxpayer knows how and why their taxes are spent.We will not make promises unless the bill is attached.Our manifesto will be a menu with prices. Clear, specific, costed.With the Liberal Democrats strong in the next Parliament, we can begin to put the trust back into British politics. Without, it will be politics as usual - tax lies, phoney figures and painless promises.And here is my next wish. It is for Judy and for her family. I stayed with them in one of Britain\u2019s crime-hit, demoralised inner city estates.My wish for her and her family is that they should have a healthy and secure life. That they should have the freedom to walk the streets in safety day or night.That they should have a Health Service they can rely on.           That they should have the confidence in the quality of the water they drink, in the purity of the air they breathe, in the safety of the food they eat.Crime, health, the environment - they might all seem like different issues. But they are not. They are actually about the same thing - the quality of our lives.Schumacher\u2019s great book, Small is Beautiful, had a subtitle: \u2018A study of economics as if people mattered.\u2019Well, what the Liberal Democrats are about is \u2018politics as if people mattered.\u2019And that means putting people first in the fight against crime.And we will.We will establish a crime-busting plan for every community - bringing schools and businesses, parents and police, probation services and youth workers together to form a united front against crime.We will give victims of crime a new deal, putting their interests at the heart of justice, and making their protection a priority.We\u2019ll back the police - with 3,000 more officers - and we\u2019ll free them from paperwork so that they can get out of the station and onto the streets, policing as if people mattered.And we\u2019ll get our National Health Service back to working as if people mattered, too.That means waging war on bureaucracy in the Health Service.In the last six years, the number of managers in the NHS has increased by 40,000. The number of nurses has fallen by 45,000.It seems now that the Government has finally decided that they must do something about this. So what have they done?Have they given more money? No.Have they recruited more nurses? No.What they\u2019ve done is taken 4,000 of those managers, and decided that from now on they\u2019ll call them nurses instead.Well that\u2019s alright, then! Problem solved!And here\u2019s another Conservative solution to the problems of the Health Service. The Private Finance Initiative - PFI. Fine. But what the NHS really needs is a different kind of PFI. Patients First Instead.Putting patients first. Supporting the doctors and nurses.Less bureaucracy. Better care.And to match that, a whole new approach to healthcare.Teaching people to look after their own health. Concentrating on preventing illness, instead of just treating it.It\u2019s common sense. And it\u2019s cost-effective.Why should anyone in 1990s Britain be forced to choose between balancing the family budget and looking after their health?As the first step towards a Health Service that treats prevention as seriously as cure, the Liberal Democrats will restore free eye and dental check-ups to every single person in Britain.Simple. Practical. Cost-effective.And incidentally, while we\u2019re on the subject of dentistry, imagine what it must be like to be a dentist in the Labour Party these days.It must be so frustrating.All those thousands of mouths. No one willing to open them!But a healthy Britain requires more than an effective Health Service. It requires a Government determined to tackle the root causes of ill health - poor housing and homelessness; poverty, unemployment and deprivation.It means cleaning up our poisoned air and polluted water, and getting serious about the damage we do to our environment.Go and ask a commuter, stuck, stressed, day after day, in queues of fuming traffic, what price a safe, reliable public transport system?Go and ask the parents of an asthmatic child, living on that same congested road, what price action to clean up our air?Asthma has become a national scourge.It cost us a billion pounds last year.It lost us 17 million days from work.And more than 8 million days from school.And that doesn\u2019t count the millions of days and nights of individual suffering and misery. We cannot go on like this - we cannot go on ignoring these problems.I want everyone in Britain to know that the Liberal Democrats will, at last, put the green into the grey of government.Tough targets for pollution.Pricing the congestion on our city roads, and putting the money into public transport.Shifting taxes off jobs and wealth, and onto pollution and energy use.A new Quality of Life index - a new way of measuring national success, as if people mattered.With the Liberal Democrats strong in the next Parliament, the last government of this century will be its greenest. Without, nothing will change - and our children will be left to pay the price.My next wish is for the employees of a silk mill in Suffolk with whom I worked. They make beautiful ties there and - like other British companies with good products - they sell them around the world, and the world loves them.I want them to have the benefits of a stable economy, grounded on low inflation, built on long­term investment.And I want them to enjoy all the benefits that flow from a successful Europe and a stable world - larger markets, freer trade, a powerful voice in the world; peace, security, wider opportunities, a safe environment - working with others to solve the problems no nation can any longer solve alone.The true greatness of this country has never come from looking inwards; from retreating behind our island walls and shouting insults at foreigners.Our forebears knew that.They went out to make things happen in the world - to trade, to explore, to settle, to build bridges, to make fortunes, to shape the world\u2019s laws, and to build its institutions.Britain\u2019s role as the bulwark against tyranny in two wars this century was not a product of isolationism. It was the natural response of a nation used to engaging in the world and certain about its role as a European power.There have been moments in our history, like now, when we have lost confidence and retreated into a narrow, crabbed and unproductive nationalism. But they have been few - and they have always been moments of national weakness and uncertainty.The price that Britain has paid for the divisions on Europe of both Labour and the Tories is high and will be higher still in the future.I want people to know that when it comes to Britain playing a full and constructive part in building a democratic, decentralised Citizen\u2019s Europe, the Liberal Democrats will be a rock upon which they can rely.But I also want them to know that with the Liberal Democrats, people will have their say - because we understand that we cannot continue with progress in Europe unless we carry our people with us.That is why the Liberal Democrats are the only Party in Parliament firmly committed to a referendum on Britain\u2019s European future.With the Liberal Democrats strong in the next parliament, Britain will have a clear path to follow in Europe and people will have their say. Without, we will continue to pay the price for the muddle and confusion of two divided parties.Consider this.Within weeks of the next election, our new government will have to make the most important decision of this decade - whether to be in or out of a European single currency. The Tories and Labour both know that. They know the arguments for, and they know the arguments against. And they know what the decision ought to be. But neither will say. They dare not. For fear of breaking up their parties.So Britain will be asked to vote without knowing what it is voting for. This is a conspiracy perpetrated on the British people, by their politicians.What should guide us in this crucial decision is not short-term party management but long-term national interest.If Britain is able to join a single currency, and chooses not to, we will pay the price in higher interest rates, higher inflation, lower investment and lost influence.Every British family will lose around ten pounds a week. And the City of London could lose out completely as Europe\u2019s first financial centre. So the Liberal Democrats are in no doubt. A single currency would be good for Europe. And if it comes, and Britain can be a part of it, then Britain should be a part of it. And this brings me to my last wish.This is for those I worked a shift with in Britain\u2019s deepest mine at Monkton Hall Colliery, near Edinburgh. They used their personal savings to buy their own pit, and made it work when British Coal couldn\u2019t. And they had to fight Government and bureaucracy at every level, every inch of the way.So my wish for them is good government - government that listens, that is open, that is in touch, that they can trust.We do not have good government in this country - we have had government.Parliament behaves in ways most people find unacceptable. It is unrepresentative - of women, the disabled, young people and our ethnic communities. And it completely fails to hold the Government in check.In Scotland and Wales, big majorities have voted for non-Conservative parties - but every major decision is taken by English Tories.Power has been remorselessly sucked away from our local communities and given to clumsy busy-bodies in Westminster and Whitehall. Now the Tories say we can\u2019t change this. Britain\u2019s political system must stay precisely as it is. That is one of the few things our Prime Minister feels really strongly about.Oh yes!But Britain\u2019s constitution has always changed with the times. That has been its strength and that has been its reason for survival.To argue that tampering with our Constitution would mean the end of the United Kingdom as we know it, flies in the face of our history and far from protecting our Constitution, denies its very strength.But then scaremongering is what the opponents of reform have always done.Who said this? \u2018Touch one atom of our glorious constitution and the whole is lost.\u2019John Major on yet another Scottish re-launch?No, Tory grandee Lord Eldon, defending the rotten boroughs in 1832.Who said this: \u2018Constitutional change... would endanger the very fabric of Britain... it would destroy in years what has been built up in centuries.\u2019Some die-hard Tory opponent of votes for women, fighting the Suffragettes to the last? No, this time it is John Major - though I have to say, you can\u2019t tell by the language! And do you know the irony? The very Government which tells us that the country will fall apart if we lay so much as a finger on our failing political institutions, is the very Government that has cut down our system of local government. Has set up a forest of quangos.And established such a tangle of arms length agencies that nowadays no Minister is responsible for anything!How dare the Tories tell us that we can\u2019t put more democracy back into our government, when they\u2019ve taken so much of the democracy out of it?So here is our promise:We will clean up Parliament.We will bring in a Great Reform Act.A Bill of Rights. A Freedom of Information Act. Revitalised local government. A Parliament for Scotland and a Senedd for Wales.We will hack our way into the jungle of the quango state, and expose it to the same laws of openness and accountability that our councillors must obey in the Council Chamber.We will give people a greater say in the way they are governed.And we will deliver, at last, a fair voting system for our country.Which means that with the Liberal Democrats strong, the next Parliament will be a Parliament of reform and modernisation. Without, at worst we will stay stuck in sleaze, and at best, good intentions will once again founder on muddle and weak commitments.Remember Scotland.Let what has happened there be a warning - the great cause of reform is not safe in Labour\u2019s hands.Our task is to make sure that this election is one in which the great issues are faced, not fudged. You have a vital role to play in that.Without you - without us - this will be an election in which the truth will be asked to be a by­stander. In which the poor will be requested not to take part in case they get in the way of the hunt for middle class votes. In which the realities of Europe will be invited to stay on the other side of the channel, because no one wants to talk about them.In which the true state of Britain\u2019s finances will remain locked in the Chancellor\u2019s cupboard because they\u2019re too uncomfortable to face. In which all will be promised, but nothing paid for. In which tax won\u2019t be seriously discussed and the environment not even mentioned.In which the election will be about fear and not about the future.Our job is to make sure that, at this vital moment of decision for our country, we are faced with the facts, and confronted with the real issues.Now, I have chosen in this speech to measure our policies against the lives of real individuals. This is quite deliberate.Some say that it\u2019s good enough for us to be the best free think tank in British politics. Not for me it isn\u2019t.And not for you either.There is only one standard for success that I can accept. And that is whether what we say and what we do makes Britain better and improves the lives of those we serve. Putting that first, and taking risks to achieve it, is how we have won our great success in local government. And in the short time ahead we will have to show the single-mindedness and courage to do that at national level, too. I told you at the beginning that this speech was a kind of tour - and like a great many tours, it will end where it started. Let me remind you of some of the things that I said. I said that this country must change or die. I said that this party is the only party ready to put clear plans for change in front of the electorate.I talked about leadership - and I said this: \u2018When people hear their inner hopes expressed in words they recognise... then they know that they\u2019re part of something bigger - and that which seemed remote and hopeless suddenly becomes an attainable goal.\u2019 Believe me: there are millions of people - who believe, privately, in all that you and I believe in. Who want to help build that more prosperous nation with a more generous heart.They may not say it in political phrases, but you know as I do, because you\u2019ve met them too. That there is a majority of people in this country who believe in fairness, in generosity, in self-sufficiency. Who love this country and its people and who long for a greater sense of pride and purpose. Who look for wise guidance for themselves and their children.And who desperately hope that someone, somewhere, will see where the sun is shining on the fields ahead - and show them the path to get there.These are people full of doubt about all political parties. They do not yet see themselves as Liberal Democrats. In your communities and your own constituencies it is you who, one by painstaking one, can explain and inspire, and allow those millions of individuals to see that they are not alone... that they are part of something of such size and momentum that if only they will act as they already believe, they will see the changes this country needs before the next year is out.We have within our sights, the achievement of all we stand for.A victory for principle, a victory for persistence. A victory that will give a new shape to hope and new opportunity to every single person in this country.A victory that will make all our long years of commitment, persistence and endeavour all the sweeter. It can be won. I know it can be won.And I know that you can win it.

aVFellow Liberal Democrats, it's great to be here.It\u2019s great to be in the home straight before the election.We are now, at most, nine weeks away from the election day, and may be less than three weeks away from the start of the campaign itself.I know how hard you have all been working over the last year. I have seen the local by-election results to prove it.But from now on these efforts need to be doubled. Everything we do as a party must be focused on the election. There is only one judgement now for all our work and campaigning and that is measured by votes in the ballot box.We are now in the last fading, twilight days of this rotten, discredited and sleazy Government.They were routed in Wirral. They\u2019re squabbling amongst themselves like rats in a sack. And I suspect now, that the longer they leave it, the harder they will fall.Well they can run - but they cannot hide. For now the account must be settled. They must now pay for what they have done.And the bill is a long one.This is the Government which gave us the poll tax, and shamelessly used Scotland as its guinea-pig.The Government which has brought us a new scandal every week, from 'cash for questions' to 'arms to Iraq'.This is the Government which gerrymandered Scottish council boundaries for its own ends - but still failed to win a single council.This is the Government which has squandered 210 billion pounds of North Sea Oil money and privatisation receipts while quadrupling the national debt.This is the Government responsible for the BSE fiasco which has done so much needless damage to the Scottish beef industry.This is the Government which received only a quarter of the votes of the Scottish people in successive elections, but has exercised absolute power through Ministers and their quango placemen.This Government has no further role to play except to hang on miserably until the bitter end.They must go.They have nothing further to say.No vision for our country.No plans for the future.No message for our comfort.No hope for our hearts.No place to go.No weapon left but fear.And they will use it. Since they cannot brighten our path to the ballot box with hope, they will frighten us to it with fear.They will say they are the party of low taxes - despite the 22 tax rises since 1992.They will say they are the party of sound economics - despite running up a national debt of nearly 400 billion pounds.They will say they are the patriotic party - while rejecting all the values that have made our country great.But most of all, here in Scotland, they will say they are the party of the Union and that any form of Home Rule will send Scotland tumbling down into some sort of Third World status.They say we will undo a thousand years of British history!Well actually, Prime Minister, there hasn\u2019t been a thousand years of British history!!Of all the absurd things our Prime Minister has said that must rank as one of the most absurd of all.I do hope the Prime Minister will take a history lesson before the campaign begins.The Prime Minister has said of Northern Ireland that, \u201cbecause of its history, there has been an Assembly in the past. That does not apply elsewhere.\u201dClearly the Scottish Parliament that existed up to 1707 has slipped his mind.At a different level he\u2019s even forgotten the old Greater London Council which only went in 1986.The last thousand years of history? His memory doesn\u2019t even stretch to the last decade of his own Government!I wonder if he can remember the General Election manifesto he stood on as a candidate in 1974. \u201cDevolution\u201d, it said, \u201cwould act as a spur to commerce and industry\u201d.Now he says it is \u2018the politics of the madhouse\u2019.Perhaps he should tell this to Lord Tebbit who wrote earlier this year that: \u201cUnionists will not save the Union by mocking the idea of a Scottish nation.\u201dOr Lord Hailsham, once Lord Chancellor - now more famous as the father of our hapless Agriculture Secretary. He wrote in 1992 that it was \u2018idle\u2019 to pretend devolution to a Scottish assembly was either impossible or a constitutional error.Or Sir Edward Heath - who only last weekend said that nothing had changed since 1974, so far as he was concerned. He still supports a Scottish Assembly and believes \u201cit has no danger to the unity of the United Kingdom. None whatever.\u201dJohn Major does not see that by bringing power back to Scotland we are bringing government closer to the people, and making government more responsive to people\u2019s needs, not less.He does not see that Britain\u2019s strength lies in building on our diversity, not on preserving our centralism.He does not see that by meeting the aspirations of Scotland\u2019s people for their own Parliament we are strengthening our Union, not weakening it.The Prime Minister seems to believe that the Union is so weak that power must be concentrated, centralised, and guarded jealously by Westminster - which means, of course, guarded jealously by Tories like him. And he seems to believe that Westminster is so weak that, if it loses some of that power it will lose it all. So he concludes that if anything changes, everything will collapse.But Britain\u2019s flexibility and diversity has, historically, been its strength not a weakness.Perhaps John Major should leave Westminster for Murrayfield this afternoon.Then he would see how our unity is strengthened by our diversity.This afternoon the Scottish captain Rob Wainwright and Irish captain Jim Staples will be facing each other at Murrayfield. Head to head. Locked in competition against one another.But in the summer they will join together with Englishmen and Welshmen, to win together for the British Lions in South Africa.When the Scots pull on their shirts this afternoon they will be proud to be Scottish. Proud of their history. Proud of their heritage. And so they should be.In the summer, when they swap their blue shirts for red they will be proud to be British. Proud to be pooling together our collective resources. Proud to be standing cheek to cheek, jowl to jowl with Englishmen, Welshmen and Irishmen.So, is it a threat to the Union that we have four different national football sides?Is it a threat to the Union that England and Scotland have different legal systems?Is it a threat to the Union that we have different established churches?That you have a different education system, or your own proud, independent banks?No - these are not threats to our Union. They are our strength. Even, perhaps, our glory.The real threat to the Union is not our diversity - not our differences - but the determination of the Conservatives to trample these down under.It is not a Scottish Parliament that poses a threat to the United Kingdom. It is the Conservatives\u2019 contemptuous rejection of Scotland\u2019s claim of right and Scotland\u2019s sense of nationhood. That\u2019s what poses the real threat to the Union.What a pity then that in the face of Conservative contempt for Scotland, Labour has sounded such an uncertain note.Michael Forsyth started his scaremongering about a tartan tax. Labour\u2019s response was to risk Scotland\u2019s carefully constructed consensus, seven years in the making, by erecting a new and quite unnecessary double fence for the Scottish people to leap.Hardly the new politics!Amid this confusion we Liberal Democrats have stood like a rock.On election day there will be no doubts. No ifs. No maybes. The Liberal Democrat guarantee is the bankable guarantee. If you want to cast one vote for a Scottish Parliament with meaningful tax powers then it has to be a vote for the Liberal Democrats.Only the Liberal Democrats can make the difference.This is our message. And it\u2019s a strong one. And I believe it will help us gain votes and seats on election day.You know, in war they use a technique called 'nightwalking'.Here is a description of nightwalking. See if it reminds you of anybody:"There is one thing and one thing only that matters: the feet of the person in front. That is your universe entire, the focus of all your attention. Look up, look sideways, just blink too long and you may lose the precise trail being trod. And may stumble. And may make noise. And may be shot at."The only thing that matters is the feet of the person in front. Stay as close as you can. Or you might be shot at.I think Labour\u2019s shadow cabinet have been doing some weekend training in political nightwalking!I think they\u2019ve decided to nightwalk to the next election.Consider last November\u2019s Budget.Conjuror Ken Clarke\u2019s great con-trick. Less tax, more spending. At least that\u2019s what he would have us believe.No-one believed him, of course, because after all their broken promises, no-one believes a word the Tories say these days.And people were right not to believe him, because underneath - it was one great smoke and mirrors con-trick.A con for our Health Service. A con for our schools. And a con for our local communities.Nothing for the future.All the way through the Budget debate we were clear where we stood. Malcolm Bruce was clear. I was clear. And across Britain Liberal Democrats have been clear as you have campaigned for better education and healthcare.Solid in our principles. Confident on our ground. Clear in our message: Our children\u2019s schools before tax bribes. Our hospitals before tax bribes. Britain\u2019s people before tax bribes.And Labour said, broadly, the same. They criticised the Budget. They said it was a con. But when it came to the vote the best they could do was abstain.Well, if you haven\u2019t got the guts to vote against tax cuts in the House of Commons, then you haven\u2019t got the right to campaign against the consequences in the country!Now note, this was the Budget which at the time Labour\u2019s Deputy Leader said was an unfair Budget for the few and not for the many. Now, Gordon Brown says this is the way it has to be.That Labour should be nervous about its past I understand.But why be so nervous about the future?That Mr Brown wants to make no more promises than he can deliver, I am pleased.But why must that mean making no promises at all?That he wants to ensure that Labour will never again return Britain to punitive rates of taxation, I am prepared to applaud and support - even though I know some of his MPs would not.But what I cannot understand is how Labour can spend six months telling us the Tory Budget was a fraud, and now may spend the next two years applying it.I don\u2019t want taxes in Britain to be a penny higher than they have to be. But to rule out the possibility of any tax increase whatsoever is a counsel of despair for education, for the NHS, for our public services and for the country as a whole.If all that changes after the next election are the names on the nameplates above Number 11 and Number 10 Downing Street then I genuinely fear for this country\u2019s future.So, if your school is about to lose a teacher you can blame the Tories. But don\u2019t look to Labour for help. They say they will do nothing.If your hospital is in crisis - blame the Tories. But don\u2019t look to Labour for help. They say they will do nothing.If elderly parents are about to lose the care they need to live because of council cuts - blame the Tories. But don\u2019t look to Labour. They say they will do nothing.Just look at the two Crime Bills pushed through Parliament by the Government this year, one for England and Wales, one for Scotland. The second a carbon copy of the first; Michael Forsyth riding roughshod over the different legal system and traditions north of the border to win a few cheap votes and a quick cheer from the party faithful.Both bills were fundamentally illiberal. Both sought to restrict judicial freedom in a way never seen before. Both of them were attempts to deceive the public into believing the Government were seriously tackling crime while really doing nothing of the sort.And there was another thing they had in common. On both of them it was the Liberal Democrats who led the opposition. Labour stayed away.Two clear examples of how the Liberal Democrats will make the difference.Just look at what\u2019s happening in Scotland\u2019s schools.Class sizes have risen since 1992, and they\u2019re still rising.The backlog of repairs and maintenance has increased since 1992, and it\u2019s still increasing.More and more schools are becoming dependent on PTA funds for essential equipment like books and computers, creating a hierarchy of rich schools and poor schools - fundamentally undermining the ethos of Scottish education.What I said at Budget time and what I have been saying ever since is that there\u2019s no point moaning about the problems in our schools if, when it comes to the crunch, you\u2019re not prepared to invest in doing anything about them.Where the Tories obscure and Labour fudge, the Liberal Democrats are clear. We need both higher standards and extra investment. The two go hand in hand - and only we will deliver themEarly years education for every 3 and 4 year old whose parents want it - the most important investment we can make.Smaller primary class sizes, and extra resources for books, equipment, and teacher development.And better post-16 training and adult education later on.Guaranteed.Elect Liberal Democrats, this is what you get. Around £200 million extra for Scottish schools - every year. Over a Parliament that would add up to a billion pounds of extra investment in our children\u2019s futures across Scotland.At local level the Liberal Democrat commitment to education already shines through.In the Borders Archy Kirkwood, David Steel and Michael Moore have joined forces with councillors fighting tooth and nail to save music tuition and hot school meals , and to stop the closure of rural primary schools in the face of the worst council funding squeeze ever seen.That determination has brought success - a success which is reflected in education departments in Liberal Democrat administrations up and down the country.When it comes to the things which matter most to people it is the Liberal Democrats who are fighting hardest for them.An example. Nothing is more important to people than their health.You don\u2019t have to be an expert in public policy to understand the crisis now going on in our Health Service - you only have to read the newspapers and use the evidence of your own eyes.Every week, there is new evidence of a closed ward or axed service.So what do we do?The NHS has three main problems. Lack of investment. Lack of accountability. And lack of strategic planning. And in each case it is only the Liberal Democrats who will make the difference.We will bring proper accountability to healthcare in Scotland, so that the people taking key decisions are answerable to the local people they are supposed to serve.We will bring better planning to the NHS in Scotland. At the moment there is no planning. There is panic. What we see is the haphazard, crisis driven, chaotic closure of hospital wards and NHS services.Well we\u2019d stop that. Tomorrow. For six months. While a full NHS audit was done, matching needs to facilities.And we\u2019d put in place a proper system for NHS strategic planning for the future. And we\u2019d make that a responsibility of the new Scottish Parliament. And then we\u2019d ensure that the Scottish health service operates on a five-year rolling programme, to provide stability and long-term confidence.That would cut bureaucracy. And save money. Which we will put into further care.But that\u2019s not all. We will put more real investment into the NHS in Scotland as we will across the UK.We will freeze prescription charges - which have risen by 3000% since 1979.We will abolish charges for eye and dental check ups.We will invest two hundred million pounds across the UK in NHS recruitment and improvements. That\u2019s enough to pay for 10,000 extra nurses or 5,000 doctors.And we will spend one hundred and fifty million pounds more, reducing waiting lists, to no more than six months by the year 2000.These aren\u2019t just aspirations - like the Labour Party have for health.They\u2019re not even plans - like the Conservatives make at Budget time and then break a year later.They are commitments. And they\u2019re fully costed.The eye and dental checks will be paid for by putting five pence on the price of a packet of cigarettes. If you don\u2019t believe that\u2019s a price worth paying to restore free eye and dental checks - don\u2019t vote for us.The extra nurses and doctors for better patient care; and reduced waiting lists will be paid for by closing off a tax loophole on the payment of wages in kind.This is the Liberal Democrat Guarantee for Scotland\u2019s Health.And like every other policy that will be in our General Election manifesto it will be subject to the Liberal Democrats\u2019 Tax Contract with the British people.That any extra taxes we ask for will be targeted, specific, costed, and independently monitored to see that they deliver value-for-money.That we will target that extra money not on more bureaucrats and more managers, but on specific practical things that improve the quality of people\u2019s lives.That we will be specific about where the money will be spent and what it will achieve.That we will see that every promise we make has a bill attached.And that we will insist on minimum waste and maximum value-for-money.The media talk a lot about pacts. But this is the only pact I\u2019m thinking about.A pact with the people of Britain.A new contract between government and citizen that will rebuild trust in taxation and reconnect tax payers with tax spenders.It is now crystal clear to anyone worried about the state of our schools, our hospitals or our society, that it is only the Liberal Democrats who will now make a difference after eighteen years of Tory government.Ours is the crucial role in defeating the Tories.Ours is the crucial role in ensuring real change after the election.Ours, uniquely, is to work with others when the nation benefits but oppose them if they do the nation harm.Never before has our party gone into an election campaign so strong, so independent, so certain about the role only we can play, and so clear on what marks us out from the other parties.Our long-term outlook.Our commitment to defending individual liberties against the intolerance of both right and left.Our belief in local democracy and open government.Our green agenda.Our unashamedly internationalist vision.Our commitment to providing public services to be proud of - properly funded, and with every penny accounted for.And our unique guarantee - no fudges - to legislate for a Scottish Parliament.I am determined that this country goes into the next century facing up to the challenges before us, not evading them. Head held high in pride and self-confidence. Not so timid that even their politicians prefer to follow, than to lead.That will not happen if things stay as they are.It will only happen if Liberal Democrats are able to make the difference.We are now the strongest liberal force in Britain for 60 years After the next election, we can be stronger still.There are just days to go.Make use of every single moment of them!Good campaigning. And good luck.

aVI want to start by telling you a story.One December, a British Ambassador in Washington was called by an American radio station. They asked him what he would like for Christmas.He said that, as a servant of his country, he couldn\u2019t possibly accept a personal gift. But the journalist persisted. And eventually the Ambassador, anxious no doubt to get back to whatever it is that Ambassadors do, said: \u2018Oh, all right then, I wouldn\u2019t wish to cause offence. Perhaps just a very small box of crystallised fruit?\u2019He then forgot all about it.Until Christmas Day.When he turned on his radio and heard the announcer say \u2018On this holiday morning, with the new year just a few days away, we called the representatives of three great nations to find out what they would like for Christmas.\u2018First we asked the German Ambassador. He said he would like to see the final resolution of the East-West conflict and a long unbroken period of world peace.\u2018Then we asked the French Ambassador what she would like. And she said she would like to see the elimination of crime and corruption from our society so that the youth of the world could march without fear into the future.\u2018And then\u2019, said the Announcer, \u2018then we asked the British Ambassador what he would like for Christmas ... and he said he\u2019d like a small box of crystallised fruit\u2019.Fellow Liberal Democrats, there is now a desperate need in this country for leadership in our politics. For ambition. For self-confidence. For vision.Yet all we are being offered from the Conservative and Labour parties is a small box of crystallised fruit.The challenges before us are huge. They have never, perhaps, been bigger.How do we maintain decent public services? How can we re-establish the common values that bind us? How do we learn to live more lightly on our planet? How do we tackle poverty, at home and around the world?No, the issues are huge. But the ideas and the responses we are offered are tiny.From John Major, the big idea to shape our time:The Cones Hotline.Or the promise of a toilet every ten miles on the motorway.Or a cadet force in every school.You know, there will be schools where the children have no inside toilets. But they\u2019ll have a cadet force.There will be schools with more than forty children to a class. But they\u2019ll be able to join the cadets.And there\u2019ll be schools with leaking roofs and repairs waiting years to be fixed. But don\u2019t worry, they\u2019ll all be able to join the cadets!Now, don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019ve nothing against cadets. Unlike John Major and Michael Portillo, I\u2019ve actually been one!But it does suggest an astonishing sense of priorities, a puny shortage of vision, and a terrifying lack of ambition for our country.These are indeed the small ideas of timid minds.And what are we offered from Her Majesty\u2019s Official Opposition?Unfettered by the realities of office, untainted by recent failure; surely they must be a seething cauldron of great ideas and charismatic inspiration?Well, yeeees.There\u2019ll be national homework periods.There\u2019s a distant, uncosted promise of a 10p tax band - this year . . . next year . . . some time . . . never.Oh ... and there\u2019ll be a clamp-down on that great social evil of our time - the squeegee merchant!There are patients waiting on trolleys in hospital corridors because of the financial crisis in the NHS.There are youngsters sleeping rough on our streets because they\u2019ve nowhere else to go.There are thousands of old ladies denied a decent pension, denied the care they need because of cuts, living in poverty, too scared to step outside because of crime, too frightened to turn on the heating because of the cost.But we are told we can\u2019t afford to tackle these problems.So let\u2019s get rid of the squeegee merchants instead.Everywhere I look, I see this extraordinary discrepancy:What is ahead of us are huge challenges to confront. What we are offered is the politics of toytown.Or perhaps it ought to be The Wizard of Oz. Do you remember the Wizard of Oz? Do your remember the cowardly lion?That\u2019s what I thought of when I saw that poor, sad lion on the Conservatives\u2019 latest posters.That lion, you know, is a lion with a history.The Tories chose it to frighten us all into voting for them.But - and this is absolutely true - that lion was actually screen-tested for a part in John Cleese\u2019s film - \u201cFierce Creatures\u201d - and failed. Because it was too timid!Seems a pretty good bargain to me. We get John Cleese; they get the lion!Now I don\u2019t want to be too beastly to Brian Mawhinney. He had a real triumph last week. He got - at last - a defector of his very own!Mr Stuart Hughes.The former Chief Whip of the Monster Raving Loony Party!Now Mr Hughes has a history, too.Finding the Monster Raving Loony Party insufficiently loony, he formed his own breakaway party - the Jolly Green Giant Party!And in case you think I am making this up - that\u2019s absolutely true as well!But it seems that not even the Jolly Green Giant Party was loony enough. So Stuart has decided to join the looniest bunch of the lot. The Tories!Now that is what I call \u201ca marriage of true and settled minds.\u201dI am afraid to say, however, that even with that political career behind him, I don\u2019t think Mr Stuart Hughes is yet fully prepared for Mrs Teresa Gorman and Mr David Evans!That\u2019s the modern Tory Party for you. Mr Stuart Hughes in one end. Mr George Gardiner out at the other.But seriously, we are about to enter the last election of the century.There are just 50 days or so to go.50 days that will set the course Britain takes for the next fifty years.And the election campaign, and the way it is fought, and the choices which are put before the country will settle the pattern of our lives for decades ahead.And an election campaign of sourness and soundbites, which ducks the issues, which is bereft of new ideas, and which substitutes abuse for open debate is just not good enough for our country.For this is almost certainly the last election of the Millennium. It should be a time of national renewal. An opportunity to unite us as a country, to point us, not backwards, to what has been, but forward to what can be. To liberate, to challenge - to inspire.That is the sort of election which we Liberal Democrats shall fight.50 days which are worthy of the 50 years ahead.For the new ideas are our ideas. We have the power to see them adopted. And it is our duty to see that they are.It is not only true that we can make the difference. It is also true that it is our duty to make the difference. Because no-one else will.You know, the whole of our politics now seems to be infected by a terrible fatalism.We are told that nothing can be done. We are told there is no other way. We are told we must accept things as they are.We are a \u2018can-do\u2019 nation. But we are being let down by \u2018can\u2019t do\u2019 politics, and \u2018can\u2019t be done\u2019 politicians.We can\u2019t ask people to pay more for their child\u2019s education or their family\u2019s well-being.We can\u2019t ask people to pay for more childcare, to help women back to work.We can\u2019t ask them to use their cars a little less to protect our environment or save our children from asthma.We can\u2019t ask those who have most, to share a little, to give opportunities to those who have almost nothing.New thinking is out.Debate is dulled into a deadening conformity.Conservative assumptions go unchallenged for fear of offending the conservative press.Don\u2019t frighten the horses - above all, don\u2019t frighten the focus groups.You know, in the services, there is a technique called \u2018nightwalking\u2019. It is a method of stealthily getting from A to B without making a noise or attracting attention. Here\u2019s a description of it. See if it reminds you of anything.\u201cThere is one thing and one thing only that matters: the feet of the person in front. That is your universe entire, the focus of all your attention. Look up, look sideways, look left, look right, just blink too long and you may lose the precise trail being trod. And stumble. And make a noise. And be shot at\u201d.The only thing that matters are the feet of the person in front. Stay as close as you can. Or you might be shot at.I think the entire Shadow Cabinet has been away, taking weekend courses in political nightwalking.I think they\u2019ve decided to nightwalk all the way through to the General Election.My fear is that, with the Tories tough talking, and Labour nightwalking, Britain will be sleepwalking right through the election, and into the next century - lacking leadership, lacking vision and lacking the optimism that breeds confidence and courage.Forget all those daft Tory posters. That is the real danger of this election - that nothing changes.And you know, there\u2019s an important relationship between optimism and tolerance, and between pessimism and intolerance.Confident, buoyant countries welcome diversity and challenge: they see impending change as an opportunity to be embraced and exploited.Small-minded, defeatist countries see change as a threat: and their instinct is to retreat. To withdraw into bitterness, intolerance and prejudice.If there is a single epitaph for this Government - for these last five years - let it be those terrible words of John Major\u2019s, two years ago.Do you remember them?\u201cIt is time to condemn a little more, and understand a little less.\u201dJust think about that: \u201cit is time to condemn a little more and understand a little less.\u201d From the Prime Minister.The man whose job it is to lead Britain - appealing for less understanding in our times.Sixteen year old children leaving care homes where they\u2019ve spent the whole of their lives. No work. No training. No benefit. Nowhere to sleep but the street. No way to live but beg. Because it\u2019s time to condemn a little more and understand a little less.Single parents, stuck in poverty on sink estates. No way out. Can\u2019t afford childcare. Can\u2019t even afford the cost of travelling to work. Attack them for a roar at a Tory Party Conference. Because it\u2019s time to condemn a little more and understand a little less.Refugees fleeing persecution. Seeking asylum. Asking for our protection. Lock them up. Deny them benefit. Turn them away. Because it is time to condemn a little more and understand a little less.Young men and women sleeping in shop doorways just the thickness of a plate glass window away from job ads they\u2019ll never have the skills to apply for. Attack them. Demean them. Demand they be hosed off the streets if it wins you a few more votes. Because it\u2019s time to condemn a little more and understand a little less.This idea - \u201cit is time to condemn a little more and understand a little less\u201d - has sounded through this Parliament - through the last five years - like a cruel drumbeat. Driving the Government. Mesmerising the Labour Party.It is the reason why, leaderless, our politics now falls into step behind every latest spasm of nonsense put out by the right-wing press.It is the reason why new laws are drafted, not with due consideration, but to appeal to the carefully whipped up vindictiveness of a Conservative Party Conference.It is, above all, the reason why Mr Jack Straw and Mr Michael Howard are now involved in this bizarre public contest - to win the 1997 Attila the Hun prize for who can condemn most and understand least.Since it\u2019s a telephone poll, incidentally, Jack Straw is bound to win, of course!If you want to see the illiberal drift of British politics, just consider the Police Bill introduced by Michael Howard.A Bill which would have given the police the power, whenever they thought it right, to bug or burgle any house in the land.From the very start, we spoke out in opposition. It was just instinctive.But for Labour, appearing tough on crime was more important than standing up for individual freedom.And you know what I found most depressing? Labour\u2019s undignified U-turn finally came only after the Daily Mail and the Daily Telegraph said it was alright to oppose the Bill.And then .... a spectacle to strike fear into the heart of any citizen - Michael Howard and Jack Straw sitting down to decide together how best to protect our freedoms.A process, indeed, whose most likely outcome is something more extreme than either of them would have thought up in the first place!On measure after measure of law and order, Liberal Democrats now stand alone in opposing this new and dangerous authoritarianism that has gripped British politics.This attitude is not just the enemy of tolerance and decency. It is also the enemy of common-sense.Of course crime and anti-social behaviour are a problem. They\u2019re a huge problem. And we have to tackle them.Let\u2019s give the police the resources they need to do the job.Let\u2019s put more effort into preventing crime in the first place.Let\u2019s deal with young offenders in a way which stops them getting sucked into a life of crime.Let\u2019s give the victims of crime a new deal from the criminal justice system.Instead of dealing with the symptoms, let\u2019s start tackling problems at their roots.Only this Government would pile millions more into prisons and boot camps, but cut millions more from our schools and colleges.Let me tell you another story.A month ago, at half term, I met a headmaster from Oxfordshire.His school has been hit by cuts for three consecutive years.His roofs are leaking. His classes are up to 40. And now it looks as if he\u2019s going to have to sack yet another teacher.No. I didn\u2019t meet him lobbying in Parliament. He\u2019d given up on that.I met him on his way to Covent Garden in London. With his guitar. To busk. To raise money for his school. To keep that teacher. He said it was the only thing left he could do.I don\u2019t know about you, but I am ashamed that education in our country has come to this.And what a contrast! One \u201ccan-do\u201d individual, struggling to solve a problem our \u201ccan\u2019t do\u201d politics says we can\u2019t do anything about.Well, we Liberal Democrats reject that. And the whole timid \u2018can\u2019t do\u2019 culture of our politics. We say we can do. We say we must do. And we say we will do.We will turn the next Parliament into a \u2018Parliament for Education\u2019.We will provide a massive 10 billion pound programme of education investment to make that happen.We will turn the year 2000 into an \u2018Education Millennium\u2019 for our country, where we concentrate less on grand monuments, and more on creative minds. On the ideas and innovations and intellectual capital that will give choices to our children, decency to our society, and prosperity to our country.These are the grand phrases.But they are not good enough. So let me tell you what they mean.They mean smaller class sizes, giving pupils and teachers the books and equipment they need, giving every 3 and 4 year old the guarantee of nursery education.No. That\u2019s still not good enough. I want to tell you precisely what that will mean - in detail - for your local school.It will mean that a typical primary school with 250 pupils will, next year, get an extra 16,000 pounds for new books, computers and equipment.It will mean that a typical secondary school with 1,000 pupils will, next year, get an extra 110,000 pounds to spend on new books, computers and equipment.And it will mean that by the end of the next Parliament, we will have provided enough money to ensure that no child between 5 and 11 - no child at either infant school or primary school - need be in a class of more than 30.Now that\u2019s not a wish-list. That\u2019s \u2018can-do\u2019 politics.It\u2019s not one of those never, never promises we keep hearing from Labour and the Tories. It\u2019s a clear, costed commitment.And here\u2019s another.Today, on Mother\u2019s Day, a commitment to every mother and father of every baby born this year. That from the age of three, your child will have the chance of two years, high quality early learning to give them the best possible start in life.You know, 2000 babies will be born in Britain today. They will celebrate their third birthday on 9th March, in the year 2000.When they grow up, they\u2019ll have no memory of this Millennium at all. But if we deliver, they\u2019ll remember this pledge. Our Millennium Pledge.Of course this will cost.But it will create, too.Better opportunities. Youngsters with more initiative - and a clearer sense of right and wrong. Less crime. Higher standards of education. And a stronger economy later on.And immediately, 35,000 new jobs in teaching and support staff for pre-school education alone.And that\u2019s a commitment - and its costed.Yes, we\u2019ll have to put a penny on income tax to pay for these commitments. How much is that? Well, taken with our other tax changes, that\u2019s an extra 45 pence per week for the average tax payer in Britain.So it\u2019s very simple. If you don\u2019t think giving these children that chance is worth an extra 45 pence a week, then its simple. Don\u2019t vote for us.But if you do think it is worth spending 45 pence a week for our future, then the only Party who will give you that investment are the Liberal Democrats. If that\u2019s what you want, then your vote can make a difference - and with your support the Liberal Democrats will make a difference.So if your local school is losing a teacher - blame the Tories - of course you should.But don\u2019t look to Labour - because they\u2019ve adopted the Tory Budget. They\u2019ve decided they\u2019ll do nothing about it.And do you know why we are able to make these commitments while others cannot? It\u2019s because we are prepared to talk some common-sense about tax.You see, here is another issue where our politics is dominated by fatalism and timidity - by the idea that the British people are a bunch of mean-minded misery guts, as obsessed with tax as the politicians and the press.Well I just don\u2019t believe that.What people talk to me about is not the level of tax, but the state of the NHS, or the cuts in their children\u2019s schools, or the crime on their streets.People don\u2019t want to pay any more tax than they have to. Of course they don\u2019t. And they certainly don\u2019t want to give politicians blank cheques with their money. But most of all what they don\u2019t want is yet more fantasy promises they can\u2019t believe either.They want to be told the truth.Okay. Here\u2019s the first truth.Promise minus cost equals lie.And here\u2019s the second truth.In real life, you don\u2019t get something for nothing.And here\u2019s the third truth.If we want better public services then they have to be paid for.What people want to know is how much? Where\u2019s it coming from? What do you get for it?And we Liberal Democrats will tell them - precisely.We won\u2019t throw money at problems in the old socialist way. Our proposals are modest, specific and targeted. And every extra penny spent will be monitored so that it delivers higher quality services, higher standards and better value for the taxpayer.We will give the National Audit Office and the Audit Commission a new responsibility - to follow every extra pound we invest in education and the NHS, to see that the money goes where we say it will and delivers the improvements we promise.And we will strike a new Tax Contract with the British people. We will send this Tax Contract out to every taxpayer with their annual tax demands, showing them where their money is going, what it is buying, and giving them a chance to say where they would like to see more money spent, or spending cut.Just consider what this would deliver for our Health Service.Over the last six months I have visited hospitals all over the country. I have met patients and relatives, doctors, nurses and managers. I have seen with my own eyes what is going on in our NHS.It is, in the words of a senior doctor at the British Medical Association, the worst financial crisis in the NHS for ten years.So let me now set out precisely what the Liberal Democrats will do about it.We\u2019ll halt, for six months, the closures of beds and wards, while we match NHS facilities to patient needsThen we will invest an extra 200 million pounds a year in recruiting and retaining staff, especially in our hospitals.That\u2019s enough for either 5,000 more doctors or 10,000 more nurses.And we will invest an extra 150 million pounds to cut waiting lists to a maximum six months within three years.And how will we pay? We\u2019ll close the loophole used by the very rich to dodge the National Insurance that all the rest of us have to pay.But it doesn\u2019t stop there.We\u2019ll attack the extra bureaucracy created to run the Government\u2019s internal market - and shift the money into patient care.We\u2019ll reintroduce free eye and dental checks for everyone in the country, as the first step towards a Health Service that puts as much emphasis on preventing illness as on treating it.And how will we do it? With an extra 5 pence on a packet of cigarettes.And if you don\u2019t think paying 5 pence more for a packet of cigarettes for free eye and dental checks is worth it - then it\u2019s very simple. Don\u2019t vote for us.But if you do think an extra 5 pence on a packet of 20 cigarettes is worth paying for free eye and dental checks, then the only Party who will give you that investment are the Liberal Democrats. If that\u2019s what you want, then your vote can make a difference - and with your support, the Liberal Democrats will make a difference.So, if your hospital is in crisis - blame the Conservatives - of course you should.But don\u2019t look to Labour - they say they will spend even less on the NHS than the Conservatives!And in every area of policy the story is the same.If you want to protect the environment for the future, your vote can make a difference - because the Liberal Democrats have the policies to put the environment at the heart of government - and with your support we will make the difference.If you want to build new homes to house the homeless, your vote can make a difference - because the Liberal Democrats will sort out the rules that stop these homes being built - and with your support we will make the difference.If you want to see politicians doing something about the poverty in our country, your vote can make a difference, because the Liberal Democrats say something can be done - and with your support we will make the difference.Our proposals to tax earnings over 100,000 pounds at a top rate of 50% mean we could free 500,000 of the lowest paid people in Britain from the burden of income tax altogether - helping thousands of low-paid women, in particular.At a stroke that would make lower-paid jobs more attractive to people out of work.It would put much-needed cash into the pockets of thousands of people struggling to survive on very low wages - again, many of them women.It would benefit 99.5% of all tax payers, and reduce the 90 billion pound benefit bill that is such a burden on this country.Now that\u2019s \u2018can do\u2019 politics for you.But if you\u2019re against asking the very rich to do their bit to help the poorest in our country, then it\u2019s simple. Don\u2019t vote for us. Lord Andrew Lloyd Webber can flee the country now!But if you do think that we must now give opportunities to those who have been left out, then there is now - amazingly - only one Party dedicated to doing this, and that is the Liberal Democrats. With your vote you can make a difference - and with your support, Liberal Democrats will make the difference.At this moment, when our country so desperately needs a lead, I think back to David Lloyd George and his \u201cPeople\u2019s Budget\u201d in 1909. A Budget to pay for the Liberals\u2019 great war against sickness and poverty in unemployment and old age. A Budget which laid the foundation stone of our welfare state.As he told one cheering crowd:\u201cThe Budget is introduced, not merely for the purpose of raising barren taxes, but taxes that are fertile taxes, taxes that will bring forth fruit ...\u201cWe are raising money to provide against the evils and sufferings that follow from unemployment. We are raising money ... to provide for the sick and the widows and orphans. We are providing money to enable us to develop the resources of our own land.\u201cI do not believe\u201d, he said, \u201cthat any fair-minded man would challenge the justice and the fairness of the objects which we have in view in raising this money\u201d.Maybe not any fair-minded man. But the House of Lords rejected that Budget, and the King even sent a message of complaint from the Royal Yacht - that\u2019s right, the Royal Yacht - it was causing trouble in those days, too!But note. Lloyd George didn\u2019t turn to his spin doctors for advice. He didn\u2019t retreat into his shell, terrified of the Tories\u2019 \u2018Tax Bombshell\u2019 campaign. He didn\u2019t say \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I can\u2019t do anything. I\u2019m not prepared to exceed Mr Balfour\u2019s spending plans.\u201dHe set off round the country, arguing his case before huge crowds, and winning people\u2019s support for that great Liberal programme which marked the birth of Britain\u2019s welfare state.He had conviction. He had belief. He knew that people wanted a fresh approach.Now in this election, while the other parties will offer up their small boxes of crystallised fruit, let us make the case, once again, for fertile public expenditure that will bring forth the fruits of education, health and decent public services. Our Party now carries the torch of conscience and reform.We carry the torch of radicalism in our defence of individual liberties and progressive social policies. And in our fight to control the abuse of power and modernise our political system, we carry the torch of liberals and democrats and radicals and reformers in every generation for four hundred years who have fought the vested interests of the day, to modernise our political system, and control the power of the State. In every generation, we have been opposed by the conservatives and the reactionaries. In every generation, we have succeeded through our tenacity, through the force of our ideas, and through the strength of our cause. Now, in the last decade of the twentieth century, we have our own battle royal to fight. Before us stand, once again, the forces of conservatism who will scaremonger about the consequences of change. Before us, once again, stand those who speak of our Constitution as though it were a dead thing - a museum-piece - when it is, in fact, a living thing - changing, evolving, modernising itself over the last four hundred years.This has not been its weakness - it has been its strength. The people of this country know our politics is a mess and they know the mess must be sorted out. We draw our inspiration from the oldest principle of British radicalism - the struggle to control the abuse of power - and from the most recent expression of liberal belief - community politics. Fused together, these two create an idea that is immensely powerful - the idea of returning power to the people. Protecting individual rights. Opening up government. Handing power to local communities. Giving people information, responsibility, a direct say.Getting more women and ethnic minority MPs into Parliament to make it more representative.Dispersing the power concentrated in Westminster and Whitehall. Bringing power down to our local communities and to the separate nations of our United Kingdom. Here in Wales, six billion pounds of public money is now spent by government appointees over whom the Welsh people have no control, and a Welsh Secretary of State who they did not elect. It is time to give Wales more control over Welsh affairs. It is time to give the Scottish people more control over Scottish affairs. It is time to give people all over our United Kingdom more power in their communities. It is part of our Party\u2019s historic mission. And I am determined that it shall be a lasting achievement of Liberal Democrats in the next Parliament. We have, through choice, been able to work and agree with the Labour Party in this one crucial area - despite our different values, our different policies and our different beliefs. Now that may be criticised by some. But it will be a great source of hope for millions in Britain who despair of politicians ever working together for the good of the country. Now that\u2019s \u2018can do\u2019 politics. That\u2019s the Liberal Democrats making a difference.The next Parliament must not be another Parliament of broken promises. It has to be a Parliament of promises kept, trust repaid, guarantees delivered. At this Conference we have set out our priorities for Britain in the next century. In the local communities of our country, we are already making a difference. Now it is time for our Party to do nationally what we have done locally - to become a party of power and make a real difference to people\u2019s lives. There will be those who say this is an impertinence. Who will say that as the Tories fail and Labour appear to thrive, ours will a marginal voice. How dare they? We have won the power to make the difference. We have proved ourselves in local government. We have proved our ability to change the agenda. To put education at the forefront of national debate. To demand open, honest taxation. To set a new style of co-operation in politics, which puts country before party where it is right and where it can make a difference. Yes - we have earned the right and the power to make a difference. We have proved our ability to win. So get out there and enjoy yourselves!I want every single one of you to look back on these next fifty days and be proud: proud to have been part of this great campaign. Proud that, like Lloyd George, you went to the country with a message you believed. Proud to have said what you think needs to be done for your country. Proud to have stood out against the fatalism of British politics.Proud to have said - it does not have to be like this. Yes, it can be done. Tell them how it is. Tell them what we will do. Tell them we will be their champions. Tell them their vote can make a difference.Because, with their support, WE Liberal Democrats will make the difference. Good luck. Good campaigning.

aVLet me tell you a story.There\u2019s a hunter, stalking through the jungle. And all of a sudden he hears a terrible trumpeting of a bull elephant in pain, followed by deathly silence.He heads off in the direction of the noise, hacking through the undergrowth, to find himself in a jungle clearing. In the centre, there's an enormous dead elephant.Sat on its carcass is a tiny three foot high pygmy."D'you kill that elephant?", asks the hunter incredulously.\u201cYes", says the pygmy."How d'you do it?", asks the hunter."With my club", comes the response."It must have been a big club!""Yes", replies the pygmy, "it\u2019s got 100,000 members!"Fellow Liberal Democrats, that\u2019s how we\u2019ve got where we are today.Teamwork.It\u2019s our secret weapon, you see. And that\u2019s what the other parties don\u2019t understand. We actually rather like each other. And even when we do sometimes disagree it\u2019s not about people, it\u2019s about policies. Not policies as a substitute for people, or a proxy for differences of personality. But REALLY about policies. The press can\u2019t quite get their heads round that idea.A journalist recently said to me: \u201cI can\u2019t quite get the hang of you lot. At the other parties\u2019 conferences they spend all day slapping each other on the back on the stage, and then beat each other up in the bar afterwards. You lot spend all day beating each other up on the stage\u201d - I think he meant constructively debating - \u201cand then slap each other on the back in the bar!\u201dHe just couldn\u2019t work it out!As our party celebrates 10 years of existence it is good to bear in mind this, and the other values that have stood us in such good stead and given us such great success this past decade.We\u2019ve come a long way.Through the splits, the wrangles, the party name debate, the \u2018dead parrot\u2019 document. Fourth place in the Euro-elections. I remember looking at one poll, and commenting to my office that we were within the margin of error of nothing.Well look at what we\u2019ve achieved since then. Not just holding what the Alliance had in its heyday, but winning more - 1500 more council seats. Going from 14 councils, to 50. Winning our first ever MEPs.And more than doubling our parliamentary strength - creating the largest liberal force Britain has seen since the days of Lloyd George.At the election last year we promised people we\u2019d make the difference. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing.In Westminster today, just as in Labour's rotten boroughs across Britain, it is the Liberal Democrats who are providing the effective opposition.And the Conservatives who are ... well, nowhere to be seen!We know why the Tories are silent in Wales. There\u2019s none left. The voters threw \u2018em out. Just like they did in Scotland.But even in Westminster, the ragged remnants of the Conservative Party - the English Conservative Party - are eerily silent.The good ship Tory has become a ghost ship.Last year - the Titanic.Now - the Marie Celeste.A once great vessel, now disabled by some strange and unnerving disaster. Eerily silent. Drifting aimlessly on with no hand on the tiller.No-one on deck. No charts to steer by. The crew have mutinied. The Captain and his officers have abandoned the bridge - and handed it over to one of the midshipmen!And all that\u2019s left is a motley, rag bag collection, so anonymous as to make the average stowaway look high profile by comparison!And so the Tories blow with the wind - drifting, directionless from one day to the next.I tell you what, it comes to something when Tory MPs look wistfully back to John Major for decisive leadership!So it\u2019s little wonder that, increasingly, people are turning to the Liberal Democrats.It\u2019s little wonder, as more and more people are coming to realise, that when it comes to the things which matter most to them, it is the Liberal Democrats they can rely on.We are the effective voice today for investment in our schools and our hospitals. In Parliament and across the country.We are the effective opposition to the Labour Government.Who was it who flagged up the hidden cuts in Gordon Brown\u2019s Budgets hitting every Government programme?Not the Conservatives. It was the Liberal Democrats.Who exposed the Chancellor\u2019s £200 billion hidden \u2018war chest\u2019?Not the Conservatives. It was the Liberal Democrats.Who brought the Government's shambolic handling of EMU policy - dictated by phone from a Whitehall pub - to public attention?Who showed up the Government's puny response to the threat of the Millennium computer bug?Who highlighted the potential £4 billion tax hike hidden in the Chancellor\u2019s abolition of TESSAs and PEPs?Not the Conservatives. It was the Liberal Democrats.And here in Wales, who\u2019s fighting hardest for schools and health services, and for a fair deal for business and farming?Not the Conservatives. Not even the separatists of Plaid Cymru. It\u2019s Richard Livsey. And it\u2019s Lembit Öpik. Even when he\u2019s stuck in a hospital bed himself. Best wishes for a quick recovery from all of us, Lembit.Across Britain today we are the effective opposition. We\u2019re not afraid to work with the Government, where we agree with them, especially on the great cause of modernising our political system, to help make the changes Britain needs. But where we disagree, we will not hesitate to oppose them, with vigour and with zeal.Take the Government's five \u2018early pledges\u2019.As luck would have it, I have a list of them here!\u201cKeep this card and see that we keep our promises,\u201d it says.Well, one year on, how are they doing?Pledge one: school classes will be smaller.But the number of children in big classes isn\u2019t falling. It\u2019s rising. And to record levels.Pledge two: a \u2018new deal\u2019 to get young people back to work.Well, lot\u2019s more young people are in jobs. And that\u2019s great news. But it\u2019s the economic recovery that\u2019s done the work. The Government's \u2018new deal\u2019 is only just getting off the ground. But what the recovery has shown is that the bigger problem is getting the older, long-term unemployed - who there are twice as many of - back to work.Pledge three: we\u2019ll ensure low inflation, and low interest rates.But the Government have raised the inflation target twice since the election, breaking their promise to stick to the Tories\u2019 target. And interest rates have risen five times because of their refusal to rebalance fiscal policy.Pledge four: fast track sentencing for young offenders.All I can say is I hope the sentencing\u2019s faster than the policy. Because we\u2019re still waiting for it to be even piloted.And that leaves hospital waiting lists.Frank Dobson ... is embarrassed.I think that says it all really.I hope Ron Davies is too.Ten thousand more people on waiting lists across Wales since the election.And hundreds of people across Wales who have been waiting over two years for treatment - in direct breach of the Government's \u2018Patient\u2019s Charter\u2019 guarantee.Yet wards are being closed.And community hospitals threatened with closure.And the Chancellor provides a Budget increase which is less than the NHS got for most of the Tory years.Let\u2019s be clear. The Chancellor\u2019s decision to respond, at last, to the calls from Liberal Democrats and others and put some extra money into education and health is very welcome.But the questions on which we will judge the Budget are these:Will it stop school class sizes growing?Will it stop hospital waiting lists rising?And the answer, I fear, in both cases, is NO.The money provided will barely even cover inflation.You see, the Chancellor has pulled a very simple trick.He\u2019s still using Tory spending levels. But inflation has risen since the Tories set those levels. On the one hand that means higher tax revenues; but on the other it means higher costs for public services. They\u2019re two sides of the same coin.Here\u2019s a quick question for you.Who said this in a Parliamentary Question?\u201cWill the Chancellor confirm that by failing to compensate for inflation there will be a real deterioration in our essential public services\u201d?No - not Malcolm Bruce. And not a Tory either - well it wouldn\u2019t be would it. No, that was the question posed from the opposition benches in the 1980s by shadow minister ... Mr Gordon Brown.Who has now has pulled off precisely the trick he complained bitterly about when Tory Chancellors did it. He has pocketed the extra tax revenue from increased inflation - all £7 billion of it - without giving public services the extra money they need.And the effect?Cuts.Across every government department. Nearly £7 billion worth, oddly enough. A huge black hole in our public finances that last week\u2019s Budget doesn\u2019t begin to respond to adequately.So waiting lists will go on rising.Community hospitals will go on closing.And problems will go on growing in the NHS throughout the year ahead.And the same for schools.At the election Labour promised to increase the proportion of our national income we spend on education. But it\u2019s falling. It fell this year. And it will fall again next year - even after the Budget changes.So class sizes will go on rising.And teachers will go on being sacked.And why? Because the Government's strategy is to starve our services of money now to pay for a huge windfall in four years time - just in time, conveniently enough, for the next General Election.But this makes no sense at all.Why does a Government committed to ending \u201cboom and bust\u201d economic policies, think it right to indulge in \u201cbust and boom\u201d funding of our public services?There is no point in saying that the creed of your Government is \u2018education, education, education\u2019 - but not until the year after next.By then the experienced teachers will have been sacked, the school playing fields sold and yet another year\u2019s intake of our children, or two, will have had their futures blighted. You can\u2019t re-run a child\u2019s education.The Government's failure to provide for our public services was one of two fundamental failings of last month\u2019s Budget.The other was doing nothing to deal with the strength of the pound.Now a strong pound might sound like a good thing. And it can be - in moderation - if industry has time to adapt and cope.But when the pound rises at the rate it has been for the last two years - and the last few months in particular - it means trouble.Trouble, most of all, for hard pressed exporters.Because a strong pound means their goods suddenly become more expensive when they try to sell them abroad.And that includes farmers - on top of all the suffering caused by the beef crisis. More than a third of sheep farming in Wales is for export.But the strong pound doesn\u2019t just hit exports, it hits sales in this country too - because it makes imports so much cheaper.So it becomes cheaper for British supermarket chains to buy their meat and their dairy produce from abroad. Which forces down the prices our farmers can get here.So lamb prices in mid Wales have slumped by 40% in just six months.And farm gate milk prices have fallen by a third in two years.So the pound needs stabilising - for the sake of farmers and manufacturers alike.The best way would have been for the Government to take the heat out of private spending. They should have done this in the Budget, or - better still - in their Budget last year.But they couldn\u2019t. Because they\u2019d made a promise - totally rashly - four months before the election - not to raise personal taxes.So it\u2019s been left to the Bank of England to act, with the only weapon they have - interest rates.But interest rates are a blunt weapon.You see, Britain\u2019s economy is split in two at the moment.The service sector is booming and urgently needs slowing down.But manufacturing industry is flagging and needs to be stimulated.Interest rates, however, hit them both the same.Think of the Bank as a doctor with two patients - one with blood pressure too high, and one with it too low - but compelled to give the same treatment to both.Now you see why the Bank\u2019s Monetary Policy Committee split 50/50 on whether to put interest rates up at its last meeting.There are some signs now that the pound\u2019s rise is slowing. I hope they\u2019re right. I hope desperately that the economy has the \u2018soft landing\u2019 we all want, rather than being tipped into recession.But the Government should be aware that, through their actions, they have made the latter more likely than it would have been - certainly for our manufacturing industry.By pursuing \u2018one club\u2019 \u2018interest rates only\u2019 economics - just as the Tories did in the early \u201880s - they have exposed our recovery to unnecessary risk, and our exporters to unnecessary pain.And all because of that rash, pre-election promise not to raise personal taxes.There is one step, though, that the Government could take tomorrow, which would lower interest rates, stabilise exchange rates, and give a real boost to our exporters.And it is staring them in the face.Come off the fence on the Single Currency.Britain has met the main criteria for monetary union.The Government should adopt, now, what is called a \u201cdeclaratory\u201d position on EMU.Set a clear target date for joining.Follow policies consistent with that aim.And announce that you are prepared to have a referendum on the principle of the Single Currency before the next election.The benefits would be substantial, and immediate.A lower, more competitive pound.Lower interest rates, helping companies borrow.Increased influence and standing for the Government in Europe, with a place at the top table now, as the rules for the Single Currency are being set.A real boost for farming. Don\u2019t just take my word for it. Listen to the NFU, because this is what they\u2019re saying too.And, especially important for areas like South Wales, a real boost to inward investment - at a time when it is desperately needed.You only have to open the newspaper to see the threat hanging over much of our inward investment.The crisis in South East Asia is showing once and for all that no country can isolate itself from serious economic failure elsewhere in the world.Already four countries have virtually ceased importing products from Britain.Look at the wobbles, just last week, of the Korean giant LG Semicon about whether or not to continue with their new £1.3 billion plant in Newport. And the similar concerns about Hyundai and Samsung elsewhere in the UK.Not to mention the report by an independent consultants last week saying that Wales alone could lose up to 70,000 jobs if inward investment from Asia dries up.But look beyond Asia too, to the doubts expressed by managers at General Motors in America, and Siemens in Germany, as well as Toyota in Japan, about investing in Britain if we stay out of the Single Currency.Here in Wales you have a great record of winning foreign investment - more than £6 billion of it over the last five years.But this success is being put at risk in future by the uncertainty the Government have created over monetary union. If we fail to participate, many multinational companies may prefer to limit their currency risks by placing production facilities within the area covered by the Euro. We will probably not lose existing plants, but we may well lose new ones.If the uncertainty goes on, the Government are set to deliver a double blow to our economy. Higher interest rates, and lower levels of foreign investment. A double whammy.And this is not only unnecessary - it is pointless.Because I am firmly convinced that events will force the Government to make their decision on the Single Currency before the next election.So my message to the Government is this.Don\u2019t wait for Rupert Murdoch. Take your decision now.Don\u2019t be led by events on Europe, like the last Government was. Lead them.And then we can all start reaping the benefits.Colleagues, we are living in historic political times.Over the next decade it is likely that we will see shifts in the political landscape to dwarf even the changes of the last. A Welsh Assembly. A Scottish Parliament. A single currency. Proportional representation. A complete reshaping of our politics.And the Liberal Democrats are the one party with the potential to come out of these reforms stronger than we went in.I believe, as Jo Grimond, David Steel and Roy Jenkins before me, that there is a natural liberal and progressive majority in this country, if only we can find the means to assemble it.Our party is stronger now than at any point in its 10 years. And stronger than any of our predecessors for more than 70.We are united. And we are strong.But our ideas are stronger still.Our agenda - from empowerment to the environment - is at the heart of the political debate today, more than we could possibly have imagined a decade ago.Our task now is to take our liberal values and set the agenda for the next century. Just as we have done for much of this.Lloyd George\u2019s creation of national insurance and the old age pension. Beveridge\u2019s welfare state and NHS. Keynes\u2019s economics. Entry into Europe in the 70s. The green agenda in the 80s. The constitutional reforms we are helping implement today.Historic successes for which our party and our predecessors have fought from government and opposition benches alike. Historic Liberal and Liberal Democrat achievements.But now we look forward to a new century - and new challenges.Forging a new settlement between the citizen and the state.Creating a welfare system that combines social justice with individual responsibility.Renewing our public services and restoring people\u2019s faith in them.Transforming our relationship with our natural environment.Stripping away our class system and build a more open, tolerant and liberal society.Building a new role for Britain and her nations in this increasingly interdependent world and especially with our sister nations in Europe.These are the challenges for our generation.Together, we can meet them.Together, we can go into the new century with new courage, new belief and a new determination.Together, we can make the difference.

aVIn our debate yesterday, we fixed our strategy for this Parliament. And now we move to the next phase. Developing our policies and sharpening our messages for the elections ahead.And an awful lot depends on getting this right. When others are trying to move onto our ground it is essential that we maintain our independence and our distinctiveness.And if we win fair votes, that distinctiveness will matter more than ever before. The clarity of what we stand for will be crucial to the number of votes we win.So our success in the years ahead will depend on our ability to think afresh - and to be radical and adventurous.And the opportunity for that has never, ever been greater.The Tory Party is still too shell shocked by defeat to think of the future. They are incapable of providing the lead that Britain needs as we make the transition from the old century to the new.And Labour, who are ditching so much they used to believe in, have yet to find any new compass to set their course by as they wrestle with the storms of government.This leaves a huge opportunity - no, a duty - for us Liberal Democrats.Many, perhaps most, of the proposals on which we have fought elections for 50 years have now become the commonplace policies of our time. Constitutional reform; positive Europeanism; an independent central bank; the importance of education; the need for new thinking on the environment. These are now established in the lexicon of modern politics and many are in the legislative programme of this Government.Even what is still called the Official Opposition is not immune from borrowing our phrases.Mr Hague now tells us he is the constructive opposition and he has even taken to talking to himself about constitutional reform.And, you know, Sir Norman Fowler has got so desperate that I thought I heard him on the Today Programme the other day trying to persuade us that the Tories are now the party of community politics!Well if you believe that you\u2019ll believe anything.Somehow, Sir Norman Fowler has never quite struck me as one of life\u2019s pavement pounders!So, it\u2019s time for us to get ahead again.To do some new thinking.To reclaim our historic role as the leaders of ideas in Britain.Some tell me this is the age of politics without ideology.They say the great \u201cisms\u201d are dead.Communism? Dead!Rampant free-market Thatcherism? The country tasted that in the 1980s. We know its price. And we have rejected it!Socialism? Mention the word in the Labour Party and Peter Mandelson will confiscate your bleeper and have you locked up in the dungeons of Millbank Tower!But there is one creed whose time, I am passionately convinced, has come again.This is again the liberal age.You will even hear Government Ministers using the word in polite company. Our wallpaper loving Lord Chancellor was heard to say not long ago: \u201cWe are all liberals now, you know.\u201d Well, not quite Derry, not quite.But seriously.There is a reason why everyone is scrambling to get onto our ground.It is because our ideas, liberal democrat ideas, are the ones that can make the best sense of the great questions that face us.There are now two great challenges which confront conventional thinking. And between them they are, quite literally, tearing apart the old politics and the old structures of the nation state.They are the globalisation of power on the one hand.And the search for individual freedom and individual choice on the other.The old creeds have nothing to say about this.Conservatism has become little more than a celebration of the nation state. Their response to the rise of global power is to return to the sad refuge of 18th century sovereignty, mixed in with some ugly modern xenophobia.And socialism is a creed of the masses. It is bewildered by the idea of personal choice. It feels threatened by the rise of individual power.But for us liberals, internationalism is our meat and drink - and individual liberty, and power and choice and freedom - these are our very purpose. They are the values from which we draw even our name itself.So, this is our ground. We own it. We have tilled this soil all down the long years of this century to produce the policies which now, I believe, underpin one of the great reforming decades of our history.So it\u2019s time to get ahead again.To take our values, now more relevant than ever, and set the new agenda for progress as we cross the threshold into the next century.There is a great project now before us.It is, quite simply, to prepare Britain for the 21st century.To forge a new settlement between the citizen and the state.To create a welfare system that combines social justice with individual responsibility.To renew our public services and restore people\u2019s faith in them.To transform our relationship with the natural environment.To strip away our class system and build a more open, tolerant and liberal society.And to build a new role for Britain, especially with our sister nations in Europe.This is the agenda on which I want to lead you through the years of this Parliament and beyond.Last month, in my Liberal Democrat News lecture, I mapped out one area where we might start this new thinking.I suggested a new relationship between tax payers and tax spenders to rebuild trust in the way we fund our public services. With more consultation, openness, decentralisation, and earmarked taxes - like a penny on income tax for education.That is one way we can move forward.Now I want to use this speech to map out another.I want to talk about unemployment.You know, for too long too many politicians across the developed world have become fatalistic about unemployment. In public they\u2019ve traded empty rhetoric about the need for jobs. In private they\u2019ve reassured each other that long dole queues are inevitable.\u201cNot much we can do really ... factor of the global economy ... jolly bad luck on those who are unemployed, of course ... but we can\u2019t go round promising people jobs you know!\u201dBut the fact is that this does not have to be like this. It is not written in stone.In the 1970s politicians thought inflation was unavoidable. They said it was necessary to oil the wheels of the economy - a kind of economic Act of God.But they were wrong. When we had to, we tamed inflation. Because we found the will.And it\u2019s the same today with jobs. We can have low inflation and low unemployment. It\u2019s not a see-saw. It\u2019s not a zero sum game. It can be done.If you\u2019re puzzled why I\u2019m raising this now, when unemployment is apparently falling, you shouldn\u2019t be.Nearly one and a half million people are on the dole in Britain today - even at the top of an economic boom. Twice as many as 20 years ago when we were at the same point in the economic cycle.And that\u2019s without counting the extra 300,000 we must add to the figures who would be considered unemployed in any other country. And the two million more who long for jobs if only they were available.And even these figures don\u2019t tell the whole story. Although the total number of unemployed has fallen in the last year, there are still 400,000 people who have been out of a job for more than a year - again, at the peak of the economic cycle. In some of the estates that I have visited over the last few months male unemployment stands at 60 per cent and well over a third of households have no-one working at all.A society which says that work is the source of dignity and self respect, threatens itself if it then consigns such a high proportion of its citizens, and especially its young, to rot in unemployment.I know. I remember. Because it\u2019s happened to me. Twice.Once when I first arrived in Yeovil in 1976. I was unemployed for six months. Then five years later, in the first Thatcher recession, when, as a manager, I had, on one terrible and unforgettable day, to shut down my division of the firm I worked for. And make all those I worked with, and myself, redundant.It was the most soul-destroying experience of my life.It is only when you don\u2019t have a job that you realise what a job can give you. Direction, focus, motivation, companionship, self-esteem. The chance to travel, to meet people, to work with others as part of a team.Unemployment excludes people. Not just from work, but from society. It takes away their stake. It robs them of their dignity.But surely, the Government's welfare to work plans will solve all this?I hope so. But I doubt it.The Government's New Deal will do a lot to give young people experience and training for work. Good! But I fear that it is not going to do much to create long-term jobs. Indeed it may actually displace some real jobs, with purely temporary ones.I do not underestimate the importance of work experience and training. Unlike most politicians, I was actually on one of these schemes, the Community Programme, when I was elected. And I remember how welcome it was.But I also remember how terrible it was to come to the end of the year and face unemployment again.So I welcome the Government's welfare to work programme. It is good - as far as it goes. It may even be a better programme of its sort than those that preceded it.But it remains an unemployment initiative. Not an employment strategy.It may help people to get into work, but I doubt it will create many new jobs for them to get into.I want us, Liberal Democrats, to start thinking much more radically about unemployment. Not just how we can fit people out for the work that is there, but also how we can create more jobs.I believe it can be done.And in this speech I will sketch out for you how I think it should be done.I want to outline an approach that builds on the real needs of the communities that make up Britain. That widens the scope of action for government, and especially local government, to meet those needs. That accepts how technology and globalisation have transformed work, but does not accept that this has to mean insecurity and hopelessness for many.But first, we must be clear what a long-term strategy to tackle unemployment does not mean.It does not mean a return to the past - to the rigidities of the regulated market, or the old nostrums of demand management.On the contrary it means dealing with the labour market as it is, not as we might like it to be.There is a revolution going on in every corner of the jobs market.The make up of the workforce is changing. More women are now in work than ever before. The number of working men is in long-term decline.The nature of work is changing too. It\u2019s becoming more skill-based, and much more knowledge-based. Intellectual capital is the new wealth, not commodities or heavy engineering or large scale manual labour. There are now more telephone sales people than there are coal miners, steel workers and car makers put together.And the way we work is changing out of all recognition too. Fewer than a third of people now work a standard \u20189 to 5\u2019 week. The number of part-time workers has doubled since 1971.These changes have brought insecurity to many. But they have brought more independence to many too - with self-employment, small business and \u2018portfolio-based\u2019 work all growing.The old divide between employee and employer is breaking down.And a new divide is appearing - between the \u2018job rich\u2019 and the \u2018job poor\u2019.On the one hand, high wage, high pressure households. Dual incomes. Longer working hours in Britain than in any other EU country.On the other, low wage or no wage households. No chance of a job with the wage or the hours to lift them out of poverty. And a benefits system that traps them there.Now, what can we do to begin really to tackle unemployment in Britain?Gordon Brown tells us that the Budget on Tuesday will be a Budget for Jobs. If it is, we shall welcome it. But we shall judge it against these key tests.Does it raise skills? Does it promote flexibility? Does it reward work? Does it create stability? Does it encourage enterprise? Does it generate jobs in the community?In the rest of this speech I shall sketch out for you a strategy for jobs based on these six key elements.A strategy that combines flexibility with fulfilment, prosperity with participation, competition with community.And which blends social cohesion with market efficiency.First, simple, and, for us, very familiar - but vitally important: skills - and education.One in eight of Britain\u2019s young adults lacks basic literacy skills. Skills they\u2019ll need for any job now.And one in ten employers can\u2019t fill a job vacancy because they can\u2019t find people with the skills they need.There can be no greater indictment of our failure to invest in education and training than that firms are held back because they can\u2019t find the skills they need, while so many are left, unskilled, condemned to unemployment.Just this week Steve Norris, a Minister in the last Tory Government, said this was something the Tories should be ashamed of. And he was absolutely right.So what do Labour ministers do about it? Well, they talk. They hold reviews. They appoint watchdogs. They set up task forces - twelve, so far, on training and education alone - each with a Government appointee to head them.Let me list just some of them.There\u2019s the Chairman of the Further Education Student Support Advisory Group. The Head of the Advisory Group for Continuing Education and Lifelong Learning. The Secretary of the Review of the Bureaucratic Burden on Teachers.But you know, it\u2019s not just in education. There are others too.Chairman of the Strategic Review of the Welsh Trunk Road Programme. The Head of the Review of the Revenue Effect of the Reduced Rate of VAT for Energy Efficient Materials and Alternative Options for Targeted Relief to Help those on Low Incomes to Save Energy.And finally, the most important job of all of the 161 reviews, task forces and quangos. Yes, you guessed it. The Chairman of the Review of Quangos!Come to think of it I suppose that is a job creation scheme all of its own.But the really important thing is, if you\u2019re going to create jobs you have to start in the classroom.So what\u2019s happening in the classroom?The fact is class sizes are at their highest for 20 years and rising.Three times as much is now spent on tests for seven year olds as on books to boost their basic skills.Fewer trainee teachers now than even 10 years ago - when Labour called it a crisis.So, teachers - sacked.School budgets - cut.Employment and training budgets - even with Labour\u2019s New Deal - cut.Further and higher education - cut.You know, it will not do to promise education, education, education - but then start with cuts, cuts and cuts.Of course, much of this is the Tory legacy. And of course, money isn\u2019t everything. But if we\u2019re going to equip our children with the skills they need to succeed then we must make the investment that our schools, our colleges and our students need, and we must make it now.As Lord Dearing said recently, if you think education is expensive, just try the alternative.That\u2019s why we have insisted, we are insisting, and we will continue to insist - this is the investment Britain has to make. It\u2019s the investment Ministers are still refusing to make, despite all their promises. And if they don\u2019t make that investment in the Budget on Tuesday, we will harry them every day of this Parliament until they do.That\u2019s why we say again this year that, since there is no other way to find that money than to put a penny extra on income tax for education, that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019d do.So that\u2019s point one of our strategy - investing in education and in skills.And here\u2019s point two. To create jobs, we need a stable economic environment which enables business to think long-term, and to plan, and to grow.And that means a much more rule based approach to economic management, to stop politicians fiddling with the economy for short term political ends.That stable economic environment means three things. Stable interest rates. Stable tax rates. Stable exchange rates.To stabilise interest rates we now at last have an Independent Central Bank - proposed by us at the election, adopted by Labour three days after it.To stabilise tax rates we must now adopt a Fiscal Responsibility Act which prevents pre-election tax bribes. And we should build on the sort of public service reforms being pioneered in New Zealand. Reforms which have made government departments more accountable to tax payers for what they do. And more focused on what they deliver.And the route to stable exchange rates, and a more competitive pound, and lower interest rates, and higher investment, is staring the Government in the face, if only they would have the courage to take it.Come off the fence on the Single Currency.Set a target date for Britain\u2019s entry into EMU. Show we\u2019re serious about it by following the policies to make that happen. And hold a referendum on the principle of the Single Currency before the next election.I despair at the Government's timidity on this. \u2018Wait and see\u2019 under the last government has been replaced by \u2018waiting for Rupert Murdoch\u2019 under this one.This is costing Britain dear in an uncompetitive pound, higher interest rates, lost inward investment and diminished influence in Europe.And I make this prediction. This Government will be forced by events to make its decision on the single currency before the next election.So I say to the Prime Minister: don\u2019t worry about Mr Murdoch. Put Britain first. The last Prime Minister was a prisoner on Europe. You should be leading on it.Now, creating stability in our economy leads to the next strand of our strategy - encouraging enterprise.Time and time again it has been in the small business and self-employment sector, that most new jobs are created.In the fragmented labour market of the future, working for yourself will be the way that more and more people take control of their economic lives, earning a living for their family and making a contribution to the well being of their community and our country.And that is a good thing. The idea of the self-reliant individual - empowered by their own abilities, beholden to no-one - is at the heart of Liberal Democrat belief. The freedom to make your own choices in life - enslaved neither by poverty, nor by ignorance, nor by pressure to conform, is a fundamental Liberal Democrat value.So that\u2019s why I want to see the Liberal Democrats become the party of small business, of self-employment and of enterprise over the years of this Parliament.And it\u2019s why promoting flexibility is a key element of our strategy for employment.The economies that will prosper in the future will be those which are flexible and light on their feet.Adaptable government, adaptable companies, adaptable workers. The biggest prizes will go to those who respond quickest to rapidly shifting demands.I want our British economy to be one in which people are able to work in flexible ways which suit their life styles in every corner, crack and crevice of our economic system.And that means a flexible labour market.But - and here\u2019s the point too many business people refuse to understand - flexibility is a two way street.It\u2019s not simply the power to hire and fire.That does not produce a flexible workforce; it produces a frightened workforce - a workforce resistant to change and fearful of risk.A truly flexible workforce is one equipped with the skills to move confidently around the marketplace, protected by a framework of basic rights against exploitation and unfair practice.This is the importance of the Social Chapter and of safeguards against low pay.But flexibility means a lot more. It also means making pensions safer and more portable, encouraging participation and profit sharing. And making sure part-time workers have the same pro rata rights as full-timers.It means making it easier for people to work in different ways to meet the changing patterns of their lives - a flexible age of retirement, portfolio working, variable hours when they\u2019re bringing up the kids.It means making it easier for people to work from where they choose - making homeworking and teleworking real options for more people.It means making it easier for people to take a break from work, and easier for them to come back too - so better use of career breaks, access to training to uprate skills in mid-career, and proper maternity and paternity leave.And, of course, it means what we should have had long, long ago in Britain. And what we must see in Tuesday\u2019s Budget. A decent, affordable, high quality, national network of childcare for all who need it.What I\u2019m talking about is a framework which gives us the choices, the freedoms and the security to make flexible work an opportunity not a threat.And if we\u2019re to achieve that we need a benefit system that rewards work rather than penalises it.It is simply ludicrous that someone on the dole actually loses out when they take a job.We\u2019ve got to cut through the tangle of overlapping thresholds, tapers, rebates and credits that leave most people as lost as the Lord Chancellor buying wallpaper at his local B&Q.Now that we are going to have a minimum wage there is, frankly, no reason why we should not give people a simple guarantee - that whatever benefits they are on, they will never be worse off in a job than out of a job.And we could go further. Why not guarantee that whatever benefit people are on they can keep at least a quarter of the extra money they earn if they go back to work.Now that would be real welfare to work.And, if Gordon Brown chooses, he could make a start on Tuesday.He could merge out-of-work benefits, like income support, with in-work benefits, like Family Credit.He could raise the tax threshold, as Liberal Democrats are committed to do, to take a million people out of income tax altogether.That is a far better way of helping the poor and encouraging work than the gimmick of a 10p tax rate.So when the Government finally produces its proposals for welfare reform, we will judge them by these yardsticks. Do they tackle poverty? Do they encourage self-reliance? And do they reward work?These then are five strands of our strategy for jobs.Investing in skills. Creating stability. Encouraging enterprise. Promoting flexibility. Rewarding work.And the sixth, is the most radical of all.Stop, for a moment. Let\u2019s come at this from an entirely different direction.Consider these facts.There are not far short of four million people who would like work.But there is no shortage of work waiting to be done.Look around you.Homeless people on our streets - but derelict and empty buildings with no-one to do them up.Elderly and disabled people desperately in need of care - but no-one to care for them.Rural villages without shops, post offices, public transport - and people lost without them.Pot holes, and broken street lamps - and no-one to repair them.Railway stations, unacceptably frightening after dark - because there\u2019s no-one to man them.Parks, unkempt and uncared for.Public spaces, dirty and dangerous.Then pay a visit to your Benefits Office, and look at the queue of people who are unemployed. And remember that each costs us £10,000 a year in benefits and lost taxes. And that\u2019s before you count the cost of the wasted lives and the economic contribution they could have been making.This is simple madness.Surely it cannot be beyond us to connect up the people who desperately need work with the work that desperately needs to be done?I spoke earlier about changes in the job market.But those changes are not uniform. Different parts of the economy are developing in quite different ways.At one end there is the \u2018competitive economy\u2019. Trading goods and services in the global market, earning Britain\u2019s prosperity. High wage, high tech, high risk, low security.At the other end there is what I shall call the \u2018community economy\u2019. Wages generally lower. Work usually more secure, and sometimes more rewarding too.Now note, this is not about the difference between the public and the private sectors. It is about two different kinds of economy - that need to be treated differently.And the biggest difference between the two is the way they deal with labour.In the competitive economy labour is a cost that has to be carefully controlled like any other.But in the community economy, labour is an asset, both to the person who has it, and for the things it can do that bring benefits to us all.You see, the community economy is a different kind of economy. Its success is measured, not in the creation of financial capital, but in the growth of social capital.But it\u2019s no less real - no less valuable for that.This is the neighbourhood and family economy which brings up children, nurtures relatives and friends, looks after older people, watches out for neighbours, and does so through hundreds of thousands of small local organisations and millions of individuals who keep the wheels of our communities turning. Everything we do, everything we care about, every business success, depends upon this economy.In the competitive economy, it is profitability which comes first - as it should. And Britain must be good at that. And, by and large, we are. This is where we earn our living in the world.But in the community economy it\u2019s people who come first. Now why can\u2019t our communities be just as successful as our companies? Because they aren\u2019t. In too many areas of Britain our communities are simply failing.So, that question again. Is it really beyond our ability to connect the millions of tasks that need to be done in our communities, with the millions of people who are desperate to do them?I believe it is not. If we can only start thinking more radically.First we have to realise that everyone who is sidelined by the market - young people, older people, disabled people - these should not be viewed merely as a cost to the state, but as underused assets with time and energy and something to offer, which we badly need if we are going to revitalise the places where we all live.Then we have to realise that those millions of things which need doing - the caring, the educating, the helping, the rebuilding - are work too, even though Labour\u2019s New Deal might define them otherwise.So here are some practical ideas. None of them just theoretical - all of them already successfully working somewhere else in the world.Why not cajole our financial institutions, and big business too, into investing in those run down neighbourhoods so many of them fail to help? That\u2019s what they\u2019ve done in the United States, with the Community Reinvestment Act. Couldn\u2019t we do it here?Why not do what they are already doing in Sweden, the Netherlands, Australia, South Africa and thirty American cities? Set up \u2018Business Improvement Districts\u2019 in which businesses vote to pay for agreed regeneration projects which they subcontract to their local council to run, improving communities and creating jobs at the same time.Why not encourage - not discourage - ideas like skill exchanges, \u2018Time Dollars\u2019 and local trading schemes - LETS - which help people without money use those assets they do have - goods, services and time - to rebuild their communities?Why not actively encourage credit unions to give people access to funds and credit - drive out the loan sharks who prey on deprived areas? That\u2019s what President Clinton is doing in the United States.All these practical ideas foster self-reliance, and support people trying to escape from poverty. And in my journeys outside Westminster these last three months I have seen how initiatives like these - and the people who make them work - are making a real difference to people\u2019s lives.I want the Liberal Democrats to become the champions of this ignored third sector, which is already doing so much but which could do much, much more.And, incidentally, I do not believe that these jobs should always, or even mainly, be done by Government - whether local or national. Far from it.I see Government in the new century, doing less and commissioning more. Setting the contracts, assuring the quality, overseeing the delivery. Government which steers more - and rows less.Indeed, I don\u2019t object at all, even to delivering core public services in this way. If we followed an entitlements approach to public services, then the job of Government would be to frame the entitlement, to fund it, to ensure equality of access for all and to assure the quality of delivery - not necessarily to deliver itself.For instance, should we really be concerned about who provides a school? So long as Government ensures that it is accessible to all and delivers education which is regularly monitored and whose standards are scrupulously maintained.This is a new approach. One in which the scope of government, especially local government, is far greater, but the range of the things they do themselves is far smaller. One which combines social action with market efficiency. One which puts the interests of the consumer before those of the producer. And which, in doing so, can increase our social capital and create jobs at the same time.And we could start right now.Here\u2019s a challenge to the Government.Why not turn your New Deal into something much more?Make it a \u2018New Deal Plus\u2019. Set up projects, initially in areas of the highest unemployment, which allow local councils, and other bodies like health trusts and voluntary groups to offer new services they\u2019d like to provide beyond their current budgets. Contractors could tender to provide these services on condition they give the jobs to one of the New Deal target groups - the young or the long-term unemployed. And the service they deliver would be closely monitored by the body that commissioned them.It won\u2019t necessarily be the cheapest option. But it could be the best value one - the most effective one. And it will create real jobs - without displacing existing ones, because these will be new jobs - outside existing budgets.This speech has been about unemployment.But it\u2019s been about much more than that as well.It has been about an end to navel gazing about strategy - and moving on to a period of new thinking and intellectual adventure.It has been about reclaiming our position as the leaders of ideas in Britain.And it has put in place some of the signposts that I hope we shall follow in that new thinking.A more rule-based approach to economic policy.A commitment to self-employment, small business and enterprise.An approach to welfare reform which rewards work and which combines social justice with self-reliance.A clear stance to provide leadership on the Single Currency.An enduring determination to invest in education and training as the corner stone of a tolerant, liberal and prosperous society.An employment market which promotes job flexibility by giving people greater personal skills and security.A new approach to government, especially local government which combines wider scope for action with the efficiency of market mechanisms.And a radically different approach to creating jobs, so that we can begin to connect the people who need the work, with the work that needs to be done.We have come a long, long way together, these last 10 years.Now we enter the most exciting phase of all.The phase which will determine Britain\u2019s politics in the next century.And our place as the gathering point for a new liberal and progressive majority which can form the dominant governing force to carry Britain into the next century.We must seize the chance now to give our country, at last, the politics it deserves.More hopeful. Less cynical.More ambitious. Less negative.More imaginative. Less traditional.More based on partnership. Less on confrontation.There is nothing we cannot achieve. Everything is possible.We must seize the chance now. To change. To experiment. To work together, instead of against each other. Everything is possible.We must seize the chance now. To achieve all we Liberal Democrats have dreamt of for so long.Strong, independent, clear in what we stand for, courageous in what we do.Everything is possible.I give you a motto for the years ahead. It is taken from the words of Theodore Roosevelt, but after 10 years of success, we are entitled to call it ours.\u201cThe greatest deeds are yet to be done and the greatest victories are yet to be won.\u201d

aVOn the wall of my office at home there is an old faded photograph. It's of my grandfather.It was taken almost exactly a hundred years ago. He has just returned from the Paris Exhibition, and has brought back the first motor car in Ireland.And there he is, sitting in it, proudly, outside his house in the little Northern Ireland hilltop town of Rathfriland.I have his diaries too. In them, he says that this thing, the motor car, will change the world.His friends tell him this is nonsense. They will only ever be toys for the rich.Sometimes, you know, our faces are pressed so close to the window pane, that we do not perceive the scale of the changes of which we are a part - or understand their significance - or see their direction.The Changes of the Last Ten YearsConsider for a moment, the world of just ten years ago, when our party was born.The Berlin Wall still in place. The Iron Curtain still impregnable. The Soviet Union still menacing.Nelson Mandela still in jail.Margaret Thatcher still going "on and on".William Hague still in short trousers.And Peter Mandelson still just a gleam in his own eye.And Tony Blair still a socialist. He had just said this."There will be few politicians standing for election next time on a platform advocating free markets."Who would have dared to predict then, that in the next few years the Berlin Wall would tumble, Germany would unite, the Soviet Union would disintegrate, and the Warsaw Pact would disappear?That the European Community of 12 would have become a Union growing towards 25?That a Single Currency would now be just 99 days away?That the prisoner of Robben Island, would be President of South Africa?That Ireland would, God willing, be on the threshold of peace?That the Tories would be swept away in the most crushing defeat in their history?That socialism would have become a dirty word - in the Labour Party?And, that the Liberal Democrats would have won so many historic victories - storming Labour's municipal stronghold of Liverpool, and capturing Tory parliamentary bastions like Kingston, Sutton, Newbury, Harrogate, and Winchester - by 21,000 votes?Who would have guessed, not ten years ago, but two, that we would, today, have won devolution for Scotland, Wales and London? That we would have taken the first steps towards a Bill of Rights? That we'd be months away from the first UK wide 'fair votes' election? And weeks away from the start of the great campaign that will give us the best chance this century of winning fair votes for Westminster, too?The changes we have seen these last ten years, and especially these last two, would have been simply inconceivable - had they not actually happened.But - and here is my point - this is not the end of change. It is the beginning.The very character of modern politics is being transformed.Now, what's driving that change?First, there is the globalisation of power.Businessmen and women who commute between continents. Multinational companies who choose where - or even if - they pay tax. Money that flies round the world so fast, the pound can be halfway down the plughole while the Chancellor's still singing in the bath.Borders are vanishing. The old limitations of geography and nation no longer apply.And there is a parallel change taking place in Britain's politics, too. The long, slow decline of the old ideologies of the masses and the classes.The end of the days when you knew what a politician would say simply from their position on the left or right. You can no longer guess how someone would vote, simply by the cut of their suit.And then there is the change in attitudes. A new assertiveness. People: better educated, more questioning of authority than ever before, and better informed too.They can watch wars live from their living rooms.They can see the Budget analysed before the Chancellor sits down.They can find out, from the Internet, about a coup in Africa before the Foreign Secretary has had a chance to read about it in his Red Box. Or, in the case of our Foreign Secretary, not read about it in his Red Box.And they can read what a Minister will say before Alistair Campbell's even told them they're going to say it.These three factors - the globalisation of power, the decline of class loyalty, and the end of deference - are putting great pressure on our antique political structures, and our antiquated political ways of thought.The Strange Rebirth of Liberal BritainOf course, to some, change will be frightening.But look for a moment at what people are rejecting.Class conflict. Elitism. Conformity. Centralism.Things our party has fought against for half a century and more.Now think what we are gaining. The new values. The 21st century values.Interdependence. Self-reliance. Openness.Liberty. Diversity. Pluralism.Liberal values every one.What we are seeing before our eyes is the strange rebirth of liberal Britain.In the words of the leading academic John Gray "Liberal ideas and values now have no serious competitors in British politics." "Liberal values have been accepted as the spirit of the age, even by those who define themselves by opposition to them."It is, as Bob Maclennan said yesterday, our fate, and our fortune, to be leading the liberal cause in Britain at a time when it has the most relevant answers to the great challenges that face us.For decades we have circled the walls of Jericho, blowing the trumpets of reform. Now, at last, the walls are coming down.If we keep our nerve.If we stay focused on the future.If we stay players on the field, not spectators from the sidelines.Then we shall be at the centre of one of the greatest periods of reform our nation has ever seen.And that means this.That we cannot set limits on the changes ahead. And we must not allow limits to be set on our ambitions either.A Liberal Agenda for a Liberal CenturySix months ago, in Southport, we set ourselves the task of becoming, once again, the pathfinders of British politics.And we've made a good start down that road.This has been a great debating conference.The kind of conference that would send a shudder through Central Office and cause apoplectic fits in Millbank Tower.But in this Party you're allowed to disagree with the leadership.And I'm pleased about that.I'm delighted about that!Now, of course, the thinking doesn't stop here. There is more, much more to be done.But we have, I believe, begun to create a new liberal agenda for the yearsahead.A liberal agenda to pave the way for a liberal century.Based around four great themes.The powerful citizen.Living in a strong community.Supported by an enabling government.Prospering in an interdependent world.And the greatest of these is the first.The powerful citizen.Individual Freedom, Not a Nanny StateIt is this idea which divides us from socialists. Because for socialists, power comes only from the masses and the classes. To the socialist, power in the hands of ordinary individuals is a threat.And it divides us from Conservatives, too. Because Conservatives think of individuals as subjects, not citizens. As consumers, not people. To be governed. To be ruled. To be bought off. For them, too, the powerful citizen is not to be trusted.You see, this is what defines us.Now I don't wish to go back over old debates. I have heard your voice.But I do want to say this.We will have nothing to say as liberals if we allow ourselves to become, like the others, mere instruments for holding the centres of power we have, instead of using these for handing on power to those we serve.We will have nothing to say as liberals if, when we have the chance to show we trust people to do things for themselves, we conclude that they cannot be trusted.Don Foster quoted Gladstone yesterday. Let me give you the full quote."Liberalism is trust of the people, tempered by prudence. Toryism is mistrust of the people, tempered by fear."Mind you, I suppose, if Gladstone was around today, he might have said New Labour was trust of the focus group, tempered by fear of Rupert Murdoch!But trust of the people means far more than talking to a few of them before you take a decision.It means letting them take a decision for themselves.Giving them the right. Letting them take the responsibility.Today we do not want men from the ministry telling us what to do.Jack Cunningham telling us we cannot eat beef on the bone.Jack Straw telling us it's time to put our kids to bed.People do not want a "nanny state".Letting Scotland's People Take Their Own DecisionsYou know, there is an extraordinary paradox at the heart of this Government. On the one hand they want to devolve power. On the other they are determined to control it from the centre.Labour has made the legislative change.But they don't seem to be able to make the mental leap.Look at Scotland. Labour sets up a Scottish Parliament. But Scottish Labour must do what London Labour tells it to.We are proud of having worked with Labour and others to set up a Scottish Parliament and a Welsh Assembly. And we want that style of co-operative politics to continue after next year's elections.But what this Government does not seem to have grasped is that devolution cannot work unless you have the courage to let the people take their own decisions.The last thing Liberal Democrats want is for Scotland to separate from the United Kingdom - and Liberal Democrats in Scotland will fight separation, tooth and nail - you can depend upon it!You know, we really should call the Scottish Nationalists the Scottish Separatists, because separatism is what they actually want.It was Tory arrogance towards Scotland that gave the Scottish Separatists the chance to be strong.And Mr Blair should take care that it is not Labour arrogance in Scotland that will give the Scottish Separatists the chance to break up the United Kingdom.The lesson for Labour is clear.If Labour will not learn to let go, then next May, Scotland will let go of Labour.So, here's the choice for Scotland next May.Alex Salmond and the Scottish separatists who want the Scottish Parliament to fail.The Labour Party, who want to run the Scottish Parliament from London.The Tory Party who wanted the Scottish Parliament never to exist in the first place.Or the Liberal Democrats, who have been fighting for a Scottish Parliament for over 100 years. We helped to make it happen. Now we want to make it a success.You see, the reform of our constitution to empower our people is not an optional extra for a modern Britain. It is the essential foundation stone upon which a modern Britain must be built.Let me make this absolutely clear. Our work with the Government on the Cabinet Committee is about a programme.It's not about picking and choosing.The historic Cook/Maclennan Agreement before the election is a set of proposals which can only work effectively if they work as a whole.So, there can be no backsliding on Lords reform. What place is there in a 21st century Parliament for people with 15th century titles upholding 19th century prejudices?And there can be no diversion from the final destination. An upper house based not on patronage, but on democracy.And there can be no watering down of Freedom of Information either. Some in Labour say they want to see a much weaker Freedom of Information Bill. Well, in the immortal words of Mandy Rice-Davies, "they would say that, wouldn't they"?But let me place this on record.A full and undiluted Freedom of Information Bill could have been published by now.It should be published without delay.And it ought to be enacted in next year's session.Anything less will not just damage our work in the Cabinet Committee, it will also fatally undermine public confidence in Labour's commitment to open government.So the events of the next few weeks will determine the future of our project, with Labour, to give Britain a modern Constitution.Winning Fair VotesAnd no event more so than Roy Jenkins' report on electoral reform.Roy has already done more than any other single person to break the mould of British politics. And his report will be of historic importance for the better government of Britain.For most of us, this is an opportunity we have been working for for all our political lives. To make our Parliament more representative of our people. To extend choice, and to rebuild trust in politics. To force politicians to listen to what people want.Fair votes for Britain. A new voting system for a new century.And remember, the key agreement we won in Cook/Maclennan was that this decision will be taken not by the parties, not by the politicians, but by the British people. It is their consent we have to win. And winning their agreement will depend less on having a system of PR which is mathematically perfect, than on having one which responds to their concerns, and maximises what they want.But before the British people give their opinion, Mr Blair must give his.So let me say something very directly to the Prime Minister.We have disagreed, sometimes strongly, about properly funded health and education. And on other things too.But your Government has done some very good things.Peace in Ireland, devolution for Scotland and Wales, a Bill of Rights for Britain, an independent Central Bank - these are considerable achievements.You have honoured, when many said you didn't need to, commitments you made on constitutional change before the election. And I respect you for that.But I have one great question about you.Are you a pluralist?Or are you a control freak?Your language tells me you're the first. But so many of your Government's actions tell me you're the second.Your Government could become, potentially, a historic one.But only if it lets go a little, if it relaxes a little, if it tolerates dissent a little, if it welcomes diversity a little, and if it interferes a little ... less.You miss the mood of the age if you believe that this is a new era of control. You have said you do not want this to be a Britain in which only the Red Rose of New Labour is allowed to grow. Fine - then let it be a nation in which a thousand flowers are allowed to bloom.So, Blair the pluralist? Or Blair the control freak? Your decision on fair votes will tell us which.It will reveal what kind of Government yours will be.It will determine the future course of our work together.And it will tell us what kind of country you want Britain to be.Giving People Power Over How Their Taxes Are UsedYou see, Fair Votes is about spreading political power.It is necessary to the creation of the powerful citizen, but it is not sufficient.Truly powerful citizens must have economic power too - power not just over how their votes are used, but also over how their taxes are spent.Let me give you an example.Budget Day.An ancient, outworn, tradition, that simply cannot be justified. We are kept in the dark for months. And then, one Tuesday afternoon ... Hey Presto! The Chancellor appears before us as conjurer.Gordon Brown as Tommy Cooper. Magicking our future out of thin air. Just like that!It may be great theatre. But it's rotten government.We have to open up the Budget process, and find new ways to reconnect the taxes people pay with the services that flow from them. With more use of earmarked taxes - like our penny on income tax for education. Taxes raised at the same level of government as they are spent. Spending decisions taken at the lowest practical level.And we need new ways of extending openness and accountability within government too.You know, Westminster has been quick enough, these last ten years, to impose performance targets on everyone else: teachers, doctors, nurses, almost every worker in the public sector.Fine. We agree. Quality in public services means focusing on what they achieve, not on what they spend.But if that is to apply to everyone else, then why not to Whitehall, too?Why should we not have performance targets for Government as well? Why should those who pay taxes not know how their money is spent, how efficiently it's spent and whether the Government has spent it where they said they would?And that's exactly what the Liberal Democrats would do.Nationally AND locally.Every year, every Government Minister, and every chair of every council committee, would publish a performance contract - a Service Delivery Agreement. It would state what they and their senior public servants commit to do in the year to come. How much class sizes will be reduced?How many 3 year olds will receive pre-school education? What level waiting times should come down to?And we'd combine the National Audit Office and the Audit Commission, into a single powerful body, acting as a watchdog for the tax payer. And every year they'd publish a report on the Government's performance measured against their targets and how efficiently they've spent their - no, our - money.No more vague and undeliverable promises, made at elections and forgotten straight afterwards.A whole new climate of enterprise and innovation in the public sector.A new responsiveness to the needs and priorities of the citizen.Utopian?No. The Government are slowly stumbling down this path themselves.Gordon Brown seems to understand the need for contracts, too.But once again, Labour have got the right idea, but drawn the wrong conclusion.Gordon Brown wants contracts which make ministers responsible to him and the Treasury.We want contracts to make them responsible to Parliament and the people.It's not always easy for New Labour. So many changes! I could almost sympathise with them.Just consider the case of Mr Iain Coleman, the new Labour MP for Hammersmith and Fulham.Now, it could not be said that Mr Coleman thus far has made a major impact on the public mind. Indeed, before the incident I am about to relate to you, his most notable act was to allow himself to be set on fire by a fellow new Labour MP.Who said: "Iain bet me a hundred sovs that I wouldn't set him alight - so I got my lighter out."His defence to the Sergeant at Arms was, you might think, a unique one. He claimed that setting fire to a Member of Parliament was one of our ancient rights and privileges.Well, thank goodness for that!Anyway, to continue with the story.Mr Coleman had a parliamentary aide who recently resigned - who can blame him?He left behind a helpful note for his successor. Which, I think you will agree, gives you a fascinating insight into New Labour's fraternal views about its members.Let me read it to you."As you are probably aware" he wrote, "most active members of the Labour Party are social misfits, rejects of society or mentally ill.""They will ring up and assume that anyone who is in the office runs the Hammersmith and Fulham Labour Party. The best way to deal with these people is suggest they leave a message on the party's Ansafone downstairs for Sue and she will deal with it."Good old Sue!And what was Labour's official response to this view of their members?They said they were aghast ... at his frankness!Now perhaps I'm being a bit unkind to Labour in this speech. But I have to tell you. I spent a long time trying to find things to say about the Tories. But I just simply couldn't. They are just so irrelevant.But I want to stop this talk going around the press gallery, that we haven't spent enough time talking about the Tories at this conference. It's absolutely untrue! We spent half an hour on Monday discussing how to improve funeral services.So we can leave the Tories lost in their internal civil war.We are clear of our route map to a Britain of powerful citizens.Individual choice and freedom, not a 'nanny state'.Constitutional change, to give people power over their politicians.A new contract between tax payer and tax spender.Personal empowerment. Political empowerment. Economic empowerment.Enough?No.Building Strong CommunitiesNo individual, however powerful, can exist alone. We need a context for our lives which enables us to understand our rights and recognise our responsibilities. A context which acts as a forum for common action. That supports us and enables us to support others.Which is why we need strong communities.And, that's why, more than ever, Britain now needs energetic, innovative local government.In the words of John Stuart Mill, "It is but a small portion of the public business of a country which can be well done, or safely attempted, by the central authorities".I agree.Councils should have greater powers to act on behalf of those they serve, especially to improve education, and health services, as we have advocated this week. And they should get the freedom to raise far more of their funds locally. So they cease to be merely central government's land agents and become instead free, innovative players in their own right, the embodiment of the communities which they represent.I want to see councils become centres of innovation.That's our vision.Compare that with the meagre reforms in the Government's recent white paper on local government, which may be well-motivated, but are so unambitious and so hopelessly over-prescriptive.Once again the Government's message is "modernise, but only on our terms".So here's a challenge for all my Liberal Democrat colleagues in local government.We have, at this conference, agreed to introduce this new idea of Service Delivery Agreements and performance measurement for government.Why not start by introducing this radical new approach to government in the local councils we control.That's one way we can begin to rebuild trust in local government - trust that has been so tragically lost because of the scandals in so many Labour and Tory authorities.Mr Blair says Britain's rotten boroughs must be cleaned up. We agree.Doncaster. Westminster. Paisley. Islington. Glasgow. Sheffield. Hackney. Hull.These councils, most of them Labour, have shamed local government, and have shamed our democracy.But if Labour really want to clean up local government, then the means to do it is staring them in the face. They should have done it already. They can do it simply. They must do it now. The way to clean up local government is to introduce fair votes.And incidentally, as we know, the most successful local authorities are not those that try to do everything themselves but those that succeed in building effective partnerships with the people they serve.Developing Community PoliticsLet me give you an example.A triumphant lesson in the community politics we invented.Do you remember the Beatles song, Penny Lane?Well there is a real Penny Lane. It's in Liverpool, and it's where the very first Focus leaflets first began. And in the real Penny Lane there are some local playing fields, which were used by some of England's best footballers, like Robbie Fowler and Steve McManaman, when they were kids.And guess what? Liverpool's Labour council were going to sell these playing fields off to the developers.But, this May, Liberal Democrats won control of Liverpool, and we saved Penny Lane playing fields. And, because we Liberal Democrats believe local people can do a far better job of looking after their own assets than the council ever did - or could - we gave them to a community trust - run and owned by Penny Lane people.You see, it's just common sense. After all, who's going to look after playing fields best? The people who use them.And how do you make playing fields a real community asset? You give them to the community so that they actually own them.You see in Liverpool we've given people back control of their green spaces.And now Liverpool are keen to do the same with their schools.Now we debated the issue of neighbourhood schools yesterday.Speaker after speaker said they agreed with the principle of giving more power to people. What they questioned were the practicalities involved.Fair enough.Perhaps we didn't leave enough time for consultation and explanation.So the proposal we debated yesterday will not be in our programme for next year's elections.But our colleagues running Liverpool, with all that experience and enthusiasm for devolving power to local communities, want to look again at this, consider all the practicalities involved. And report back to us.And if their experience shows that this can work, we'll bring it back to you for full consultation and debate. And if it doesn't, we won't.You see, it's practicalities, not ideologies, that matter to us.Enabling GovernmentThe practicalities of providing enabling government.Separating the job of "governing" from the job of "doing".Active Government. But active in enabling citizens, not in interfering in their lives.Government that acts as partner, not master.Government that rows less and steers more.Our structures of government in Britain, local and national, are, frankly, left over relics of a past industrial age. Large, monolithic, hierarchical.Do you realise that the size of central government today is bigger than when we governed half the world, 60 years ago?And, you will remember, more recently, under the Tories, Whitehall hived off around a third of all it does to privatised utilities and arms length agencies.So, has this resulted in fewer ministers? No, it's resulted in more.And, during this Parliament, we will devolve much more of what we do to Scotland and Wales. And a good thing, too!But, do we plan to reduce the number of MPs at Westminster?No. Not even by a single one!We, Whitehall and Westminster, have spent the last two decades telling everyone else in the public service that they must do more with less.But we are now doing less, with more.No wonder the public doesn't trust us!Well, we Liberal Democrats believe it is perfectly possible for the House of Commons to run just as effectively with 150 fewer MPs.And I can name them!I've got a little list.Peter Lilley's on my list.Portillo's not been missed.Michael Howard's on the list.Lots of Tories on my list.Red Ken's not on my list.But then he's on Tony's list.They'll none of them be missed!They'll none of them be missed!And talking about people losing their jobs, there is something I want to say to you about retirement.Tackling Poverty in Work and RetirementOur new pension proposals are a shining example of government helping people to do things for themselves. Offering choice through the private sector. Encouraging self reliance and rewarding those who can make their own provision for old age, while supporting more effectively those who cannot.Remember the Government saying it would "think the unthinkable"? Well, we thunk it - they flunked it!Time has now run out. The Government can't get away with just changing ministers any longer - they have to start changing policies. The pensions green paper this autumn will be a crucial test.Liberal Democrats are clear about what we want to see. We want to give people more control over their pensions. But we accept that while most can make provision for their later lives, some cannot.So yes, that does mean redistribution as well. And, unlike Labour, we do not shy away from the word.Some of the poorest people in this country are the oldest pensioners. And we're going to raise their pensions by over two hundred and fifty pounds a year for the over 80s, and over a hundred and fifty pounds a year for those over seventy-five.That's practical help for the most needy.And we are prepared to change our tax system to help those in work, and on the lowest incomes. There is something badly wrong with a system which taxes even those on the minimum wage.Well, we'll do something about that.And we'll shift tax away from earnings and jobs, and onto pollution and the use of finite raw materials. Taxing the things we don't want rather than the things we do.Now what would that enable us to do? With that, and closing tax loopholes, we can take those earning less than ten thousand pounds a year out of income tax altogether. And give millions of people new incentives to work.There you are. More practical action from the Liberal Democrats. To save the environment. And tackle poverty.So far, I've been talking about the Liberal Democrat vision for Britain .The powerful citizen, living in a strong community, backed by an enabling government.These are necessary for a Britain in which the talents of people can flower.But they are not, in themselves, sufficient.The Interdependent WorldFor we are no longer an island.We are living in an increasingly interdependent world.We've had a glorious, sunny week here in Brighton. As we sit here, secure in this hall, it is very difficult to imagine that just two hours flight from here, there are, perhaps 100,000 people, mostly women and children, and the elderly, who have been driven by the Serbs from their homes to live without shelter in the forests of Kosovo. And the first winter snows are only weeks away.A human tragedy of terrible proportions is about to unfold.Not in far away Africa, but here on our continent of Europe. But there's been almost no attention paid to it. That's one of the reasons why I've decided to go there tomorrow.But here's the point.Here we are once again. Another crisis on our own doorstep, in our own continent of Europe. Yet the European response has been, once again, hopelessly inadequate.Just as in Bosnia, where the US had to bail out Europe's failure, and a European peace accord was signed not in London, or in Paris, or in Bonn, but in Dayton ... Ohio.Sooner or later, we Europeans are going to have to wake up to the fact that we cannot continue to expect Uncle Sam to bail us out every time there's trouble in our own back yard.Sooner or later we are going to find that our interests and those of our friends in the United States do not always coincide.Ming Campbell warned the Government what would happen in Kosovo five months ago. He and I were told by the Government in July that President Milosevic would be stopped. But he hasn't been. He continues his brutality. He continues his ethnic cleansing. The Balkans stand once again on the threshold of war.The international community, led by the West, must say to President Milosevic: STOP. Or we will use air power to stop you!Give free passage to the United Nations humanitarian organisations, especially to reach the refugees in those forests.Recognise that the problem of Kosovo is a regional one, that can only be solved with a regional solution.And agree to start peace talks now under the chairmanship of the international community.Crisis in Kosovo. Chaos in Russia. Financial collapse in the Pacific Rim. Of course each of these involves human tragedies which reach out to our conscience and imagination. But each of these also has the potential to reach out and threaten our security and our prosperity.This remains a dangerous world.So what to do? How to act?Taking a lead in EuropeThe truth is, that to be effective in today's world we have got to get our act together here in Europe. Sadly we have, once again, a Government which, rather than leading on Europe, is being led by events on Europe - or even worse, waits for a lead from the press barons.Last year the Prime Minister told us: "We cannot shape Europe unless we matter in Europe."Quite so - but without British involvement in the Euro, we will matter less and less in Europe.This is not the moment to be marginalised. Nor is it the moment to hide behind business. Urging captains of industry to go over the top first, to be mown down by the Sun and the Sunday Telegraph.Nor is it the time to ask everyone else to pick up the bill for the Government's own lack of resolution. Exporters punished by the high pound. Companies threatened by high interest rates. Jobs destroyed by both!While Britain looks for leadership, this Government seems to be following the leadership style of Gilbert and Sullivan's Duke of Plaza-Toro.Remember him?"In enterprise of martial kind,When there was any fighting,He led his regiment from behind,He found it less exciting."The policy of our Government on Europe seems to be to dare only to delay, to decide only to defer, to commit only to be uncommitted.So I say again: This Government will be forced by events to act on Europe, to commit themselves to entering the Euro, and to hold a referendum sooner than they think, probably before the next election.But it's not only the UK that must change its ways on Europe. The European Union must change its ways, too. If it does not the historic opportunity to enlarge Europe to the east could be lost, and at the same time the dangerous gulf between Europe's political elite and Europe's people could widen even further.The old tangle of opaque regulations and fudged treaties may have served us well enough up to now. But the benefits of these careful ambiguities no longer match the problems they create. Fears of conspiracy, and of erosion of national identity, however unjustified, are rife.It's time to grasp the nettle.To draw up a Constitution for Europe, which limits the powers of Europe's institutions. Clarifies the relationship between the centre and the member states. Guarantees the rights of European citizens. And boosts the Union's transparency and accountability.This is our chance to reinvent Europe, from the bottom up. And let's start by removing some of the absolute absurdities that can come from Brussels.Let me give you an example.Across Britain there are many shopkeepers who put pounds and ounces on the food they sell, alongside the weight in grammes and kilos. Not because they're wedded to the past, but to help their customers - the elderly especially. But, do you know, from the end of next year Europe has decided they will be banned from doing this. It will be a criminal offence. A criminal offence!They will not be allowed to use any other measurement except the official European one, even if it helps their customers. This is farcical! It is, almost certainly, an infringement of freedom of speech, and quite probably a breach of the European Convention on Human Rights.And in our European campaign next year, we will campaign to get this and other similar lunacies removed.There is something ludicrously wrong with a European Union which can bring the full weight of the law down on a greengrocer who tries to help his customers, yet sits helplessly by while its continent erupts in bloodshed.You see, we are friends of Europe - and we are proud to be. But we are candid friends.We are pro-Europe - and we are proud to be. But we are clear about its limits and firm on its failings.And determined to put them right.So, when it comes to next years European elections, a vote for the Liberal Democrats is a vote for the only party committed to Europe and to reforming Europe.It will be quite simply the strongest vote you can make.Our Strength, Our OpportunityNow right at the beginning, I started this speech by saying that we are living in a period of profound change.For some, that change will be a threat. For us, it's an opportunity. An opportunity to unlock the potential of every individual and to rekindle our lost sense of community.There's been talk in some circles of a third way in politics. It's good to know that others are groping for the path of liberalism that we've been following for so long. At this conference we have taken many more long confident steps along that path.That the other parties will follow us, I have no doubt. But they cannot catch us because they are still too weighed down with their old ideological baggage.We've come equipped for the journey. We know the terrain. And we know our destination.So now, we must bring all our skill, all our strength, all our determination, to bear, in order to use this moment of unique opportunity, so that the days ahead can determine the decades to come.And we can do it. For in the last ten years we have fought our way back to the very centre of British politics.I have talked about the unimaginable changes around us in these past ten years - but the change of which I am personally most proud is the transformation of our Party and of our political prospects.The dominant agenda of ideas - the powerful citizen, the strong community, enabling government - is ours.Unprecedented electoral strength, is ours.And so, today, we have arrived at the very threshold of an historic achievement.If there is one thing I now ask of you and which I shall demand of myself in these vital days, it is this.To have the self-confidence.To show the daring.To take the risks.Which alone can win the prize.

aVIt\u2019s been a busy week. You might have noticed!Welcome to J-Day, plus two.Or alternatively, the year zero, AJ. After Jenkins.We should be clear: Thursday was a defining day in British politics.The Report of the Jenkins Commission is not simply about changing our voting system. It is about changing our country.It is also, as it happens, a rattling good read. Really!Which isn\u2019t what you\u2019d expect from a 90 page paper on PR.But you know Roy - never dull!The whole Report is marvellously full of great images - what I like to call \u2018Royisms\u2019.\u201cVote heavy beasts\u201d with different numbers on their backs, \u201crather like prize bulls at an agricultural show\u201d is, for instance, the prospect conjured up when considering the \u2018Weighted\u2019 Vote.German unification is the \u201cawkward and ill-prepared dish of East Germany\u201d being digested \u201cby the great boa-constrictor of the West German economy.\u201dThe endless choices offered by STV resemble, according to the Report, \u201ca caricature of an over-zealous American breakfast waiter\u201d insistent on offering more choices than people want.And my personal favourite, the Labour Party, \u201cafter many thirsty years\u201d, having \u201ca cornucopia of luscious psephological fruit emptied over its head\u201d at the last election.I can thoroughly recommend it to you.£10.30 from all good book stores.Less than a good bottle of claret ... by some distance.But very, very valuable for the country.Take a step back from this week\u2019s events and think for a moment about the qualities we want our society to have.We want it to be open - open to new ideas, and tolerant of alternative views.We want the citizens within it to be empowered - through new choices and new opportunities.We want it to be inclusive, reaching out to the poor, the weak and the marginalised.We want it to have stability, so business can plan, and long-term concerns like the environment get the priority they deserve.And we want the kind of society where teamwork and co-operation are cherished and rewarded, and where government is sought through consent not confrontation.This is the kind of society I want to live in. Not a \u2018divide and rule\u2019 society. But an inclusive society, a pluralist society, a \u2018one-nation\u2019 society.This is why I came into politics - to achieve these things. And I suspect it\u2019s why most of you came into politics too.And this is why we Liberal Democrats prize constitutional reform so highly.Because we recognise that constitutional reform, and especially voting reform, is not something additional - not an optional extra for a modern Britain. It is the very foundation stone upon which a modern Britain must be built.It is our political system that sets the rules and provides the context for every other aspect of our society.If our politics screens out alternative or minority views.Then how can that not impede diversity in the rest of society?If our political system is designed to produce and exaggerate confrontation.Then how much harder does that make it to heal the divisions in society?If our other political institutions lack the power or the legitimacy or the will to hold Government to account.Then how can that not lead to a dangerous centralisation of power?And if the reasons for decisions taken in the name of the people are hidden from those very people.Then why should we be surprised if cynicism and disillusionment dominate our political culture?This is why we have fought, and go on fighting, for Freedom of Information in Government.For a written constitution to control the power of the state.For reform of Parliament, so it can better hold the Government to account.This is why we have fought for devolution, to the nations and regions and communities of the United Kingdom.And this is why we fight for fair votes.We know that changing the nature of our political system is the key to changing our society. And we understand that fair votes is the key to changing the nature of our political system.Think about our current voting system, the \u2018first past the post\u2019 voting system.First, it limits choice. It tries to force everybody neatly into two camps. Those who will not, or cannot, join either are marginalised.Those who do are pushed by the system into conflict.Second, it is unrepresentative. It exaggerates the support of big parties and discounts supporters of smaller ones. It provides not for majority government but for government of a minority, with untrammelled power.And not always the biggest minority. Those Labour MPs still high on the glory of last year\u2019s landslide would do well to remember the lessons of their other landslide victory, in 1945.Six years later, Labour won what remains their record ever share of the vote - higher than \u201845, far higher than \u201897, and 230,000 votes above what the Tories got in the same election. But they lost. The Tories got 26 more seats, won a majority and stayed in power for 13 years - under First Past the Post.And now the system has an inbuilt Labour bias. The pundits all agree that for the Tories to even get the same number of seats as Labour at the last election, they\u2019d have had to be six and a half percentage points ahead of them. Because Labour\u2019s votes are in the right places and the Tories aren\u2019t. It\u2019s a farce!So First Past the Post is unreliable, and it is unstable. It turns small changes in public opinion into dramatic electoral swings and radical changes in Government. A pro-Europe Government can be replaced overnight with an anti-European one, an interventionist Government with a free market one, simply because a handful of votes, often as little as five per cent, have changed hands.That\u2019s why General Election campaigns ignore 95 per cent of voters and concentrate on 5 per cent in the few marginal constituencies that determine the outcome.This instability means businesses suffer and economic growth is lower. And because it\u2019s easier to swing an election at the last minute with so very few votes changing hands, politicians are encouraged to concentrate on manipulating short-term public opinion, rather than developing long-term policies.And standing here in Hartlepool, in a county where every MP is from the same party, reminds me of another of the great faults of our current voting system. It polarises the country. North and south. Town and countryside. England and not-England.Even in May last year, in their greatest ever election victory, Labour won no seats at all in a number of English counties. In Surrey, for example, 130,000 people voted Labour and elected nobody.In Cumbria 500 fewer people voted Labour and elected four Labour MPs.The system lacks consistency. In the county of the West Midlands 148,000 people voted Liberal Democrat last year. In Kent, 145,000. But these votes elected nobody. In Powys, less than a quarter of either of those totals won us both seats.But it is the Conservatives who have seen their representation most polarised by our electoral system. Wiped out in Scotland. Wiped out in Wales. Wiped out in Sheffield, Bristol, Liverpool, Manchester, Leeds, Newcastle - almost all of our great cities.The 300,000 Welsh Tories elected no MPs. The 500,000 Scottish Tories elected no MPs. The 260,000 Tories in the North East elected one MP. The 160,000 Tories in Dorset elected 8.This has a huge impact on the focus of political parties. When so many of the Tories\u2019 MPs come from the south of England is it any surprise they have become so out of touch with feeling in the north, and in Scotland and Wales? Is it any surprise they were so unresponsive when they were in power to the legitimate demands for power to be devolved?And is it any surprise now, when more than half of the Tories\u2019 MPs are from the south eastern corner of England, that they get so excited about the idea of an English Parliament - presumably based in London - but ignore the far greater demands for an Assembly for the North East.Where parties are already strong, first past the post makes them stronger. Where they are weak it removes them from the scene altogether. It creates monoliths. Tory Surrey. Labour Tyneside. As if there was no other view.The new system recommended this week by the Jenkins Commission would end that. It would break the Tory monopoly in Surrey. It would break the Labour stranglehold in the North East. Across Britain it would bring alternative voices into the old one party fiefdoms.Now, the system proposed is not perfect. Of course we\u2019d have preferred STV. But Jenkins is far better than our present corrupt system of election. It offers us, for the first time, the chance for British politics to break out from the prison of First Past the Post.And by reaching out to the concerns of those who value the link between an individual MP and their constituents, the Jenkins Commission have created the potential for a huge alliance of support for change, stretching well beyond our party and the traditional enthusiasts for reform and taking in a wide section of the Labour Party, many independent observers and commentators, and even some within the Conservative Party.The value of assembling a coalition of this breadth should not be underestimated. The task is to win the backing of the British people for change. And the greater the alliance that is built, the greater the chances of success.But be warned. Our opponents will throw everything they have at us. You only had to listen to the Tories at their Conference to realise that.\u201cThe future of our democracy is at stake.\u201d\u201cIn terms of our constitution ... it could hardly be more dangerous.\u201dSound familiar? Yup. It\u2019s just what they said about the Scottish Parliament. And the Welsh Assembly. And fair votes for the European Parliament. And reform of the House of Lords. And the establishment of the welfare state in 1946. And Lloyd George\u2019s old age pensions in 1906. And the Great Reform Act in 1832.And I bet you there was some old Tory grumbling away on the edge of Runnymede Island, saying just the same things when King John signed the Magna Carta in 1215!Incidentally, I think the quote of the week on the Jenkins Report - leaving aside Roy\u2019s own, of course - was from Alan Beith when he pointed out that Liam Fox, the man the Tories have to put forward to speak for Scotland and Wales because they have no MPs in either, as the nearest thing provided by our current system as to a top up member for Scotland and Wales! He just has to speak for the 800,000 Scots and Welsh Tories from his seat in Somerset!So we should remember, at every turn, why it is we seek change - for the better government of our country, for greater choice for the electorate, for the empowerment of our people, for the improvement of our democracy, and for the benefit of our society.The year ahead will be among the most challenging our party has yet faced. The first elections for the Scottish Parliament. The first for the Welsh Assembly. Elections for around half of all local councillors. And, of course, the European Elections in June.The new voting system for the European elections offers us a tremendous opportunity to greatly boost our representation in the European Parliament. But it also means we will be judged by new criteria. If we fail there will be no excuses.We have to be better prepared for these elections than we have ever been before.We can be optimistic. We have a tremendous team of candidates in place, and your Northern team, led by Chris Foote-Wood, are among the best. And every week there is more evidence to make it clear we are the only party with a credible policy on Europe.Every week Labour\u2019s dithering goes on over the Single Currency, and our businesses go on suffering. Don\u2019t just take it from me. That\u2019s what our Trade Secretary and your local MP here in Hartlepool said after his recent visit to the United States, when he identified the \u2018dangerous talk\u2019 about Britain losing interest in Europe, which is causing business leaders across the world to think twice before investing here.And every week too, it becomes clearer that Conservative policy on Europe is in the grip of the \u2018little Englanders\u2019. And don\u2019t just take it from me. Listen to these words, spoken by someone who has been fighting elections for the Conservative Party for 32 years.\u201cI originally joined the Conservative party because it was committed to playing a constructive role in Europe. But William Hague has shown that he is determined to redefine Conservatism as being hostile to Europe.\u201d\u201cFollowing the outcome of the Conservative Party\u2019s ballot on EMU, I have resigned from the Conservative Party and joined the Liberal Democrats ... the only major British political party that is truly committed to a positive relationship with Europe.\u201dThe words of James Moorhouse, a Conservative MEP for the past 19 years. Someone who has had to work with our partners in Europe through the worst excesses and tantrums of Margaret Thatcher. But he persevered. And through the Tory civil war of the Major era, he persevered. But it is now, with Hague at the helm and Michael Howard navigating that he has just given up on them.Just as Emma Nicholson did. And Hugh Dykes. And Peter Thurnham. And Lord Thomas. And Arthur and Susan Bell, who used to lead the moderate Tories in Scotland. And Peter Price, after 15 years as a Conservative MEP. And Keith Raffan, who was a Conservative MP in Wales in the days when they had them. And Anna McCurley, who was a Conservative MP in Scotland in the days when they had them.115 years of parliamentary experience representing the Conservatives. Now given up on them. Now putting their faith in the Liberal Democrats. And putting their hearts into the Liberal Democrat campaign for Europe.Because they know that the Liberal Democrat way is the best way for Europe to move forward.Because moving Europe forward will help move Britain and the British economy forward.The service sector may still be growing, but manufacturing stands on the brink of recession, and agriculture is up to its neck in it. Three hundred manufacturing jobs are being lost every day, many of them here in the north east, but while industry burns the Government just fiddle a tune of indifference, as if there was nothing they could do about it.They play the blame game.The Chancellor blames the foreigners. The Trade Secretary blames the workers. The Chief Secretary blames the opposition.Well, instead of playing the blame game, it\u2019s time for the Government to face up to what they can do.They can make a clear commitment to the single European currency, which would help the level of the pound.They can provide help for our stricken farming industry, to get it through its worst crisis in 50 years, starting by claiming the EU aid package for farmers that Britain is still refusing.They can commit themselves to a fiscal package in their next Budget which helps rather than hinders the rebalancing of our economy and the cutting of interest rates. (And if that means delaying the much trailed 10p tax rate, so be it.)And they can, by strengthening Regional Development Agencies, and enabling the creation of Regional Assemblies, provide more ways for the regions of England to respond to their differing economic situations.Four things the Government could do. Four things they could commit themselves to now, to help those whose livelihoods are being threatened.This is not just about economics. This is also about getting the right form of government.Which is why I take this opportunity to wish you success with the planned North East Constitutional Convention, to be launched in the new year, I understand, bringing together Liberal Democrats, Labour, the church, trade unions and other organisations in the region to push for a Regional Assembly for the North East.Just as the Constitutional Convention in Scotland paved the way so successfully for the Parliament there, your North East Convention can play a vital role blazing a trail for Regional Assemblies in England, wherever people want them. There is too much political power being hoarded in the corridors of Westminster and Whitehall when it should be being exercised in the towns, cities and regions of our country.And let this serve as another reminder, that however fiercely we may compete with others at election time, and however strongly we may criticise them when we disagree, where we agree we are prepared to work with others, campaign with others, and fight with others - for devolution, for the Single Currency, for fair votes.This week has been a crucial staging post in what could be a great decade of reform.The challenges of the next few years will be formidable.They will test us to the limit.But if we have the confidence, the commitment and the spirit to succeed then the prizes we can win for our country will make it all worthwhile.The battle starts here.Good luck, and good campaigning.

aVNow we have work to do - and a campaign to win.And that\u2019s what this speech is all about.SNAPSHOTS FROM A NEW WORLDBut I want to start by standing back a little.By painting for you two pictures, from quite different visits I made last year. Visits separated by a thousand miles. But with, you will find, a surprising, connection.The first was to the Braunstone Estate in Leicester.Like too many estates in our cities it was run down and neglected. Houses dilapidated almost beyond repair. Walls too far gone to decorate. Rotten windows. Leaking roofs.These were not empty buildings.They were people\u2019s homes.But here is the important bit.The houses may have been rotten.But the people certainly weren\u2019t.After years of neglect, they decided they had had enough.No, they didn\u2019t petition the Government. Or march on the council.They took power into their own hands.They drew up their own plans for the regeneration of their estate. And they put forward their own bid for the funds to carry it out. Their aim was nothing less than a fully community-run project, with power not in the Council Chamber but in the hands of the community. And they succeeded.Now here\u2019s the second picture. It is totally different \u2013 and it comes from the other side of our continent, a thousand miles away.After our autumn Conference last year, you may remember, I went straight to Kosovo.And what I saw was barbarism on a grand scale. The Serbs using the weapons of total war against defenceless Albanian villages.But this speech is not about what needs to be done in Kosovo. That\u2019s for another time.I want to tell you instead about two seemingly unconnected things which caught my eye amid the mayhem.The first was the freshly dug graves in every village. And the second the satellite dishes on the walls of every house.Now, what struck me was this.That while the graves, according to Muslim tradition, pointed at Mecca; the satellite dishes pointed at Murdoch.And I fell to thinking, which of these two facts will influence these people most in the future?The way that their tradition requires them to bury their dead? Or the way that the living get their news, their information, their entertainment.What I was seeing was how a thousand years of tradition and identity is being eroded by just ten years of global technology.For me, these two different images, the Midlands estate and the Kosovan villages, illustrate what\u2019s happening in today\u2019s world more powerfully than a dozen green papers or a hundred Westminster speeches.The first, shows how, even in one of Britain\u2019s most deprived communities, people are solving their problems by taking power for themselves.The second, shows how, even in a region torn apart by ethnic conflict, people are still subject to the impact of the new global culture.The first, shows how power is being drawn down from the nation-state, into the hands of individuals and communities.The second, shows how power is being pulled up from the nation-state into the hands of the global players.Power being localised.Power being globalised.And conventional politics, anchored exclusively in the nation-state, has no answer to either.In fact, it is deeply resistant to both.THE CHALLENGE TO THE NATION STATEYou see, the old political \u201csettlement\u201d is breaking down. Under the old pact between the citizen and the state, national governments offered security and prosperity, in return for supreme power at home and the unchallenged right to speak for their citizens abroad. That settlement is being irresistibly reshaped by the force of events.Now in some senses, this isn\u2019t new.We have long understood that our security cannot be defended by national governments alone. That\u2019s why we pooled our sovereignty in NATO.But nowadays this goes far further than security. Our prosperity too can depend on what happens beyond our borders.A market crash in Taiwan means factory closures on Tyneside.The managing director of a car maker in South Korea can have more impact on unemployment in Swansea, than the Secretary of State for Wales.A trade war about bananas means job losses in the Borders.In a free and increasingly global market, a national government alone can no more guarantee jobs for all than it can guarantee sunshine on Sundays.Nor can it guarantee a clean environment. A nuclear accident in the Ukraine means contamination in Snowdonia.And so on. You see, no country any longer has absolute sovereignty. We are all of us interdependent.Set a punitive tax rate and business may flee abroad.In the old days it took time. But with the new \u2018weightless\u2019 industries, it can be done electronically - instantaneously.And if you want to avoid tax, you don\u2019t have to become a tax exile. You can just move your money.You don\u2019t have to do a Sean Connery - you can do a Geoffrey Robinson!And consider this. If a man in Scotland buys an album from a company in Germany, through an Internet provider in Belgium, using software from Australia, and downloads the music onto a recordable CD bought from America ... who gets the sales tax? And, just as crucially, how do they collect it? How do they even know?So here\u2019s the question we are going to have to answer - and soon.Who will regulate the global players, and how? The currency traders, the satellite broadcasters, the multi-nationals, operating in all countries but responsible to none?Sooner or later we are going to have to find ways to put limits on the power of the global players. And we cannot do that alone.The only answers to these questions will be international ones.But there are a separate set of questions to which the only answers are local.Because people also want control of their own lives.They want choice, and freedom, and power, not in the distant Westminster hot house, but in their own hands. In their own communities.EXAMPLES OF MULTI-LEVEL GOVERNMENTHere\u2019s how I put it in a radio phone-in a few months ago.A woman challenged me: \u201cHow you can say you want power for local government and for Europe. Surely that\u2019s completely contradictory?\u201dI said: \u201cWell. Let me see if I can explain. Do you have a favourite pastime?\u201dShe said \u201cYes, I love walking my dog in the park.\u201d\u201cRight,\u201d I said. \u201cNow, imagine there\u2019s a tree in your park that\u2019s old and rotten. It\u2019s a danger to you and your fellow dog walkers. Who should take the decision to cut it down? Westminster?\u201d\u201cOf course not,\u201d she replied. \u201cMy local council should.\u201d\u201cRight. But what if that tree was one of only two of its kind in Britain? Who should take the decision then? Your local council?\u201d\u201cOf course not,\u201d she said. \u201cThat should be Westminster.\u201d\u201cRight! Now what if that tree was dying from acid rain that had blown over from eastern Germany. Who should be responsible for stopping that? Westminster?\u201d\u201cOf course not,\u201d she said. \u201cThat should be Europe.\u201dExactly!If you\u2019re going to succeed nowadays you have to work locally, nationally and internationally.And when you think of it, that\u2019s true for lots of other things too.Jobs can be lost in Scotland because of poor planning. That\u2019s a matter for the local Council.Or because the infrastructure is inadequate. That will be a matter for the Scottish Parliament.Or because the business tax is too high. That is a matter for Westminster.Or, as now, with knitwear workers in Archy Kirkwood and Mike Moore\u2019s constituencies, because they\u2019re innocent victims of an international trade war about bananas. Now that\u2019s a matter for the World Trade Organisation in Geneva.You see, you can\u2019t succeed in preserving jobs, or creating new ones, unless you are prepared to work locally, nationally and internationally.And, incidentally, that\u2019s why Archy and Mike and I are going to the WTO in Geneva on Thursday to fight the case for jobs in the Borders.You see what the Banana War teaches us is what happens when international co-operation breaks down. Then it\u2019s the law of the jungle. Where the strong and the bully make policy \u2013 and jobs and prosperity are the casualties.Europe and the US working together have been the driving force which has brought the world freer and fairer trade.In this futile and damaging trade war both sides have made mistakes \u2013 but the biggest mistake of all is to allow this to develop into a dispute where innocent communities pay the price. The US must now step back from the brink and return to the only place this problem can be solved \u2013 the World Trade Organisation in Geneva.Which demonstrates my point.Whether it\u2019s creating jobs, or reducing pollution, or tackling crime, or protecting consumers, or ensuring our security, or fighting poverty - in today\u2019s world we cannot succeed unless we work locally, nationally and internationally.THE LIBERAL DEMOCRAT COMMITMENTNow, what makes Liberal Democrats different is that, for us, this is not new and uncomfortable. It is our very creed. We have always known this.Internationalism is in our blood.And community politics is our invention.Narrow nationalism is not our way. The little England of the Tories. Or the little Scotland of the SNP.But nor is the stultifying centralism that runs through the veins of Labour, Old and New.We are a different kind of party.We believe not in the sovereignty of Parliament but in the sovereignty of the people.We understand what the others don\u2019t. That you can\u2019t succeed in solving the problems of this country unless you are prepared to work locally, nationally and internationally.SPRING\u2019S ELECTIONSNow at first sight, the local government, Scottish and Welsh elections on May 6th and those for Europe on June 10th, are two completely different sets of elections.But if you think about it, they\u2019re not!They are connected in just the same way as that Leicester estate and those villages in Kosovo.Because what is necessary to make Britain successful is not just having the right kind of Government at Westminster. It\u2019s also having the right kind of government in Brussels, in Scotland, in Wales, and in our local councils.You see, what we are creating on May 6th and June 10th is a whole new political settlement for our country.That is why I say these will be the most important set of mid-term elections ever seen in Britain.Perhaps even more important than May 1st 1997.Because they will decide not just who governs, but how we are governed.After these elections Britain will never be the same again. The Government of Britain will move decisively and irreversibly closer to its people.We are opening the door to the new politics of the 21st century.THE SCOTTISH PARLIAMENT AND WELSH ASSEMBLYJust think about it.In less than two months Scotland\u2019s health service will be run, not from 400 miles away in Westminster, but from here in Edinburgh. And so will Scotland\u2019s schools and local government and housing and prisons and police.The Scottish Parliament will have the potential to make a billion pounds of difference to Scotland\u2019s hospitals and Scotland\u2019s schools.Now sadly, the Assembly in Cardiff will fall short of the proud Welsh Senedd that we Liberal Democrats would like to have seen. But we should not underestimate it either.The New Labour fixers of Millbank Tower certainly don\u2019t. You know, you wonder whether Labour actually understand the purpose of Welsh devolution. Or are they just taking the Michael?But seriously, the Welsh Assembly will be able to give a priority to Welsh Schools and Welsh hospitals which Westminster would never have given. It will have powers for industrial development for regeneration, for jobs, for investment.The First Ministers of Scotland and Wales will actually have more impact on the day to day lives of their people than the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.Now, this is a moment for which we Liberal Democrats have fought all down the years of this century.All through the long decades when Labour and Conservatives promised devolution in opposition, but betrayed their promises in government, we kept the faith. We kept up the cry for Home Rule - for many years as a lone voice, but, finally, leading a mighty chorus, we won the argument.For others, May 6th will be just another polling day.For us it will be victory \u2013 at the end of a century long crusade.I was talking to a Scottish journalist at the bar last night - you know, as one does. Over a couple of mineral waters - doubles.He said: \u201cWhat happens in May is going to be the most exciting political event in Scotland for 300 years, and your lot will be at the centre of it.\u201dAnd he\u2019s right.This will be our chance to get things right for Scotland. And I can tell you, Jim Wallace and his team will seize that opportunity with both hands.And this campaign will be different too. This time it\u2019s fair votes.Do you know that the day before yesterday the Prime Minister, here in Scotland, said that because these elections were under PR: \u201cIt\u2019s a fairer system.\u201dThose were his words: \u201cIt\u2019s a fairer system.\u201dWell I say to the Prime Minister, if it\u2019s fairer for Scotland then it ought to be fairer for all of us.Under fair votes, every Liberal Democrat vote will count.And that means that our Party, here in Scotland, and in Wales, will take another great stride along the path that we have followed these last 11 years - as we have moved from a Party of protest, to a Party of power.And yes, that will mean working with others - as we have already shown we can. And as fair votes will often require.But let us make this clear.The partnership we seek, here in Scotland and in Wales, is not a partnership with this Party or that - it is a partnership with the Scottish and Welsh people.It\u2019s not who we work with that matters, it\u2019s what we achieve.The coalition that Liberal Democrats are building is the coalition that brings together business and parents and teachers and patients and nurses. Rural and urban. Highland and lowland. North and south.These are the alliances that Home Rule can help us create.A Scottish Parliament, bringing together the Scottish people.Raising the Standard of Scottish services.Raising the Standard for Scotland.And only the Liberal Democrats can make that work.You see, it all boils down to a very simple choice for May 6th.If you vote Labour, you vote for a Party that wants to run the Scottish Parliament from Millbank Tower in London.If you vote Tory, then you vote for a Party that didn\u2019t want the Scottish Parliament in the first place.If you vote SNP, you vote for a Party whose only vision for a Scottish Parliament is as a stepping stone to separation.But, if you vote Liberal Democrat, then you vote for a Party that has fought for Scotland\u2019s Parliament all the long years of this century and is now determined to make sure it succeeds \u2013 so that Scotland can succeed.One of the things that has really struck me about this campaign is the extent to which the other parties seem to be changing places.The \u201cborn again\u201d Tories will say almost anything to win votes.Remember that man of the people Lord James Douglas Hamilton \u2013 the man Donald Gorrie defeated at the last election. The man of whom the story is told that he visited a shared ownership housing scheme and mistook it for a timeshare - and actually asked one of the bewildered residents what fortnight in the year they had the house for.Well, Lord James Douglas Hamilton, ex-minister, ex-Member of Parliament, is trying to make a comeback as a member of the Scottish Parliament. The Parliament whose existence he fought so strongly against when he was at Westminster. And what is his platform for the election? He is campaigning to reopen a casualty ward that was shut by the Scottish Office when he was a minister.There can be no more perfect illustration of the hypocrisy of today\u2019s Conservative Party.Now, here is a multiple choice question for you.Who is David McLetchie?Is he (A) the full back for Heart of Midlothian?(B) the Managing Director of Highland Spring?Or (C) the Leader of the Conservatives in Scotland?Let me give you a clue.It\u2019s (C).David McLetchie. A man so obscure that if Thomas Hardy had met him he would have called his novel \u201cJude the Comparatively Well Known\u201d.You know, the more I think of it, the more I realise how far we have come these last 11 years, in more ways than one.Do you remember what they used to say about us?Well, what would you now say about the other parties?In Scotland, you\u2019d say: \u201cthose Tories, they can say anything, because everyone knows they\u2019re never going to be in Government.\u201dAnd what would you say about the SNP? You\u2019d say: \u201cparty of protest. One man band, that\u2019s all they are.\u201dAnd what would you say about New Labour? \u201cNice people ... but no-one knows what they stand for?!\u201dLABOUR\u2019S LACK OF AMBITIONAnd it\u2019s true.New Labour seem so often so uncertain. So unwilling to be bold. So unprepared to raise their sights, and Britain\u2019s horizons.Time and again this Government ducks the really big issues.Labour clamps down on underage drinking - but ducks the problems of pensioner poverty.They give us a task force on air rage, but not on climate change.The Prime Minister will tell Richard and Judy what to do about Glenn Hoddle - but he won\u2019t tell us what he\u2019ll do about the euro.We have a jungle of reviews, Royal Commissions, focus groups, think tanks, working parties ...This Government will do anything in order to do nothing.Almost everything has been kicked into the long grass.There\u2019s so much in the long grass now, that to find out what this Government's doing, it\u2019s not David Dimbleby you need. It\u2019s David Attenborough!Picture the scene - David Attenborough in the New Labour Forest - deep in the undergrowth. Voice characteristically hushed. It is past ten o\u2019clock. And the Home Secretary has sounded the curfew.\u201cThere, not ten feet from me, you might just be able to see the Westminster Fair Votes - a splendid beast, beautifully proportioned - easier to spot, mind you, if the Deputy Prime Minister is not sitting on it!\u201cIf you listen very carefully you may just hear the faint call of the Freedom of Information bird. A delicate creature, but one with many predators. Its location, I\u2019m afraid, is a closely guarded secret.\u201cAnd there, look, an EMU \u2013 an exotic foreign bird thriving in 11 European countries but not allowed to fly in Britain. It has a unique characteristic. One sight of it and the Government puts its head in the sand.\u201dOUR AMBITIONS FOR BRITAINNow, Mr Blair likes to tell us that his is one of the great radical reforming Governments of the century.Really?Can you imagine Lloyd George, in his People\u2019s Budget, saying he\u2019d awfully like to introduce the old age pension but couldn\u2019t because he had to stick to Balfour\u2019s spending plans!Or Beveridge, deciding that he couldn\u2019t fight the five giants of idleness, want, squalor, disease and ignorance, because it wouldn\u2019t play well with the proprietor of Pathe News!Or Gladstone saying he wouldn\u2019t go campaigning in Midlothian, because it wasn\u2019t a target seat!New Labour boasts that it roars like a lion. But far too frequently it squeaks like a mouse.I do not doubt New Labour\u2019s good intentions.But I despair at their lack of ambition.They tinker at the edges but too little really changes.We may get smaller classes for five to seven year olds - but only by expanding them for eight to elevens.Queues for NHS operations are down - but only because we\u2019ve doubled them for outpatients.And we\u2019re told that Labour are helping pensioners \u2013 but actually pensioners are worse off today than they were two years ago.To borrow a phrase - it doesn\u2019t have to be like this.We can do better.We can be better.We Liberal Democrats are ambitious for Britain.Our eyes are focused not on the next day\u2019s headlines but on the next century\u2019s challenges.The Government wants to mark the new millennium with a giant upturned wok on the South Bank of the Thames, which will be flogged off in 18 months time.Why not celebrate the new century by changing Britain in ways which will benefit all the people, permanently.Here are five things which it is perfectly within our power to do in the next decade, if only we have the will.Make Britain the world\u2019s foremost learning society.Give Britain a Health Service we can count on, whenever we need it.Ensure all Britain\u2019s senior citizens have a decent pension.Combat crime and violence so that people feel secure in their homes and safe on our streets.Safeguard our environment so we can be proud when we hand it on to the next generation.These are our ambitions.This is our message.Achievable, costed and clear.First - and always - education. For Liberal Democrats nothing is more important to our national future.Yet look what is happening even under a Labour government.Did you know, that here in Scotland, the education budgets of 29 of the 32 local councils have been cut - CUT - in real terms since Labour came to power?For every £100 spent by Scottish councils under the Tories, only £96 has been spent by Labour.That is a disgrace.That is why the Liberal Democrats will continue to make education our number one priority.If, as a nation, we will not invest in more books, more equipment, and more teachers, then our country cannot succeed in the future - it\u2019s as simple as that.So be in no doubt. Investing in education is so important that we remain committed to investing the equivalent of 1p on the basic rate of tax into specific and costed improvements. And if the only way to do that in Scotland is to use the tax varying powers of the Scottish Parliament, then that is exactly what we will do.So let me make this clear. Here is a message to the other parties in Scotland and in Wales for the day after the election:\u201cIf you\u2019re not interested in investing more in education then don\u2019t even bother to pick up the phone.\u201dAnd here\u2019s another message. Every Liberal Democrat vote in these elections will be a vote for better hospitals and a better health service, too.You know, Labour\u2019s spindoctors are trying to convince us they\u2019re doing brilliantly because the National Health Service is no worse under Labour than it was under the Tories.It reminds me of a line from the famously bad poet laureate, the McGonagal-like Alfred Austen, who, wrote \u201cOn the illness of the Prince of Wales\u201d, this immortal couplet:\u201cAcross the wire the electric message came. He is no better. He is much the same.\u201dBut, actually it\u2019s worse than that.The NHS is not the same. In many cases it\u2019s now getting worse.Although waiting lists are, thank heaven, at last falling, the time to get onto waiting lists has been soaring.Listen to this:Before the Election the number of people waiting more than 3 months to see a consultant was a quarter of a million.Today, it\u2019s nearly half a million. Double.That\u2019s why Liberal Democrats will scrap the waiting list target and replace it with a waiting time limit.No-one should have to wait more than 6 months for an operation.But we will do much more than this.We will shift emphasis from treating illness to preventing it in the first place. You can\u2019t have good health unless you have good housing, clean air, safe food.And it\u2019s about time the Government woke up to that.And it\u2019s about time they woke up to their failure to tackle crime too.Having promised to increase police presence, Labour is actually cutting police numbers.That\u2019s why Liberal Democrats would provide 6,000 more police officers.But we don\u2019t just want a bigger police force. We want a better police force.So let me make this absolutely clear. If there is one lesson that we must learn from the scandal surrounding the murder of Stephen Lawrence it is that every police officer must know that fighting crime means fighting racism.But security isn\u2019t just about being secure in your home and safe on your street. It\u2019s also about being secure for the future.It is about having enough to provide dignity in old age.Some of the poorest in our society are some of the oldest.And the very oldest are the very poorest.That\u2019s why, when you turn 80, you get a higher pension.And so you should.But do you know how much?Let me tell you.25p a week.Not enough for a first class stamp.And it has been frozen at that level since 1971!That\u2019s a disgrace.And we will do something about it.We\u2019ll increase the extra pension for the over 80s 20-fold. From 25p to £5 a week.And we\u2019ll bring in a new rate of an extra £3 a week for the over 75s.Now that\u2019s a real start to tackling pensioner poverty in Britain.And the Chancellor could do it if he wanted in Tuesday\u2019s Budget.And here\u2019s something else which the Chancellor should be doing on Tuesday.Something else which is absolutely vital for our future.Shifting taxes off people and onto pollution.Cutting tax on the things we want more of, and raising it on the things we want less of.And that\u2019s what the Liberal Democrats would do.The money raised by our plans to tax pollution will help us to lift anyone earning less than £10,000 a year out of tax altogether. That will mean that 10 million of the poorest in Britain who now pay income tax won\u2019t have to.Fighting poverty and fighting pollution.And fighting pollution also means encouraging fuel efficiency. And we\u2019ll do that too. Under our plans the annual car tax would be scrapped completely for any car of 1600cc or less.And that could be just the beginning.Some of our European neighbours take it even further. In Italy the tax difference between the biggest car \u2013 your Ferrari Testosterone or whatever \u2013 and the smallest, your Fiat Shopping Trolley \u2013 is a thousand pounds a year.But surely we don\u2019t always have to take our lead from Europe. We should give a lead in Europe, too.It is a tragedy that while other nations are now forging ahead after the successful launch of the single currency, Britain is still dithering on the sidelines.Slowly, at last, almost imperceptibly, Tony Blair is inching forward.We are told that his recent statement on the euro represented a change of gear.But who is driving the car?Not the Government.Whether we join the euro is, undoubtedly, the biggest question to confront our nation in the next decade. But almost everyone has taken a clearer lead on it than our own Government has.The TUC has said yes.The CBI has said yes.The City of London has said yes.The Chambers of Commerce have said yes.David Owen has joined the Tories in saying No. Well, I think that\u2019s only fair - it is their turn!Dear David, bless him. His final political migration - from Lord Owen of Split to Doctor No.Meanwhile our Government has said nothing.And the serious point is this.The argument in favour of the Euro risks being lost by default, and with it Britain\u2019s whole future in Europe, unless the Government is prepared to take a lead and argue its case.But Liberal Democrats are not only the voice of constructive engagement with Europe.We are also the force of reform in Europe.Of accountability. Of democracy. Of tackling waste. Of reforming the Common Agricultural and Fisheries policies.Our determination to hold to account the powers of government is as strong in Europe as it is here at home.That\u2019s why our Liberal Democrat MEPs have led the way in taking the European Commission to task for not cracking down on fraud. And we are proud of them.And that\u2019s one of the reasons why we will work for a Constitution for Europe to define and limit the powers of Europe\u2019s bureaucrats.OUR VOYAGESo that\u2019s our programme.Yes, our ambitions are lofty.But I remember when they said a Scottish Parliament was a lofty ambition.I remember when they said a Welsh Assembly was unachievable.I remember being told that Reform of the House of Lords would never happen.I remember when we were told fair votes for Europe was lost forever.I can remember being told, less than a decade ago, that the idea of a Single Currency for Europe was simply utopian.So much has been achieved already. So much we have done, or helped to bring about.We are embarked on a voyage to a new political world.Of course, as with Christopher Columbus 500 years ago, there are the sceptics, who scare us with stories about sailing off the edge of the world. We call them Tories.And as with Christopher Columbus, there are the doubters, urging a quick return home to the safety of the past. We call them Old Labour.But, like Christopher Columbus, if we keep our faith and stay true to our course then a new world is opening up before us.For us Liberal Democrats, this is not a journey into the unknown. It is a course we have been charting for a generation and more.It is the journey from the 20th century to the 21st.From the era of Government as master, to the age of Government as servant.CONCLUSION - OUR ROLENow the success of this voyage is not certain.The changes we have begun could lead to a more open, more tolerant, more liberal Britain - or they could be just another brief fluttering of hope, quickly lost through lack of ambition and a shortage of boldness in those who lead us.More than in any but the earliest years of this century, we in this Party can now influence which of these two paths our country takes.We cannot do that standing on the touch line.We can only do it, playing on the field.We cannot do it, unless we continue to win - and grow in influence and power.Which is why May 6th and June 10th are so important.This time, the wasted vote will be the one which keeps things just the same.To vote in Scotland and Wales for a Party that wants them still to be run from London. That\u2019s a wasted vote.To vote for a Party that squanders Britain\u2019s opportunities in Europe by once again condemning us to the sidelines. That\u2019s a wasted vote.To vote to keep in place a rotten Labour Council, or a do-nothing, care less Tory one. That\u2019s a wasted vote.Remember, this time, it\u2019s the Liberal Democrat vote that\u2019s the powerful vote.That will clean up our councils.That will raise the Standard for Scotland.That will guarantee the Welsh Assembly put Wales first.That will give leadership in Europe.Remember this.Remember, in the next few weeks and months.Remember, when it\u2019s cold and it\u2019s raining and there are just a few more leaflets to deliver - remember. Remember that you are not just fighting for a candidate, a seat and a party.You are fighting for the future.So, here\u2019s my message for the future, to each and every one of you.Be ambitious for the Liberal Democrats.But above all be ambitious for Britain.

aVThe easy thing for me to do today would be to give you one of those sort of end of jumble sale speeches, where you say thank you to everyone, and say what a success it all was. Well, there are a great many people who deserve to be thanked. But I have always tried to avoid making comfortable speeches to you. And I see no reason to make this an exception.My first ever speech to you - 11 years and 22 conference speeches ago - was about signposts for the way ahead. I\u2019d like you to treat this one, not as a signpost, but as a message left behind for you to consider as you plan the future under our new leader, Charles Kennedy.And incidentally, a word about Charles. In choosing him you have, I believe, chosen a leader of exceptional ability, who will, I have absolute confidence, lead us to greater and greater success in the future. I look forward to being able to support him in that task. And I know that you will give him and the Party the same unfailing commitment which has made our successes possible over the last eleven years.And now, a brief look back before looking forward. Eleven years ago, the first thing we did in the Liberal Democrats was take our liberal agenda and update it. That new thinking gave us the distinctive messages, which won us the votes, that made us strong, that gave us a role to play on the field of politics as we do today. That\u2019s the order. First the ideas; then the votes; then the influence; and then the power.Recently, we have talked a lot about strategy. And rightly so. But no strategy will work, unless we have something fresh to say and offer something distinctive to vote for.As a Party, we now have some of the most long-established policies in British politics. And that can be good.We have been a party ahead of our time.Many of our most long-standing policies are actually being implemented. Many more have stood the test of time.But in some areas we are, I fear, running the risk of becoming rather lazy and complacent in our thinking.If we Liberal Democrats will not think afresh, then we risk falling into the easy trap of leftist, oppositional politics. And that would mean making ourselves irrelevant again for a generation.Political parties are always prone to bouts of introspection. We love discussing ourselves with ourselves. We too often believe that all the important questions are internal ones.They are not.We live at a time when the questions before us are, quite literally, of global proportions.Before I say my goodbyes, I want to talk to you about two of these. I make no apologies that I have spoken to you of them before. Because I believe they are at the centre of the new politics, which we should be at the centre of.The first is the globalisation of power.And the second our growing interdependence on each other.They are the two big facts of our times.You know, whenever, in history, power breaks free from the structures created to control it, change becomes inevitable - often violent - change. So it was with the barons and Magna Carta. So with Cromwell\u2019s Parliament and the King. So with the growth of industrial power and the Great Reform Act. And so it is today.Power is accumulating, often with frightening speed, in the hands of the global players - the commodity brokers, the internet operators, the satellite broadcasters, the multinational traders. All operating unfettered and unlimited by the structures of any government or the constraints of any ideology, or the limits of any creed or culture.We have begun to talk about this at this Conference. But do we yet realise the scale of what is involved?Here is a thought for you. A nation\u2019s currency, perhaps more than anything else today, is seen as a symbol of its national identity - look at the destructive emotions so easily stirred up by the anti-Europeans in this year\u2019s elections. And look out for more of it - much more of it - at the next General Election.Yet the Deputy Governor of the Bank of England, speaking at a conference of central bankers three weeks ago, said that the growth of internet trading risks making central banks completely irrelevant. And with them, incidentally, the capacity for Exchequers to collect taxes for public expenditure - and so for governments to govern in the traditional modern sense. Indeed, there is no reason why private firms like Microsoft or News International, should not set up their own currency for internet trading and investment. The Gates Groat. Or the Murdoch Shilling. Rupert\u2019s Rupee!And that is only one example of the changes that globalisation will bring.Here is the inescapable fact. Power is now moving, increasingly, beyond the confines of the nation state and is rapidly making many of its institutions irrelevant. We must start taking global governance seriously. The nation states, their governments and their politicians are going to hate it. But the longer they leave it the more powerless they will become; the more chaos will be caused and the more painful the transition.If we as the Party of internationalism will not lead this new thinking, who will?We will need new doctrines for international intervention in places like Kosovo and, more recently and tragically, East Timor. New structures to enforce control of global pollution; new ways to harness the power of the global market place whilst placing limits on its capacity to destabilise and disrupt.The new world order needs institutions and rules to match.But if globalisation is the most important change in the exercise of power in our age, then our increasing interdependence on each other is the key condition that governs our existence as individuals.The question that has plagued me is this. If nation states cannot any longer protect their citizens from the effects of global power, who can?That question took me all the way back to that great revolutionary and thinker, Tom Paine. The times may have changed, but the question hasn\u2019t. We may be talking about global power, not the power of kings. But the central issue remains: \u2018How do we give people dignity and control over their own lives?\u2019And the answer remains, by giving them power and encouraging them to work together.We used to look on society as a machine. Well ordered, neatly constructed. If only the right person pulled the right levers in the right order - hey presto! All would be well. Marxists believed this. Socialists believed it. Some Social Democrats - forgive me - believed it. Some Liberal Democrats still seem to believe it. And Conservatives, above all, believed it.And they were all wrong.Society is not a machine. It is a living, breathing organism, like the people who make it up. It needs to be understood as an entity. Each portion is dependent on the other. Damage one and you damage the whole. Now we need a name for this idea. And the one I am going to use is mutualism - or, at the risk of offending - new mutualism.I have tried to persuade you of this idea before. I first wrote about it 10 years ago in \u2018Citizen\u2019s Britain.\u2019 And I have become increasingly convinced that this idea of mutualism lies at the centre of the new politics.One commentator, Peter Kellner, says this about it:Mutualism understands that we have both rights and responsibilities... It seeks to rescue the virtues of co-operation and the principles that gave birth to the Co-operative movement, from the strangling embrace of socialism. So what matters is not where power comes from, but how it is used, how it is checked and how far it is dispersed.Exactly!Mutualism recognises that our own capacities and self reliance, together with the strength of the communities we live in, matters, probably, more than the governments who govern us, or the nations we belong to.Here is a theme for liberals, in the widest sense, in the years ahead.How do we create mutual economic structures, that recognise the common shared interest and interdependence of shareholders and customers and workers?Do we understand that Governments have a duty to regulate market behaviour, but ought to avoid becoming a market player?Do we accept the revelation that markets too, are social institutions, whose players, too, have responsibilities as well as rights?Do we recognise that the key equality that we seek, is not equality of outcome - or even, as I used to think, equality of opportunity - but equality of access?And do we understand that, because of this, the free market and strong competition are the best means by which ordinary people can get access to what is otherwise always going to be dominated by the bandit capitalists and the economically powerful?Perhaps most difficult of all for us as self confessed radicals; are we prepared, to liberate the great institutions that deliver our public services - education, health, justice, welfare - from the clammy embrace of corporatism, whether national or local, in order to make them human in scale and responsive to the interests of the consumer, not the producer?We have become far too staid, far too conservative - yes, conservative - in our thinking about public services in the Liberal Democrats.As liberals, our place is to be on the side of the citizen, not the state. Of the consumer, not the producer. What matters is not who provides the service, but how good the service is.You know, in Jo Grimond\u2019s time we used to have a slogan. \u2018We hate the Tories. But we distrust the state.\u2019 It\u2019s not a bad one for the years ahead!Enough!Now to the bit I\u2019ve dreaded.I hate goodbyes. So I will use the words of one of my heroes, William Wilberforce. A few days before his death he wrote his last letter to a friend who had asked him, how he had done this extraordinary thing, the conquest of slavery. He wrote this: \u2018We did not march as a marshalled army towards a distant obelisk. We travelled the highways and byways, gathering friends and flowers as we went.\u2019Over the last 11 years we have travelled many highways and by-ways together. And Jane and I have gathered so many friends and so many flowers. You have given me, quite simply, the pride and the purpose of my life. To have had the privilege to lead you has been the greatest thing I have ever done - or ever will do.And you have been a great Party to lead.Which is not the same thing, incidentally, as an easy Party to lead. You have been uncompromising at times, when I wanted you to bend a little. Uncomfortable at others, when I could have done with an easier ride. You have been unbelievably stubborn when I tried to take you in a direction you didn\u2019t want to go. And unbelievably curmudgeonly at times when I thought I was delivering you a success.But you have been recklessly generous in forgiving my faults. Indomitable, especially when we had to face defeat. And through it all, you have done all I have asked of you and more. So often I left Westminster tired and dejected, to go out to meet you and campaign with you, in the knowledge that it was my job to inspire you. But ending up with you inspiring me by your trust and your hope and your unshakeable will to win.And we have achieved great things together.Things which they said could not be done - but which we have done. We have given millions of our fellow citizens the benefit of government informed by the things we stand for.We have helped to bring a tidal wave of change which will, for ever, alter the nature of the country that we serve.We have laid the foundation stone, at last, for a modern Britain, in which the liberal ideal will be stronger and more relevant than it has been since the very earliest years of this century.It has been a privilege to have been a member of this Party these last 11 years, let alone its leader. And I have been able to hand over that leadership to Charles Kennedy, with pride and love and confidence.I can think of no good way to end this. So I will do so with what my grandmother used to tell me was the Irishman\u2019s blessing.May the road rise with you. May the wind always be at your back. May the sun shine warm upon your face. And the rain fall soft upon your fields. And until we meet again, May God hold you in the hollow of his hand.

aVNow, the leadership election was a unifying experience for our party. Thank you all for the part you played. Particularly as you all voted for me. Thanks particularly to Simon, Malcolm, Jackie and David. Good colleagues, good friends. And on a personal level - thank you, Paddy Ashdown.1999 has been a year of elections. Next year there will be more. We have a London Assembly election to fight. And an excellent candidate for Mayor in Susan Kramer.Each election this year was unique in its own way. Some showed us what is good with British politics - and some showed us what is not so good. There are different lessons to be learnt from them all.We\u2019ve certainly made an impact wherever we stood. Westminster, European, Scottish MPs and Welsh Assembly members. We can count the Speakers of the Scottish Parliament and the Northern Ireland Assembly among our colleagues. We are now in government, with Jim as Deputy First Minister of Scotland.In Scotland, the government we are part of has real power. It makes decisions that affect everyday life. So the voters are interested, engaged, connected.But it\u2019s not quite the same elsewhere in Britain. Compared to Scotland, voters in Wales were less interested, less engaged, less connected. Why? It\u2019s because in Wales, there has not been the political leadership to win the argument for a full scale Parliament. Labour refused to build a partnership to win the argument well before the referendum. When we have that Parliament, Mike German and his team can help deliver still more. And inevitably, the voters will be more connected.But the story was worse, far worse, in the European elections. Seventy days of a war in Europe. Night after night on our TV screens. And the turnout? Under 25% A turnout of less than one in four in Great Britain was a clear sign of what politicians can expect. When the government of the day refuses to discuss the issues at stake with the voters. When it is too timid to say how far Europe has brought benefits to people in Britain. When the European Commission is seen as sleazy and unaccountable. And under 25% is what happens when people are presented with Jack Straw\u2019s list of parties, rather than a system that allows them to pick people.In local council elections, turnouts can be even worse That happens where local government isn't seen as sufficiently relevant. That happens where parties take voters for granted. Where people feel that so-called New Labour has nothing to offer them. We need radical change. To transform local government through the introduction of Fair Votes. Real powers to make a real difference. Scrap the unfair Council Tax. Let's go for a fairer Local Income Tax. That way local government will reconnect.There is one key lesson from all these elections. Give people real power, so they can see the point in voting, then they\u2019ll soon get involved.Politicians have got to reconnect with the voters. So the voters are as enthusiastic about parties as they are about pressure groups. The alternative is that derisory turnouts will be the norm. Party politics can make a difference - not just through voting, but through engaging in the process. We must, inspire a new generation of voters. And we, as Liberal Democrats, must connect our values and vision to everyday life. I will give everything I can for this task. And I expect nothing less of you.If we want to reconnect with the British people, the first thing we have to do is reconnect with our party. Why do you think our leadership election was so successful and engaging? We saw serious debate at over twenty hustings meetings. Excellent candidates. But crucially, we involved thousands and thousands of party members. They chose who would lead their party, because it is their party. One member one vote.Do you like one member one vote? I do, and I want to see more of it.We\u2019ve got to realise that we do not include enough of our members in party elections. Well over sixty thousand of our members campaigned in the last general election. But party committees are elected by a few thousand conference reps. To be a conference rep takes time and money. You all know that. It excludes many activists, even councillors, who work hard for the party all year round. So I shall be asking the party's Federal Executive to look into extending one member one vote to more party elections. If it\u2019s good enough to elect the President. If it\u2019s good enough to elect the Leader. If it\u2019s good enough to elect our candidates. It\u2019s good enough for us all.But that\u2019s enough about internal party matters. The most important way to reconnect with the voters is to put forward a clear message. We must place Liberal Democrat values at the heart of the nation\u2019s political conversation. Through more dialogue we may actually achieve more idealism. Explaining to people why the causes that brought us into politics affect them. So that politics and the people reconnect.Now, the government achieved a clear cut victory on the first of May \u201997. They may have a broad majority of seats. Yet they should remember it is also a shallow one. They didn\u2019t get an outright majority of votes.And let me say this clearly to the country. The Liberal Democrats are nobody\u2019s poodles. But we are not Rottweilers either. We don\u2019t attack for the sake of it. We don\u2019t savage on command. That is the old politics.It's a lesson the Tories haven\u2019t yet learned. What an irresponsible disgrace they have become on Northern Ireland. A word here, on current events. One of the most telling lines of poetry for me. W.H. Auden on the death of Yeats. \u2018Mad Ireland hurt you into poetry. Now you are gone. But Ireland has her madness still.\u2019 Let me make one thing absolutely clear on behalf of this party. Loose talk at Westminster can literally cost lives in Northern Ireland. We are not going to play Westminster party politics with the Northern Ireland peace process. William Hague, grow up.Our approach is different. We want adult politics. We believe that for politics to make a difference, you need to talk to people in other parties. It\u2019s why I\u2019m talking to pro-European Conservatives. It\u2019s why I want to maintain our current constitutional co-operation with the government. It\u2019s also why I won\u2019t rule out further co-operation with ministers. Remember what we\u2019ve already agreed. If we get our policies implemented. If you, the party, consents. And if we remain independent.This open-mindedness shows we are serious about helping the people of Britain. Where the government is doing things that are right, we shall support them. But when they are wrong, and they often are, we shall oppose them.Take social justice. There are real deep inequalities in Britain today. Men and women, black and white, rich and poor. Dire problems in inner cities. And just ask farmers about the rural crisis. If you\u2019re old, or cold, or hungry, the government is less New Labour, more new conservatives.The government has not done nearly enough to reach out to the poor and the powerless. It hasn\u2019t shown that politics and the actions of politicians can improve their lives. No surprise then, that many of Britain\u2019s poorest people choose not to vote in elections. They can\u2019t see any point to it. Politics hasn\u2019t connected with vast swathes of our country. We must reconnect.And nowhere more so than with women. Through far more elected women Liberal Democrats at all levels.And Liberal Democrats can reconnect on the core issues. For we are different on these issues. We believe that if you want decent public services such as health, education and transport, you have to pay for them. Money isn\u2019t always the solution. But so often, problems can\u2019t be tackled without it. Liberal Democrats will be honest with the public about that. We will not engage in a ridiculous competition about who can tax less. The Tories want to cut taxes for the very rich, and are now promising tax cuts on all savings. But they won\u2019t say which services they will cut to do so.It\u2019s typical of the mess they\u2019re in. Peter Riddell in The Times recently described the Shadow Cabinet as \u2018among the most second-rate in a generation.\u2019 They\u2019re a rabble. But they\u2019re also a dangerous rabble. We certainly don\u2019t want them back in power. Remember the sense of liberation in May \u201997 after eighteen years? Tory after Tory going down to defeat. A sense of hope for what seemed possible. A modernised constitution, a fairer society, a leading role in Europe. All of this could be wiped out in one blow by a Conservative recovery. Think of that. Cuts in health and education. Disengagement from Europe. Home Secretary - Ann Widdecombe. That\u2019s what a Tory government would mean We know from all the memoirs that this is a party with some past. What the police call \u2018form.\u2019 But increasingly it doesn\u2019t look like a party with a future.But to get back to serious politics. What about Labour? My big fear is that Labour will be seduced down the path of short-term tax cuts BEFORE the next election, at the expense of schools, hospitals, and pensioners AFTER the election. After all, they\u2019ve already done it once. In the last budget, when schools and hospitals desperately needed more cash, Gordon Brown gave us a tax cut, due next April. Nobody expected it, and nobody was calling for it. Any government that calls itself progressive, but refuses to fund health and education properly should be ashamed of itself.They should be even more ashamed when they start using the rhetoric of the moral crusade. There\u2019s more to morality than curfews. There\u2019s more to morality than attacks on how people choose to bring up their children. And there\u2019s a lot more to morality than some of the most illiberal asylum and immigration laws this country has ever seen.The real moral crusade would be to take a principled stand against injustice.Abroad, on issues such as Third World debt. Supporting Jubilee 2000. And what about the so-called ethical foreign policy? Ethical foreign policy? Like selling military jets to Indonesia? Ethical foreign policy? Dodgy deals over Sierra Leone? Ethical foreign policy? That\u2019s not ethical foreign policy. That\u2019s a moral stench masquerading as a foreign policy.And at home. Here and now, we have an opportunity to do something about the inequalities in Britain. Social justice isn\u2019t just about spending. It\u2019s about rights and changing attitudes. So that blacks and Asians have equal opportunities. So that the disabled have access to facilities the rest of us take for granted. And we cannot claim to be a decent society when in the workplace, in local government and in the armed forces, there exists unethical and arguably illegal discrimination against lesbians and gay men. It\u2019s absurd, isn\u2019t it, that we no longer prosecute spies. But patriotic men and women because of their sexuality can't serve their country in uniform.There\u2019s more. The hospitals without beds. The schools without books. The children leaving school without qualifications.To tackle these problems, we need to change the nature of political debate. The focus of our nation\u2019s political conversation must shift. Towards a concern about inequality and lack of opportunity. How about a genuine Social Justice Audit, to examine the effects of all government policies. To hold government to account for the way they treat the poorest and most needy in our society. We need fresh efforts on all-party agreement on pensions. It\u2019s too important an issue to leave to the vagaries of party politics. Governments come and go. Parties even come and go - tell me about it. But the reality of the ageing process is a constant 40 this year. Too old to rock \u2018n\u2019 roll? Too young to die? Well perhaps. But old enough to know that Britain needs to do better. Above all, above all, I believe leadership means a serious debate on how you fund public services, so that people understand the costs and the options on offer.So I challenge the Prime Minister and the Chancellor, here and now, to use the treasure chest they have now to invest in local schools, local hospitals, pensioners, rather than still more tax cuts for the better off. The nation wants it. They could do it. They should do it.When we talk about social justice, we also need to recognise that the inequalities in society affect the life chances of people who don\u2019t think of themselves as especially disadvantaged. Women, bringing up children, whether alone or with a partner, face enormous difficulties. Parents sending their children to university. Sons and daughters trying to look after their elderly parents. They may receive a reasonable salary. But what\u2019s the use of that, if you can\u2019t get a hospital appointment. Or your child\u2019s class at school is 36 strong and the teachers can\u2019t cope any more. Or you live in fear of crime.Make no mistake though, our response is not solely about spending. Our future is not as a left of Labour party. It\u2019s been tried before. It led to the longest suicide note in history. That would be the political cul-de-sac of all time.Can we spend better should be the question we ask, before we see if we need to spend more. This means that our party must be even more intellectually agile on policy than we have been. We need to work with the voluntary sector to raise awareness of problems that face so many in Britain. We need to look at ways of giving incentives to people to help the poor. And look at ways of discouraging activities that worsen poverty.There are other issues that we need to take to the people. The environment. Political parties aren\u2019t nearly bold or honest enough - ourselves included. We have a good set of environmental policies. But we need to ensure that they stay at the cutting-edge of thinking.Take transport policy. So-called integrated transport. The biggest single contradiction in British politics. Presided over by Two Jags Prescott himself. Poor John. He\u2019s got as much chance of transport integration as he\u2019s got of verbal integration.And now a word for our train spotters in the audience. I\u2019m sure there\u2019s quite a few of you. One of my favourite campaigns as a local MP was the successful fight to save the Fort William Sleeper. Today it\u2019s more popular than ever. After what I\u2019ve been through this week, I realise from now on, that's the only place I'm going to get an extra hour in bed.There\u2019s no greater challenge to government than a joined-up environment policy. To do this, we will need to change the very nature of government. Change the way we tax. We should tax pollution. We shouldn\u2019t tax jobs. That won\u2019t just help the environment. It will help employment too.And we need to make sure that government departments actually talk to each other. They all make policies that affect the environment. So when we campaign, we must get our message across on bread and butter issues. Our crumbling transport systems. Pollution in town and city centres. Asthma among children. Do we really want to ruin the countryside by building on green fields?And what about GM foods? The vast majority of the country is unpersuaded. But the government isn\u2019t listening.At the moment we have Brown\u2019s Budgets. I\u2019d like to see Green Budgets. And a Green Budget would be a Liberal Democrat Budget.The environment affects everyone. You can\u2019t be brought up in the Highlands of Scotland without realising that.Politics lacks courage, when what\u2019s needed is a serious debate.Just look at drugs. There\u2019s not a family, a home in the land, not touched directly or indirectly by this issue. It\u2019s talked about everywhere. Except - with a few honourable exceptions - in Parliament. Too much silence in politics, it was once said, is much more ominous than too much noise. But on drugs, there\u2019s an ominous silence in Westminster. Not the silence of the lambs, but the silence of the sheep, and the herd instinct that goes with it. This serious debate can be part of a much wider process to prevent drug-taking in the first place. We spend far too much on treatment and policing, and much less on prevention. We need to start listening to what people are saying to us.You know, what really amazes me about this government is its timidity. For so long under the Conservatives, politics was dominated by fear. Under Labour it has been dominated by frustration.The government has a huge majority. It continues to bask in good opinion polls. Yet it doesn\u2019t use its advantages. It doesn\u2019t lead. Too often it just follows the latest focus group.Nowhere is that more true than on the issue of Europe.I am unashamed on this issue. I know you are too. Europe is good for Britain. It\u2019s good for British business. That\u2019s good for British jobs. And all that\u2019s good for the British people. It\u2019s patriotic to be pro-European.People need to know that thanks to Europe, we\u2019ve got progress on paternity leave Thanks to Europe we\u2019ve got progress on equal pay for men and women, It was thanks to Europe that the invalid care allowance was eventually given to married women.But the government won\u2019t say so. They shouldn\u2019t be so afraid. I am proud to be a Highlander and a Scot. I know who I support when the teams run out at Murrayfield. But I am equally proud to be British - proud of the journey that the peoples of our islands have made together. Yet there is no contradiction with any of these in feeling proud to be European as well. And I do.We can play a full part in the EU without losing our national distinctiveness. We have nothing to fear. It is now time to be up-front about the big decision facing Britain. You won\u2019t manoeuvre the British people into the euro by stealth. It won\u2019t wash.Some time, there will be a referendum. When it comes, there will be a perverse rainbow coalition of yesterday\u2019s men and women arguing against the euro. In reality, they will be arguing for Britain to pull out of the EU altogether. Norman Tebbit, Tony Benn, Ian Paisley, Margaret Thatcher. Just William no doubt will play his part. If Portillo lets him. William Hague - out of touch with the 21st century. Yesterday\u2019s man before his time. And by the way William. Your biggest threat isn\u2019t Michael Portillo. Your biggest threat is here.In contrast, the case for our future in Europe will come from mainstream and respected figures from all parties. The best of the Labour government. And the best of the Conservatives. People like Ken Clarke and Michael Heseltine. Yes, I\u2019ll be there too. We all have to be there. As part of the Britain in Europe campaign.What is there to be afraid of? Lead now. Lead now and there can be a decisive majority for British entry to the euro. Put it off, and the result is far from clear. But the country needs and wants a lead.More vigour is needed too on the constitution. There has been a long overdue revolution. But it is an unfinished revolution. The government won\u2019t get the modernisation it seeks if the revolution stops. The country won\u2019t get the modernisation it needs if the revolution stalls.We have to keep the momentum going. More decentralisation of power from Westminster to the regions of England. A democratic House of Lords. Freedom of Information, not freedom from information.And of course, voting reform. After the fair votes elections in Scotland and Wales, and for Europe, many Labour MPs said: \u2018There you are. That proves it. PR doesn\u2019t work.\u2019 It didn\u2019t work for them because they didn\u2019t get huge majorities based on a minority of the vote. But it worked for the voters.They got a government in Scotland far more representative of the people\u2019s wishes than ever before. In Wales the government can only survive by taking account of other views. The systems weren\u2019t perfect. They weren\u2019t the systems we Liberal Democrats would have chosen. But that\u2019s not an argument against PR itself.There must be more change. There\u2019s been a coalition agreement in Scotland on fair votes for local government. We already have it in Northern Ireland. So you can\u2019t deny the logic of fair votes for local government in England and Wales.Fair votes in local government won\u2019t necessarily mean more Liberal Democrats everywhere. But it means less sleaze and corruption. Fewer Labour Doncasters, fewer Hulls.And there is no way that you can hermetically seal Westminster from this process.So these are my core beliefs. They offer a popular message for the country. A popular message about Liberal Democracy. A popular message about politics. It is a message we must now carry to every citizen in Britain.We can show that politics matters. A clear voice when we disagree with the government - as we often do. Speaking for the people who aren\u2019t heard, and the issues that aren\u2019t discussed. That\u2019s how we reconnect with Britain on the basis of our principles. And it\u2019s the way we show that politics can make a difference.Showing we are a serious party of government. Making a difference. To change lives for the better. Making sure that politics and the people reconnect. Inspiring a new generation of voters. That is our case. That is our cause.These are momentous times. Today, it is one hundred days until the new millennium. We can look forward. I look back to the days long before I was born. Back to Mill, Keynes, and Beveridge. Liberal Democrats all, even before there was a party of that name.And in modern times to David Steel and Roy Jenkins who dreamed the dream of the Alliance and brought it alive. People like Bob Maclennan who made our new party a reality. Paddy Ashdown, who made it powerfully relevant.We have a principled past to be proud of. We have a future of power to do good to look forward to.Time is now our ally. The opportunity ours to grasp. The twentieth century was too much a Conservative century. The twenty-first can be the century of liberal democracy.Sixteen years ago, it seemed a long way from the Highland croft to the House of Commons. It was then a long leap to the leadership. Sixteen years on, the gap between leadership and government doesn\u2019t seem so great any more. I\u2019m ready for it. I know you are. I\u2019m eager. This represents for me the chance of a lifetime. Three people at any given time - out of 55 million. Get the opportunity to lead a British political party. You have entrusted that chance and that responsibility to me. And politically, for all us, it\u2019s the chance of a generation. Let\u2019s go for it. Let\u2019s go for it. Let\u2019s go for it together.

aVPotentially, politics is at a crossroads. We saw that last week. The opinion polls have recorded that this week. That ha­s been the backdrop for this, I think, one of our most successful conferences ever.Politics is about leading. You might expect me to say that. But politics is also about listening. The events of the past ten days, have demonstrated, graphically, that the current government, neither leads nor listens enough.So it\u2019­s not just that people are estranged from politics. It\u2019­s that politicians are estranged from people.I know that. You know that. The country knows that. We\u2019­re different. That\u2019­s what our conference this week has been all about. Next time we meet like this, in twelve months, politics may have changed even more out of all recognition. We have to be part of that process of change, central to it. Before, during and after the coming general election. That\u2019­s why, in our pre-election manifesto, Freedom in a Liberal Society, we\u2019­ve been exploring themes, reiterating values and principles, setting out policy directions. All of which will take us a long way forward.Now today, I don\u2019­t just want to talk to Liberal Democrats, pleasant though that may be. I want to talk to potential Liberal Democrat voters. I want to talk to the country. And I want to be explicit about why Britain needs the Liberal Democrats.I\u2019­ve done a huge amount of travelling across the country this year. You know my principal impression? Put quite simply it\u2019­s this. There are too many, far, far too many anxious people out there, anxious - for themselves and their families, too anxious ever to have time to feel ambitious about our country.Well we are ambitious. Very ambitious for our country. That\u2019­s why Britain needs the Liberal Democrats.People also want a better level of political dialogue. They deserve it. They\u2019­re not getting it. Just look at the crime debate. Ann Widdecombe and Jack Straw. You know the only difference between the two? Ann got done for speeding. Jack\u2019­s got a driver to speed for him. They\u2019­re competing in a dismal Dutch auction. Going for lowest common denominator politics.Over-claim.Over-blame.Over-reach. Undermine the entire point of the political process along the way. It\u2019s got to stop. You can\u2019­t change human nature. But poverty. Unemployment. Drugs. These are major causes of crime too. Someone needs to be saying that. That\u2019­s why Britain needs the Liberal Democrats.Let me be quite clear. I\u2019­m not one of those who believe that all Britain\u2019­s problems began on the first of May 1997. But Labour\u2019­s poverty of ambition is quite remarkable. With a parliamentary majority of one hundred and seventy nine, they behave like John Major did - with a majority of three. It\u2019­s all about what will play well in the opinion polls.Britain was promised an ethical foreign policy. Britain demands legislation on the arms trade. But instead we get arms sales to Indonesia.And all too often, they seem scared of their own shadows.Remember that leaked Prime Ministerial memo? What was it he said? \u2018A sense that the government are somehow out of touch with gut British instincts.\u2019 The PM. His verdict on his own administration.So I ask you, Labour voter last time, maybe for the first time was it? Did you believe that things could only get better?And have they? For you?Your family?Your community? Your local school?Your local hospital?Your sense of job security?Your sense of reassurance that your elderly parents would be looked after? Your belief that your students wouldn\u2019­t be up to their ears in debt.Millions of people believed it.Millions of people are disappointed and disillusioned as a result.The Conservatives won\u2019­t improve these things for you. But the Liberal Democrats can. We can improve a lot on Labour. They are continually terrified to be called the party of boom and bust. That old Labour habit of splashing out in their first years in power, and then having to cut back at the end. Gordon Brown certainly hasn\u2019t done that. He\u2019­s cut back and now he\u2019­s splashing out. Bust followed by pre-election boom. We said that wasn\u2019­t good enough.I\u2019­d like to think he saw the light. But the truth is, he felt the heat. Now prepare yourselves: what of the Conservative Party?Today, I want to address the millions of previous Conservative voters, who feel that William Hague\u2019­s Party offers them nothing. I share many of the values, the beliefs, the concerns, of the people who used to be called One Nation Conservatives. Tolerance, decency, fair play. If you believe in those things, and you look at your party, and it\u2019­s not got room any more, at the top table, for the likes of Ken Clarke, Michael Heseltine, Chris Patten. Then your party\u2019­s got no room for you. To you, I say this.You have friends in the Liberal Democrats. You have a home. Come and talk to us.You will be very, very welcome.What\u2019­s gone wrong with the Conservative Party - oh, so wrong, is not even so much the individuals. It\u2019­s the issues and the instincts which today drive William Hague\u2019­s Conservative Party.William jumps in with both feet, in the wrong place, at the wrong time, and for the wrong reasons. Desperate for a headline, desperate for a quote. Desperate to get attention. He\u2019­s the world\u2019­s first unpopular populist. So how come the Tories have come up in the polls?I know the answer. It\u2019­s not William\u2019­s popularity.It\u2019­s the people round about him that the country\u2019­s warming to.It must be John Redwood, Michael Portillo and Ann Widdecombe the country loves.Just look at what William\u2019­s been up to this year.January - a Patient\u2019­s Guarantee.Ditched.February - tax guarantee.Ditched.March - the moral case for low taxation.Ditched with the tax guarantee.April - bogus asylum seekers.May - Romsey.June.He was quiet in June.Perhaps he had a 14-pint hangover.Or perhaps it was that Romsey hangover. I ask you.Is that opposition? Is that a positive view of Britain?Is that anything, of any use, to anybody?Why does Britain need the Liberal Democrats? That\u2019­s why Britain needs the Liberal Democrats.And remember their record?Recessions.Crime doubled.Larger class sizes. Fewer nurses. Pensions slashed.Interest rates - through the roof.Arms to Iraq. BSE. Cash for questions.Sleaze. It must never, ever, be allowed to happen again.That\u2019­s why Britain needs the Liberal Democrats.William Hague is not the serious leader of a serious political party. That\u2019­s the serious point.We are serious. Our purpose is here in this document. It\u2019­s the F word. Freedom. That\u2019­s why we\u2019re in politics. We want politicians to promote freedom for all. So people can make the most of their lives.That means excellent local hospitals and schools.Fair and decent pensions.Safer streets.A clean environment.Civil liberties. Stopping government interfering in people\u2019­s private lives.That\u2019­s why Britain needs the Liberal Democrats.I am determined we will get our message across. But as part of that, it is vital, absolutely vital, that we persuade people, that for every area where government can do more, there\u2019­s an area where government should be doing less, or doing different. That\u2019­s why I want to make an early announcement today, about the contents of our manifesto for the next election.In our pre-manifesto, we have policies for green action in every chapter. The manifesto will do that too. But it will also show, in every chapter, where government must do less, to give people more freedom.We would scrap a range of regulations that burden small businesses.We will cut bureaucracy in schools.And we will let people, not politicians, decide how some of their tax revenues are spent. Tax and spend? Every party taxes and spends.But our priorities, are the people\u2019­s priorities.That\u2019­s what freedom means. It\u2019­s not left of Labour.It\u2019­s not right of Labour. It\u2019­s ahead of Labour.It\u2019­s also honest.Where there is a cost, we say how we will pay for it. Saying that if necessary, we will pay for better schools, by asking everybody to pay just one pence more on the basic rate of income tax. And to fund decent pensions, we will ask those fortunate enough to earn over one hundred thousand pounds per year, to pay a little more. That\u2019­s the way to be honest with people. And remember, when you\u2019­re talking to people, remind them, that\u2019­s still less than the self same people were paying under Margaret Thatcher.That makes us clear on what we will then do.On health:Nurses and doctors - more of them.Prescription charges - abolish them.Eye and dental check-ups - free once again.That\u2019­s why patients need the Liberal Democrats. Schools and colleges, cut class sizes for all 5 to 11 year olds.Abolish tuition fees for higher education. Jim Wallace and our colleagues have done it in Scotland. Let\u2019­s do it for the rest of Britain as well.The mountains of bureaucracy that burden teachers.Flatten them.So that teachers can actually teach more, and stop being bureaucrats.That\u2019­s why parents and children need the Liberal Democrats.And what about the pensioners? Forgotten and insulted by Gordon Brown. Pensions were introduced by a Liberal government. By a man called Lloyd George. And today, we retain that commitment to a decent pension for all. So we will give pensioners more, above inflation. £5 extra every week for every pensioner. If you\u2019­re over 75, it\u2019s going to be £10 extra.If you\u2019­re over 80, it\u2019­s going to be £15 extra. Now that will make a real difference.That\u2019­s why pensioners need the Liberal Democrats.The environment.The great challenge facing our generation.We say that a clean environment relates to health. To poverty. To transport. To education.To civil liberties.We understand that, instinctively so. And again, we\u2019­re honest. We\u2019­re clear, fuel taxes should be used to improve the environment. In the months and years to come, we have got to get that message across. To show that good environmental policies are about more choice, not less. Positive gain, not pain. And that we can all make a difference.That\u2019s why the environment needs the Liberal Democrats. And let me say something about the single currency. If there is an election next year, then a referendum on the Euro can\u2019­t be long delayed. Labour will no longer have anywhere to hide. It shouldn\u2019­t be a party political issue. But let me make our position crystal clear. As pro-Europeans we are not in favour of rushing into the euro head first. We don\u2019­t believe Europe is perfect. And we will work to see that reform takes place. But we do believe that Britain can and must lead in Europe. Lead reform in Europe. Lead on the euro\u2019­s benefits for Britain. That\u2019­s why, earlier this year, I asked a panel of experts to report on what the government should be doing. They\u2019­ve done so. And if the government chooses to ignore the experts, British businesses will lose, British workers will lose, British consumers will lose. Britain will lose. So those of us in favour of the euro must go out there and argue the case. We have a duty to do so. We cannot sit on our hands. That\u2019­s why Britain and Europe need the Liberal Democrats.This has been an outstanding year for the Liberal Democrats. The local elections - our biggest ever share of the national vote. Sandra\u2019­s triumph in Romsey. Real votes, cast in real elections.And we are making a difference on real issues throughout the country. I can look round this hall and see the faces of people who are making a serious difference across Britain today. Mike German and his colleagues have made a significant impact on the Welsh Assembly. Our colleagues in the London Assembly. The singular contribution of Susan Kramer. And the enormous contribution that the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland has made to the peace process. We wish it and them well. And I am particularly proud of our record in Scotland, where Jim Wallace has been running the government. Liberal Democrats have helped deliver. In Scotland, we are delivering better hospitals.More money for education.More police officers. Freedom of Information.A new approach to farming and rural affairs. And, the abolition of tuition fees.In Scotland we\u2019­ve shown that the SNP are an irrelevance. In Wales we\u2019­ve shown that Plaid Cymru are an irrelevance.And both will be an even greater irrelevance at the next Westminster election.They really are the wasted vote in British politics.The Liberal Democrats are the party for the whole of Britain.And that\u2019­s why the whole of Britain needs the Liberal Democrats.We\u2019­ve shown that the others are now the old parties of the 20th century. We are the party of the 21st. Our policies, our principles, our practical approach, our philosophy of freedom, can lead us to even greater triumphs. Let us connect with the people and the people will connect with us. At the next election, I believe we will win more votes, and more seats. 1997 was a staging post. It wasn\u2019­t a high-water mark. In the months and years to come, our message of freedom is one that we have to get across to the British people.For me, and for my family, that\u2019­s a very personal message. For my grandfather, freedom meant putting on a uniform, and going to fight in the Dardanelles in the First World War.For my mother and father, freedom has meant the chance to give their children - youngest son included - better life opportunities than they could ever have aspired to for themselves. For me, freedom is about being grateful for the opportunities I\u2019­ve had, and my friends at school had, and doing something for our country to help make that freedom commonplace. I have great pride in our party, in what we stand for. Pride in our principles. And I have a pride in Britain. In what it can be.So we must go into the next election, and tell people about our message of freedom. The difference between the Liberal Democrats and the disaster of William Hague\u2019­s Party. The difference between the Liberal Democrats and the disappointment that Labour has become.Go out there and tell it to people as it is. What you see is what you get. This is what we will deliver. A truly modern, truly free, 21st century Britain. A Liberal Democrat Britain.

aVWe meet against an unimaginable backdrop. It is hard to find words adequate to give proper voice by way of response, far less respect. How can day-to-day vocabulary, measure up to such sheer criminality?For me, watching those grim images on television - again, and again and again - there were all the normal, human reactions. Disbelief. Then alarm. Horror - as the truth sank in. Compassion for all those people and their families, so many of whom were British. Can you imagine that last mobile phone call from your husband, or wife or child? The helplessness. And with it, the hopelessness. We\u2019re here because we don\u2019t believe in hopelessness. We actually believe in hope. But hope requires purposeIt\u2019s fortunate that we\u2019ve had a conferenceat all this week.Not just fortunate for Liberal Democrats.But fortunate for everybody here,who\u2019s involved in the democratic process.The media.Charities and commercial organisationswho come here to put their views to us.I don\u2019t doubt, you put your views to them. But what do I really mean by fortunate? I mean this.I mean that we\u2019re fortunate to live in a countrywhere democratic political debatetakes place even in these most difficult of days. I\u2019ve felt quite humbled, but proud,to be here this week.Leave aside my words, on Monday,and just  remember the words of otherswho spoke so eloquently in our debate,about those terrorist attacks on America.That     told     people     a     lotabout the sheer quality and the integrityof our political party, the Liberal Democrats. So too, did the fact,that this week of all weeks,the American Ambassador,found time to visit our party conference. When I spoke with him,I said we\u2019d thought twiceabout whether even to hold our conference.And he said, that he\u2019d thought twice,about whether to come to a party conference.But we both came.And I know that was the right decision. We\u2019ve set out this week,a clear and principled responseto international terrorism.We have stayed true to what we stand for.We have continued to demonstrate and debatethe application of those principlesto everyday concerns. That\u2019s what we did during the general election.And that\u2019s why we stand here today,as the effective oppositionin British politics. Before and during the election,we said three things in particular.1.	That we wanted to win more votes and gain more seats.2.	That we weren\u2019t going to win the general election overall. There were a few raised eyebrowsabout that one,but it seemed to methe honest and realistic point to make.3.	That decent, quality public services cost,so you only get what you pay for. Well, there were sceptics.A few internal.A lot external.But we have travelledsome significant distance this year. I drew a few personal lessons from the election.Get some sleep.Be straight with people.Address people\u2019s hopes not their fears.Address aspirations not just attitudes.Talk about solutions not just problems.Don\u2019t get bogged down in left versus right arguments,but try to stay ahead of the other parties. So despite all that was predicted,we did do well.You did well. Part of that\u2019s because so many of youhave worked and worked and workedfor years and years and yearsfor so little reward, building up seatsso that one day they come into the fold.People like Margaret Sharp in Guildford.And Tony Rogers in Chesterfield. These are the people who\u2019ve built up this party,so that we could win both those seats in 2001.We owe a great debt of gratitude to them,and to countless people like them. Today\u2019s Liberal Democrats.Thousands of councillors.Parliamentarians from four Parliaments,Liberal Democrat government ministers.Constituency agents,Parliamentary and Party staff. Thousands of party volunteersgiving up hundreds of evenings,dozens of weekends,sacrificing holiday timeto work for their local communities.Tens of thousands of supportersfrom all walks of life,all age groups,working together,with no distinctionsof class or sex or race. And that\u2019s why I\u2019m proudnot just to be the Leader of the Liberal  Democrats,but proud just to be a Liberal Democrat.Thank you. Next Thursday, Parliament is due to meet.On behalf of all of you,the first message I will convey is this. As we have always said,whether in the context of the Middle East,or in thirty years of terrorismwithin our own country,we will never,ever,let the terrorists triumph. Dissent, democracy, debate,must never be beaten,by bullets, barbarism, and bombs. But we should also remember this.We do a disservice to democracy itself,if we simply meet terror with terror. We do nothing to protect,all that we hold dear,if we abandon, in the name of security,the very principles which terrorists seek to destroy-	liberty, democracy, diversity. And we only build a long-term peace,by addressing the underlying causesof such hatred.And what are they?Ignorance, poverty, prejudice. So today, let\u2019s talk about the principlesthat must underpin a better society.The first of these principles, self-evidently,is liberalism.Make no mistake:Liberalism and fundamentalismare fearsome enemies.As liberals, we do not ask,nor necessarily want,people to be like us.We ask only for the freedom to be ourselves.And, in return,to guarantee others that self-same freedom. Cracking down on civil liberties,carries a price.Liberties lost tend to be liberties hard to regain.The message from our conference,is this:in the weeks and months to come,wherever civil liberties are concerned,tread with care,tread with care. Let it also be understood that no nation,no people, can stand alone in the 21st century. Let there be no doubt. The best way to solve international problems,is through international agreement,international law,international co-operation.Now that is where we stand. It\u2019s why we\u2019re so committedto the United Nations,to NATO and to the European Unionand why we place themat the heart of our approachto international affairs. It\u2019s why, for example,we must support Pakistan,in the refugee crisis,it is already facing. The real lesson of September the 11th,staring us all in the face,is that isolationism just doesn\u2019t work.We\u2019re in this together. And if you think about it,the entire case for Britain,being part of the European Union,is built on that self-same basic premise. That\u2019s why we are firm Europeans.and firm patriots in the process.There is no contradiction between the two. But it would be foolish and dangerous,to pretend that all people in Britainsubscribe to that view.There are people in British party politics,who seem to believe somehowthat we can go it alone.That we don\u2019t need Europe,and that we are actually better off without it.Well I say to those people,you        are        wrong.  Other great issues to address.Tackling global poverty.Protecting our shared environment. Next year\u2019s Earth Summit in South Africa,is the major opportunityto address these issues.It is essential for all countries,big and small, rich and poor,to take a full part in that conference,to reach agreements,but most important of all,to stick to those agreements. That internationalism,that international co-operation,is the only way ahead.It\u2019s the only way to ensure,that the environment is not merely somethingthat we inherit from our parents,but something we preserve for our children. Let me deal with another prevailing concern.The whole issue of the public servicesand the private sector,which has so correctly been the focusof much of our conference this week.We\u2019re going to be judged by this, you know.And we\u2019ve got to get it right. This is our position. We start with the interests of the public.And who are the public?Parents, pupils, patients,victims of crime. What is it that best serves those people?Doctors - able to do their jobs well,without interference from bureaucrats.That serves the public.Police - able to spend less time on form filling,and spend more time catching the criminals.That serves the public.Teachers, able to teachan interesting and relevant curriculum.That serves the public. So our priority,is that public service professionalsshould have the freedom to deliverhigh quality public services,not in the interests of the producerbut in the interests of the people. And we should set world class standards,for our public services.Why can\u2019t we have world class schools?Why can\u2019t we have world class hospitals?And why haven\u2019t we gotthe cleanest and safest streets? There is another important aspectof our approach to public services.We believe that public services work best,when local people have local control.Our agenda means making public servicesmore diverse and more local. And we recognise also,the simple truth on funding public services:there are no cheap or easy solutions. People understand that.Our general election campaign showed it.The money has got to come from somewhere.Public funding, private funding,we all end up paying in the end,whether it\u2019s taxes, tuition fees,prescription charges or private insurance.People understand this.They\u2019re not daft you know. So let\u2019s be honest.And be honest with ourselves. Of course, private initiativeshave a place in public services,just as there\u2019s a real rolefor the voluntary and charitable sectors,all too often overlooked.But we will never, never, never,put profit before transport safetyor health or education.Never. That message,will be absolutely vital,as we develop our role as the effective opposition.The need for us to be that effective oppositionhas never been greater.That\u2019s why we have suspended,the Joint Cabinet Committee.It has carried out valuable work in the past,And helped create a climate,that has allowed us to work with others,not least in Scotland and Wales.Our approach in the devolved administrations,is one we will follow in Parliament.Fight hard for policies we believe in.Refuse to descend into yah-boo politics.But we are going press hard,on all the unfinished constitutional business:regional government in England,reform of the Lords,PR for local government,and fair votes for Westminster. The JCC might now be without a purpose,but we do have a purpose.This party now faces an historic opportunity,to step up a leagueon the domestic political scene. But we will only achieve this,if in the months and years aheadwe are more vocal,more competent,more authoritative,more imaginative,and quicker on our feet,than either of the other parties. This raising of our gamemust apply to every level of the party,whether at Westminsterin other parliaments, assemblies,or local councils.It must apply to our policy,to our recruitment of members,to our fundraising,to our campaigns. That will mean engaging with peoplewho no longer feel that the Conservative Partyoffers them a home.One Nation Conservatives.Who want the creation of wealth.Decent public services.Young peoplewho can afford to become students,elderly peoplewho don\u2019t have to sell the family home.Well, that\u2019s where we stand.And as the effective Opposition,we have to persuade those peoplethat we are their natural home. The same is true,of people disillusioned with Labour.The people who voted for change,but have been sadly disappointed,by underinvestment in hospitals.Shortages of teachers.The police underfunded.Scant concern for the environment.For all those people,as the effective opposition,we do offer the natural home. But that effectiveness,also means engaging with people like Digby Jones,who this week, when he spoke to our conference,became the first Director-General of the CBI,to give a formal platform addressto any party conference.We\u2019re a serious party.And the outside world recognises that fact. We also have to remain principled.And there is one final parallel of principlethat I want to drawbetween our domestic concernsand the international situation. There is no doubtthat the seeds of the destructionof the World Trade Centrewere planted and nurturedin a fundamental hatred of difference.Difference between creeds,between races, between faiths.We\u2019ve seen in the last two weeks,the terrible harvest of such hate. I say to you today,that those in our own countrywho seek to cultivate fear and loathingwill find the Liberal Democratsresolutely against them.We will continue to oppose discriminationand celebrate diversity.Not that you need it,but you have my personal guarantee.  Returning to America,and one of its great Presidents,Franklin D Roosevelt.On April 12th, 1945,President Roosevelt died.The next day,he\u2019d been due to deliver a special address,to commemorate Thomas Jefferson. And what he was due to say was this: \u201cThe only limit,to our realization of tomorrowwill be our doubts of today.Let us move forwardwith strong and active faith.\u201d In these difficult times,let us reflect upon those undelivered wordsof President Roosevelt. Let us, move forward,with strong and active faith,in the sure and certain knowledge,that by overcoming our doubts and fears of today,and by working with our friends,we will indeed,realise our dreams of tomorrow.. And purpose requires direction.When I spoke again with the prime minister earlier today, we were clear on a number of matters. First, common resolve to root out terrorism wherever it may be. Second, the need to balance legislation with the interests of domestic civil rights. Third, vigilance against anyone who seeks to target and attack any of our ethnic communities. Fourth, no ruling out of a further recall of parliament, if events require it.Now immediate emotions inevitably begin to subside, but they will never go away. Nor should they. We Liberal Democrats must be clear about our intentions. Resolve. There cannot be capitulation to the terrorist. Determination. That we strike at the heart of international terrorism. And equal determination that in combating terrorism we do not lose sight of the fact, at one at the same time, that we live - actually - in a liberal democracy, and the principles of democracy are what we\u2019re all about. So as we gather here this week, this is one of the challenges facing us as Liberal Democrats. One of our particular duties is to make it clear that short-term knee-jerk responses, never provide long-term solutions.We have to be especially vigilant against those people who would seek to make scapegoats of Muslims in Britain. Let us be quite clear, we have no quarrel with the Muslim community and no quarrel with the Islamic faith. Last Friday, when I visited a mosque in London, that was the message I took to our fellow citizens on all our behalves. And that message went out loud and clear from this conference hall this morning. But let us also remember there will be particularly difficult dilemmas ahead for our party. Those difficulties will involve a gauging between the balance of the liberty of the individual against the threat that the terrorist presents to that very liberty. Do not underestimate the real, ongoing pressures and the public scrutiny that goes with that, which will be upon us in the times ahead. Proportionate response is not just about military measures. Proportionate response is also about civil liberties. The scandal that is terrorism is all about civil liberties. In facing those dilemmas, we are best to remember our first principles. We subscribe to the rule of law, violated over the skyline of the United States, on September 11th. But that subscription, as the very word implies, comes with a price tag attached. It involves realism and risk. Realism means facing the stark truth, that the terrorist will stop at nothing, absolutely nothing. Risk is about the consequences of your response. So let us be clear about these first principles. Civil liberties - yes. The rule of international law - yes. Co-operation amongst sane-minded peoples across the globe - yes. All underpinned by a philosophic and fundamental commitment to the integrity of the individual, and the supremacy of that individual over the power of the nation state. But recognising also that people need and are looking for security and reassurance, and that the proper role of the state is to provide that.Now that\u2019s where we stand. And that defines our response and our reasoning in the wake of these dreadful events. When parliament was reconvened, I couldn\u2019t help but cast my mind back to such a happy year as a student in the mid-west of the States. Friendships were made there. What struck me then, what I didn\u2019t understand properly, was the extent to which the mid-west can almost be a country which is very different from the rest of the country, which, when you think about it, itself is a continent.But what is so striking now is the remarkable degree of spontaneous unity right across America. A unity of understandable anger. But the fear that can flow from that can be dangerous. That\u2019s where a candid friend comes in. Standing shoulder to shoulder, but always there for the occasional cautionary tap on the shoulder. The most special relationships, in my experience, are based on a combination of trust and mutual respect. And as America\u2019s candid friend, we are able to say: there are no blank cheques to be issued to the United States. The way to defeat international terrorism is through international co-operation, based on international law, clear intelligence and a measured and appropriate military response. And let me say this where military response is concerned: we have a duty and a responsibility to ensure that where our armed forces are involved, the risks to them are quantified and minimised. We cannot shelve or abandon that requirement. That means supporting American actions only in the knowledge that Britain will be involved in all planning and risk assessment. All that, we owe that to our armed forces.And let me also, incidentally, pay tribute to the BBC World Service. As ever, one of the key contributions that Britain can make to the coalition against terror and suppression is to offer accurate information and rational analysis.But do remember. War is not the word. Nor is crusade. Resolve is. We have got to fashion a mindset, to find that approach which begins to address the roots of such evil. We do need to get back to those first principles. In the face of such violation, be inviolate. Don\u2019t flinch. Democracy must prevail and it will.

aVIt\u2019s been a highly significant - if not seminal - week.For this conference, this party, parliament and our country.Iraq - naturally and properly - has been the overwhelming preoccupation.And the Liberal Democrats have been the prevailing voice of people\u2019s concerns and anxieties.I say today - on the evidence of this week alone - to anyone who is still cynical or unsure about us, to anyone who doubts our collective capacity to respond with swiftness and responsibility to fast-moving events, to anyone who dismisses what has long-since become our permanent role in British politics and public life generally:Think, look and listen again. To the kind of people we are; to what we have to say; reflect upon our principles, our priorities, our policies.Consider our relevance, note our willingness to state a case in the court of public opinion - and then to defend it in united and articulate fashion.That distinguished parliamentary correspondent, Norman Shrapnel, once observed that too much silence is much more ominous than too much noise in a parliamentary democracy.I sat in the chamber of the House of Commons, at our recall session, on Tuesday. I listened with great care and attention to a detailed and lengthy statement from the prime minister. The night before I had read carefully here the advance copy of the dossier made available to the opposition party leaders on privy council terms.And then I listened to the leader of the other opposition party. And the sound I heard? The sound of parliamentary silence.If the predominant party of power throughout most of the twentieth century finds itself reduced to brief banalities on one of the early defining issues of the twenty first - if it has scarcely any questions to ask of the government of the day - then I say that\u2019s a party which is rendering itself redundant and irrelevant in the body politic of our country.By total contrast - we speak, we question - for the country. We do so on the basis of those first principles I set out before you at the beginning of this week.The rule of international law.The role of our House of Commons.The supremacy of the United Nations.The need to contain and disarm a despot who exterminates his own people, threatens regional security, represents an affront to civilised values.For those of us who never embraced unilateralism by Britain, it wouldn\u2019t make sense to subscribe to it by the United States now.And that is not for one moment to deny or in any way dilute the collective assault upon America and the rest of us which were the atrocities of September 11th.I repeat our stance over Iraq.There must be a new UN resolution, setting a timetable for the readmission of weapons inspectors. Without conditions.The House of Commons must have a vote prior to any possible future deployment of British forces to Iraq.Parliament must remain mindful of the anxieties now amongst the Muslim community here in Britain.And every effort must be made to restart the Middle East peace process - genuine security for Israel, stability for a Palestinian state.A resort to military force must be a last resort - and under the auspices of the UN.In all of this we speak for the common-sense and humanity of the vast majority of the British people. We shall continue to do so.Gladstone once described the Liberal party as one of conscience and reform. That still helps define us today.And it\u2019s why our influence has grown so much on the domestic front as well.In parliament, our stance has been that of a critical but constructive opposition.Precisely what a functioning parliamentary democracy requires.Effective opposition.The prime minister and the government know that.This party knows that.The country knows that.Consider what we\u2019ve achieved in the past year.Again and again our MPs have reined in Labour\u2019s worst excesses.And our peers have used their pivotal position in the House of Lords to force the government to think again.We\u2019ve stood up proudly, courageously and effectively for liberal values.Yes, we backed the action which followed September 11. But we also fought against proposals which offended civil liberties. And we won.We opposed unlimited detention without trial. We stood up for trial by jury as well. And of course we spoke up for asylum seekers and for the most vulnerable in our society.There\u2019s much we\u2019ve spoken against too:Special advisers exceeding their powers. Overstretched troops with inadequate equipment. Broken promises on transport. Bureaucracy undermining teachers. Health targets that prevent doctors treating the most urgent cases.Older people languishing unnecessarily in hospitalAgain and again we\u2019ve held this government to account and found it wanting.Only the Liberal Democrats have probed the government\u2019s failings consistently, thoroughly and effectively.There\u2019s one fundamental difference between the government and ourselves.We\u2019re liberal. They\u2019re not.And you don\u2019t need me to point that out. Just take the behaviour of the home secretary.With every day that passes, David Blunkett becomes more insensitive in his language and more intemperate in his actions.Who talked about swamping schools with asylum seekers?Who instructed immigrants to use English in their own homes?You\u2019d have never heard that from a reforming Labour home secretary like Roy Jenkins.But there\u2019s a broader charge. And it can be directed at the government as a whole.I believe it\u2019s lost sight of the bigger picture - the positive picture.Remember that marvelous Jubilee parade along the Mall?It celebrated the diversity that is today\u2019s Britain.The Union Jack, paraded by people whose skin happens not to be white - that really does say a lot about identity in Britain today.Of course there are racial problems, but there are also so many positive signs of our society growing together.We should seek to build on that.Increasingly we are a society of multiple identities. I find no contradiction between being a Highlander, a Scot, a citizen of the UK and a citizen of the European Union at one and the same time.The European cause is one which all too often we Liberal Democrats have been left to champion alone.It\u2019s an issue which is at the core of my personal beliefs as a Liberal Democrat.Back in the 1940s, the Liberals were the first British political party to vote at their annual conference in favour of a European Union.But as you know our party conferences have never been anything other than wise and visionary in any decision they\u2019ve taken.Now eight leaderships later in our political lineage and we remain still the most consistent pro-European party in British politics.It takes a long time to establish and maintain such principled consistency.It takes a much shorter time to squander it. So - consistency on Europe - well you\u2019d certainly never accuse the Labour party of that.Look at their attitude to the single European currency referendum:Mixed messages. Followed by claim and counter claim. Followed by briefing and counter briefing. Followed by spin, reverse spin and then - in case you missed it - back spin.This is not leadership. This is not a recipe for winning hearts and minds.We deserve better. We can\u2019t allow such an important cause to be undermined by such an abdication of responsibility.We have argued - again and again and again - that the government has to set a timetable for the timing of a referendum.Tony Blair could do it this autumn - in the Queen\u2019s speech. It would be a start. A bill, paving the way for the referendum. It would be a clear signal of intent, kick-starting the debate.But I\u2019m not holding my breath.The prime minister and his chancellor have got to resolve their collective political position.Europe has become the unacceptable conspiracy of silence in British politics.Tony Blair would like to talk more about it - but Gordon Brown just won\u2019t let him.It\u2019s an insult to the collective intelligence of the British people. And here\u2019s another cause we Liberal Democrats have been left to champion on our own - the environment.The west - and in particular the USA - must stop plundering the resources of the planet.It\u2019s not only future generations who\u2019ll suffer. It means more deprivation here and now for the poor countries of the world.And that glaring injustice will inevitably lead to future conflicts - more economic migrants, more human misery, more fertile ground for terrorists.Johannesburg was a step forward - but what a small one! But what did our government contribute? John Prescott!Well I suppose it briefly spared us the exhaust emissions from his two Jags.But he apparently swapped them for five Mercedes instead. It\u2019s hardly progress.We Liberal Democrats want to see real action on both poverty and the environment.It\u2019s high time this country met the UN aid target of point seven per cent of GNP.And it\u2019s high time we addressed our environmental problems at home as well. Look at the government\u2019s current plans.Are they seriously considering a new generation of nuclear reactors?And without a public debate?Without even a nod towards viable alternatives?While Labour are talking up nuclear, this country already has combined heat and power plants capable of cutting carbon emissions by a million tons a year. They\u2019re standing idle.Now that\u2019s a scandal.And it\u2019s the duty of any effective opposition party to point that out again and again.So no surprise that the Conservatives have been totally silent on the matter.In fact there\u2019s very little that they seem to want to talk about at all these days.Not even Europe. I wonder why?After all Iain Duncan Smith presides over the born-again party of British politics where matters European are concerned.The arch-Eurosceptic leader has actually sent his shadow cabinet off round the rest of Europe - wait for it - to discover why our European partners have got right all the things which successive Conservative governments got so wrong.Apparently they\u2019re looking for inspiration.More like W C Fields being found reading the Bible.\u2018Just looking for a loophole.\u2019We could have saved them the price of all those travel tickets.All those lonely hours spent at railway stations and airports.Waiting for something to turn up.I say this to Iain Duncan Smith and the Conservative shadow cabinet.If you really want to know how to improve public services, go and talk to the real experts - former head teacher Phil Willis on education, Dr Evan Harris on health, Professor Steve Webb on social security.And if you want to know about anything else - anything at all - then just give Conrad Russell a ring. But set aside some time.The French translate Shadow Cabinet as Cabinet Phantome. And never has there been a cabinet more phantom than the Tory front bench. We\u2019ve seen more recently of Lord Lucan than of some of them. Coming to think of it, perhaps Lord Lucan is a member of the Tory Shadow Cabinet.At the moment, the only direction the Tories are going is backwards.Iain Duncan Smith knows it. His response? A reshuffle. Now there\u2019s a thought.But the trouble with the Tories these days is this: it\u2019s not just the individual personalities or the policies. It\u2019s the party itself that\u2019s the real problem.They look faded. They sound jaded. The party of yesteryear.And that gives us Liberal Democrats a great and growing opportunity. We\u2019re seen increasingly as the party of tomorrow. Particularly among young people - as survey after survey this year has shown.But not just among young people. We had one of our best ever results in the countrywide elections in May.Norwich, Hull, Milton Keynes, Kingston on Thames, Lambeth, Southwark, Worthing, Cheltenham, Eastbourne - all now run by the Liberal Democrats - and Dorothy Thornhill triumphantly elected as Mayor of Watford.Meanwhile, we\u2019re attracting new recruits from all quarters - and attention from both sides of industry too. This year Sir Iain Vallance, having completed his term as President of the CBI, joined the Liberal Democrats. And earlier this month I became the first leader of any party other than Labour to be invited to deliver a platform speech at the TUC Congress.Our message is the same, whether to the TUC or the CBI. And it\u2019s equally welcome and equally relevant to both. By the time we gather again this time next year we\u2019ll have been through another even more important set of elections.In Northern Ireland, our sister party the Alliance Party are fighting Assembly Elections. David Ford and his colleagues have shown great courage in the past year. They deserve their reward at the ballot box.There\u2019ll be more major local authority elections across England too.Liberal Democrat councils - and council groups - campaigning on their record of action and delivery, with the promise of still more.In Scotland and Wales, Liberal Democrat government ministers will be campaigning on their record in office.And it\u2019s a record in which they can take great pride.In Wales we\u2019ve now secured additional help for the hardest-pressed students.In Scotland we\u2019ve scrapped tuition fees and won free personal care for the elderly.And just this week, Jim Wallace has put Scotland on track for proportional representation in local elections.It\u2019s a great achievement. But we want to see fair votes at every level. The Government said they\u2019d review our many electoral systems after next year\u2019s round of elections.It was a promise I sought and extracted from them. And I mean to hold them to it.The case for PR has never looked so strong. We\u2019ll be there at the table, making that case.It\u2019s high time the Government extended fair votes to Westminster. It would give us a system which made every vote count. And it would also give us a Parliament which looked far more like a genuine cross section of our country - male and female.And in the meantime, while we still have first past the post - I intend to go on doing everything I can to get more women Liberal Democrat MPs elected. The gender balance task force has my strong and active backing.We Liberal Democrats have always been a party of ideas. And I\u2019m proud of that fact. We remain true to that tradition, leading the way with new thinking while the other parties trail behind.The question which dominates domestic politics now is the future of our public services.That\u2019s why, shortly after the last general election, I invited Chris Huhne to chair a new Party Commission into these matters.We had to be prepared to think afresh - and think aloud.And think about the basis of our thinking itself - our philosophical values set in a contemporary context.That\u2019s why Chris Huhne\u2019s report has to be read alongside Alan Beith\u2019s paper on party philosophy.The two go hand in hand.Not just \u2018How do we go about things?\u2019But equally \u2018Why do we want to go about things in a certain way?\u2019And both papers answer that second question clearly and emphatically: it\u2019s about freedom. Our objective is to give people the freedom to make the most of their lives.And the best way for the state to ensure this is to provide quality public services.This Conference has endorsed the Huhne Report. And thanks to Chris and his colleagues, there\u2019s now a crystal clear difference between ourselves and the Conservatives over public services policy.We\u2019ve got one. They haven\u2019t.But at the same time we have a radical and exciting alternative to Labour\u2019s plans.The argument\u2019s no longer about how much you spend - but about how effectively you spend it.We\u2019ll earmark National Insurance for the National Health Service. People will be able to see how the money is raised and see how it\u2019s spent. That will force politicians and managers to deliver the most efficient service.Gordon Brown\u2019s plans are time-limited. National Insurance Contributions guarantee investment in the Health Service year in, year out.And we\u2019ll continue to guarantee decent pension provision as well. The Liberal Democrats have always had costed plans to make sure pensions are funded generously. It was the Liberal Party which first introduced the state pension. It\u2019s one of our proudest traditions. We have no intention of abandoning it.There\u2019s a second radical reform in our programme for public services. And that is to reduce the power of central government over them. Reduce it drastically. Ensure that the people making the decisions are local. People who understand the needs on the ground much better than Whitehall.And our third big new idea is to give local people - including the professionals who work in schools and hospitals - the opportunity to run them.That means far more scope for doctors, nurses and teachers to exercise their professional judgment.And it means more power for patients and parents to make decisions for themselves - choice for everyone, not just those with money.The policy\u2019s distinctive, it's fresh and it has great appeal. It\u2019s a case we can argue with confidence and conviction between now and the next General Election. We value the hard work and dedication of all those who work in schools and hospitals and police stations up and down the country. That\u2019s why our policies aim to support them, to give them more freedom to work effectively, so that they can better serve the people who depend on them.This is an exciting time in politics. It\u2019s what some call the new politics.The Conservative Party\u2019s lost its head. The Labour Government\u2019s lost its way. We can show there\u2019s a better way - our way.Why was it that we won Guildford from the Tories and Chesterfield from Labour in the same General Election?You\u2019d think they wouldn't have that much in common - apart from the fact they were at opposite edges of this week's earthquake zoneBut we did win both. And I can promise you that we\u2019ll be creating a lot more earthquakes of our own at the next General Election.You see, people no longer recognise any relevance in the old distinctions of left and right.In this era of new politics we can set out our stall with conviction. In the knowledge that the argument is going our way.The budget earlier this year was a decisive moment.The Conservatives opposed it. They actually voted against all those vital extra resources for schools and hospitals. That decision destroyed their credibility. They\u2019re comprehensively off the field of play. It\u2019s left to us to make the case.Increasingly a defining debate for the next General Election is between the Government and ourselves, the Liberal Democrats. And the issue is this: do you spend the money wastefully from the centre - or effectively through local people?The so-called official opposition can\u2019t engage in that argument. The Liberal Democrat opposition is already at the heart of it.That\u2019s what people will be talking about as we move towards the next election. The debate has moved on from funding to delivery.And it\u2019s a debate which is bound to secure and enhance our reputation as the effective opposition.And today we can honestly advance that claim.Steadily, month by month, our influence and credibility is growing.The attraction isn\u2019t simply that we\u2019re not Labour or the Tories. Our image is becoming ever stronger, our role ever more clear.We\u2019re the only party committed unswervingly to human rights. The only truly internationalist party. The only party with a real vision of Europe. The only party with a consistent track record on public services. The only party with genuine credentials on the environment.I\u2019ve always said as your leader that the process of building up the Liberal Democrats in British politics is more a marathon than a sprint. But now has to be the time to quicken the pace.British politics is up for grabs in a way it has not been for a hundred years.The prize is very great. There\u2019s no law which says when the Conservative Party is down it must come up again. And there\u2019s no law which says the Liberal Democrats need forever remain third amongst Britain\u2019s parties.As a party, we believe in ourselves as never before. And there are millions more out there who can be persuaded, who want to be persuaded, to believe in us too.We\u2019re now in the strongest position to speak for the British people because we\u2019re most in tune with the British people. They\u2019re looking to us. To speak up on Iraq. To speak up on public services. To speak up on human rights. And to speak up and speak out for Liberal Democracy.

aVWell, for me it\u2019s been a year of jubilees. I\u2019ve had the pleasure and the privilege of representing you all, our party, at the celebrations for Her Majesty the Queen\u2019s Golden Jubilee. I know that fact will not be lost on our conference.But more recently another jubilee has played a recurrent part in my life.  The London Underground Jubilee line, which runs from Westminster station to Willesden in Brent.  Nine stops on the tube.  Now renamed the Victorious Line.  The people there voted for fairness and decency.  That\u2019s what we Liberal Democrats stand for.  And that\u2019s what Sarah Teather offered. A message which resonated over local, national and international issues alike.Left and right is Westminster talk. It has no resonance or relevance outside. You need only go one stop on the tube to find a very different Britain. A country where people do actually want to talk to their politicians if they feel that the politicians are genuinely prepared to listen.A country that wants to see real improvements in real services - not posturing and pretence.A good country.A caring country.The fourth richest country in the world. Which can afford the best for our people. And our kind of politics is people focussed - first and foremost.It\u2019s no longer a question of people being disappointed with this government. After six years of failure, they despair of this government. It\u2019s our job as Liberal Democrats to be an effective opposition - and an increasingly tough one as well.Taking a principled and consistent stance over Iraq has attracted much criticism from our detractors and opponents.But they couldn\u2019t ignore us.And the voters didn\u2019t either. We should not prejudge the outcome of Lord Hutton\u2019s enquiry. It\u2019s already exposed a great, great deal - despite its tight remit.We argued from the outset for a far broader independent enquiry. One into the entire basis upon which this country was led into that war. And events are increasingly proving us correct.The current speculation over the interim report of the Iraq Survey Group raises still more profound questions.Two things however are clear.The full legal advice of the attorney general at the time must now be published in full.And the case for that full-scale independent enquiry becomes stronger by the day. And - incidentally - do you share with me a certain distaste at the sight now of the Conservative leadership criticising the consequences of a war for which they were the principal cheerleaders.This is a leadership of charlatans and chancers.At the time, they asked none of the key questions.That was left to us.Whatever the eventual judgement, the political implications of Hutton are already clear. A devastating indictment of Labour in power; and of our political system itself.Consider these words from 1997. \u2018We are not the masters. The people are the masters. We are the people\u2019s servants. Forget that and the people will soon show that what the electorate give, the electorate can take away.\u2019 That\u2019s what Tony Blair told his new MPs in his first speech to them after his first election victory. Good instincts. Great ideals. Today tarnished for good.No more glad, confident morning for this shop-soiled Labour government.They seek to manage, not lead; to manipulate, not tell it as it is.I don\u2019t actually subscribe to the view that all power corrupts.But absolute power - when secured on the back of massive parliamentary majorities, which don\u2019t reflect the balance of political opinion in the country - can corrupt absolutely. The soul goes out of politics.So the system itself simply has to change.I tell you this.If the British House of Commons had known then what it knows now - about the events leading up to that fateful parliamentary debate and vote on committing our forces into war in Iraq - then the outcome could and should have been fundamentally different.But, of course, parliament did not know these things.Because the government\u2019s instinct is to shroud itself in secrecy. To act like the office of a president instead of as a collective cabinet government held to account by the elected House of Commons. This is supposed to be a parliamentary democracy. What we\u2019ve seen is a small clique driving us into a war, disregarding widespread public doubts.That is not acceptable.That\u2019s why we need fundamental constitutional reform. It\u2019s not arcane stuff any longer - if it ever was. Proportional representation? Let me just say one thing today about PR.Does anybody really think that a House of Commons in possession of adequate information; able to hold the executive to account; and elected by fair votes; that such a structured and functioning House of Commons would have signed off the case for war?Remind people of that next time they seek to dismiss the case for PR.And we\u2019ll remind the government of that as well - when their review of voting systems gets underway.Fair votes - fundamentally - are about the rights and the interests of the people.It\u2019s high time that we really did give power back to the people.But it\u2019s not just the system which needs to change.It\u2019s the values in politics which have to alter as well.The other two parties operate on the instinct of command and control.Our instinct is to consult and then to win consent.It\u2019s the very lack of that approach which is turning people away from political parties.We\u2019re the people to win them back. For the sake of the future.And the omens are promising.Among younger voters we\u2019re already ahead of the Conservatives. Perhaps not surprising when our party has led the fight against tuition and top-up fees.They\u2019re a party of defeat - and in retreat.In fact, they\u2019re increasingly not a truly national political party anymore. Consider this list. Liverpool, Newcastle, Gateshead, Manchester. And the London boroughs of Islington and Haringey. Now ask what these places have in common. Know the answer? You can phone a friend. But the friend can\u2019t be a local Conservative councillor in any of those places. Because there aren\u2019t any. That\u2019s the answer.That\u2019s what they have in common. And it\u2019s bad for democracy.If ever there was a case for fair votes in local government then that is it.We\u2019ve got to give these poor, downtrodden, under-represented Tories a chance.A space.A space that befits a third party.Remember - that party voted against the extra investment on health and social services.The Conservative choice is no choice at all in today\u2019s Britain.By fundamental contrast, we are a genuine 21st century party. We talk positively about solutions, rather than concentrating negatively on people\u2019s fears.And you know Britain is becoming a more liberal country. Our social attitudes as a country are changing. And changing for the better. Acceptance of the right openly to be gay has increased. And a good thing too - in a liberal society. Racial prejudice - alas, still with us - is nonetheless diminishing. A good thing too - in a liberal society. There\u2019s less discrimination against women. A good thing too in a liberal society.In the post-Blair era - yes, we should think of Tony now as a future, former prime minister - people will be looking for a different approach to politics and a different style of leadership. They want a more liberal and modern political attitude. Less the bonfire of the vanities - and more, occasionally, the fireside chat approach. Mind you, it depends who\u2019s giving the chat.With the current leader of the Conservative party, there\u2019d be a grave danger that the fire would be out half way through. Perhaps we should think of him as well as yet another future, former leader of his party? The other parties between them are offering us an unprecedented opportunity.The Tories remain paralysed - as they have been for the past ten years - by feuds and rifts. The government has lost its way. It\u2019s tired and fractious, and trust in the prime minister sinks by the day.Meanwhile the nationalists - Scots and Welsh alike - are rebels without a cause. The better devolution works, the more irrelevant independence becomes. The nationalists are left turning in on themselves, turning away from the voters.With the others in disarray, people want us to be more ambitious. And I don\u2019t lack ambition for us, I want to see our ambitions realised for them. Last year, I said it was a realistic ambition for us to start overtaking the Conservatives in British politics.This year, be in no doubt - we are overtaking the Conservatives. Be in no doubt - we are the only credible challenge to the government. And all that means going on being realistic and straight.That\u2019s the basis on which we shall frame our policy for the next general election.A liberal approach is rarely an easy option.Our stance on Iraq for a start. That was a tough choice. On the key vote committing the country to war, all 53 Liberal Democrat MPs were in the no lobby. All 53. And of course that decision by the 53 was one of many reasons why we now have a 54th MP. Jack Straw taunted us at the time about the iron discipline of the Liberal Democrats. He was jealous of course. But in truth this wasn\u2019t iron discipline, Jack. It was iron principle. Liberal principle. Two words which this government simply doesn\u2019t understand - liberal and principle.And it\u2019s principle which inspires trust.Politics means facing up to hard choices. And facing down prejudice, short-termism, the easy, tempting court of knee-jerk public reaction.That\u2019s why we led the attack over Camp Delta. You cannot claim to be backing international justice while denying its very application to prisoners in your jurisdiction. Is that soft on terrorism? No. It\u2019s hard on the need for universal human rights and the rule of international law. That\u2019s why we challenge over crime.Why are too many people in prison and yet too many crimes unsolved? Is that soft on crime? No. It\u2019s hard on the need to really tackle the causes of crime.That\u2019s why we urge fairness and tolerance over asylum and immigration. Is that soft over illegal entry to Britain? No. It\u2019s hard about the need for an efficient system that works in the interests of individuals and the state alike. And it\u2019s by arguing that hard, compelling case that we are taking the lead in combating the racist scourge of the BNP.Last year we led the way in the debate for making the funding and the control of our schools, our hospitals and our police services far more local. We\u2019ve got to remain at the cutting edge of that debate - and take our ideas further forward. And that\u2019s just what we\u2019ve been doing this week.The argument\u2019s no longer about how much the government needs to invest. It\u2019s moved on. It\u2019s increasingly about how well our taxes are being spent.People want straight talking about tax. And they\u2019re correct to.But they also want effective spending where they can see its benefits. And they\u2019re right there too.To get a better deal locally we have to start nationally.Strip away the unnecessary and the wasteful in and around Whitehall itself.Save at the centre to get more help and services for people in the local community.Earlier this year I proposed scrapping five Whitehall departments. With savings like slimming down the number of ministers and slimming down the number of ministries, we argue that you can cut central government spending by at least 1%. One percent? Doesn\u2019t sound much, does it? Well in fact, that 1% cut in central government is 1% of a colossal amount of our money. On today\u2019s prices it\u2019s equivalent to £5bn - each and every year. That\u2019s substantially more today than you get by putting an extra penny on income tax.And it all adds up to 150,000 more local nurses, local teachers or local police officers.Vote Liberal Democrat. For less central government and Whitehall interference. And for more local nurses and teachers and police officers. And more protection for essential local services like post offices.That\u2019ll be our message at the next general election. This is a defining gulf between us and our opponents.The Conservatives now say they too want to cut central government. But they won\u2019t. Because they love big, centralised government. They spent eighteen years building it - to serve their interests, not the people\u2019s. And what they want are tax cuts - to benefit the better off. And that means cuts in local services, encouraging those with money to go private, hitting hard those who most need support from government.That\u2019s not the Liberal Democrat way.We\u2019ll be there when you need us. Not when we think you need to be told what to do.We want less government and less interference in people\u2019s lives.We favour more choice and a better chance. Social liberalism and freedom must also be about harnessing the power of the market to do good.And Labour? Well, people have given up trusting them. This past year has well and truly put paid to that. People don\u2019t trust them because they see that they don\u2019t trust the people. This government doesn\u2019t actually trust the doctors and nurses, the teachers, the chief constables, to make genuinely local decisions. It\u2019s all driven by artificial targets set and controlled at the centre. Hardly a voice for the local professionals that people really do trust. And next to no voice at all for the councillors that people locally elect.But we are going to have to earn people\u2019s trust as we advance these arguments in the second half of this parliament. And that means being consistent. Which is why, as we develop our programme for the next general election, I intend to be even more insistent and rigorous. Our credibility depends on our self-discipline.So I pledge that any new role we give government must be matched by a corresponding government function which we scrap.With technology we can get much more out of far less.It\u2019s the system that\u2019s wrong, not the people who try to make it work. A lot of talented civil servants would welcome our improved approach.There\u2019s another aspect of our last general election manifesto which we must build upon for next time.The green aspect.In 2001, we highlighted in every policy section the positive green impact of the proposals being made. Next time we\u2019re going to have to be even more upfront. We\u2019ve always been ahead on green issues. I\u2019m determined we\u2019ll stay ahead. And we\u2019ll do that by sticking to one firm principle: making the economy work for the environment.Green growth.The polluter must pay.The environmentally friendly must be encouraged.And if we\u2019re serious about the green agenda that will demand still more tough choices.As the party of the future we cannot duck the biggest global threat to the future - the threat to the global environment. It\u2019s not just about big remote-sounding international treaties like Kyoto - although that must be implemented.At national level, it\u2019s about the scandalous waste of public money over civil nuclear power and about proper caution over GM crops. And at the level of every single household in the country, it\u2019s about recycling, home insulation, saving energy. And the availability of safe, affordable, reliable public transport.Consider this: since 1974, the true cost of bus travel - up by 66%.Rail travel - up by 85%.Car travel - down by 1%.Or consider this. Since 1997, the number of bureaucrats working in the rail industry has doubled. And over the same period, the number of trains delayed has also doubled. Could there perhaps be a connection here? Remember too that poor transport is a particular handicap for those older people who no longer drive or who have never owned a car. And Liberal Democrats have certainly won the respect of older people in this country for standing up for their rights and their dignity.We are the party which has fought against the complexity and unfairness of the pension credit. Which has fought for extra on the pension for the over 75s and over 80s. Which has campaigned long and hard for free personal care. But we must not forget too that there are increasing numbers of people in their late fifties and sixties whose concerns are not necessarily the same as those over 70. To take one example, many of them are frustrated that it is not possible to combine working part time with drawing part of their pension entitlement. I want our party to step up its efforts to reflect and champion the concerns of everybody who has reached the second half of their lives. To this end, I\u2019ve set up a new taskforce on the third age.There\u2019s another cause which has always been central to this party\u2019s beliefs - the cause of Europe. We are at a decisive moment in British politics where Europe is concerned.Tragically, a decisive moment presided over by an indecisive government. It\u2019s left to us to put the positive European case. And that\u2019s what we'll be doing in those all-important European elections next year.But we\u2019re sensible, not supine in our attitude towards Europe. The EU must be more open, less remote and more accountable. We are committed to Britain maintaining a national veto on fundamental constitutional issues - the right of our House of Commons to decide if British troops are ever sent into military conflict, the right of our House of Commons to decide budget and tax matters, the right of our House of Commons to decide pay and social security. We broadly welcome the blueprint for the new Europe set out in the European Constitutional Convention.Now this complex package must be decided upon at an Inter-governmental Conference. We can\u2019t yet know its eventual outcome. But we have always said that major constitutional changes should be subject to referendums. And that remains our position today.Next year we have another large-scale set of local elections. We have many strong messages to put across. And one of the best is our pledge to scrap the council tax. The Tories invented it. Labour keep forcing it up. They\u2019ll both have to defend it. But it\u2019s appallingly unfair and everyone knows that. This week the government admitted that it has reached the limits of acceptability. I agree. And it\u2019s the poorest - particularly poorer pensioners - who suffer the most.We must have a system of fair, transparent local income tax. A system founded on people\u2019s ability to pay. This year\u2019s campaign saw us make spectacular gains - from Tories and Labour alike. We\u2019ve panicked Michael Howard in Folkestone. It\u2019ll be something of a goodnight for him, come the general election. And as for Theresa May - I wouldn\u2019t want to be in her shoes in Maidenhead. And we\u2019ve shown the Labour Party that the days are over when they could take strongholds like Durham and York for granted.Next June, we\u2019re set to advance deeper still into Tory and Labour territory. Labour had better watch out in places like Newcastle, Huddersfield and Sheffield. And the Tories had better watch out everywhere. We\u2019re coming after you both - and the voters are coming with us.And, of course, there\u2019s the campaign for Mayor of London. Well, we start with the best candidate - Simon Hughes. And the only candidate with the genuinely united backing of a genuinely united party. I\u2019d be astonished if the word Conservative passed Steve Norris\u2019s lips during his campaign. He\u2019ll be more the Jarvis candidate. And I wonder if Ken is now as anxious to rejoin the Labour Party as he was a week ago.But Simon is a Liberal Democrat to his fingertips. I\u2019ll tell you the difference between Simon and Ken. Simon would be an outstanding servant of the people of London. Ken\u2019s another one who\u2019s far too keen to be their master. And of course Ken has a turning circle tighter than a London taxi. \u2018I don\u2019t want to keep running around spin-doctoring\u2019 \u2013 That\u2019s what he said two years ago. And now he has more press officers than No 10 Downing Street. The court of King Ken is growing larger and larger. Like the Labour government, Ken has a mounting problem with trust. And there\u2019s certainly no reason to trust his judgement. Remember his warning last week to the voters in his old constituency: \u2018the Liberal Democrat campaign could even deter enough Labour voters to hand victory to the Tories on a small turnout.\u2019 Watch out Ken. We\u2019ve already captured your backyard. You only have squatter\u2019s rights to the rest of London.So time is running out for our opponents.Because a great moment of opportunity is opening up for us To be able to seize that moment we have to be clear among ourselves - and to be clear with the public. We\u2019re at our best and we achieve our best when we stand united on our integrity and independence. More and more people have moved from disappointment to despair with this government.More and more people have come to despise this government.We offer something different, fresh - and better. We\u2019re gaining the support of millions of voters.We stand united, we stand independent, we stand determined.We stand as the best hope for Britain\u2019s future.

aVIt\u2019s three-party British politics. That\u2019s been the real lesson of this year. Take those local elections. Big Liberal Democrat gains. Taking on and trouncing Labour in places like Cardiff and Cambridge, Liverpool and Newcastle; making big gains from them in Leeds and Manchester as well. While in most of these places, the Conservatives just simply disappeared.You know it is telling indeed that the voters did not think it worthwhile electing a single Conservative councillor in a place like Oxford. And if you take Scotland and Wales into account and they\u2019re scarcely a national UK political party any longer. And Liberal Democrats continued making gains from the Conservatives in places like Portsmouth, St Albans and Watford.In his first speech as the new Liberal Democrat Leader in Newcastle - after thirty years of one-party Labour rule - this is what Peter Arnold had to say: 'For Newcastle Liberal Democrats, one of the most important success criteria will be the extent to which we are able to give the city back to the people...We will be doing things differently, by making sure the Council is less politically partisan and more inclusive. We will be offering Opposition Groups the opportunity to adopt a more positive role in the council\u2019s affairs.'Now there\u2019s the difference for you - in a nutshell.As that onetime Liberal, Winston Churchill, put it: \u2018In victory - magnanimity.\u2019 That\u2019s the breath of fresh air that we bring to British politics - and to local communities with it. That\u2019s why we\u2019re on the move. And that\u2019s why we pushed Labour into third place for the first time ever in a national election.Add to those the European elections results. We stuck firmly to our reforming pro-European principles. And the outcome? Two more Liberal Democrat Members of the European Parliament. Fiona Hall in the North East. And Saj Karim in the North West. Saj - our first ever elected Liberal Democrat parliamentarian from an ethnic minority community. And about time too. But not unique for long.In Leicester South - just as in Brent East last year - we leapfrogged the Conservatives - we came from third place to take on Labour and win. Congratulations, Parmjit Gill. And never forget we came within an ace of doing the same in Birmingham Hodge Hill as well. Well done, Nicola Davies. So fantastic results. Each and every one.And when you leave Bournemouth make sure that your next stop is Hartlepool. That\u2019s where I\u2019m heading next. Immediately after this speech. Lembit Opik is flying me there. I kid you not. Greater love hath no man for our party than his is prepared to place his life in Lembit\u2019s safe keeping in the skies above us. So I expect to see you all there in Hartlepool. Well, I really do hope to see you all there in Hartlepool!We are the challengers.The Conservatives have already conceded they aren\u2019t in the Hartlepool race. And it\u2019s a simple statement of fact that the Conservatives are now out of the race in most of urban Britain. And that the only effective challenge to Labour is coming from the Liberal Democrats. People know we\u2019ve done it before - and we can do it again in Hartlepool. If we go out there and make our case - make no mistake. We CAN do it.I want to talk to you today about the future. The future of two things. The future of our party. And also the future of our country. We want the two increasingly to go hand in hand. We know we can make the political weather - tuition fees, the council tax. And we know we\u2019re capable of much more yet.But our success also poses certain questions - and rightly so. Are these people up to it? Are those Liberal Democrats ready for the task in hand? Can we be sure we know what they stand for?Well we stand for three things above all else. Freedom. Fairness. Trust. Those are our watchwords. Those are the core principles against which our policies must be measured. And they are the principles which match the increasingly liberal instincts of 21st century Britain.A Britain now of many faiths, many colours, many languages; a variety of family structures; far greater life expectancy. And working patterns our grandparents would scarcely recognise. Social mobility and fast communications; high aspirations and far less deference; openness and tolerance about sexual orientation. A Britain where the individual counts for so much.  But still a Britain where a sense of community matters.In so many ways that\u2019s a liberal Britain.It\u2019s our task now to turn these instinctively liberal attitudes into positive votes for the party of British liberal democracy. And it is also a Britain in which the way we are governed is being transformed.We have a Scottish Parliament and National Assembly for Wales, both elected by fairer votes - involving proportional representation. And on November 4th people in the North East will have a referendum for a regional assembly. We\u2019re out campaigning hard for that - and I\u2019ll be back on that campaign trail again shortly.Devolution is at its best when it gets things done. And it\u2019s getting things done that show people what we value and what we stand for.It\u2019s been a big responsibility for us, in Wales, where we helped bring much needed stability to the Assembly at a crucial moment - and better policies as a result. Reduced class sizes; more environmental initiatives; free school milk; Free admission to art galleries and museums, recognising that the legacy and the vitality of Celtic culture demands the decision-makers to understand not just the price of things but also the value of things. As a result - people know more about what we stand for. And they\u2019re voting accordingly. Impressive gains this year in Cardiff, Bridgend and Swansea - and so many other places across the country. And in Wales we carry on pushing for an extension to the law making powers of the Assembly - that has to be the next logical and necessary step forward.And in Scotland where the partnership there has been delivering on many of our top priorities:Free personal care for the elderly - delivered.Abolishing tuition fees - delivered.Fair votes for local government elections - being delivered.But it doesn\u2019t stop there.Liberal Democrats in government in Scotland have set the new agenda for devolution. A Scottish agenda that deals with long-term challenges - like poor health; the environment; the need to improve education, the foundation for an enterprising country. New legislation announced by Jim Wallace just this month to provide free eye and dental checks for all. And a new Environment Bill announced by Ross Finnie so that a green thread runs through the heart of Scottish government, one where every policy will be audited for its environmental impact.Liberal Democrats getting things done. And demonstrating how our approach - every time - is rooted in freedom, fairness and trust.I\u2019ve done a lot of travelling across Britain this year. And with it a lot of listening.I listened to the students on campus in Plymouth, worried about their steadily deepening debts and how on earth they would ever escape them.I listened to the young mother in a Leicester shop, troubled that teachers are not getting the time to teach her children properly.I listened to the Asian grandmother in Huddersfield, who told me about being genuinely afraid, for the first time in over thirty years in her local community, because of the growth of mindless racism among an unrepresentative few.And then the high street traders in Birmingham, utterly sick and tired of senseless vandalism against their properties.And their local customers, equally scared about street violence and the threat of crime as it affects them personally.The pensioners in Exeter - bitter about their dwindling resources, confused about losing their pension books, unhappy about the level of pensions themselves and angry about seemingly never-ending council tax rises.And to the doctor in Norwich, expressing his sheer frustration at the remote, command and control from London which characterises so much of this government\u2019s mismanagement of our National Health Service.And then the school pupils in Cardiff, thinking aloud about pollution and climate change - uncertain about the environment they would inherit.This is our Britain today; these are typical of people\u2019s concerns.Well, if you seek to lead, first you must listen.People have a huge desire to be listened to, for politicians to take the time to understand their problems. And address those problems with solutions. It is we Liberal Democrats that are now providing the answers.For students - when the pupil aspires to become the student, we would encourage and enable them - by stopping tuition fees and axing top-up fees - one of the most socially retrograde acts of this government, when what Britain needs is a university system affordable to all.For parents - we will equip children for life - because children well cared for and well taught in their early years have a far better chance of success. So we will reduce class sizes for the youngest children and give teachers time to teach and children time to learn by abolishing unnecessary tests and red tape. And we would ensure that every child, in every classroom, in every school is taught by a qualified teacher in the relevant subject.That\u2019s what the Liberal Democrats stand for.For those in fear of racism - first, a real lead from politicians - celebrating the fact that our country is better, it\u2019s richer and more diverse, precisely because it is a multicultural society. And that we have been prepared to stand out and if necessary alone in having no truck with short-term, knee-jerk responses to complex social issues. That we won\u2019t pander to the lowest common denominator over asylum and immigration. But we\u2019ll reform the systems - to make them fairer and faster. And that we respect people\u2019s genuine religious and cultural identities at community level.That\u2019s what the Liberal Democrats stand for.On crime - 10,000 more police on the streets and cutting the time spent on paperwork, so they can spend more time tackling drug dealers, muggers and yobs. Use prison as an opportunity to educate in the basics - numeracy, literacy - so that when they get out people will be far better able to find work and far less likely to reoffend. And for the victims of crime open up the courts so that they can confront the offenders - and speed up the system of compensation as well.That\u2019s what the Liberal Democrats stand for.For pensioners - we will continue - to make and win the case for axing the unjust, unfair, increasingly unworkable council tax. And its replacement by a fair, local income tax - based on people\u2019s ability to pay. We\u2019ll stop the scandal of elderly people having to pay for their personal care - and probably losing the family home in the process. We would deliver free long-term care for the elderly. And all pensioners over 75 - the war generation - should be entitled to a pension which lifts them above means-testing - £100 extra a month. No one should be demeaned in their old age anymore.And this specific pledge to women, who have long been discriminated against because of the way the pension system works. For the first time you will be treated equally. For the first time you will have a pension in your own right.That\u2019s what the Liberal Democrats stand for.On health - We would put patients first and free doctors and nurses from Whitehall meddling. Liberal Democrats would hack away the red tape, abolish the absurd targets and free our frustrated doctors and nurses. Let the local community and the local doctors and local nurses make the decisions. They are far better placed to get them right. And more emphasis than ever before should be placed on prevention of ill health and promotion of healthy lifestyles. We truly need a health and not just a sickness service.That\u2019s what the Liberal Democrats stand for.On the environment - our determination to make the environment count at every level of Government means thinking green in every area. Yes, it\u2019s big picture stuff - from the food chain to climate change, energy to trade, aviation to sustainable international development.Britain can\u2019t do this alone. The Prime Minister is right to use our presidency of the EU and the G8 next year to press for consensus. But if we can lead by example, if we can achieve our Kyoto targets ahead of time, we can encourage other countries to sign up. If we can deliver 20% of our electricity needs through renewable energy by 2020, that would be leading by example.Take air travel - which is fast become the world\u2019s biggest polluter. We should be shifting taxes on aviation away from the passenger and onto the plane itself which does the polluting. Now that would be leading by example too, encouraging better fuel efficiency and therefore less pollution.But quality of life actually begins at home - it\u2019s in your street, around your community. And our approach to the environment must begin there too. The green thread that should run through all aspects of government, should run through all aspects of our lives also. So more park and ride schemes for our towns and cities - cutting pollution in our streets. More local recycling initiatives - showing how all of us can make that difference within our own homes. Cutting waste - reusing - improving.That\u2019s what the Liberal Democrats stand for.Freedom. Fairness. Trust.Because that\u2019s what these - and many more - policies are rooted in.Policies designed to create more freedom. Based on social fairness. Not bogus, false choices - designed to distract. But real, quality local choice - designed to deliver. And it\u2019s all underpinned by economic fairness as well. This is crucial to our credibility and critical to our success.From the outset, I have insisted that we have the most watertight set of tax and expenditure proposals possible. We want to tax more fairly and spend more wisely. Isn\u2019t it a disgrace that after 7 years of a supposedly Labour government the poorest 20% contribute more of their income in tax than do the richest 20%? We don\u2019t want the politics of economic envy. But we do want the politics of social equity.What does that mean?It means asking the top 1% of income earners to pay a top marginal rate of tax of 50p for every pound earned above £100,000. That pays for our immediate commitments to:But spending on our priorities does not mean higher taxes across the board. It means looking hard as well at how much Government spends and getting value for money for taxpayers.And we\u2019ve already found further large savings - at least £5bn a year - by cutting back on big, centralised government and redirecting money to priority spending:The figures add up; the balance sheet is balanced.Freedom. Fairness. Trust.It is trust that has to underpin everything else. And it\u2019s winning public trust that is going to be the biggest challenge of all.Over the course of this parliament one issue more than any other has helped define just what the Liberal Democrats stand for in the minds of millions of our fellow citizens.You know what I\u2019m talking about. And the people know exactly what we\u2019ve been talking about. From the outset we have provided rational, principled and consistent opposition to the war in Iraq. We\u2019ve done it without exaggeration. We\u2019ve done it without name-calling. We\u2019ve done it - quite simply - because we believed it was the right thing to do. Now I believe the vast majority of people have made their minds up - one way or the other.Donald Rumsfeld promised shock and awe.What we got was shock and then steadily increasing horror.The Prime Minister promised action on the Middle East Road Map.What we got was little progress and more violence.There\u2019s a sullen, and increasingly angry mood on the issue. And understandably so. Not least when Kofi Annan declares the war illegal. When the Iraq Survey Group is expected to conclude that the WMD were not there. When the Foreign Office warned of the likely disastrous consequences. And when it appears the Government told the Bush administration, a full year before the war started, that it would not budge in its support for their policy of regime change - and yet the Prime Minister told our Parliament and our people that it was all about weapons of mass destruction.There is a fundamental question that the Prime Minister has consistently failed to answer. I asked him this in the House of Commons in the run up to war, and again as recently as the 20th of July this year during the debate on the Butler Report.\u2018Did he advise President Bush privately - long before the United Nations route was formally abandoned - that if the President decided to prosecute an invasion of Iraq, the British would be in active military support, come what may?\u2019\u2018If he did advise the President to that effect, when did such an exchange take place?\u2019When Parliament next convenes, the Prime Minister must take the first opportunity to come to the Despatch Box and make a full statement. It\u2019s time we got an answer. And if the Prime Minister still refuses, the people can make a judgement. There is the ultimate verdict of the general election itself. Lord Hutton did not provide the answer. Nor did Lord Butler.The decision to decline to participate in Lord Butler\u2019s enquiry was a tough one at the time. But it was the correct decision as events have proved. And at the end of the day that is what trust in political leadership has to be all about. What trust today in what our leaders told us at the time about Iraq? And what kind of corrosive effect does that have on politics generally? Yet the tragic experience of Iraq should have the opposite effect. And I believe it can.It should galvanise people to participate, to make their views known through the ballot box.It should strengthen all of our resolves to rededicate ourselves to the rebuilding of effective international institutions, to the repairing of shattered alliances among long-standing friends.But within our own country - one lesson must be learned.This country is still crying out for an effective political system that responds to them and listens to the people. More openness. More accountability. Politicians taking responsibility for their decisions.Never again must this country be led into war on the basis of questionable intelligence.Never again must this country be sold an incomplete and false prospectus as a basis for unilateral military action without the sanction of the United Nations.Never again must Britain find itself on such a basis so distanced from principal partners within Europe.Never again should our troops find themselves without proper and adequate equipment in a war zone.Never again should such supreme Prime Ministerial power be allowed to progress without sufficient checks and balances.And without the proper operation of collective Cabinet government itself.And never again should a so-called \u2018official opposition\u2019 be entitled to that name when it so pathetically fails to fulfil its most basic parliamentary function and duty - the provision of constructive and effective questioning of the executive of the day.Never again.But we should not just look back in anger.There is every sign that we need to look forward with increasing anxiety.And that is why the Prime Minister should also take that opportunity to give a cast iron guarantee that the United Kingdom will not support unilateral military action against Iran.You know some commentators will tell you that our recent victories are just the fallout from Iraq. That the Lib Dems are just the protest vote. Well, let\u2019s face it. There has been a lot for people to protest about. But we are being seen more and more as a party which does win elections, which does exercise responsible representation, which has become increasingly comfortable with the duties and the disciplines of power.Some also say that you can\u2019t go chasing left-wing voters and right-wing voters at one and the same time - while remaining consistent and true to your principles.It is a deeply flawed analysis - based on a fundamental misreading of today\u2019s Britain.Why? Because for the vast majority of people who live their lives in an increasingly interdependent world, facing increasingly complex issues, for them the old-fashioned nostrums of right and left no longer apply. They\u2019re looking for solution-based politics. Politics which address their everyday needs.There is a shift in the way people view politics, one that transcends any single issue. Iraq has been part of this, but by no means is it the whole story. I come across it, day in and day out. People see that the Labour and Conservative agendas are converging. Whereas ours is about having the freedom to make the most of our lives. It\u2019s about what is fair - taxation based on ability to pay and delivery for all not the few. And that you have to be able to trust your political leaders and your political parties to deliver.There\u2019s a deep-rooted sense in our country that somehow all is not quite right. That somehow all is not as we\u2019re being told it is. An underlying sense of doubt. Made worse by the fact that people just don\u2019t trust this Government. This Government flags up the big, long-term difficult issues - pension provision, funding local services, global warming - but then puts off serious discussion and decisions until safely beyond another general election.But people don\u2019t identify with the Conservatives - because that party just doesn\u2019t connect with them. They hark back to a Britain that is no more. They\u2019re out of touch with the Britain of today. No wonder they fall back on hard-core instincts - and increasingly belongs to all our yesterdays. In huge swathes of the country it\u2019s the Conservatives who are now firmly established - as the third party. In so much of the country a vote for the Conservatives is now a wasted vote. The third party - on their third leader in as many years - and a third leader who\u2019s just had his third reshuffle in less than a year.Well, they say variety is the spice of life.For the Conservatives it looks to me much more like the kiss of death.They belong to the past.We\u2019re working for the future.We are moving from a party of protest to a party of power.Three-party politics is here - and here to stay.You know, at times this past year I\u2019ve felt rather nostalgic. 21 years as a Member of Parliament. You learn quite a lot after more than two decades doing any job. Direct personal experience does teach along the way. That\u2019s why, whenever I\u2019m asked to speculate - an occupational hazard - I always suggest to people not to waste time on the crystal ball, but instead learn from the history book.It\u2019s really quite simple. For the country to believe in a political party - first that party has to believe in itself.We\u2019re at our best, we perform best, we persuade best - when we spend our time talking positively about what it is that we have to offer. And we\u2019re far more likely to achieve that from a position of principled party independence - not one distracted by noises off.So when people ask me \u2018Where does your party stand?\u2019 my starting point is not the crystal ball. Instead, it\u2019s crystal clear. No nods, no winks, no deals, no stitch ups.If, on polling day at next general election, more people vote Liberal Democrat - then the next day and in the next parliament what you will get are more Liberal Democrats working for more liberal democracy. Not something else.But working all out for better public policies from parliament. Prepared to work with others on issues of principle - like Europe.But not prepared to surrender our essential political independence along the way.That\u2019s our Liberal Democrat pledge to the people.So there is a fundamental choice before us all at the next General Election. The British people have probably not more than 225 days left to choose between two essentially conservative parties - and the real alternative which is the Liberal Democrats.225 days.Then a stark choice. A serious choice.And we, increasingly, are the winning choice.Because all that we say and all that we do is based on those fundamentals.Freedom. Fairness. TrustThat\u2019s us.That\u2019s what we want from our politics. That\u2019s what we stand for. That\u2019s what we want our country to stand for. At home - and abroad. That\u2019s Liberal Democracy.

aVSplits, plots, rival camps, backbiting, leadership speculation: how I wish I could be a fly on the wall here at the Tory party conference in two weeks\u2019 time. Some things just don\u2019t change do they? The Conservatives are having yet another leadership election. Their fourth in seven years. I can see their conference slogan already. \u2018We\u2019re not sure what we\u2019re thinking.\u2019Meanwhile, back in Labourland, the jockeying goes on as ever between the Blairites and the Brownites. Tony Blair, desperate to protect his legacy; Gordon Brown, desperate to end it. The prime minister was delighted he had a hand in bringing the Olympics to London. It\u2019s said on hearing the news he punched the air. He\u2019s getting more like John Prescott everyday. But at least he\u2019s not yet claimed credit for the Ashes. Even he has learned the lesson that you can\u2019t win with a team of eleven spinners!Now, at the general election it was crucially important to see our liberal tradition again confirmed as the growing force in politics:It is my determination that we, as a party, continue to make that fundamental restatement of liberal values in the politics of our country.Liberalism testedIt\u2019s remarkable the pace of events since that general election. Some events of the most immediate and terrible seriousness - like the awful consequences of the hurricane in the United States, the continuing nightmare in Iraq, and of course, terrorism here at home.Above all, the London bombings in July have made it critical for those liberal values to be reasserted. The terrorist seeks to smash the most fundamental liberty of all: the right to lead our everyday lives on the basic assumption of safety. There can be no compromise with such a mentality.It is the government\u2019s fundamental duty to ensure the security of every individual citizen. And the responsibility of politicians is to frame laws which give effect to that principle. But the response must always be proportionate to the threat. That has always been our party\u2019s approach. It long predates those appalling attacks in London in July.The government\u2019s reaction to those tube bombings has been mixed - but so typical. At first it was measured; then it was muddled. Spin and counterspin. When what we really needed was leadership and clarity.This is no time for a turf war between No 10 and the Home Office. And it is no time either for the prime minister to play politics with the leaders of the opposition. I believe when the country feels threatened it is important that we are seen to be working together to find an appropriate structure for dealing with terrorists in our midst.But I won\u2019t play a walk-on part. This process can\u2019t be all show and no substance. We now have the details of what the government is proposing. And I want to make it clear: we shall not accept what is on offer.There can be no consensus on detaining people for three months without charge. That\u2019s a prison sentence by any other name.This party will oppose any blanket extension of custody powers. This proposal undermines our most basic rights and eats into our most cherished freedoms. If we undermine the foundations of our legal system then we let the terrorists win.There is always a temptation for governments: see a problem and announce a quick fix. Labour\u2019s gut reaction is to chase a headline, where, as I said earlier, leadership has to be about judgment. New law must be law which works, not a raft of unnecessary measures which simply sound tough. That is why we will oppose the unworkable offence of \u2018glorifying terrorism.\u2019 It is a badly drafted proposal that, frankly, won\u2019t stand up in court. The government says \u2018but we all know what we are talking about.\u2019 What complacency. That is no way to make laws. You can\u2019t be vague when framing legislation. In fact, the bill already contains a better solution that will serve the same purpose: that of the incitement to commit terrorist acts.It is my belief that how this administration deals with the ongoing threat of terrorism will be one of the defining aspects of this parliament. Ours will be a distinct voice in this debate. And, just as we Liberal Democrats opposed the flawed logic of that war in Iraq, we will oppose the flawed government claim that we have to surrender our fundamental rights in order to improve our security.And I will take no lessons from the Conservatives on these matters. They have only been consistent in their inconsistencies.There is just one party which has been tested again and again and stuck firmly to its principles on these touchstone issues. It\u2019s our party, the Liberal Democrats.That is not to say we will oppose for opposition\u2019s sake. Some aspects of the government\u2019s proposals are good.We agree it should be an offence to plan terrorist acts.We agree it should be an offence to provide training to terrorists.We agree it should be an offence to incite terrorism.But, even if we can get our domestic response to terrorism right, we will not succeed unless, and until, we get our foreign policy right. Along with President Bush, Tony Blair\u2019s so-called \u2018war on terror\u2019 has been so badly implemented that it has actually boosted the terror threat, not diminished it. When they should have been concentrating on bringing a proper peace to Afghanistan, Bush and Blair waged war in Iraq. It is our stance on the war in Iraq which has defined the Liberal Democrats for so many people. And, however hard this government tries, it cannot \u2018move on.\u2019It cannot move on when the prime minister remains in denial.It can\u2019t move on when people are dying every day.And it cannot move on when our British troops are still there in the firing line.It is absurd for this government to pretend that what has happened in Iraq has no impact beyond its borders. The reality is that invading Iraq was a terrible mistake. And, given all the warnings that I - and this party - made at the time, the failure to plan properly for the aftermath is unforgivable.The invasion of Iraq has created a volatile, fragmented country now facing the threat of civil war. The terrorists have been given a new lease of life. Thousands have been killed in Iraq since the elections there. The UN mandate is running out. So hard choices must now be made.Parliament must play a central part in those choices.The government must confront the fact that the presence of British and American forces in Iraq is a part of the problem. After this week\u2019s events in Basra, we cannot sustain the myth that Iraqis see coalition troops as liberators. What they see is an occupation.The government must wake up and admit its responsibility. The prime minister\u2019s pride should not get in the way of finding a solution for the people of Iraq. His blind support for George Bush is continuing to cost lives: Iraqi citizens and coalition soldiers. It\u2019s time he laid before parliament a proper, structured exit strategy for the phased withdrawal of British forces from Iraq. They have served there with distinction, courage and skill.But prime minister, what people are asking now is: \u2018When can our troops come home?\u2019A liberal BritainJust as we showed over Iraq, we have achieved the most when we have stuck to our liberal values. Now, more than ever, we must avoid getting distracted by noises off about whether we are left or right. Viewing British politics through the prism of left v right is completely the wrong vantage point and it leads to quite a misleading view.Why?Because all experience shows that the vast majority of people no longer see their choices in old-fashioned left-right terms. It is no longer possible to categorise most issues like that.Just look at the things we have been discussing at conference this very week:These don\u2019t fall neatly into the old left/right axis.Our solutions are liberal solutions based on our liberal principles.Proposals to make the Post Office network viable and give Royal Mail the commercial freedom to compete.Not left - not right - but liberal.Proposals to reform the European Union budget.Not left - not right - but liberal.Proposals on tackling antisocial behaviour - solutions that Liberal Democrats in power up and down the country are already implementing.Not left - not right - but liberal solutions that actually work.Colleagues, we must not allow ourselves to be led by the media and define our debate in their terms. This left/right, either/or mindset is out of date and out of time. It is Liberal Democrat solutions that this country needs. Our take on things. Not the false interpretation of others, many of whom don\u2019t wish us to succeed.And let me say this clearly and firmly. There is absolutely no contradiction between economic liberalism and financial discipline on the one hand, and fairness and social justice on the other. I find it deeply ironic that, as we approach the centenary of the greatest reforming Liberal government ever, that some people still believe you cannot reconcile the two. Those who argue that somehow this party must choose one or the other would have received short shrift from Asquith and Lloyd George. They would have found that argument utterly ludicrous. We must display the liberal values that lie behind a particular stance on an issue, or a particular approach to a policy area. In doing so we achieve lasting political credibility. And it\u2019s bringing results.We run cities: Liverpool, Newcastle, Durham, Cambridge, York.We run county councils, like Somerset, Devon and Cornwall.London boroughs like Islington and Southwark.Today we have MPs in almost every major city: Manchester, Leeds, London, Bristol, Cardiff, Birmingham, Glasgow, Edinburgh.At the election, we doubled our representation in Wales.And in Scotland the result gave us more seats and more votes than any party except Labour. The SNP down to third and the Tories a poor fourth.When you look at our record in government in Scotland it demonstrates how successful we are at implementing our policies that spring from those liberal values.In Jenny Willott, Julia Goldsworthy and Jo Swinson we have the youngest MPs in Wales, England and Scotland - all women elected to parliament as Liberal Democrats.A liberal identitySo the political framework in Britain is changing. And we are an integral part of that process. But I believe the changes go deeper than that.A debate has now been joined about Britishness, about our sense of national identity. And what\u2019s so telling are the morose tones of so many when they address the issue. They talk of a disconnected country; a society ill at ease with itself; a crisis in our national identity. Profound questions are being raised over race and faith as well; concerns which go to the heart of our multi-racial, multi-faith, multicultural society. Concerns which cannot adequately be addressed if politicians merely fall back on simplistic responses to complex questions, or speak in emotive or pejorative terms about what it should mean to be British today.I am far more an optimist.Perhaps it\u2019s because I've been born, educated and brought up, and always considered home to be the Highlands. I think of myself as a highlander first. But with it a Scot - and with that I\u2019m British. And through that a citizen of Europe. When England play Scotland at rugby, or, much more rarely now, in football, I have not doubt who I want to win. But I cheered England through the Ashes. I got caught up in the national mood. I\u2019m clear about my identity. And in that, I am no different to 10s of millions of British citizens.We have to recognise the complexity of our country - from city to city, community to community.We have to recognise that the best way to tackle the tensions in our society is community by community.We need stronger local politics.And that requires a changed mindset among politicians and civil servants alike.The truth is the gentleman in Whitehall does not know best. If he had then many of the present difficulties might have been addressed more successfully and much sooner.The same is true for our public services. Labour\u2019s obsession with authoritarian central control - with this culture of target setting and micromanaging - distorts community priorities. It means that local people are making do with inadequate and badly structured services. Yet they feel they don\u2019t have the power to make real change in their communities.That is why I am determined that in our policy review we will look at new and innovative ways of devolving power, of raising more money locally, to be spent locally, on what local people really want.Ours is the liberal conscience and the liberal voice. It\u2019s vital and authentic.Because, to a far greater extent than any of the others, we are a political party that is instinctively decentralist.Community solutions are the first and best approach. And why?Because we trust people.The health of British democracyBut what trust can people have in our electoral system in return?Let\u2019s be clear about one unarguable conclusion of this year\u2019s general election. Ask yourself: how many votes did it take to elect a Liberal Democrat MP? Well it was 96,000. And to elect a Labour MP? The equivalent figure? Just 26,000.People have every right to feel cheated by a system in which four out of five eligible voters did not vote Labour, yet people woke up the next morning to find a majority Labour government.After all the other arguments collapsed over Iraq, Tony Blair fell back into saying that it was essential to help establish democracy. He might have had a bit more credibility if he set an example here at home. Because what kind of democracy was it that delivered back in May?A democracy which returns an outright majority on little more than a third of the popular vote.How can we any longer call something like that \u2018the popular vote\u2019?How \u2018popular\u2019 was the government, even among those who did vote Labour?That\u2019s Blairite democracy for you.This prime minister has got to realise: he may have a working majority, but he cannot claim any moral mandate. This argument, about Westminster voting reform, just won\u2019t go away. And we\u2019re not going to let it go away. Even with the odds stacked against us, the truth is at this election, Labour became just as worried about the Liberal Democrats as they ever were about the Tories. And in that they were undoubtedly correct.We represent a change to the status quo. An end to their comfortable two-party system. We threaten directly their arrogance in power. And I say to all those who held their nose last May and voted Labour without conviction: don\u2019t get fooled again.But you know what I reject most of all is the idea of British politics being a desultory contest between two essentially conservative parties. One calls itself Conservative. The other conducts itself as conservative. I don\u2019t care if one is led by a Davis or a Clarke. I don\u2019t care if the other is led by a Blair or a Brown. What people don\u2019t want, don\u2019t deserve and don\u2019t demand is yet another conservative party in British politics. Small c or capital C. That part of the pitch is already overcrowded.And I can assure all of you: I did not enter public life with the ambition of leading yet another conservative party in British politics. I\u2019m happy to leave it to others to compete over a law of diminishing returns. One where the level of Labour support is on the slide. And the Conservatives cannot break through a losing glass ceiling.At the next general election you could well be looking at a situation where it is understood that the Conservatives cannot win. But that Labour can certainly lose.That\u2019s our opportunity.That\u2019s our challenge.Ambition for BritainWhen this Labour government falls - which one day it surely will - the party that is ready for the challenge of government will be ours. I will lead this party into the next election as the clear alternative to a discredited Labour government. It\u2019s my ambition to lead the first government in the liberal tradition in the 21st Century. Because, it is my ambition to restore to government in Britain the fairness, the decency and the tolerance that should be the hallmarks of our democracy and our society.I want a Britain that tackles poverty - and with it the poverty of ambition. I want a Britain in which every one of our children has the opportunities I had growing up - and more besides.A Britain in which ambition and opportunity is not diminished by the circumstances of birth.I want a Britain which pays its debt to our older generation.Which looks after them when they are ill and in need.Which provides our pensioners with dignity, security and peace of mind.I want a society that tackles crime - but really does tackle the causes of crime.I want a Britain where older people again feel safe to answer their doors.Where parents can let their children walk to school - or play in the park - without the incessant worry.Where our streets and town centres are free from fear at night.And I want a system of prison, punishment and rehabilitation that produces people fit for work not just fit for reoffending.I want a Britain with first-class public services, so that people can be treated well in a local hospital, and they don\u2019t have to shop around for a decent school, they are there on the doorstep.I want a Britain that has a vibrant growing economy that rewards success, not penalises it.That encourages innovation and entrepreneurs, setting them free from over-regulation and the dead hand of government.Only in that way can we hope to generate the revenue to afford the world-class services we need as a country.I want my child to grow up in a Britain in which the environment is protected.I want him to enjoy our natural landscape every bit as much as I do.To breathe clean air.It will be our children and their children who will feel the full consequences of climate change.We have got to get serious about this.I\u2019m sick and tired of hearing Tony Blair make excuse after excuse for George Bush.We need action and we need it now.I want a Britain that is pro-European and proud of it.That lives up to its responsibilities on the international stage, that values international law, that is genuinely outward looking and emphatically internationalist.Because I want a Britain that is respected around the world.These are the ambitions that brought me into politics in the first place 25 years ago.These are the things that have driven me over those years - and still drive me. They are what I want the Liberal Democrats to achieve. Not for me, not for us, but for Britain. A Liberal Democrat Britain.

aVThis has been my first autumn conference as Liberal Democrat leader. And I have enjoyed it - particularly since Tuesday lunchtime.But while I have enjoyed my first, others will be hoping to enjoy their last. Labour is preparing to pick a new leader. You may have read that the prime minister is planning a farewell tour for a grateful nation. The Chris Evans show is on the list. So is Blue Peter \u2013 he\u2019ll be wanting a free badge out of that. And then there are to be Songs of Praise. Details are top secret. But in the best new Labour tradition, they have been leaked. And this time, I have received a copy. The hymns are definitely fit for purpose. To start with, a hymn about new Labour\u2019s current situation: Oh hear us when we cry to thee, For those in peril on the sea. Then, to lift the spirits of the party faithful: Oh, what a friend we have in Gordon. And finally, before the curtain falls, repentance: Dear Lord and Father of Mankind, Forgive our Foolish Ways.Liberal Democrats, we are unique among the major British parties in the way our conference works. The decisions you made this week mattered. The debates we\u2019ve had have meant something. We have demonstrated our belief in liberalism, our commitment to democracy, and our unity of purpose.Next week its Labour\u2019s turn. You won\u2019t see any liberalism from them. There won\u2019t be any democracy. And there won\u2019t be votes that matter. Half of them want Blair out. And the other half don\u2019t want Brown in.After that, it\u2019s the Conservatives\u2019 turn. See if you can find a policy. Just one will do. The Tories are determined to avoid policy decisions at all costs. They\u2019ve chosen to adopt the oak tree as their new party logo. For a policy-free party, that seems an entirely appropriate symbol. It can take an oak tree 50 years to bear any fruit.There is a serious point here. Political debate in this country is in danger of losing sight of what matters. It is in danger of losing its substance. In the last few weeks, Labour has been tearing itself apart. The Conservatives are concentrating on image and little else. Despite all the challenges our country is facing, neither of them has anything to say on the issues that matter.But this week we Liberal Democrats have shown what politics ought to be about. The issues that matter to people - public services, the environment, crime, taxation - a fairer and more peaceful world.This country needs a party of principle. A party that is confident and consistent. A party that is prepared say this is what we stand for, and this is what we will do. A party of policy, not of symbolism. A party of substance, not of spin.This week we have unveiled the most progressive plan for tax reform this country has seen in decades. It provides the British people with the politics of substance. This is about taking the tough decisions that really make a difference to people\u2019s lives.Taxation is at the heart of good government. And if a political party cannot or will not tell you how it will tax, then it does not deserve a single vote. Mr. Brown taxes by stealth, never willing to tell us during an election campaign what he will do after the votes are counted. Nor will David Cameron talk about how much he will tax or how much he will spend. All he says is that he will \u2018share the proceeds of growth.\u2019 That\u2019s a slogan, not a policy.We Liberal Democrats are different. Here is exactly what we\u2019ll do.We will cut national income tax for 28 million working people.We\u2019ll abolish the 10 pence starting rate. We'll cut the basic rate from 22 pence to 20.We\u2019ll raise the top rate threshold from £38,000 to £50,000We\u2019ll take over two million of our lowest earners out of income tax altogether. More than two million people. Money back in the pockets of the poorest working families.We will reward ambition and aspiration - not penalise effort.Let me tell you how we will pay for it.Not by higher taxes. We will not raise the overall level of taxation.But we will reform the tax system so that it is fairer, simpler and greener. Under our plans, some will pay more. We are straightforward about this. The very wealthy will lose their generous pension tax subsidies. Tax breaks on capital gains will be removed. Those who can afford to make a greater contribution should do so. And we will raise environmental taxes too. All of us should pay tax on the pollution we cause. Yes - It means taxing aviation properly. Yes - It means fuel duty going up with inflation. And yes - It means paying more for the cars that pollute the most.If we are serious about the environment, only action will suffice. The truth is, we still have a chance to affect the course of climate change. But in ten years it may be too late. Climate change is the greatest moral and practical challenge we face. We must act. Not in the future - not just when new technology becomes available - but now.Our tax reforms are not about posturing on the environment. We\u2019ve seen enough of that over the last year. This is about taking the decisions that will help us live up to our responsibilities - at home and abroad.We are the only party prepared to take those decisions necessary to create a greener Britain. And necessary to create a fairer Britain.Income tax cuts for hard working people. The polluter paying the price. Taxing wealth, not work.Now this is the politics of substance. It\u2019s fairness in action. It\u2019s environmentalism in action. It\u2019s liberalism in action.And this country has never been in more need of our liberal values.Like many of you, I was optimistic in 1997. Not just because 18 years of Conservative rule were over. But because there was a feeling of hope and a promise of change. A promise of inclusive politics where people and ideas mattered. The opportunity to renew Britain. To restore public services. To bring back trust and faith in government. To create a new progressive politics.But Labour has squandered that opportunity. After three election victories, Labour has failed.The gap between rich and poor is wider than at any point under Margaret Thatcher. We have higher taxes, but little improvement in public services. Millions of pensioners remain consigned to poverty: two thirds of them women. Hard-working families are crippled by debt. Carbon emissions are rising. And now hospital wards are closing, doctors and nurses are losing their jobs. This is the domestic legacy of the Blair-Brown Government.And Labour has put our civil liberties under threat.Labour believes that terrorism should be tackled by taking away personal freedoms.Let me be very clear - Terrorism is a threat to everything that liberals stand for - individual freedom, democracy, and the rule of law.We support this government when it provides the police and security services with powers and resources when these are truly justified. It was, after all, the Liberal Democrats who won the argument for the creation of the new criminal offence of acts preparatory to terrorism.But a strong and safe society can only be created if communities work together to tackle these threats.Excessive powers - and the excessive use of powers - alienate the very communities we need on our side.Terrorism thrives where civil liberties are denied.That is why Liberal Democrats, under my leadership, will fight to maintain the principles of the Human Rights Act. That is why Liberal Democrats, under my leadership, will fight for the independence of judges and the rule of law. That is why Liberal Democrats, under my leadership, will fight against any acceptance of torture. And if the proposal comes back - and it will - we will fight to ensure that the government cannot imprison people for ninety days without trial or charge.When tackling terrorism, we must recognise that how we act abroad is as important as how we act at home.We should all be proud of the contribution the United Kingdom has made to democracy, to the values of tolerance and diversity, to the spread of the rule of law.But in a few short years, Britain\u2019s reputation has been tarnished.In foreign policy, the Prime Minister has elevated belief over evidence, conviction over judgement, and instinct over understanding.Put quite simply, he has presided over a foreign policy which is neither ethical nor effective.Week after week in Parliament, the Prime Minister has had to lead tributes to the members of the armed forces who have been killed in action. Since Parliament last sat in July, another 29 have died. We must never forget the price that we ask the men and women of our armed forces to pay. In Iraq, we are approaching a state of civil war. Hundreds dying every week. Terrorism taking root. And all the while, Guantanamo Bay stands as a shameful affront to justice and the rule of law. Secret Prisons, rendition, the suspicion of torture.How can those who operate outside the rule of law argue credibly for its observance in Iraq?We Liberal Democrats will not shrink from our responsibility to challenge the government for the consequences of its decisions.Security is not being gained, it is being lost. Terrorism is not being defeated, it is being invigorated. Freedom is not being spread, it is being undermined.On the Middle East lets us be clear.We do not underestimate the difficulties for Israel - in dealing with Hezbollah or a government in the Palestinian territories led by Hamas. Hamas must recognise the state of Israel. It must renounce violence. And it must accept existing peace accords. These remain the necessary conditions for the development of long term peace.But there will be no peace in the Middle East while the Palestinians are subject to daily humiliation, settlements are expanded on the West Bank and the Palestinian people have no viable homeland they can call their own. As long as this continues, Israel\u2019s legal and moral right to live in peace behind secure and recognised borders will be undermined.And what, more recently, did Lebanon teach us?Hezbollah\u2019s actions in kidnapping two Israeli soldiers were an outrage. So too was their shelling of innocent civilians in Israel. But the disproportionate response - the systematic destruction of roads, houses and bridges, the death and uprooting of so many innocent citizens - all of this has served to strengthen Hezbollah, not weaken it.We Liberal Democrats led the call for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire. But the Prime Minister was silent. Yet again, Blair\u2019s Britain was out of step with everyone but the Bush administration.But our country\u2019s reputation can be recovered.It can be recovered by a British government that works through international institutions and is unflinching in its support for the rule of law.I hope that at last our government recognises the depth of the crisis in Darfur. Hundreds of thousands dead - millions displaced - desperate for aid and in fear for their lives. You remember, in Rwanda the world looked the other way. It must not do so again. Britain must not do so again.And now Mr. Cameron expresses his reservations about Britain\u2019s foreign policy. Well I say to that - Where were you? Where were you when what was needed was not reservation but votes? I\u2019ll tell you where you were. You, Mr. Cameron, were in the government lobby backing military action against Iraq. You should apologise for supporting that war.And while you\u2019re at it, Mr. Cameron, you should apologise for the last Tory manifesto, which you wrote - one of the most reactionary, unpleasant, right-wing manifestos of modern times.But now, when it comes to policy, Cameron\u2019s Tories are a substance free zone. Their idea of political principle is to say, tell us what you don\u2019t like and we\u2019ll abandon it.They have learned all the wrong lessons from Mr. Blair - the spin, the photo opportunity, the endless sound bites signifying nothing. Political parties shouldn\u2019t be glorified advertising agencies.It\u2019s all very well for Mr. Cameron to say he is a liberal now - but real liberalism means leading public opinion not following it.The British public is entitled to the politics of substance, not the politics of spin.That is why the British people are voting for Liberal Democrats in ever-greater numbers.Take this year. The by-election in Gordon Brown\u2019s back yard in Dunfermline returned the Liberal Democrat Willie Rennie as Member of Parliament, boosting our number of MPs to an all time high. And in one of the safest Tory seats, Bromley and Chislehurst, Ben Abbotts reduced their massive majority to just 641 votes.So much for David Cameron\u2019s appeal outside Westminster.The British people will vote for us in greater numbers still. But only if we show that we practice the politics of substance, just as we did in that great tax debate on Tuesday. And only if we show that we are the party of opportunity. That freedom, fairness and a commitment to the environment are at the very heart of everything we say - and everything we do.I joined the party as a young man at Glasgow University. My generation - those of us now entering what I like to call youthful middle age - was beginning to battle the injustices of the twentieth century - racism, sexism and homophobia.That is why, when I was elected leader of the party, I made it clear to you that I would not be content until we had ensured that our party is more representative - that we have more candidates drawn from the ranks of women, the disabled and black and ethnic minorities.That is why we have set up our new diversity fund. We will be using it to fight target seats where such candidates are chosen.We already have £200,000 pledged for that purpose. This is clear signal of our serious ambition to make our party more representative. But this is just the start. Over the next few months there will be further initiatives - more money and more action.But while we reform our own party we must never forget that inequality, unfairness and lack of opportunity are a blight on our society.I was born in a tenement in Glasgow. My parents worked hard to provide me with the opportunities that they never had. My father wanted to be a doctor, but couldn\u2019t afford to go to university. So they saw to it that I got the chances they did not. But opportunity should not be an accident of birth. It must be open to everyone in Britain.That is why I have established a commission, chaired by Liz Barker, to look at ways in which Liberal Democrats can reduce inequality, tackle poverty, and provide opportunity for those who have none.And we will come to conference next year with proposals to meet these challenges - another real contribution to the politics of substance.You know, my education was paid by for by the state, the sports facilities where I trained as an athlete were paid for by the state - and the health care that I have received was paid for by the state.So I know the true value of public services.I know about the way in which they provide the essentials of a decent society, and I know about the way in which they create opportunity.The Tories told us that public services were safe in their hands. How hollow those words were.Labour told us on the eve of the 1997 election that we had \u2018twenty four hours to save the NHS.\u2019It is true that Labour has put a record amount of money into our public services. But they certainly haven\u2019t delivered value for money. A quarter of sixteen year olds drop out of education with no qualifications. And our creaking transport system is still struggling to cope. Hospitals are being closed.Increased investment is not enough to provide the quality services our country needs and deserves. We need to spend that money more wisely.Let me set out the principles for Liberal Democrat reform of the public services.First, stability.Reforms must be thought through and given time to bed in. Not rushed through and then abandoned.The experience of the NHS makes that point.From the reorganisation of its structure, to the botched reform of doctors\u2019 contracts \u2013 it\u2019s no wonder that our doctors and nurses are in despair.Stability can only be achieved through long-term planning.If public services are to provide proper value for money, they must plan for the long-term needs of the communities they serve.That\u2019s why localism is our second principle.Localism: so necessary for our country, but so alien to the Tories - and even more so to Labour.The Labour Government is like the hurricane that hit the Azores yesterday. A great, grey depression that spins around sucking everything into its centre. And its name? Hurricane Gordon.But centralisation is not for us. We will put power where it is needed.That is why Liberal Democrats believe in freeing councils to raise and spend their own money. Because local authorities understand local priorities. And local problems require local solutions.Our third principle - services should be tailored to the needs of the individual. Our public services must put people first: not targets imposed by Whitehall. That is what public services should be about. Serving the real needs of those who use them.That is why we support \u2018pupil choice\u2019 to combine both academic and vocational learning in secondary schools. Education tailored to the needs and interests of each individual - and encouraging young people to stay in school and gain skills.Public services that plan for the long-term, that serve the local community, and that are centred on the needs of the individuals who use them. We Liberal Democrats are clear and united in our vision.We share a great ambition for our party and our country. We are ambitious to put our principles into practice. To turn our ideas into action.My objective is nothing less than to complete the transformation of the Liberal Democrats from a party of opposition into a party of government.It is only by governing that we will have the opportunity to build a society that is free, fair and green.Millions of people are represented by Liberal Democrats. At Westminster, in the European Parliament, the Scottish Parliament, the Welsh Assembly and in local councils the length and breadth of this country.And today 17 million people in Britain experience Liberal Democrat government. That\u2019s 17 million people who know how tirelessly Liberal Democrats work for them. Great cities like Liverpool, Newcastle, and Cardiff are prospering under Liberal Democrat leadership. And across the country, Liberal Democrat Council leaders are responsible for a combined budget of over £10bn.In Scotland, Liberal Democrat ministers are the driving force behind progressive politics. Look at what they have achieved. And end to tuition fees. Free personal care for the elderly. And fair votes for local government.Under Nicol Stephen\u2019s leadership, we have great ambitions. And our party is poised to make many gains in next year\u2019s elections. The momentum is with us and, next May, Nicol Stephen has a real chance of becoming Scotland\u2019s First Minister.As in Edinburgh, so in Westminster. To become a party of Government, we must act as a party of government.We must make the tough decisions necessary to show that we are radical and responsible. That we practice the politics of substance. That we are the party of opportunity in Britain.My commitment to the beliefs and principles of the party is absolute.I want to build a Britain that is at peace with itself at home, and respected abroad.You know, some people yearn for the years gone by. Some mourn for what is past. But not me. I hunger for what is to come - for what is possible. We should have no fear of the future. Rather, we should relish the challenges ahead.I have had three great opportunities in my life: In sport, in the law, and in politics.And now I have been given one more.The opportunity to lead our party from opposition towards government.And when that moment comes, to ensure that we are ready to build a Britain that is free, fair and green.That is my vision. Your challenge. Our future.

aVLet me start by asking some questions:What kind of country is it where the government responds to the threat of climate change by allowing green taxes to fall as carbon emissions rise?What kind of country is it where the richest in the land pay a lower rate of tax than the people who have to clean their offices?What kind of country is it where the government halts a criminal investigation into corrupt arms sales to placate commercial interests?What kind of country is it where the government colludes with the Tories to exempt MPs from freedom of information?What kind of country is it where the government sneaks out a short statement on the last day of Parliament signing us up to host America\u2019s Son of Star Wars on British soil?And what kind of country is it where the government leads us into an illegal and disastrous war and then stops people from protesting against it?Well, I\u2019ll tell you what sort of country it\u2019s not.It\u2019s not a liberal country.That\u2019s why the Liberal Democrats have never been more necessary than we are today.Last year at our conference, I made it clear that under my leadership the Liberal Democrats will always put substance ahead of spin. And this year we have gone even further in setting out distinctive policies to pave the way to a better future for Britain.Take climate change. The film that you have just seen makes an overwhelming case for action on the environment now. This party \u2013 and this party alone \u2013 has committed to deliver that action. In England, Wales and Scotland, the Liberal Democrats are leading the fight against climate change.Last week the Green Alliance rated our environmental policies top of all the major parties \u2013 just as Friends of the Earth did in the recent Scottish election campaign. And on both occasions the Conservatives scored zero.Only we have the honesty to propose raising tax on pollution in order to cut tax on income.Only we have the foresight to map out the route to a zero carbon Britain.Only we have the vision to insist on British leadership in the international effort to tackle climate change.You might have noticed this week that we have one or two critics in the media. Well, I\u2019m happy to say that I answer to you and not to the media. Thank goodness.  That\u2019s why we Liberal Democrats can confront the difficult issues. Take tough decisions. Yes \u2013 and say controversial things too.That\u2019s what real leadership is about.That\u2019s what my leadership is about.That\u2019s why we - the Liberal Democrats - are at the cutting edge of the debates on tax, poverty and crime.And I won\u2019t have it any other way.When we go into the next election I will tell the hard, uncompromising truths about the state of this country. And about the radical action needed to change it.That\u2019s the honest way to earn peoples\u2019 trust.That\u2019s the only way to earn peoples\u2019 trust.That\u2019s the Liberal Democrat way to earn peoples\u2019 trust.But radical action doesn\u2019t feature on Labour\u2019s agenda. Gordon Brown spent the last decade wanting to move into number 10. But the most extraordinary thing he has done since he finally got the job is to praise Margaret Thatcher. It\u2019s like a soap opera. It\u2019s certainly an identity crisis. Gordon wants to be like Maggie. But he doesn\u2019t want to be like Tony. Tony also wanted to be like Maggie. But Maggie only wanted to be like Ronnie. Now Dave, he wants to be like Tony. But he doesn\u2019t want to be like William, or Iain, or Michael. And certainly not like Maggie either. Confused? You must be.But you can be clear on this: I don\u2019t want to be like any of them.And what about the Tories? This year, David Cameron is going back to basics. Last year the Conservative conference was about health, happiness and the sunshine glinting through the trees. This year it will be flag, fear \u2013 and foreigners. But why the right-turn?I\u2019ll tell you why.Because he\u2019s under pressure. And without convictions of his own, the Tory leader is buffeted by the beliefs of others.He\u2019s done a u-turn on grammar schools.An about turn on identity cards.And a wrong-turn on human rights.Margaret Thatcher would have to concede: He turns if you want him to. The laddie\u2019s all for turning.But we\u2019re not for turning \u2013 we know exactly what we stand for.Our next manifesto will be a programme fit for the purpose of government in twenty first century Britain: Radical, responsible \u2013 and liberal.You know, we might need that manifesto soon \u2013 very soon.But let me assure Gordon Brown of this: Whenever he calls the election - whether it\u2019s next week or next year - we\u2019ll be ready. Whenever he calls the election he will face a Liberal Democrat party determined to rattle the cage of British politics. Whenever he calls the election he will face a Liberal Democrat party which will compete for every vote and for every seat.I will make every effort, seize every opportunity, work every day to return the maximum number of Liberal Democrat MPs in the next House of Commons. And I know \u2013 I know \u2013 that I can expect nothing less from you. You proved it last year when you helped Willie Rennie win that stunning victory in Dunfermline: Gordon Brown\u2019s own backyard. And you proved it this year too when so many of you came from across the country to campaign in Ealing Southall and Sedgefield. In both contests, your hard work and commitment ensured that the Liberal Democrats emerged as the principal challengers to the government. And the Conservatives \u2013 David Cameron\u2019s Conservatives \u2013 were pushed into third place.But great campaigns need great candidates \u2013 and that\u2019s why we offer our thanks and congratulations to Nigel Bakhai and Greg Stone. And you know we have three equally talented candidates on our short-list for mayor of London. Chamali Fernando, Fiyaz Mughal, and Brian Paddick. Whichever one wins the nomination, I am certain that they will have enormous fun taking the fight to Ken Livingstone. And even more fun taking on the Tories if their candidate is one Boris Johnson. Boris Johnson: imagine that - the blondest suicide note in history.Now when it comes to the next general election, I believe there is some speculation that age will be a factor.You bet it will. Because I\u2019ll make it one.Because with age comes experience, and with experience comes judgement. And when you are deciding whether to send our young men and women to war, it pays to have that experience and it pays to have that judgement.So, if military action is proposed against Iran, who should the British people trust to stand up to George Bush?Should they trust the Labour and Conservative MPs who voted for the war in Iraq?Or should they trust the Liberal Democrats who stood \u2013 steadfast - against the tragic folly of that decision?While we stand by our record, our opponents seek to hide theirs.Mr. Brown is working hard to convince us that there has been real change in Number 10: That his arrival has somehow wiped the slate clean. That the last ten years of waste, failure and disappointment are to be forgiven and forgotten.Well, not so fast Gordon. You spent a decade blaming everything on the previous Conservative government. But as Chancellor over the last ten years you had unparalleled influence over government. You could have raised green taxes to tackle climate change. You could have stopped the ineffective, expensive and unnecessary identity card scheme. And you could have prevented Tony Blair from embarking on the catastrophe of the Iraq war. But you didn\u2019t.This is your legacy, Mr. Brown:The environment degraded.Civil liberties eroded.Iraq invaded.Not to mention the record for which you - and you alone - were responsible as Chancellor.A smash and grab raid on private pensions.A steady, disturbing rise in the number of home repossessions.And a national economic backdrop of £1.3 trillion in personal debt.With a record like that, it\u2019s no wonder that the Prime Minister wants to start afresh.But it\u2019s a record for which we will ensure that he takes responsibility:In spite of your claims of change, Mr. Brown, not much really has changed. New Labour remains blue Labour. And you\u2019re still wrong.Wrong on nuclear energy.Wrong on council tax.Wrong on student fees.And you are wrong, wrong, wrong on detention without charge.We don\u2019t need a change of tone in this country: We need a change of policies. And you, Gordon Brown, have not delivered.Now let me say a word about two important issues that have faced our country in recent times.Right now, British farmers are in crisis over foot and mouth. The necessary restrictions imposed following the outbreak have come at the worst possible time. We will continue to back necessary action to eradicate this disease. But we will also urge the government to get the balance right. We must get Britain\u2019s farmers back in business as soon as possible. Because there\u2019s no point killing off foot and mouth if we kill off our farming industry in the process.And I also want to mention Northern Rock. One of the most alarming features of the last week has been the complete collapse of trust in a leading bank - and perhaps the banking system in general. There have been people queuing in the streets, panicked by worries about their savings. In the short-term that panic has been stopped. But the underlying problem of excessive debt and reckless lending has not been addressed. And, for this, responsibility must rest with Gordon Brown, who has minimised the problem despite repeated warnings - not least from our Shadow Chancellor, and Deputy Leader, Vince Cable.The fact that David Cameron inflamed the situation with rash words is further evidence of what we already knew: The Conservatives are not fit to govern. Look at their record.They criticise the government\u2019s handling of the war in Iraq. But it was their votes that made that war possible.They protest against a \u2018broken society.\u2019 But it was their policies - under Margaret Thatcher - that widened inequalities and shattered social cohesion.They talk about the environment. But they have not made one single policy commitment.The Tories have had a bucketful of proposals put to them in recent months. We\u2019ve had the Clarke Commission, the Duncan Smith Commission, the Dorrell Commission, the Gummer Commission, and - of course - the Redwood Commission. Would you believe it? Advice from the Vulcan First Officer. Ideas straight from the bridge of the Starship Free Enterprise. Policies, Dave - but not as we know them.But for all the working groups, leaked reports, and photo opportunities, the Tories still don\u2019t know what their policies would be. They shy away from making the hard choices that are necessary for government. Because they are suffering from an identity crisis. You know there\u2019s really a very good case for the Tories having identity cards. How else will they know who they are? When they meet a hoodie, they don\u2019t know whether to hug \u2019em - or hang \u2019em.What our country needs is a political party that\u2019s prepared to take the lead and speak the truth. Because Britain needs a competition of ideas, not the stifling of debate and the undermining of accountability. But on so many of the major political issues there is a two-party consensus - comfortable, cosy and complacent. On the environment, taxes, pensions, nuclear power, tuition fees, Iraq. And that\u2019s a consensus that we alone can break: That we must break.That doesn\u2019t mean parties should never co-operate with each other.In Scotland the Liberal Democrats have campaigned consistently for more powers for the Scottish Parliament. Just yesterday, Nicol Stephen met the Labour and Conservative leaders in Scotland to discuss how devolution might be strengthened. But how those powers would be used would - I can tell you - be a matter for vigorous debate between the parties.That\u2019s the difference between the constructive cooperation we support and the cosy consensus that we oppose. And you know, we\u2019ve always been at our best when we have opposed that consensus.When David Steel spoke out against apartheid in the House of Commons, they shouted him down.When Paddy Ashdown argued for intervention in Bosnia, they shouted him down.And when Charles Kennedy argued against the war in Iraq, they shouted him down too.But Steel, Ashdown and Kennedy were right.So when they tried to shout me down - on extradition, on rendition, on the scandal of Guantanamo Bay - I would not be silenced.I will not be silenced.The Liberal Democrats will never be silenced.And I don\u2019t intend to be silenced on the issue of Europe either.The Government will not show leadership on Europe and the Conservatives wilfully distort the public debate. So it falls to us to make the overwhelming case for the European Union.A Union that has provided peace and prosperity.A Union that promotes human rights and democratic values.A Union that is needed today to tackle the threats of climate change and international terrorism.I will lead the public debate in defence of the European Union.David Cameron and his Europhobe allies wish to restrict the British people to a choice on a narrow question about the draft European Treaty. But if there is to be a referendum it shouldn\u2019t be restricted to that question. It must be a decision about the EU as a whole. Let\u2019s have an honest debate on the European Union followed by a real choice for the British people. That means a referendum on Britain\u2019s membership of the EU.We would ask the British people the real question - whether they wish to remain in the European Union or not. I will proudly lead the Liberal Democrats at the forefront of that debate. So I will not be silenced on Europe and I will not be silenced in defence of our liberal values - or silent when others seek to undermine them.Liberalism requires tolerance.But that does not mean indifference in the face of intolerance from others.Because freedom is indivisible and absolute.That\u2019s why I speak out against intolerance and extremism wherever and whenever they threaten our freedom.If a woman is forced into a marriage that she does not want -If a sportsman is barracked because of the colour of his skin -If a person is bullied because they\u2019re gay -Then I stand with them.I have spent my whole life speaking out against bigotry.You can\u2019t be a part-time liberal.Discrimination and intimidation have no place in a liberal society.And on the matter of faith, let\u2019s be clear. A truly liberal society guarantees the freedom of all religions, but it accepts the tyranny of none.People must be free to live without threat or fear.To say the things, write the words and live the lives they choose.Does that offend some people? Yes, of course.But the price of freedom is the risk of offence - and, for me, that price is always worth paying.What does that mean for us?We, the Liberal Democrats, must be the voice of those who are not heard -Of those who are marginalisedAnd of those who are rejected.Over the past few months, I have travelled throughout this country. I have had the privilege to meet - in private visits - some of the most extraordinary and courageous people: People from all walks of life.I met Jamal - a young musician who wants to go to university but is frustrated and angry at the prospect of being deep in debt.I learned from him and his friends of the terrible waste of talent and the alienation of so many young people.I met Anne, a 20-year-old woman in prison for drug offences. She\u2019s had little formal education. Yet she\u2019s studying to take GCSEs and wants to enrol with the Open University.I learned from her that if prisoners get proper education and training it will help them to find work on their release.That\u2019s the way to cut reoffending.I met Jane - a 26 year old former addict, in a shelter for the homeless. She has beaten her addiction. She now hopes to get custody of her four young children.I learned from her how important it is for the homeless to regain their self-respect and to feel that they are in control of their own lives.I met Michael, a 29 year old British soldier who had suffered terrible injuries in a mortar attack in Iraq. He was determined to get fit again and rejoin his unit.I learned from him at first hand what our young men and women are going through in Iraq.He told me he was lucky - two days before he was hit, one of his best friends had been killed by a single small piece of shrapnel. That\u2019s the price being paid for a war that should never have been.These are inspiring people:People with the spirit and determination to beat the odds.But for every success there are too many stories of shattered dreams and frustrated ambitions.There are too many forgotten people in Brown\u2019s Britain.People who don\u2019t make the headlines.People whose opinions no one ever seeks.You know, facts and figures about social exclusion are okay for studies and reports. But it\u2019s in the reality of peoples\u2019 lives that the pain of their stories is written.These people don\u2019t just feel shut out, discounted, cast aside.They are shut out, they are discounted - they are cast aside.Well, I tell you it\u2019s not good enough.So when people ask me what I feel about the state of Britain today, I say I\u2019m angry: Deeply angry.Things have to change if we want our country to be one truly united Britain.Whether you are black or white, male or female, rich or poor, gay or straight, sick or healthy, young or old.Government must stand for the interests of all, but the vested interests of none.People will have confidence in Westminster when it provides open, honest and transparent government.And you know, that\u2019s not just about listening to people: We\u2019ve had that already. Labour\u2019s Big Conversation. The Tories\u2019 \u2018Stand up, Speak up.\u2019 But there\u2019s no point talking to people when they\u2019re just not listening.Well, we Liberal Democrats offer something different.Our mission is to change the British political landscape, once and for all.To throw open the doors of government and let the people in.No more sleazy patronage, no more dodgy dossiers, no more abandoned investigations into secret arms deals - in fact, no more secret arms deals, full stop!And on the constitution, not piecemeal change or pick and mix proposals. But a commitment to fair votes, and an end to the lottery of first past the post.Real freedom of information, and an end to government efforts to undermine it.A wholly elected House of Lords, and an end to politics based on the power of patronage.And at the foundation of it all a Bill of Rights -A Bill of Rights to reclaim the civil liberties stolen from us by this Labour government.A Bill of Rights to anchor freedom of speech, freedom of conscience and freedom of association within our law.And I am prepared to go further still.Climate change is the greatest challenge facing the world today.So I want a Bill of Rights that puts the protection of the environment at the very heart of Britain\u2019s constitution: We should guarantee the right of every citizen to clean water, pure air and unpolluted land.You know, I joined this party because I believe in freedom. Not just the intellectual freedom of politicians and academics, but freedom in its most practical sense. The freedom we get from good health, decent education and a clean environment. And the Liberal Democrat challenge is to show how we can extend that freedom to every citizen in this country.Some people have the good fortune to be born into opportunity. But for millions of others life is a great deal tougher. In London - the capital of one of the richest nations in the world - just six miles separate Hampstead from Hackney. But they might as well be in different countries. If you live in Hackney you are four times as likely to suffer from long-term unemployment as your neighbour in Hampstead. If you live in Hackney you are twice as likely to be permanently sick or disabled. And if you live in Hackney you are four times as likely to have no qualifications at all.Who\u2019d have thought it, that after a decade of Labour government - a Labour government - the gap between rich and poor in this country would be wider than it was when Labour came to office?Who\u2019d have thought that after a decade of Labour government social mobility would be in decline?And who\u2019d have thought that our country would languish - shamefully - at the bottom of the UNICEF league table for the well-being of children.That\u2019s the record of Gordon Brown and the Labour government.And you know what: The people out there know it.The one and half million families across this country who are waiting for social housing: they know it.The millions of older people who struggle to get by on inadequate pensions: they know it.The parents who worry that their background determines the quality of their children\u2019s education and their future prospects: they know it too.You know we\u2019ve had a decade hearing from Labour about education, education, education.But let me educate them.After ten years these are the facts:Fewer than one in five of the most disadvantaged children get five good GCSEs;Less than one in five of the most disadvantaged children go onto higher education;And in this country today, 1.2 million young people are not in education or employment or training.This is unacceptable in 21st century Britain.Under the Liberal Democrat pupil premium, the money follows the pupil. Extra money for the most disadvantaged children. Our schools given incentives - our children given chances. The pupil premium will help to ensure that educational opportunity extends throughout our society. Because the state of the country is a reflection on us all. And where opportunity is denied freedom is denied too.Nearly sixty years ago that great Liberal William Beveridge identified \u2018Five Giants\u2019 which had to be tackled: Want, Disease, Ignorance, Squalor and Idleness.The language is out of date but the challenges posed in the twenty-first century are every bit as compelling.Having led the fight against the Five Giants, we Liberal Democrats should now lead the fight for Five Freedoms.Opportunity, good health, personal security, prosperity for all and a clean environment.First, the freedom born of opportunity.In this country today, a child\u2019s opportunity is shaped by background and parental income to a degree that is unacceptable.It doesn\u2019t have to be that way.We should invest in the most disadvantaged pupils. And give a fair deal to students. We should ensure that graduates leave university with high hopes, not huge debts.Second, the freedom born of good health.Labour has centralised, reorganised and disrupted the National Health Service - our National Health Service. And created a culture of boom and bust. More doctors and nurses trained than ever before - but without jobs for them to go to. It doesn\u2019t have to be that way.We can ensure that local people have the power to meet local health problems with local health solutions. We can take back our NHS.Third, the freedom born of personal security.Over the last ten years, Labour has created more than three thousand new criminal offences. And yet public confidence in the criminal justice system is at an all time low.It doesn\u2019t have to be that way.We can have more police officers and get them out on the streets. We can make prisoners work to compensate their victims. And we can have better education and training in prison to cut reoffending rates. Fourth, the freedom born of prosperity for all.Gordon Brown used his last budget to increase taxes on the lowest earners in order to fund tax cuts for the better off.It doesn\u2019t have to be that way.We will close the tax loopholes that favour the super-rich. We will cut the standard rate of national income tax to its lowest level for nearly a century. We will shift the burden of taxation from people to pollution. And the average family will see their taxes cut by one thousand pounds a year.And fifth, the freedom born of a clean environment.You know, the need for action has never been more urgent. I\u2019ve seen at first hand the devastation that flooding can cause. In Hull, Cheltenham, and Toll Bar \u2013 I\u2019ve seen it. It\u2019s a disgrace that this government pays no more than lip service to fighting climate change.But it doesn\u2019t have to be that way.We would take action now. By raising green taxes, by investing in renewables - by making Britain carbon neutral. And - as we have done this week - by ruling out further investment in nuclear power stations - on environmental, on security and on financial grounds too.There you have it - Five Freedoms for a liberal society.Opportunity, health, security, prosperity and - above all - the environment.These are the five freedoms for which we will fight.And I relish the prospect of that fight.Let me tell you this.I will lead this party into the next election with energy, ambition and determination.Because the stakes for this party have never been higher.And liberalism has never been needed more than it is today.So whenever people ask you: \u2018Why vote Liberal Democrat?\u2019 tell them this:We alone are prepared to break the cosy consensus of British politics and face up to the challenges confronting our society.To create a country that is free, fair and green.Free in thought, expression and conscience.Free from the disadvantage and discouragement that still blight the prospects of far too many of our people.And free from the growing threat of climate change.Only we can achieve that free, fair and green society.Because only we believe in it.Only we will work for it.Only we will fight for it.The Liberal Democrats versus Labour and the Tories. Today, our party is not only the real alternative: It is the only alternative. Not two against one. But one against two. I joined this party because, like you, I wanted change.I joined this party because, like you, I wanted opportunity - opportunity for all.I joined this party because I wanted a different kind of politics - yes, and a different kind of country too.This is what Liberal Democrats stand for.This is what I offer.And this is what we can achieve together.

aVI\u2019m going to talk today about the future. But let me start by asking you to think back to the past. One year ago. It was a different world. You remember. The Labour government was - sort of - popular. Gordon Brown had dealt with a crisis \u2013 competently. Everyone wanted to pay court to The Great Gordon. Even Margaret Thatcher had tea with him. The Sun newspaper wrote: \u2018Gordon Brown is in a position of strength.\u2019 And at the other end of Whitehall, David Miliband was telling reporters he wasn\u2019t interested in being Prime Minister. Oh, really, David.Things were so different last year that when Vince Cable predicted a housing collapse, people just thought he was Victor Meldrew. No one outside this party realised Vince was a twinkle-toed economic prophet.What a difference a year makes.But what\u2019s far more important is that things have changed for every family in Britain too. The political changes of the last year are nothing compared with the economic hardships families face now.Like Angie, a middle-aged mum, who came to see me recently in my constituency. Who said she was finding it difficult to sleep. She told me about that sinking feeling she gets at the supermarket checkout and the petrol pump. Counting down the days until her cheap mortgage deal ends. Switching down to just half an hour of heating in the morning because it\u2019s all she can afford. You know how it feels, don\u2019t you?There\u2019s this big, intangible thing called the global credit crunch. Banks and funds with names you\u2019d never heard of \u2013 Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, Lehman Brothers, Bear Stearns. And suddenly you\u2019re worrying \u2013 is my money safe, in my bank, on my high street?These are difficult times.Our economy weakens by the day.We survive on oil and coal we cannot afford, from nations we cannot trust.A firestorm is raging through our financial system, ignited by reckless bankers and fuelled by complacent politicians.I had a look back recently at Gordon Brown\u2019s final budget last year. Can you believe it. He actually boasted: \u2018Our growth will be the highest in the G7.\u2019 \u2018Inflation has never gone above 3%,\u2019 he bragged.Labour offers nothing. They\u2019re so desperate to protect their own jobs, they can\u2019t be bothered to protect other people\u2019s.They\u2019re the living dead, no heart, no mind, no soul. Stumbling around with no idea what to do. They are a Zombie government. A cross between Shaun of the Dead and I\u2019m Sorry I Haven\u2019t a Clue. All these backbenchers and ex-ministers you\u2019ve never heard of, rising up from the grave of obscurity to impale their Gordon Brown. Thank goodness Gordon\u2019s got Geoff Hoon, chief whip, chief zombie slayer on his side. Riding to the Prime Minister\u2019s rescue, he declared: \u2018It\u2019s important that people who have something to say come out and say it.\u2019 What a shambles.We can\u2019t predict the future.We can\u2019t know exactly what challenges our country will face.But we can be certain that Labour cannot help us.And we can be certain that the Conservatives won\u2019t bother.Cameron\u2019s only aim was to make the Conservatives inoffensive. Problem is, once you strip out the offensive parts of the Conservative party, there isn\u2019t much left. Cameron\u2019s hope is to become the Andrex puppy of British politics. A cuddly symbol, perhaps. But fundamentally irrelevant to the product he\u2019s promoting.I asked my office to do some research over the summer into Conservative policy positions. Before you laugh, it turns out they have actually said quite a lot. 3148 pages worth, in fact. At a best guess, that\u2019s about 1.8 million words. That is three times as long as War and Peace. Or two and half thousand readings of The Gruffalo. I think they\u2019re hoping to produce so much of this stuff that no one will have the time to read it. Because, out of all those 1.8 million words, guess how many translate into concrete commitments?None. Not one.You see, when you promise, you have to choose. When it\u2019s all \u2018blue skies thinking\u2019 \u2013 you can say everything, no matter how contradictory.You can say you want fairer taxes \u2013 but propose to spend billions cutting inheritance tax for the very richest in the land.You can call for the European Union to be stronger against the Russians \u2013 while still plotting to break it in two.You can say you\u2019ll protect civil liberties \u2013 and then call for extra surveillance powers.You can cycle to work \u2013 and have your driver follow behind.They are a say everything, do nothing party.David Cameron and his cronies have tried to take over every comforting, soft-focus word in the dictionary. They are for work-life balance, fairness, motherhood, apple pie, saving the planet and custard.  You have to admire, I suppose, the sheer gall of someone who worked for Margaret Thatcher claiming he cares about poverty.But that arrogance. That born-to-rule conceit. That sense he\u2019s already picking out curtain patterns for Number 10. That\u2019s not what Britain needs.Power must be earned, not inherited.What Britain needs now is absolute honesty about the situation we\u2019re in. And big, bold ideas to set us right. Quite simply we need a government that listens, understands, and acts. And you know what? The Liberal Democrats can be \u2013 will be \u2013 that government.We are the party with the ideas that can get Britain out of this mess.Because we understand.There are no mistakes made by government that cannot be set right by the British people, if only they are given the chance.Ask yourself this: When you meet someone new, someone you don\u2019t know anything about, what do you expect? I\u2019ll tell you what I expect. My basic view of human nature is that people are born with goodness in them. Of course, people can be selfish, cruel or violent. But I believe no one starts that way. Most people, most of the time, will do the right thing. Not just for themselves - but for their family, their neighbours, their community. They need to be trusted to make those choices.There is a terrible pessimism in the way Gordon Brown thinks we should all be organised from above. Our every move controlled by the great puppet master in the sky. And there\u2019s pessimism too from David Cameron when he says that if you\u2019re overweight, vulnerable or poor, you\u2019re on your own. It\u2019s condescending.Talking down to us.Talking us down.What neither of them understand is that if you always see the worst in people, you will never fix anything.There are huge challenges.Protecting the planet.An ageing population.Keeping our economy competitive as globalisation shifts the power centres of the world.Everything we know from the last fifty years will change in the next five.These are challenges that could overwhelm us if we do not harness our potential.It\u2019s liberalism - optimistic liberalism - that will find the best in Britain.We have got to get Britain\u2019s economy up and running again. Without jobs, there\u2019s no fairness, no opportunity. So let me set out, right now, our Fairer Future economic recovery plan. Four steps to a better economic future.One. Action to stop unjust repossessions before tens of thousands of families find themselves on the streets. Guided by the one man who had the foresight to see these problems coming. With more wisdom and experience than Labour and Conservatives combined: Vince Cable.Two. The free-wheeling, bonus-driven, short termism of the City must come to an end. We must stop the amoral culture that sees speculators betting on banks to fail, knowing the taxpayer will pay out in the end. And the madness of bonuses awarded no matter what. We need a wholly new approach to regulation: limiting, not encouraging, the excesses of the market. And when reckless bankers come with gold-plated begging bowls to ask for shareholders to be bailed out. Our answer should be a resounding No.Three. We will put in place the building blocks for future economic stability. Interest rates that take house price changes into account. And independent monitoring of our fiscal rules.And finally - but most importantly. Tax cuts for families who are struggling. To help them make ends meet. And keep the wheels of the economy turning. The money must go direct to people on low and middle incomes. The very wealthy, the super-rich - should be paying more not less. I will never support the Tory idea that you cut taxes for millionaires and the benefits somehow trickle down. That\u2019s not what struggling families need. They need their money back.I was talking to a pensioner recently. Joan. I could see the anxiety on her face. She was one of the million people who lost out from the 10p tax rate even after the so-called compensation package. Struggling to pay every bill that comes through the door. Worrying about getting through the winter. If you were Joan, what would you want?Your money spent on a management consultant\u2019s advice on a government IT project that will never work?Or your money handed back to you?Liberal Democrats have called for tax rises in the past, when what Britain needed most of all was more investment in our public services. We were right to do so. But what hard-up families need most of all today is food on the table, petrol in the car, and warmth in their homes.Here\u2019s how we\u2019ll find the money to help them.We\u2019ll ensure everyone makes a fair contribution - polluters, fat cats and non-doms included.Our idea is simple. Every person pays their fair share.Under Gordon Brown, tax has become voluntary for the super-rich and for giant multinational companies. And David Cameron will make it even easier for those at the top. When Northern Rock collapsed, the chief executive got what they call a \u2018golden goodbye.\u2019 Thirty thousand pounds tax free. As a thank you for failure.Who can explain that to Joan?Why is she paying more, when the man who brought down Northern Rock is getting tax-free handouts?It\u2019s wrong, and it\u2019s got to stop.Raising taxes at the top will go a long way to cutting them at the bottom. But we need to do more. This week, we pledged together to deepen our fair tax cuts. To make them fairer still. That means doing the most for those who have the least. It means making sure the richest pay more. And so aiming to make nine out of ten taxpayers better off.I want this to be the most progressive - most redistributive - tax plan ever put forward by a British political party. Using just a little of the money the government wastes every day to help people in their everyday lives. That doesn\u2019t mean cutting help for the poorest, of course. It doesn\u2019t mean stopping vital investment in hospitals and schools. It just means taking a cold, hard look at all government spending and asking a basic question: Is it working?Every family in Britain is tightening their belts for the hard times ahead. It is time for government to tighten its belt too.Labour has doubled government spending from £300bn a year to £600bn a year. That\u2019s 18,000 pounds a second. They\u2019ve taken, give or take a few, 16 million pounds of your money since I started speaking. It\u2019ll be £38 million by the time I\u2019ve finished.Does anyone in this room believe every single pound is spent well?I don\u2019t.And I think it\u2019s liberal to be sceptical. Sceptical that central, controlling government gets things right.It\u2019s the Labour party that believes every pound spent by government is better than a pound spent by you or me.We don\u2019t.We believe ministers should spend money as carefully as if they\u2019d borrowed it from a friend.We believe that tax is a means to an end and government should not take a penny more than it needs.We believe returning money to people who need it is fair, liberal, and right.The other parties say tax cuts aren\u2019t possible. But that\u2019s because they\u2019re too flaky to take the tough choices to make tax cuts possible. Too weak to trim back on wasteful spending. Too in hock to wealthy non-doms to threaten higher taxes for the rich. Liberal Democrats are not afraid of tough choices. My shadow cabinet is identifying £20bn of government spending that isn\u2019t working effectively. We need to ask ourselves: When government has proved itself incapable of keeping people\u2019s data secure, why is it spending nearly thirteen billion pounds on a botched NHS IT system?When our soldiers need inexpensive, off-the-shelf armoured vehicles today, why is government spending fourteen billion on over-complex tanks that won\u2019t be ready for years?When we want local government to respond to the needs of local people, why are they spending more than a billion pounds filling in forms for Whitehall inspectors?Making these savings will mean we can afford to spend money on things that really matter.Homes, care for the elderly, children.Things that really make a difference.And then cut taxes for the people who need it most. I know with this approach - streamlined spending and targeted tax cuts, we can get our economy going again. But I don\u2019t want to reignite the old one. I want us to be the first country in the world to move to a new economy. A green economy.As well as risking the very future of our planet, our need for dirty energy is crippling us economically. There are growing links between climate change, biofuels, and rising food prices. And inflation is fuelled by fuel. One way or another, together we are going to have to use less energy. And much less dirty energy. It\u2019s the only way to stop the growing threat of disastrous climate change.There must be no third runway at Heathrow, no expansion of Stansted, And for power stations - no Kingsnorth, no more dirty coal, no nuclear. I want to see public transport expanded, with investment funded through charges on road haulage. I want to see homes and businesses become energy efficient - saving money in the process. And I want a huge expansion of renewable energy - meeting and exceeding the commitments Labour has given up on.If we make the change now, Britain will lead the world on green technology.Driving growth through green collar jobs.Achieving energy independence within the EU.Independence because our position on the international stage is weakened by the West\u2019s desperate hunger for fuel.We cower in the shadow of countries we want to stand up to because we\u2019re afraid they might turn off our lights. Just look at where we stand with Russia. And in the Middle East. Dependence on fossil fuels undermines the fight for human rights. It halts the onward march of democracy. It\u2019s got to end.Instead of basing foreign policy on the principle of \u2018who\u2019s got the fuel,\u2019 we need to base it on the principles of justice. On our British values: Freedom, democracy, and human rights. Fair, and green. This is the new economy we will build.But we need a new kind of government to go with it. To put Britain on the right track for the future, we need to make government people-sized. People-shaped.I was talking to a father recently about how hard it is to find affordable childcare in the school holidays. And he said, Why can\u2019t we have extra child benefit in those holiday months when we need it the most?And I was talking to a pensioner, too, who said: I\u2019d prefer to get my winter heating allowance in March, when I have to pay for my winter fuel. Not in December when the money just disappears in the Christmas shopping bills.Isn\u2019t it blindingly obvious once you think about it?Benefits should be shaped around the needs of people and families, not bureaucrats. And under the Liberal Democrats they will be.Our health service needs to be people-shaped, too.I want patients to have far more control over the care they get, so people with long term conditions get to be part of designing the care they need. Choosing what suits them - and making it work.For mental health patients.For pensioners in need of care.For people with disabilities.It works.A couple of weeks ago in Sheffield, I met a wonderful woman called Katrina. She\u2019s got three disabled sons. The oldest is Jonathan, a charming, warm hearted young man of 19. He can\u2019t walk or talk clearly, or feed himself alone. He\u2019s had a breathing tube in his neck since he was a toddler.Under a scheme the new Liberal Democrat council in Sheffield is extending, Jonathan\u2019s just got his own individual budget and care plan. Now he\u2019s doing work with a local charity, attending a music group, has his own personal assistant. A child whose potential seemed so limited. Finally as a young man, engaged in life in a way he and his mother never thought possible. Katrina told me with the biggest smile I\u2019ve ever seen. She said: We\u2019ve gone from having nothing to having everything. I want every child\u2019s needs would be taken this seriously.What depresses me most about what Labour has done to our country is that they\u2019ve made it a place that\u2019s not fit for our children.Children are inspirationalMiriam and I can\u2019t wait to be parents again.I love the way children see the world.There was a great story I heard recently about a little girl, doing a painting in class. The teacher comes over and says - what are you painting? And the girl says - God.So the teacher says - But no one knows what God looks like. The girl says - they will in a minute.Children don\u2019t see barriers. When you\u2019re a child - everything is possible. So how can you not feel angry when you see what has been done to that hope and innocence.One in three children growing up in poverty. A million in cramped and unsafe homes where they don\u2019t get space to play. More children in prison than any other country in Western Europe. Our children are some of the most unhappy in the world. We have to change this.The journey starts in our schools. We need to draw out the potential in every child, from every background. Children who are struggling, or falling behind - we must help them with extra support - one-to-one tuition or catch up classes, funded by our \u2018pupil premium,\u2019 which targets extra cash at deprived children.We can engage parents, too - giving them the power to set up schools if that\u2019s what their community needs. Like parents did in Lambeth with help from a Liberal Democrat council. Making education people-sized, people-shaped.That means making sure there are different kinds of school to suit different kinds of children. One size fits no one.The government has messed things up for this generation of children. Criminalising, criticising children. Fingerprinting children, instead of supporting them. And they do down children, just as they treat us grown-ups as if we were still five year olds, needing to be checked up on, monitored, controlled.We are the most spied upon country in the developed world.A million - a million innocent people have their DNA on a criminal database.More surveillance cameras than anywhere in the world.Parents snooped on by council officials checking up on where children spend the night.They\u2019re even putting tracking chips in our bins.And for what?We are still less safe than our European neighbours.Too many young men are still caught up in a cycle of violence.As Chris Huhne has so powerfully shown, our prisons have become colleges of crime. They have taken our liberty from us and given us nothing in return.Liberal Democrats will give our freedom back.I don\u2019t just mean civil liberties, though we\u2019d restore them.I don\u2019t just mean human rights, though we would cherish them.I mean allowing people, families, communities, to decide what\u2019s right for them, and do it. Because the government doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s best for us - and it never will.I\u2019ve talked about the new economy and the new kind of government that Liberal Democrats will create. I want to talk briefly about the road we will travel together to get there. Simply changing things around at the top will not work. We saw that in 1997. We saw it again in 2007. You can change Prime Minister without changing Britain at all. We need to transform politics. Because unless we bring people in, so everyone can take part, every change we need will fail.The way Britain\u2019s run today means the government doesn\u2019t have to listen to anyone. Less than a quarter of people voted for Labour at the last election, and yet they get to wield total control over all our lives. What\u2019s incredible is that Labour and the Conservatives alike still say we are the mother of democracies.What world are they living in?In 2001 for the first time ever, more people didn\u2019t vote than voted for the winning party. And when it happened, Labour and the Conservatives didn\u2019t pull out all the stops, they didn\u2019t go into crisis mode to fix it. They sat back, and let it happen again in 2005. Surely every rational person can agree \u2013 we\u2019ve got to have something different?When politicians are held in the same contempt as the chewing gum on the bottom of your shoe, shouldn\u2019t we try something new?An end to big donations.Fewer MPs.A parliament that actually holds the government to account.No more fiddled expenses.A fair voting system.A politics that puts people first.I want our politics to connect with people again.That\u2019s why in the next nine months we\u2019ll knock on a million doors in Britain, to speak - face to face - with the people we\u2019re asking to support us.It\u2019s why tonight we\u2019re calling 250,000 people to hear their views on the challenges facing our country. It\u2019s why we\u2019re streamlining the party\u2019s decision making through the Bones Commission.And it\u2019s why, ever since I became leader of our party, I\u2019ve held open public meetings every couple of weeks or so. Where everyone\u2019s invited, and anyone can ask a question or raise an issue. Real politics, real passion, real people.I can\u2019t tell you every step on the road for us as a party. But I can tell you where we\u2019re headed. Government. We grow every year. We\u2019ve been in government in Scotland. In Wales. We run more big cities in England than any other party. At the last General Election we won 6 million votes, more than any other liberal party in Europe. Together we will double our MPs in Westminster. And at the next general election we'll take a giant leap towards that goal.We can do it because we are the vanguard of British politics. We have been at the forefront of a revolution in ideas.The first to fight for women\u2019s rights, gay rights, human rights.The first to understand the problem of climate change.The first to see the economic crisis on the horizon.The first to see the vital role of liberal interventionism in international affairs.And the first to see its limits - and oppose the illegal invasion of Iraq.We are a powerful party.We are getting stronger.And our ideas are the right ones to get Britain back on track.Remember 1997. Things can only get better? We were told our country would be a success - and no one would be left behind. It didn\u2019t happen. New Labour failed. But there is a new, New Labour on the block. Blue Labour: the Conservative party. Let our country not be fooled again.If you were drawn to Labour in the 1990s. Because you believed in a better future. Because you were filled with hope that things would get better. Join us. We are the ones who can make it happen.Labour is finished. It\u2019s over.The Liberal Democrats are now the only party that can deliver social justice.The only choice for anyone who wants a fairer Britain.A party that will put money back in the pockets of ordinary families.A party that will build a stable, green economy for each and every one of us. A party that will change politics so that every person counts.The Liberal Democrats.Join us, and make it happen.

aVIn the last eight weeks, 28 British soldiers and Royal Marines have been killed in Afghanistan. However easy it may be to forget, we are a nation at war. Already more than 75,000 British men and women have done tours of duty in Afghanistan.Thousands upon thousands of our compatriots, putting their lives on the line in the burning heat and the frozen winters of a country on the other side of the world. I want to pay tribute, on behalf of all of us, to the tenacity, bravery and extraordinary professionalism of every one of them. Their families, too, have borne with incredible fortitude the separation, the fear, and the anguish of bereavement. We salute them.I\u2019m afraid the hardship has been deepened, for all of them, by the enormous difficulties of this war. After nearly 8 years, victory not only seems more distant than ever, failure seems inevitable unless we change course.I know some of you believe we should call for British troops to withdraw now. If things continue on the present disastrous course, then sooner or later that is a judgement which we may need to make. That is why we must change course. We have one more chance, one only, to turn things around.Success cannot be secured through military means alone. Development assistance must be bigger and faster. Talks with moderate elements of the Taliban network must commence. The international community must at last agree to a single plan in place of the present patchwork of duplication, disunity and muddle.The threadbare legitimacy of the government in Kabul must be strengthened by reaching out across ethnic and tribal divisions. And here at home Gordon Brown must change gear, too.  He must now show the leadership and conviction that has so far been so disastrously lacking in making the case to the British people.You cannot win a war on half horse power. We owe it to the young men and women serving in Helmand to give them all the political leadership and all the resources they need to do the job. We should either do this properly or we shouldn\u2019t do it at all. So I say to the Prime Minister: time is running out.Unless you change course, there will be no choice but to withdraw, and that would be a betrayal of the servicemen and women who have already made such enormous sacrifices on our behalf. I do not want British troops to come home defeated by political failure. I want them to come home, mission successfully completed, with their heads held high.Today is the beginning of real change in BritainLet me tell you why I want to be Prime Minister. It\u2019s because I want to change our country for good.Because I want to live in a country where prejudice, insularity and fear are conquered by the great British traditions of tolerance, pluralism and justice. Where political life is not a Westminster village freak show, but open, accessible and helpful in people\u2019s everyday lives. Where fine words on the environment are translated into real action.Where every child can grow up safe and secure, able to flourish, no matter their background, their income, or the colour of their skin. Where we make sense of the complex, globalised world of our times and play a creative role in shaping it.Where rights, freedom and privacy are not the playthings of the government but safeguarded for everyone. I want to be Prime Minister because I want to be the first Prime Minister in my lifetime to be on the side of the weak against the powerful, on the side of freedom against conformity, on the side of human innovation against government decree.I want to be Prime Minister because I have spent half a lifetime imagining a better society. And I want to spend the next half making it happen.I was lucky enough to be brought up in a large, warm family that had almost no time at all for the status quo. By parents who encouraged us, required us, as children always to ask why. Always to assume that there is a better way of doing things. If you only bother to look for it. That\u2019s the spirit I found in the Liberal Democrats. It\u2019s why I joined, and why I wanted to lead our party.Friends, this has been quite a week for us. I\u2019ve been called a number of names. Even \u2018a good leader.\u2019 By Evan Harris. I am never going to duck asking the important questions, however difficult they are. But I am immensely proud to lead a party that actually debates things, openly and democratically. Let\u2019s always remember: we are in this together.So let us not look back any longer. Let us look forward. From this point on, keep your eyes on our goal. Let today mark the beginning of real change in Britain.These are extraordinary times. A global recession. Mass unemployment. A broken political system. Government finances in crisis. And still: inequality rising and climate change spinning out of control. Faced with these extraordinary challenges, we need an extraordinary government.Blue-Red, Red-BlueBecause one thing, above all others, is certain. The way we got here is not the way out. The blue-red, red-blue politics that got us into this mess cannot clear it up. The way we got here is not the way out. Britain needs a change of direction. Let today mark the beginning of real change in Britain.Look at what the old red-blue politics offers. Back in 1997, Peter Mandelson told us to judge Labour after 10 years in government. It\u2019s been twelve years. And we have made our judgement.If you\u2019re poor, you\u2019re still far less likely to go to university than if you\u2019re better off.If you\u2019re from an ethnic minority, you\u2019re more likely to be stopped by the police, even when you haven\u2019t done anything wrong.If you\u2019re a woman, you\u2019ll probably be paid less than the men you know. And if you\u2019re a child born in the poorest neighbourhood of my city, Sheffield, you will probably die 14 years before a child born the same day, just up the road, in a more affluent part of town. We have made our judgement of Labour. They betrayed the best hopes of a generation.People are hungry for change. So the question now is: what change? David Cameron talks about change. But is it real change?He talks about broken Britain but campaigns for tax breaks for the very rich. He says he cares about the environment but then teams up with climate change deniers in Europe. He claims he wants to clean up politics but won\u2019t tell you whether his biggest donor pays taxes in Britain. That isn\u2019t real change, it\u2019s fake change. And Britain deserves better. To be fair, the Conservatives do have one belief. That it\u2019s their turn to govern. They think power should come easily. You get the sense from so many of them that they became Conservatives mostly because it looked like the simplest route to a job in the cabinet.I chose the Liberal Democrats. Not because I thought it would be an easy route to power. I knew it would be hard. But because I wanted to fight for what I believed in, however hard, however long it took.The Conservatives want to inherit power; I want us to earn it.The thing about David Cameron is \u2013 the PR might be good, but what\u2019s behind it? It\u2019s like my grandmother would have said. There\u2019s less to him than meets the eye.As for me? Well, occasionally I\u2019m a bit too blunt in interviews \u2013 but at least you know I\u2019m not just spinning you a line. I speak out.On the Speaker of the House of Commons.On Afghanistan. On bankers\u2019 bonuses.On citizenship rights for the Gurkhas.And I am so honoured that some of you have been able to be here with us today.People are turning to the Liberal Democrats. Because they see there\u2019s something different about us. It\u2019s our pioneering spirit.It was a liberal, Gladstone, who helped develop the concept of universal human rights. It was a liberal, Lloyd George, who introduced the world\u2019s first universal state pension. It was a liberal, Beveridge, who invented the NHS.Ours is the party of Paddy Ashdown, the first person to put climate change on the national agenda. Ours is the party of Charles Kennedy. Of Ming Campbell. Who used all the courage of their convictions to oppose the illegal invasion of Iraq. Ours is the party of Vince Cable, the first to see problems brewing in our economy, the first with a vision of how to take us to recovery.It\u2019s because Liberal Democrats are different that, when Gordon Brown let casino investment banking loose on our economy. The Conservatives said yes, and only Liberal Democrats said no.When Gordon Brown let house prices rocket and personal borrowing get out of control, the Conservatives said yes, and only Liberal Democrats said no. When the contracts were being drawn up for new polluting runways. When our civil liberties were being torn up. When our troops were massing on the borders of Iraq. The Conservatives cheered from the sidelines, and only Liberal Democrats said no.We are the only party that offers real change at the next election. Labour is dying on its feet. We are replacing them as the dominant force of progressive politics. We are the alternative to a hollow Conservative party that offers just an illusion of change.Make no mistake. There is only one party that will bring real change to Britain. The Liberal Democrats.The ChallengeThe biggest challenge for the next government will be sorting out the public finances. It\u2019s a challenge neither exhausted Labour nor fake Conservatives are fit to take on. This year\u2019s deficit is likely to be one of the highest in Europe. We will borrow £175bn this year alone \u2013 £5,550 every single second.  Total national debt could hit £1.2 trillion next year \u2013 £20,000 for every man, woman and child.I\u2019ll be straight with you. There is no easy solution. There isn\u2019t a serious economist in the world who agrees with the Conservatives that, right in the grip of recession, with two and a half million unemployed, we should pull the rug out from under the economy with immediate spending cuts. But, once the economy recovers, we are going to have to control spending tightly for many years to come.We were right, in years gone by, to campaign for new spending to help people, to support them, as children, as young adults, as parents and as pensioners. As Charles Kennedy rightly says: our commitments demonstrate generosity of spirit. And those manifestos were right for an age of plenty. Now something different is needed.But let me make something very clear. I am not going to abandon our vision for a better Britain because money\u2019s tight. It makes me more determined. Balancing the government books isn\u2019t a maths test.Fiscal discipline is not an end in itself. We offer discipline for a purpose. Not just austerity, but progressive austerity. Reducing the deficit, yes, but also building a fair society and a green economy. Still driven by generosity of spirit, but fit for the circumstances of the day. It\u2019s the only way to deliver real change in Britain.That\u2019s why our approach is completely different from the two other parties\u2019. We aren\u2019t going to salami-slice budgets like Labour and the Conservatives. Pretending that you can save billions of pounds just by using fewer paperclips and putting up the price of Parliamentary salads.It isn\u2019t true, and everyone knows it isn\u2019t true. We know what happens when you simply squeeze budgets, across the board, until the pips squeak. We know, because we lived through it before, under the Conservatives. We remember the tumbledown classrooms, the pensioners dying on hospital trolleys, the council houses falling into total disrepair. We remember, and we say: never again.Liberal Democrats will do things differently. Not shaving a bit off everything, but asking fundamental questions about what the government should and shouldn\u2019t be doing. Working out, openly and publicly, what works and what doesn\u2019t. So we can completely cancel the things that don\u2019t work. In order to protect, and even in some cases extend, investment that really matters. That is progressive austerity.We\u2019ve already identified big areas where substantial long-term savings can be made. Reducing the bureaucracy of Labour\u2019s centralised state, databases and agencies. Cutting the cost of politics - changing our electoral system and having 150 fewer MPs. Reforming tax credits so they go to the people who really need them. Spending less on defence procurement.We heard yesterday Gordon Brown is considering taking one of the Trident nuclear submarines out of service. I welcome that step in the right direction.  But if you want to lead nuclear disarmament around the world, you need to be more decisive. That is why we say no to the like-for-like replacement of Trident.Some people have asked me why we\u2019ve talked so much about identifying cuts. I know it doesn\u2019t feel comfortable some of the time. But we\u2019re doing it because we know that the more we save, the safer our schools and hospitals will be. And we know that if we save enough, we will still be able to include in our manifesto, despite these difficult times, some of the pledges for new investment that we hold so dear.Because if we end the child trust fund, we can pay for smaller classes for five, six and seven year olds. If we stop the waste of money on the useless NHS IT system, we could improve maternity services so every new family gets a great start.If we substantially reform politics, with fewer MPs, government ministers, departments and quangos, we could save billions. And we could put the money into insulating homes and improving public transport, creating thousands of new, green jobs. Building up Britain\u2019s infrastructure not our bureaucracy.Many of these decisions will be difficult. Taking them is the price of fairness. But if we are brave enough to take them. It will be the beginning of real change in Britain.I want to say something to teachers, doctors, nurses, police officers, social workers, in fact to everyone who works in our public services. Britain depends on people like you and the services you provide. I know these are anxious times for you.Everyone is talking about cuts. But neither Labour nor the Conservatives has come clean about what that means for you. They\u2019re not treating you like grown-ups. I want to work with you, hand in glove, to agree the way forward on pensions and on pay.On pensions. Of course, we will guarantee every penny of entitlements you\u2019ve already built up. But we do need to have a proper, independent review of what\u2019s fair, not just for public sector workers, but also for the taxpayers who pay your salaries. Let me reassure you: my particular focus will always be on the gold-plated pensions enjoyed by senior civil servants, quangocrats, judges \u2013 and MPs. At a time of pressure for everyone, it\u2019s only right for those with the broadest shoulders to take the greatest weight.Next: pay. We will never go back on an existing pay deal. That would be a betrayal. But in future, we need to work together to agree strict, disciplined limits. Again, I believe people with the most generous salaries should take the brunt of cuts so their lower-paid colleagues don\u2019t have to. But if it comes down to discipline on pay or mass redundancies, I think we all agree: protecting jobs must come first.Young people are bearing too much of the burden of this recession. Imagine how it must feel to have slogged your way through school, college or university, maybe racking up thousands of pounds in debt, only to find there isn\u2019t a job, any job, at the other end. This is supposed to be one of the most hopeful, optimistic moments in your life.Imagine sitting at home day after day, no money, nothing to do but wait for your fortnightly appointment at the JobCentre. We used to worry about getting our children onto the property ladder. Now we have to worry whether they\u2019ll ever get a job. There can be nothing more dispiriting at this formative moment. It destroys your self-confidence, perhaps for good.I want to say, to young people. I am sorry. I am sorry that you have been, already, let down so many times. I am sorry that you will spend your working lives burdened by the debts of a previous generation.But sorry isn\u2019t good enough. Our job isn\u2019t to feel bad about problems, it\u2019s to fix them. My commitment to the next generation is simple. The Liberal Democrats will not fail you.A New PromiseSo today we make a new promise to young people that they will not be unemployed for longer than 90 days before we find them work or training. Let me spell out what that would mean: If you lost your job today, we\u2019d find you work, training, or a paid internship by Christmas. Right now, we would cancel Labour\u2019s VAT cut and use the money to invest in young people\u2019s futures.We would pay for 10,000 more university places and 50,000 more college places this year. And we would introduce a new \u2018Paid Internship\u2019 scheme to give people real job experience. With an allowance of £55 a week. Young people would get experience that could make all the difference when it comes to looking for a job.And you know. We could pay for 800,000 placements for 800,000 young people. For the cost of just one weekend\u2019s VAT cut. If it\u2019s between 15p off a cinema ticket and a decent future, I know what we should choose.I have always believed that you can\u2019t make progress as a society unless every generation tries to do better for its children. That\u2019s an idea that\u2019s at the core of Liberal Democrat values. Providing opportunity for our children, even as we provide dignity and security in retirement and old age.To build a fair society, you have to start with children. And you have to start young. In Britain today, a poor, bright child will be overtaken by a less intelligent, but wealthier child by the time he is seven. This has to change. The first few years are the most important in determining a child\u2019s future. Those first few years when their character, their personality are being shaped.The first few years are the most important ones. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve always said: scrap the Child Trust Fund, which gives people a cash handout on their 18th birthday. And invest the money when it can really make a difference. With classes of just 15 for five, six and seven year olds. The beginning of real change in Britain.If you want to know how fair a society is, look at its tax system. Britain\u2019s is painfully unfair. The poorest pay a bigger slice of their income than the richest. Polluters are allowed to get away with harming our environment without paying for the clean-up. And we lose as much as £40 billion a year to tax dodgers.That\u2019s why the Liberal Democrats are going to reinvent the tax system to make it fair. Not changing the amount we raise, but changing who pays.We will raise the income tax threshold to £10,000, funded by closing loopholes that the wealthy exploit. And by making sure polluters pay for the damage they cause. I\u2019ll be honest. If you\u2019ve got a house worth over a million pounds. If you fly trans-Atlantic a couple of times a month.  If you get a seven-figure bonus paid in share options to get round income tax. You will pay more.That is what is fair. Why on earth should you get tax subsidies paid for by people whose salaries are just a tiny fraction of yours? I don\u2019t want to penalise people who work hard. If you can make it big: all credit to you. But what it should win you is respect, not exemption from your tax bill.In exactly the same way as on public spending. Many of these decisions on tax will be difficult. Taking them is the price of fairness. If we are brave enough to take them, it will be the beginning of real change in Britain.So if there\u2019s one policy you take away from this conference. One policy to mention on every doorstep, in every phone call, in every leaflet. Let it be this one.We will deliver fair taxes. Under a Liberal Democrat government, people will not pay a single penny of tax on the first £10,000 they earn. Millions of people will find themselves with an extra £700 in their pocket, and up to four million low earners and pensioners will pay no income tax at all. The beginning of real change in Britain.After the expenses scandal, people are crying out, rightly, for something different at Westminster. Labour and the Conservatives have betrayed them.  They offered warm rhetoric about change when the scandal was at its height. And then did nothing. They will defend the status quo to the last breath.Only the Liberal Democrats will clean up Westminster, reform expenses, end big donations and elect the Lords. Only the Liberal Democrats will give people the right to sack MPs who are found guilty of serious wrongdoing.  And only the Liberal Democrats will secure, once and for all, fair votes for everyone.That means radical electoral reform, argued for from first principles. Not just some minor tinkering, put forward by a dying Labour government as a last, desperate attempt to save its skin.We must do away with safe seats. Did you know, nearly half of Britain\u2019s constituencies have elected the same party in every election since I was born? These are seats where you could put a red or blue rosette on the back end of a donkey and it would still win. Only when every MP has to do a decent job and win the trust of the people they represent will we ever clean up politics for good. It will be the beginning of real change in Britain.Imagine a Liberal Democrat CabinetImagine a Liberal Democrat cabinet. Maybe the odd heated meeting. But imagine Liberal Democrats at work.Dr Vince Cable, of course, in his office at the Treasury. Ushering in fairer taxes.Cutting the banks down to size. Tearing up the Treasury red tape that strangles local government. And that\u2019s all between breakfast and lunch before he rattles off another book for the day.I tell you, when it comes to bankers\u2019 bonuses, I can\u2019t think of anyone better to send into the negotiating room. You think Vince would listen to those reckless bankers demanding their millions? He\u2019d say what we all believe: There will be no bonuses for failure, not today, not tomorrow, not ever again.Then there\u2019d be David Laws at the schools department, hunting down all those boxes and boxes of bureaucratic rules and paperwork that get in teachers\u2019 way, and throwing them out. I mean, recycling them. And if the civil servants say the pupil premium is too complicated. They can\u2019t work out how to invest the extra money to the benefit of the most deprived children. You know David will do the maths himself.Chris Huhne at the Home Office. Restoring the civil liberties so shamefully discarded by this Labour Government on his first day with a Freedom Bill. Cancelling ID cards to help fund 10,000 more police on the streets. You know Chris won\u2019t be put off by technocrats saying it can\u2019t be done. He\u2019ll produce volumes of statistics showing he\u2019s right and look sternly over his glasses until they cave in.Norman Lamb reinventing our NHS for modern times, giving communities and patients a real say. Professor Steve Webb getting to work at the crack of dawn to improve pensions for women. Sarah Teather and Norman Baker, building Britain\u2019s infrastructure \u2013 the homes we need and the public transport we deserve. Julia Goldsworthy, devolving so much power to local communities she finds she can halve the size of her department.And Simon Hughes taking charge of environment and energy policy. This is a man who\u2019s faced death threats to bring a killer to justice. Who\u2019s been involved in every environmental campaign you can think of since the 1980s. He isn\u2019t going to listen to vested interests who say \u2018it\u2019s too difficult.\u2019 He\u2019d set our course for the zero carbon future we need. The beginning of real change in Britain.The Beginning of Real Change for BritainClimate change is the greatest challenge of our age, no doubt about it. But it\u2019s also, very much, a challenge of our age. Like so many of the problems governments have to deal with. From financial regulation to terrorism and internet crime.It crosses borders.You can\u2019t stop the weather at the cliffs of Dover. That\u2019s why the big deals, the ones that matter, are struck at international forums \u2013 like Copenhagen this December. A summit that must, must agree an international plan of action to keep global warming not just below 2 degrees, but below 1.7 degrees. Because that\u2019s what the best science tells us is now needed to prevent catastrophic climate change.Who do you want representing Britain at a crucial summit like that? Labour? They have let us down internationally. It wasn\u2019t just Iraq. It was their disregard for European colleagues, refusing to attend summits, grandstanding about how superior they were. It was their disregard for international law. Their backroom deals with Saudi Arabia over BAE, with Libya over Lockerbie, with America over torture.  Labour has undermined Britain in the world.But what\u2019s the alternative? William Hague? David Cameron and William Hague think the nineteenth century state still makes sense in a twenty-first century world. They simply do not understand that in an age of globalisation power must be exercised by nations together, not squandered by nations going it alone.William Hague gives speeches about the enduring importance of the English-speaking world. When everyone knows the new power centres are China, India and Brazil. A Cameron-Hague foreign policy would be the most insular and self-defeating in modern times. How much influence would they have in Berlin, in Paris, in Brussels?  Not a gram. Or even an ounce. And because they wouldn\u2019t stand tall in Europe, they would count for little in Washington too.But there is a third option. Imagine Liberal Democrats around the negotiating table.Ed Davey, our outstanding shadow foreign secretary. Drawing on the wisdom of Shirley Williams. Paddy Ashdown. Ming Campbell. We would secure Britain a stronger role in the world. By putting us at the heart of the European Union and committing us to abide fully by international law.The beginning of real change for Britain.Go with Your Instincts: Vote Liberal DemocratYou know, before I went into politics I managed development aid projects in Central Asia. I led negotiating teams on international trade deals with China and Russia.  I worked on new rules to help create the largest single market in the world, here in Europe. I\u2019ve seen how different things could be if Britain would only play its cards right.I know there are people who agree with a lot of what we\u2019ve got to say. But who still don\u2019t vote Liberal Democrat. You don\u2019t think we\u2019re contenders. I urge you to think again.If you don\u2019t agree with our policies. If you don\u2019t want big change in Britain. Then don\u2019t vote for us. But if you like what you hear. If you share our vision for a different kind of future. Then go with your instincts; vote Liberal Democrat.Elections are decided by your cross on the ballot paper. Power is not any party\u2019s to be inherited. Power is yours to give to whoever you choose.So don\u2019t turn away, don\u2019t stay at home, don\u2019t vote Conservative just because you think it\u2019s the only option. This is Britain. We don\u2019t settle for second best because we think it\u2019s inevitable. We don\u2019t compromise on our beliefs because people might not agree with us. We stand up for our values with our heads held high.So when you enter that polling booth, choose the future you really want.Make no mistake: the Liberal Democrats will do things differently in Britain. But if you want real change in Britain, you have to take a stand. If you want what we propose, you have to vote for it.If you want tax cuts for ordinary people, paid for by closing loopholes for the very rich. If you want the right to sack your MP if they\u2019re proved corrupt. If you want children to start out at school in classes of just 15. Then vote for it.If you want our prisons to work, so there\u2019s less crime. If you want a lasting job in a new, green economy. If you want Britain to stand tall again in the world. Then vote for it. This is a vital moment in the history of our country. And you have the power to shape it.Labour is lost. They haven\u2019t the ideas, energy or vision to start again. If you voted for them in the past, you have a choice. You can give away your vote to a fringe party. You can stay at home in despair. Or you can join with the Liberal Democrats and make the difference.If you supported Labour in 1997 because you wanted fairness. You wanted young people to flourish. You wanted political reform. You wanted the environment protected. Or you simply believed in a better future. Turn to the Liberal Democrats.  We carry the torch of progress now.The choice at the next election is fake change from the Conservatives. Or real change from the Liberal Democrats. At a time like this.A time of real crisis. Britain cannot afford to be taken in by David Cameron\u2019s illusion of change. Britain needs leadership from a party with real passion, and it\u2019s the Liberal Democrats.There is hope for a different future, a different way of doing things in Britain, if we are brave enough to make a fresh start. So let today be the first day of the future of British politics. It may be only the beginning. But it is the beginning. The beginning of real change in Britain.If you want things to be different, really different, choose the party that is different.Choose the Liberal Democrats.
p236
aVTwo and a half years ago, I stood in this very hall to make my first speech as Leader of our party. I said that the chance for change was within our reach, and we had to seize it. That chance came. Perhaps not quite in the way many of us could have expected.But the chance came and you \u2013 we \u2013 responded with real courage and conviction.Cynics expected us to back away. Instead, we confounded those who said that coalition Government was impossible. We created a Government which will govern and govern well for the next five years.Of course there are those who will condemn us. We are challenging years of political convention and tradition and our opponents will yell and scream about it. But I am so, so proud of the quiet courage and determination which you have shown through this momentous period in British political history.Hold our nerve and we will have changed British politics for good. Hold our nerve and we will have changed Britain for good.Just think what we\u2019ve done already. We\u2019ve ended the injustice of the richest paying less tax on investments than the poorest do on their wages. We\u2019ve guaranteed older people a decent increase in their pension. In November, we will publish a Freedom Bill to roll back a generation of illiberal and intrusive legislation. By Christmas, Identity Card laws will be consigned to the history books. From New Year\u2019s Day, the banks will pay a new levy that will help fill the black hole they helped create. On 1 April, 900,000 low earners will stop paying income tax altogether. In May, the people of Britain will get to choose their own voting system. And this time next year, there will be a pupil premium so the children who need the most help, get the most help.We\u2019ve always been the face of change. We are now the agents of change. And every single person in this room is part of that change. Actually there\u2019s one contribution you all made to the success of the coalition negotiations that you probably aren\u2019t aware of. Our formidable negotiating team got all the training they needed battling out policy right here on the conference floor.Some things are different in government. Some are the same. I still think the war in Iraq was illegal. The difference is lawyers now get anxious when I mention it. I still believe in our commitments to the developing world. The difference is I get to make those commitments at a UN summit and make them happen. I still campaign for political reform. The difference is I\u2019m now legislating for it as well. The only real problem is I\u2019m still trying to explain to my children that going from leader to Deputy PM isn\u2019t a demotion.We will take risks in government. But we will never lose our soul. We haven\u2019t changed our liberal values. Our status is different but our ambition is the same.Remember the four big promises we made in the election campaign? For the first time in my lifetime, Liberal Democrats are able to deliver on those promises.We promised no tax on the first £10,000 you earn. We\u2019ve already raised the personal allowance by £1000. And in the coming years we will go further to put money back in the pockets of millions of low earners. We promised more investment in the children who need the most help at school. It will happen at the start of the next school year.We promised a rebalanced, green economy, a new kind of growth. Already we\u2019re taking action on the banks. We\u2019ve set up a regional growth fund. There will be a green investment bank to channel money into renewable energy. These are the first steps to rewire our economy. New jobs, new investment, new hope.And we promised clean politics. We\u2019re giving people the chance to change our voting system, cleaning up party funding and finally, a century after it should have happened, we are going to establish an elected House of Lords.Those pledges we made, together, in the election of 2010, will be promises kept in the election of 2015. The Coalition Programme, which commits the government to making all these changes, is not the Liberal Democrat manifesto. But it is not the Conservative manifesto either. It is our shared agenda. And I stand by it. I believe in it. I believe it will change Britain for good.Now, some say we shouldn\u2019t have gone into government at a time when spending had to be cut. We should have let the Conservatives take the blame. Waited on the sidelines, ready to reap the political rewards. Maybe that\u2019s what people expected from a party that has been in opposition for 65 years. People have got used to us being outsiders, against every government that\u2019s come along. Maybe we got used to it ourselves. But the door to the change we want was opened, for the first time in generations. Imagine if we had turned away. How could we ever again have asked the voters to take us seriously? Labour left the country\u2019s coffers empty. So the years ahead will not be easy. But you do not get to choose the moment when the opportunity to shape your country comes your way. All you get to choose is what you do when it does. We chose a partnership government.The truth is I never expected the Conservatives to embrace negotiation and compromise. But they did and it does them credit. David Cameron showed he could think beyond his party and help build a new kind of politics. The election result didn\u2019t give a single party the mandate to govern. It gave all parties the mandate to govern differently. We answered that call. And one of the most remarkable surprises of this Coalition Government is that our parties are not, despite so many cynical predictions, simply settling for the lowest common denominator between us. Instead, we have become more than the sum of our parts. For those of us who believe in plural politics, that\u2019s not a surprise. In life, two heads are usually better than one. And in politics, too, when the country faces grave challenges \u2013 the deficit, the threat of climate change, a war in Afghanistan, millions of children trapped in disadvantage \u2013 two parties acting together can be braver, fairer and bolder than one party acting alone.The new politics \u2013 plural politics, partnership politics, coalition politics \u2013 is the politics our nation needs today. The Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives are and always will be separate parties, with distinct histories and different futures. But for this Parliament we work together: To fix the problems we face and put the country on a better path. This is the right Government for right now. Our first job, however, is a difficult one. Balancing the budget. I did not come into politics to make spending cuts. But it is the only choice if we want to steer Britain out of the economic mess Labour made. The only choice if we want to bring back hope and optimism to our nation. We are gripped by a crisis, and it\u2019s the worst kind: it\u2019s invisible.You can\u2019t see the debts mounting up.Walk the high street, go to work, talk to your friends, you won\u2019t see the signs of our debts or our deficit. The numbers sound alarming, but in the end they\u2019re just numbers. It doesn\u2019t feel like we can\u2019t afford things. So how did this debt crisis happen? Put simply, over the course of the recession, 6% of our economy disappeared. The shock was so profound that even now the economy is growing, we are poorer today than we thought we would be. All the old predictions about our future economy \u2013 predictions on which spending plans had been based \u2013 have turned out to be wrong. We can\u2019t keep spending money as if nothing had changed.The problems are there. They are real. And we have to solve them. It\u2019s the same as a family with earnings of £26,000 a year who are spending £32,000 a year. Even though they\u2019re already £40,000 in debt. Imagine if that was you. You\u2019d be crippled by the interest payments. You\u2019d set yourself a budget. And you\u2019d try to spend less. That is what this government is doing.This isn\u2019t new for Liberal Democrats. Speak to councillors who\u2019ve led councils across the country; they know what it\u2019s like to pick up the pieces after Labour spent a community dry. Newcastle, Sheffield, Lambeth, Southwark, and right here in Liverpool. Our Council leaders know the poorest are the ones that suffer when the finances get out of control and money has to be spent on debts. They know there is nothing fair about denying you have a problem and leaving it for the next generation to clear it up. Would you ask your children to pay your credit card bill? I\u2019ve heard some people say that the cuts we are making are somehow taking Britain back to the 1980s, or the 1930s. Dismantling the state. It isn\u2019t true. Even when all the cuts have happened, we will still be spending 41% of our national income \u2013 the same amount we were spending in 2006. The Spending Review is about balance and responsibility not slash and burn. Of course, I wish there was a pain-free alternative. Who wouldn\u2019t? But whatever Labour say now, there isn\u2019t one. Not even in Alistair Darling\u2019s old plans \u2013 they too would have meant massive cuts. Delay won\u2019t solve the problems \u2013 in fact, it would make them worse.We could have decided to go more slowly but it would have worsened not eased the pain. Because every day you ignore a deficit, it gets harder to fix. The debts mount up and you have to pay interest on them. Already we are spending £44bn a year on interest alone. Under Labour\u2019s plans, that would have risen to nearly £70bn. A criminal waste of money that shouldn\u2019t be lining the pockets of bond traders. It should be paying for police, care workers, hospitals and schools. That\u2019s why this government\u2019s aim is that by the time of the next election, our debt problems will be solved; our debts falling as a proportion of national income. We will have wiped the slate clean for a new generation.In making these changes we will learn from the mistakes of previous recessions.We will not repeat the mistakes of the 1980s in which whole communities were hollowed out. I know from my constituents in Sheffield how worried people are that cuts will hurt the North in the way the industrial changes of the 1980s did. So let me say to everybody in those communities, in Scotland and in Wales, many of whose lives were torn apart. Yes, it will be difficult, but it will not be like the 80s. We will not let that happen. We will make these cuts as fairly as possible. Finding money for the pupil premium to help children get the best start in life. Reforming welfare to help people get back to work.We will not let capital spending \u2013 investment in new buildings, infrastructure and repairs \u2013 be swept away as it has in the past. We have a billion pound Regional Growth Fund targeted specifically at creating growth in those areas of the country that have been dependent on public sector jobs. We\u2019ve offered a National Insurance tax break to employers who set up new companies outside London and the wider South East. And we are determined to wean the economy off Labour\u2019s lop sided obsession with financial services in the City of London. Rebalancing our economy \u2013 so opportunity is never again concentrated only in the south east corner of our island. So no matter what your background or where you live, you have the opportunities you crave. The destination is the right one but getting there is going to be hard. To those thousands of people who work in the public sector, who do such an outstanding job in our schools, hospitals, police forces and local councils, I say this:I know these are very unsettling times for you. I will not disguise the fact that we need to take difficult decisions today to ensure there are good, affordable public services tomorrow. We have protected the funding for the NHS, the biggest public service of all.We will provide more, not less, money for the children in our schools who need the most help. But I know you will be thinking: why should you have to make any sacrifices to deal with a recession you didn\u2019t cause?Why are the bankers who helped create the mess not taking more of the blame? Why should you have to accept a pay freeze, or changes to your pension, when the richest still get away with paying little or no tax at all? I agree.That\u2019s why we imposed a levy on the banks in our first budget. It\u2019s why we\u2019re working hard with our friends in Europe and beyond on the idea of a financial activities tax on profits, pay and bonuses. It\u2019s why we\u2019re going to be forcing the banks to own up about the ludicrous pay and bonuses they give out. It\u2019s why our Banking Commission is looking at whether to split the banks up completely to keep our economy safe. And it\u2019s why we\u2019re working flat out to get the banks lending again to small businesses, the lifeblood of our economy. We have done more in five months than Labour ever did to sort out the greed and the recklessness of the banks. Our approach is simple: they helped bring down our economy. It must never happen again. People who avoid and evade paying their taxes will no longer get away with it either. We all read the headlines about benefit fraud. We all agree it\u2019s wrong when people help themselves to benefits they shouldn\u2019t get. But when the richest people in the country dodge their tax bills that is just as bad. Both come down to stealing money from your neighbours. We will be tough on welfare cheats. But unlike Labour, we\u2019ll be tough on tax cheats too. We will crack down on the super rich who hide away money overseas. We will take on organised crime gangs set up to avoid tax. And we will prosecute five times as many tax cases as Labour ever did. So the message is loud and clear: Just as the public sector must be made affordable, the banks must be held to account. And tax avoiders and evaders must have nowhere to hide. I want to make something crystal clear about the coming Spending Review. It is not an ideological attack on the size of the state. There is one reason and one reason only for these cuts: As Liam Byrne said in that infamous letter: there isn\u2019t any money left. It\u2019s not smaller government I believe in. It\u2019s a different kind of government: a liberating government. This government will transform the state. Reversing generations of centralisation. Putting power into people\u2019s hands. Because the job of government is not to run people\u2019s lives. It is to help people to run their own. I want Britain to have the best schools and hospitals in the world. But that doesn\u2019t mean we should be controlling them all from Whitehall. Governments that have the arrogance to imagine that 100 ministers and 1,000 civil servants can fix the country all by themselves. Governments like that fail. So we will restore power to people, families, communities, neighbourhoods and councils. Turning the tide of centralisation and for the first time giving power away. Councils, like all parts of government, are going to have to make do with less money in the years ahead. But they will have more freedom than ever before.Labour rattled on about decentralisation, but they held the purse strings tight. We are different; we are liberal. Because we will put local government back in charge of the money it raises and spends. That\u2019s why in our first budget we unlocked more than a billion pounds of ring-fenced grants. That\u2019s why we will end central capping of Council Tax. That\u2019s why we will allow councils to keep some of the extra business rates and council tax they raise when they enable new developments to go ahead.And I can announce today that we will be giving local authorities the freedom to borrow against those extra business rates to help pay for additional new developments. This may not make the pulses race, even at a Liberal Democrat conference. But I assure you it is the first step to breathing life back into our greatest cities.Our leaders in Sheffield say it could allow the redevelopment of derelict mines in the Don Valley; our leaders in Newcastle believe this could help them create a new science park; in Leeds they argue the Aire Valley could be transformed. But whether in Newcastle, in Sheffield, in Leeds or indeed in every city in the UK. What matters most is that finally, they will be in the driving seat, instead of waiting for a handout from Whitehall. Local people, local power, local change.The same approach \u2013 financial freedom \u2013 is governing our relationship with Scotland and Wales, too. That\u2019s why we are taking forward the Calman Commission to give Scotland real freedom and responsibility over its own money. And why, if the referendum for more devolution in Wales is successful, we will take forward a similar process for the Senedd. Giving the nations of the UK the freedom they deserve.Putting power in local hands is one of the many things Labour never really understood. The Labour leadership candidates are trying to rewrite history. But we remember. Civil liberties destroyed on an industrial scale. A widening gap between rich and poor. Failure to act on the environment. Locking up more children than anywhere else in western Europe. Kowtowing to the banks. A foreign policy forged in George Bush\u2019s White House. The invasion of Iraq.And then, on top of all that they brought the country to the brink of bankruptcy. Writing cheques, even in the final days of their government that they knew would bounce. This country could not have borne five more years of Labour.Has anyone else lost track of the books Labour people keep publishing? Never in the field of political memoirs, has so much been written by so few about so little. They went from nationalisation to serialisation. From The Third Way to a third off at the book shop.And the next generation is still fighting the same backstabbing battles instead of talking about the future for Britain. We held a public consultation about the Spending Review.We had 100,000 ideas from members of the public about how to cut waste and do things more effectively. And not a single idea from the Labour Party. I want to say something to whoever is elected as the next Labour leader. You cannot duck difficult choices forever. All you have done in the last four months is carp and complain. But a decent opposition has to provide a decent alternative. Your party let people down in government. Until you face up to your responsibility for the state we\u2019re in you\u2019ll let people down in opposition too.Labour did some good things, of course they did. But just think what they could have done. With enormous majorities, 13 years and money to spare. The best opportunity for real fairness there has been in my lifetime. But imprisoned by timidity they squandered a golden age.We must now take up the challenge that Labour ducked. We must do more, even though they left us with less. When faced with the daunting task of reducing our deficit, the temptation might have been to go slow elsewhere. One difficult task at a time \u2013 that would have been the cautious response. But it wasn\u2019t our response.Because I believe at times of great difficulty, great things can still be done. At times of great difficulty, great things must be done. Some say we\u2019ve bitten off more than we can chew. I say there\u2019s no time to wait. We could wait to solve the welfare crisis, but every day people struggle to get back into work. We could wait to give our children a better start at school, but they only get the chance to grow up once. We could wait to reform our prisons, but every day offenders leave prison and go straight back to crime. We could wait to cut the deficit, but every day, we spend £120m servicing our debts, and that\u2019s £120m we can\u2019t spend on our children.We have four years and seven months before the next election. 1690 days. We\u2019re not going to waste a single second. There is no time for the old go-slow, timid governments of the past. We\u2019re keeping our eyes on the horizon, not on the headlines. Building, brick by brick, day by day, the changes Britain needs.Of course the ambition of these reforms will provoke controversy. I know some people, for instance, are worried about our plans for expanding Academies, as we heard this morning.It wouldn\u2019t be Liberal Democrat conference if we didn\u2019t have a motion that provoked strong passions on both sides. The great thing is that all Liberal Democrats share a passion for education. When it comes to lasting fairness education is everything.So I want to be really clear about what the government is proposing. It\u2019s not Labour\u2019s academies programme: a few schools singled out for preferential treatment \u2013 a cuckoo in the nest that eats up attention and resources. We\u2019re opening up the option of Academy freedom to all schools. Because if one head teacher is free to run their classes in the way they know is best, why shouldn\u2019t all head teachers be free?My vision is that every school, in time, will be equal, every school equally free. But there\u2019s one freedom new schools shouldn\u2019t have. Freedom to select. The whole concept of our reforms falls apart if you use it to expand selection \u2013 because instead of children and parents choosing schools, you get schools choosing children. So we have made it absolutely clear: we will allow people to set up new schools but we will not allow them to pick and choose the brightest. No to more selection.Welfare reform will be controversial too. Benefit reform is difficult in times of plenty, but essential when money is tight. Labour\u2019s welfare system simply isn\u2019t fair. It pays people to live without hope of a better life instead of paying to help them build a better life. A liberal welfare system is different. It\u2019s built around work. I believe in work. Work is essential to a person\u2019s sense of self worth, their identity. We will only build the fair, mobile society we want. If we make it easy for everyone to get out to work and get on in life. And that\u2019s what this government will do.So the immediate future will not be easy, but the long term prize is great. I want you to imagine what you will say to people when you knock on their door at the next General Election.Imagine how it will feel to say that in Government, Liberal Democrats have restored civil liberties, scrapped ID cards, and got innocent people\u2019s DNA off the police database.Imagine how it will feel to say that our Government has taken action to cut reoffending, and cut crime, while stopping Labour\u2019s mass incarceration of children. We will have withdrawn our combat troops from Afghanistan, our brave servicemen and women having completed the difficult job we asked them to do. You will be able to explain that finally, we have a fair tax system where the rich pay their share, and the lowest earners pay no income tax at all. Our banking levy will have raised £10bn, reckless bonuses for short term gain will have ended, and banks will be lending responsibly again. Imagine how it will feel to visit home after home that our Green Deal has made warm and affordable to heat. You\u2019ll be able to tell people they have a new right to sack MPs who do wrong, and that the party funding scandals of the past are history.You\u2019ll be campaigning alongside Liberal Democrat candidates for the House of Lords.And if the British people say yes to the Alternative Vote in the referendum next May \u2013 forcing MPs to work harder for your vote \u2013 then you will also be able to say that the clapped out politics of First Past the Post is gone for good.To those who are angry now about the difficult decisions needed to balance the budget you\u2019ll be able to show that those decisions have set us on a better course with new growth and jobs that last. And, finally, you\u2019ll be able to say that all this has been delivered by a totally new way of doing politics. Never again will anyone be able to frighten the voters by claiming that coalition Government doesn\u2019t work. Liberal, plural politics will feel natural; the sane response to a complex and fast-changing world. Just imagine how different our country will be. Britain in 2010 is anxious, unsure about the future, but Britain in 2015 will be a different country. Strong, fair, free and full of hope again. A country we can be proud to hand on to our children. That is the goal we must keep firmly fixed in our minds. That is the prize.The years ahead will not be easy but they will make the difference our country needs. Stick with us while we rebuild the economy. Stick with us while we restore our civil liberties, protect our environment, nurture our children and repair our broken politics. Stick with us and together we will change Britain for good.

aVLiberal Democrats, we have now been in Government for 500 days. Not easy, is it? None of us thought it would be a walk in the park, but I suspect none of us predicted just how tough it would turn out to be. We've lost support, we've lost councillors, and we lost a referendum. I know how painful it has been to face anger and frustration on the doorstep. Some of you may have even wondered: Will it all be worth it in the end? It will be. And today I want to explain why. But above all I want to pay tribute to you. Your resilience. Your grace under fire. I have been genuinely moved by your spirit and your strength. Thank you. Thank you, above all, for never forgetting what we are in politics for. After the May elections, Alex Cole-Hamilton, one of our defeated candidates in Edinburgh said that if losing was part payment for ending child detention then, as he said: "I accept it, with all my heart." That is the liberal spirit and that is something we will never lose. The spirit that gave birth to our party a century and half ago, that kept us alive when the other two parties tried to kill us off. The spirit that means however great our past, our fight will always be for a better future. Down in Westminster we've been vilified like never before. The Left and the Right didn't like us much in opposition. They like us a whole lot less in Government. The Left accuse us of being powerless puppets, duped by a right wing Conservative clique. The Right accuse us of being a sinister left wing clique, who've duped powerless Conservatives. I do wish they'd make up their mind. So yes, it has been hard. And adversity tests the character of a party just as it tests any person. We've shown - you've shown - immense strength. After being hit hard, we picked ourselves up and we came out fighting. Fighting to keep the NHS safe. Fighting to protect human rights. Fighting to create jobs. Fighting for every family. Not doing the easy thing, but doing the right thing. Not easy, but right. And as for all those seats we lost in May, let me tell you this: I won't rest, we won't rest, until we've won every single one of those seats back. These may not be easy times for us as a party. But much more importantly: These are not easy times for the country. Economic insecurity. Conflict and terrorism. Disorder flaring up on our streets. Times like these can breed protectionism and populism. So times like these are when liberals are needed most. Our party has fought for liberal values for a century and half: justice, optimism, freedom. We're not about to give up now. This conference centre is on the site of the old Bingley Hall where William Gladstone stood a hundred and thirty years ago to found the National Liberal Federation. Gladstone observed that day that Birmingham had shown it was no place for 'weak-kneed Liberalism'. No change there then. So we are strong. United. True to our values. Back in Government and on your side.In Government you're faced with hard choices every day. The question is how you make them. Some ask 'how can we get a market to work here?' Others 'how can this win us more votes?' A few 'what will the press think?' For liberals, the litmus test is always the national interest. Not doing the easy thing. Doing the right thing. And that takes a certain kind of character. One which we've seen on display over the last few months. And indeed the last few days here in Birmingham. Brave. Principled. Awkward. Resolute. Optimistic. Unstoppable. No I'm not just talking about Paddy Ashdown. I am talking about everyone in this hall. But I think people still need to know more about the character of our party. Not just how we govern, but why. We proved something about ourselves last year, when we faced a historic choice: Whether or not to enter Government in coalition with the Conservatives. The easy thing would have been to sit on the opposition benches throwing rocks at the Government as it tried to get control of the public finances. It might even, in the short run, have been more popular, but it would not have been right. At that moment, Britain needed a strong government. Alistair Darling's recent book is called "Back from the Brink" - in reality Labour left us on the brink. Teetering on the edge of an economic precipice. So we put aside party differences for the sake of the national interest. People before politics. Nation before party. And while other countries have been riven by political bickering, we have shown that a coalition forged in a time of emergency could be a different kind of government, governing differently. Because let me tell you this: You don't play politics at a time of national crisis. You don't play politics with the economy. And you never, ever play politics with people's jobs. Our first big decision was to clear the structural deficit this parliament. To wipe the slate clean by 2015. This has meant painful cuts. Agonisingly difficult decisions. Not easy, but right. Because handing control of the economy to the bond traders: that's not progressive. Burying your head in the sand: that's not liberal. Saddling our children with the nation's debt: that's not fair. Labour says: the Government is going too far, too fast. I say, Labour would have offered too little, too late. Imagine if Ed Miliband and Ed Balls had still been in power. Gordon Brown's backroom boys when Labour was failing to balance the books, failing to regulate the financial markets, and failing to take on the banks. The two Eds, behind the scenes, lurking in the shadows, always plotting, always scheming, never taking responsibility. At this time of crisis what Britain needs is real leadership. This is no time for the back room boys Labour's economy was based on bad debt and false hope. Labour got us into this mess. But they are clueless about how to get us out. Another term of Labour would have been a disaster for our economy. So don't for a moment let Labour get away with it. Don't forget the chaos and fear of 2008. And never, ever trust Labour with our economy again. Government has brought difficult decisions. Of course the most heart wrenching for me, for all of us, was on university funding. Like all of you, I saw the anger. I understand it. I felt it. I have learned from it. And I know how much damage this has done to us as a party. By far the most painful part of our transition. From the easy promises of opposition to the invidious choices of Government. Probably the most important lesson I have learned is this: No matter how hard you work on the details of a policy, it's no good if the perception is wrong. We can say until we're blue in the face that no one will have to pay any fees as a student, but still people don't believe it. That once you've left university you'll pay less, week in week out, than under the current system, but still people don't believe it. That the support given to students from poorer families will increase dramatically, but still people don't believe it. The simple truth is that the Conservatives and Labour were both set on increasing fees, and in those circumstances we did the best thing we could. Working tirelessly to ensure anyone who wants to go to university can. Freeing part time students from up front fees for the first time. Ensuring fairer repayments for all graduates. But we failed to properly explain those dilemmas. We failed to explain that there were no other easy options. And we have failed so far to show that the new system will be much, much better than people fear. So: lessons learned. But the most important thing now is to get out there and show that university is for everyone. We should all take a leaf out of Simon Hughes' book - who has been busting a gut as the Government's Advocate for Access. Travelling the country, explaining the new system and finding ways to get young people from all backgrounds to apply to university. Simon didn't like the decision we made, and for reasons I respect. But rather than sitting back he has rolled up his sleeves and got on with making the new system work. Simon, thank you. Right now, our biggest concern is of course the economy. The recovery is fragile. Every worker, every family knows that. There is a long, hard road ahead. In the last few days alone we have seen a financial storm in the Eurozone. Rising unemployment. Falling stock markets. So we were right to pull the economy back from the brink. It is clearer now than ever that deficit reduction was essential to protect the economy, to protect homes and jobs. Deficit reduction lays the foundations for growth. But on its own it is not enough. That's why we're already: investing in infrastructure, reducing red tape, promoting skills, getting the banks lending. But the outlook for the global economy has got worse. So we need to do more, we can do more, and we will do more for growth and for jobs. Because we're not in politics just to repair the damage done by Labour, to glue back together the pieces of the old economy. We are here to build a new economy. A new economy safe from casino speculation. That's why a Liberal Democrat business secretary is putting a firewall into the banking system. Protecting the people who have worked hard and saved.  A new economy that safeguards the environment. That's why a Liberal Democrat environment secretary is creating the world's first Green Investment Bank, spending three billion pounds to create green jobs. A new economy where the lowest-paid get to keep the money they earn. That's why a Liberal Democrat chief secretary to the Treasury has put two hundred pounds into the pocket of every basic rate taxpayer and taken almost a million workers - most of them women - out of income tax altogether. A new economy based on skills. That's why one Liberal Democrat minister is creating a quarter of a million new apprenticeships, and another is investing in schools and early years education. A new economy that works for families. Where men and women can choose how to balance work and home. That's why Liberal Democrats are bringing in shared parental leave and more flexible working. And a new economy run for ordinary people rather than big finance. After the so-called masters of the universe turned out to be masters of destruction instead. Which is why when we come to sell those bank shares, I want to see a payback to every citizen. Your money was put at risk. Your money was used to bail out the banks. And so the money made by the banks is your money, too. An economy for everyone: In Scotland, Wales, in every part of the United Kingdom. For women and men. Young, old. Town, country. North, South. A new economy for the whole nation. Because as Liberal Democrats we act for the whole nation. In our long, proud liberal history, we have never served: the media moguls, the union barons or the bankers. We do not serve, and we will never serve, vested interests. We are in nobody's pocket. That's why we can make decisions in the national interest: Not easy, but right. That's why we speak up, first and loudest, when the establishment lets the people down. In the last three years, we've seen establishment institutions exposed one by one. The City of London, shattered by the greed of bankers. The media, corrupted by phone hacking.  Parliament, shamed by expenses. I was brought up to know that it is not polite to say 'I told you so'. But I'm sorry: We did. In 2006 when Vince Cable warned that "bad debts were growing" and that bank lending levels were "recklessly irresponsible". In 2002 when Tom McNally said: "The Government must guard the public interest as assiduously as Mr Murdoch guards his shareholder interests." And in 1996 when Paddy said that Parliament had become "A rotten mess.a dishevelled, disfigured old corpse of what was once called the Mother of Parliaments." Free to tell it like it really is because we are in nobody's pocket. Of all the claims Ed Miliband has made, the most risible is that his party is the enemy of vested interests. While we were campaigning for change in the banking system, they were on their prawn cocktail offensive in the City. While we've led the charge against the media barons, Labour has cowered before them for decades. The most shocking thing about the news that Tony Blair is godfather to one of Rupert Murdoch's children is that nobody was really shocked at all. And today Labour is in hock to the trade union barons: After their government stipend, 95% of Labour's money comes from unions. Most of it from just four of them. Let me be clear: The values of trade unionism are as relevant as ever. Supporting workers. Fighting for fairness at work. But I don't think the unions should be able to buy themselves a political party. Ed Miliband says he wants to loosen the ties between Labour and the union barons who helped him beat his brother. Let's see him put his money where his mouth is.  Let's see if he'll support radical reform of party funding. Every previous attempt has been blocked by the vested interests in the other two parties. We are all stuck in a system that we know is wrong. We've all been damaged by it. But if we learned anything from the expenses scandal. It is surely that if the system's broken.  We should not wait for the next scandal. We should fix it and fix it fast. So whether it is securing the economy, sorting the banks or cleaning up politics, we are making the big, difficult decisions. Not easy, but right. That's what it means to be a party of national government again. Not just making arguments, making change. In a coalition, we have two kinds of power: The power to hold our coalition partners back and the power to move the government forwards. So we can keep the government to a liberal path. Anchor the government in the centre ground. We were absolutely right to stop the NHS bill in its tracks. To ensure change on our terms. No arbitrary deadlines. No backdoor privatization. No threat to the basic principles at the heart of our NHS. We are right to stand up for civil liberties. No retreat to the illiberal populism of the Labour years.  We are right to insist on keeping the tax system fair. Asking the most of the people who have the most. And we will always defend human rights, at home as well as abroad. The European Convention on Human Rights and the Human Rights Act are not, as some would have you believe, foreign impositions. These are British rights, drafted by British lawyers. Forged in the aftermath of the atrocities of the Second World War. Fought for by Winston Churchill. So let me say something really clear about the Human Rights Act. In fact I'll do it in words of one syllable: It is here to stay. So we will always hold the liberal line. But much more important is the positive power of government: Not just stopping bad things but doing good things. Last year I walked through the door of No 10. But we all walked through a kind of door together. To being, once again, a party of national government. So we must move now beyond the reflexes of opposition to the responsibilities of government, and the opportunities of government, too. New social housing. Criminal justice reform.  Fixed term parliaments. Keeping our Post Offices open. House of Lords reform. Better mental health care. Safer banks.  Income tax down for ordinary workers. Capital gains tax up for the rich. Compulsory retirement scrapped. Pensions protected by a triple lock. ID cards: history. Child detention: ended. Just look at what we've announced in the last five days. After decades of campaigning, and thanks to Lynne Featherstone: Equal marriage, straight or gay. More power for consumers over the energy companies. Calling time on rewards for failure in boardrooms. Investing in education for girls in developing countries.  New powers to turn empty homes back into family homes. A five hundred million pound investment in growth. Liberal achievements from a liberal party of government. And we have stood by our commitments to act on the environment. The pollsters tell us that climate change has dropped down people's list of worries. That people have more immediate concerns. I understand that. So the politically convenient thing would have been to put this off to another day. Instead we have acted immediately. Not easy, but right. Ambitious carbon targets.  Energy market reform. Councils generating renewable energy.  A Green Deal to make bills lower and homes warmer. Carbon capture and storage.  Green buses, trains and trams. The world's first ever green investment bank. Green achievements. From a green party of government. I've learned quite a bit in the last 500 days. About the responsibilities of government. About the resilience of our party. The integrity of our members. About our determination to do the right thing. In government, every single day brings hard choices. You can quickly lose your way unless you are certain of your cause. Of why you are there in the first place. Every one of us in this hall has strong political convictions: Civil liberties. Internationalism. Human rights. Political reform. Responsible capitalism. Fighting climate change. But every one of us has a political passion too. The fire inside that drew us to politics in the first place. Let me tell you what I care most about. My passion is ensuring a fair start for every child. I have a simple, unquenchable belief: That every child can do good things, great things if only we give them the opportunities they deserve. Equal opportunity. It sounds so simple doesn't it? Everyone agrees with it. But then we allow prejudice, tradition and class to crush a million hopes and dreams, watch young children's lives go off track even before they go off to school, sit idly by while talent goes to waste. I know I have had all the advantages - good school, great parents. I was lucky. But it shouldn't be about luck. On Saturday I met a group of young people working with a charity called UpRising, here in Birmingham. All from really difficult backgrounds. One young woman, Chantal, told me that she only started to thrive when she found someone who believed in her. I want every child to believe in themselves. In terms of opportunity, we are a nation divided: Children from a poor background a year behind in language skills before the age of five; more young black men in prisons than at Russell Group universities. And within one city, two nations: In Hammersmith and Fulham in West London, more than half the children leaving state schools head to a good university. Just thirty minutes east - down the district line to Tower Hamlets - and just 4 percent do. Odds stacked against too many of our children. A deep injustice, when birth is destiny. That's why I've been leading the charge for social mobility - for fairer chances, for real freedom. People keep telling me that it's too hard. That it's futile to push for fairness into the headwinds of an economic slow down, or that it will just take too long. And that I should find some politically convenient 'quick wins' instead. I've also encountered fierce resistance from those who do so well out of the status quo. But for liberals the only struggles worth having are the uphill ones. Allowing schools to move poorer children up the queue for admissions. Making universities open their doors to everyone. Making firms work harder to get women on their boards. Breaking open internships. All controversial. All difficult. Not easy, but right. So I'm not backing down. I'm not slowing down. Because this will not be a liberal nation until every citizen can thrive and prosper, until birth is no longer destiny, until every child is free to rise. This summer, we saw the consequences of a society in which some people feel they have no stake at all. Nobody could fail to be horrified by what we saw during the riots. These weren't organised campaigns for change. They were outbursts of nihilism and greed. I'll never forget the woman I met in Tottenham, who told me the clothes she stood in were all the possessions she had left in the world after her home was torched. But in every city where trouble broke out, most people did the right thing. So many more people went out to clean up the streets than went out to trash them. In Manchester I met a café owner who boarded up her broken windows and started serving tea and coffee straight away to the people who were helping clear up. And here in Birmingham the community stood together in the face of disorder and tragedy. Or emergency services, our police and our courts all rose to the challenge. But we have to ensure that the offenders become ex-offenders for good. hree out of four had previous convictions. So we have to push ahead with the Government's rehabilitation revolution: Punishment that sticks, that changes behaviour. An end to the corrosive cycle of crime. And I want the criminal to look their victims in the eye to see the consequences of their actions, and to put it right. That's why there will be community payback projects in every city affected. Why we are investing in drug recovery wings in our prisons. Tackling gang culture. Tougher community penalties. Effective justice. Restorative justice. Liberal justice. But let me say something else: The rioters are not the face of Britain's young people. The vast majority of our young people are good, decent and doing the best they can. Don't condemn all of them because of the actions of a few. You know what really struck me? How so many of those who did join in the riots seemed to have nothing to lose. It was about what they could get, here and now. Not what lies in front of them, tomorrow and in the years ahead. As if their own future had little value. Too many of these young people had simply fallen through the cracks. Not just this summer but many summers ago, when they lost touch with their own future. So often the people who have gone off the rails are the ones who were struggling years earlier, not least in making that critical leap from primary to secondary school. So today I am launching a new scheme to help the children who need it most. In the summer before they start secondary school. A two-week summer school helping them to catch up in Maths and English, and getting them ready for the challenges ahead. We know this is a time when too many children lose their way, so this is a £50m investment to help them along the right path. And that is why we have found the money, even now, to invest in education. Protecting the schools budget. A two and a half billion pound Pupil Premium by the end of the parliament. More investment in early years education: 15 hours for all  three and four year-olds. New provision for the poorest two-year-olds. All steps towards a society where nobody is 'enslaved by poverty, ignorance or conformity'. Towards a liberal society. These are investments that will take years or even decades to pay off. By the time the two year-olds we help next year come to vote, I'll be 60. So why are we doing it, when it costs so much and takes so long? Because investing early makes such a huge difference, especially for the poorest children: Not easy, but right. So hold your heads up and look our critics squarely in the eye. This country would be in deep trouble today if we had not gone into Government last year. And Britain will be a fairer nation tomorrow because we are in Government today. Never apologise for the difficult things we are having to do. We are serving a great country at a time of great need. There are no shortcuts, but we won't flinch. Our values are strong. Our instincts are good: Reason not prejudice. Compassion not greed. Hope not fear. After the summer riots, message boards sprang up. They became known as 'peace walls'. And on the peace wall in Peckham there was a note that simply read: Our home. Our children. Our future. Six words that say more than six hundred speeches. Our home. Our children. Our future. Britain is our home. We will make it safe and strong. These are our children. We will tear down every barrier they face. And this is our future. We start building it today.

aVThis summer, as we cheered our athletes to gold after gold after gold, Britain remembered how it feels to win again. But more importantly, we remembered what it takes to win again. Whether from Jess Ennis or Mo Farah, Sarah Storey or David Weir, the message was the same: we may be the ones on the podium, but behind each of us stands a coach.  And behind the coach, a team. And behind the team, the organisers, the volunteers, the supporters. And behind them, a whole city, an entire country, the UK nations united behind one goal. What a contrast from a year ago when England's cities burned in a week of riots. When the images beamed to the world were not of athletes running for the finishing line, but the mob, running at police lines. When the flames climbed, not from the Olympic torch in east London, but a furniture shop in south London. A 140 year-old family-run business, which had survived two world wars and countless recessions, razed to the ground. Of course, even then, amid the smoke and embers, we saw our country's true character when residents came out onto the streets to clear up the mess. And we saw it again this summer when the Reeves furniture shop in Croydon re-opened in new premises, the walls decked with photos of young people holding up messages of hope. And who put those pictures up? Young volunteers from Croydon and an 81 year-old man called Maurice Reeves, who, like three generations before him, ran the shop before handing it over to his son. Maurice, your example should inspire a generation. You see, what Maurice has shown - what our Olympians and Paralympians have reminded us of - is that, for most people, success doesn't come easy or quick. That's what our culture of instant celebrity obscures: that real achievement in the real world takes time, effort, perseverance, resilience. The war veteran: a victim of a roadside bomb in Afghanistan, competing at the Paralympics. The businessman: a victim of an arson attack in south London, serving his customers again. The millions of people up and down the country, who, no matter how heroic or mundane their battles, keep going, keep trying, keep working, whatever life throws at them. These are the qualities that will see our country through these tough times. And these are the qualities that will guide our party through tough times too. So let us take our example from the British people as together we embark on the journey ahead. Our party: from the comforts of opposition to the hard realities of government. Our country: from the sacrifices of austerity to the rewards of shared prosperity. Two journeys linked; the success of each depending on the success of the other. Neither will be easy and neither will be quick, but it will be worth it. And be in no doubt. If we secure our country's future, we will secure our own. We live at a time of profound change, almost revolutionary in its pace and scale. Here in Britain, we are faced with the gargantuan task of building a new economy from the rubble of the old. And of doing so at a time when our main export market - the Eurozone - is facing its biggest crisis since it was formed. And while the European economy has stalled, countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, India and China continue to grow, and at a phenomenal rate. The potential consequences of this shift in power, should we in the West fail to respond, cannot be overstated. Our influence in the world, our standard of living, our ability to fund our public services and maintain our culture of openness and tolerance - all are in the balance. For power would move not only away from the liberal and democratic world, but within it too; from moderates to hard liners, from internationalists to isolationists, from those committed to the politics of cooperation to those hell-bent on confrontation. If history has taught us anything, it is that extremists thrive in tough times. So yes, if we fail to deal with our debts and tackle the weaknesses in our economy, our country will pay a heavy political price. But the human cost would be higher still. Not only would we fall behind internationally, we would leave a trail of victims at home too. So to those who ask, incredulously, what we - the Liberal Democrats - are doing cutting public spending, I simply say this: Who suffers most when governments go bust? When they can no longer pay salaries, benefits and pensions? Not the bankers and the hedge fund managers, that's for sure. No, it would be the poor, the old, the infirm; those with the least to fall back on. Labour may have thought it was funny, after crashing the economy and racking up record debts, to leave a note on David Laws' desk saying: "there's no money left". But it's no joke for the most vulnerable in our society; the people Labour claim to represent but let down the most. So let's take no more lectures about betrayal. It was Labour who plunged us into austerity and it is we, the Liberal Democrats, who will get us out. It's easy to forget sometimes that the debate we're having in this country is playing out across our continent. It's a debate between those who understand how much the world has changed, and those who do not. And between those who understand the need to adapt to those changes, and those who baulk at the size of the challenge. And the fate of every European country - ours included - will depend on the outcome. In the coming years, some countries will get their own house in order. But some will not. Those that do will continue to write their own budgets, set their own priorities and shape their own futures. But those that do not will find their right to self-determination withdrawn by the markets, and new rules imposed by their creditors, without warning or clemency. That that will never happen to us is often just blithely assumed; the comparisons with Greece, breezily dismissed. Yet it is the decisions we take - as a government, as a party - that will determine whether we succeed or fail. For the first time, the future is ours to make. Our journey from austerity to prosperity starts, of course, with economic rescue; dealing with our debts and delivering growth. If you listen to Labour, you could be forgiven for thinking that austerity is a choice; that the sacrifices it involves can be avoided; that if we only enacted Ed Balls' latest press release we'd be instantly transported to that fantasy world where there is no "boom and bust" and the money never runs out. But the truth is this: there is no silver bullet that will instantly solve all our economic problems. Some of our problems are structural, others international. All will take time to overcome. We are dealing with an on-going surge in global energy, food and commodity prices. An existential crisis in the Eurozone. And a banking collapse which, more than four years on, is still blocking the arteries of our entire economic system. Ranged against these forces, the idea that if government just deregulated a bit more as Liam Fox proposes, or borrowed and spent a bit more as Ed Balls proposes, we would, at a stroke, achieve strong and lasting growth, is just not credible. In my experience, if you're being attacked by Liam Fox from one side, and Ed Balls from the other, you're in the right place. You see, what is needed - and what we're delivering - is a plan that is tough enough to keep the bond markets off our backs, yet flexible enough to support demand. A plan that allowed us, when the forecast worsened last year, to reject calls for further spending cuts or tax rises and balance the budget over a longer timescale. A plan that, even at the end of this parliament, will see public spending account for 42 per cent of GDP - higher than at any point between 1995 and 2008 when the banks collapsed. And a plan that, because it commands the confidence of the markets, has given us the room to create a Business Bank, provide billions of pounds of infrastructure and house building guarantees and an £80 billion Funding for Lending scheme - the biggest of its kind anywhere in the world. Of course so much of this is about perception. People keep telling me we should be doing what Barack Obama did with his fiscal stimulus. What they don't tell you is that much of what the President had to legislate for, we are already doing automatically. So let's not allow the caricature of what we are doing go unchallenged. If Plan A really was as rigid and dogmatic as our critics claim, I'd be demanding a Plan B, and getting Danny and Vince to design it. But it isn't. Which is why you were right, earlier this week, to overwhelmingly reject the call for us to change our economic course. We have taken big and bold steps to support demand and boost growth. And we stand ready to do so again and again and again until self-sustaining growth returns. Of course, arguments about economic theory are of no interest to the millions of people just struggling to get by right now. The home-help whose earnings barely cover the cost of childcare. The builder who knows the company will be laying people off, but doesn't yet know if he'll be one of them. The couple who want to buy their first home but can't raise the money for a deposit.  To them and to all the other hard working families just trying to stay afloat, I say this: the Liberal Democrats are on your side. You are the ones we are in government to serve. Not with empty rhetoric but real practical help. That is why we promised to cut your income tax bills by raising the personal allowance to £10,000. So you can keep more of the money you have worked for. So your effort will be properly rewarded. So the task of making ends meet is made that little bit easier. At the last budget, we made two big announcements: that we were spending three thousand million pounds increasing the tax-free allowance, and just fifty million pounds reducing the top rate of tax while recouping five times that amount in additional taxes on the wealthiest. I insisted on the first. I conceded the second. But I stand by the package as a whole. Why? Because as liberals, we want to see the tax on work reduced, the tax on unearned wealth increased, and the system as a whole tilted in favour of those on low and middle incomes. The budget delivered all three. But let me make one thing clear: Now that we have brought the top rate of tax down to 45p - a level, let's not forget, that is still higher than throughout Labour's 13 years in office - there can be no question of reducing it further in this Parliament. All future cuts in personal taxation must pass one clear test: do they help people on low and middle incomes get by and get on? It's as simple as that. At the next election, all parties will have to acknowledge the need for further belt tightening. That much is inescapable. But the key question we will all have to answer is who will have to tighten their belts the most? Our position is clear. If we have to ask people to take less out or pay more in, we'll start with the richest and work our way down, not the other way around. We won't waver in our determination to deal with our debts. But we will do it in our own way, according to our own plans, based on our own values. So we will not tether ourselves to detailed spending plans with the Conservatives through the next Parliament. Colleagues, we should be proud of the fact we have delivered fairer taxes in tough times. We should be proud of the fact that we're taking 2m people out of income tax altogether and delivering a £700 tax cut for more than 20m others, and should never miss an opportunity to tell people about it. But as we do so, remember this: our tax cuts, like our extra support for childcare, for schools, for pensioners - these are not stand-alone consumer offers. They are part of a broader agenda of economic and social reform to reward work, enhance social mobility and secure Britain's position in a fast changing world. In short, national renewal. That is our mission. Our policies either serve that purpose, or they serve none at all. One of the things about governing is it forces you to confront the inconvenient truths oppositions choose to ignore. Like the fact that, over the last 50 years, our economy has grown threefold, but our welfare spending is up sevenfold. Or the fact that, to sustain our spending, we are still borrowing a billion pounds every three days. Or that, as a result of that borrowing, we now spend more servicing the national debt than we do on our schools. In combination, these three facts present us with a fundamental challenge: to not only regain control of public spending, but to completely redirect it so that it promotes, rather than undermines, prosperity. How we do that - how we reshape the British state for the economic challenges of the 21st century - is a debate I want our party to lead. For there are only two ways of doing politics: by following opinion, to get yourself on the populist side of each issue, or by leading opinion, and standing on the future side of each issue. The first brings short-term rewards, of course it does. But the big prizes are for those with the courage and vision to get out in front, set the agenda and point the way. So let us take the lead in building a new economy for the new century. An open, outward looking economy in the world's biggest single market. A strong, balanced economy built on productive investment, not debt-fuelled consumption. An innovative, inventive economy driven by advances in science and research. And yes, a clean, green economy too, powered by the new low-carbon technologies. Britain leading the world. But I have to tell you, we will not succeed in this last task unless we can see off that most short-sighted of arguments: that we have to choose between going green and going for growth. Decarbonising our economy isn't just the right thing to do; it's a fantastic economic opportunity. The green economy in Britain is growing strongly right now, bringing in billions of pounds and creating thousands of jobs - in wind, solar and tidal energy; the technologies that will power our economy in the decades to come. Going green means going for growth. But more than that, it means going for more energy that we produce ourselves and which never runs out; it means going for clear air and clean water and a planet we can proudly hand over to our children. Going green means going forward. So let the Conservatives be in no doubt. We will hold them to their promises on the environment. Of course, there was a time when it looked like they got it. It seems a long time ago now. When the Tories were going through their naturalist phase. The windmills gently turning; the sun shining in. As a PR exercise, it was actually quite brilliant. Until, at last year's party conference, they went and ruined it all, admitting that you can't in fact "vote blue and go green". Well of course you can't. To make blue go green you have to add yellow, and that's exactly what we're doing. As we plot our path from austerity to prosperity, we need to remember that nothing we do will make a decisive difference if we don't make the most important investment of all: in the education and training of our young people. For we will only fulfil our collective economic potential, if we fulfil our individual human potential. Yet the legacy of educational inequality in Britain is an economy operating at half power, with far too many young people never getting the qualifications they could get, never doing the jobs they could do, never earning the wages they could earn. The true cost of this cannot be counted in pounds and pence. Yes it's a huge drag on our economy, but more than that, it is an affront to natural justice and to everything we Liberal Democrats stand for. Because if you strip away all the outer layers to expose this party's philosophical core, what do you find? An unshakeable belief in freedom. Not the tinny sound of the Libertarian's freedom - still less the dead thud of the Socialist's - but the rich sound of Liberal freedom, amplified and sustained by the thing that gives it real meaning: opportunity. The freedom to be who you are. The opportunity to be who you could be. That, in essence, is the Liberal promise. And that is why this party has always been - and must always be - the party of education. Because just as there can be no real freedom without opportunity, so there can be no real opportunity without education. Every parent knows how it feels when you leave your child on their first day at school. That last look they give you before the door closes behind them. The instinct to go with them, to protect them, to help them every step of the way. That's how we should feel about every child. That's the responsibility we have to every parent. To support them at every stage: from nursery to primary, from primary to secondary and from secondary to college, university or work. That's why we're providing more money so the poorest two-year-olds, as well as every three and four-year-old, can now benefit from pre-school education. Delivering our Pupil Premium - £900 per child next year - so the most disadvantaged children get the more intensive, more personalised support they need. And why, when they leave school, we're providing scholarships, bursaries, grants, loans, apprenticeships and wage subsidies, to help them go on learning or start earning. But extra resources won't make a difference unless matched by greater ambition. Which is why money must be accompanied by reform. Reform to ensure all children can read and write. To make schools focus on the performance of every child. To turn around failing schools, and put more pressure on coasting schools. And yes, reform to replace GCSEs, not with an O Level, but with a new more rigorous qualification that virtually every child will be able to take, and every well taught child will be able to pass. And to ensure they do, I can announce that from this year, we will provide a new 'catch-up premium' - an additional £500 for every child who leaves primary school below the expected level in English or maths. If you're a parent whose child has fallen behind; who fears they might get lost in that daunting leap from primary to secondary school; and who is worried by talk about making exams tougher, let me reassure you. We will do whatever it takes to make sure your child is not left behind. A place in a summer school; catch-up classes; one-to-one tuition; we are providing the help they need. So yes, we're raising the bar. But we're ensuring every child can clear it too. I am proud of the resolve we Liberal Democrats have shown over the last two and a half years. We've had some real disappointments: tough election results, a bruising referendum. But through it all, we have remained focused, determined, disciplined. It hasn't always been easy, and, when we've made mistakes, we've put our hands up. But we've stuck to our task - and to the Coalition Agreement - even as others have wavered. The received wisdom, prior to the election, was that we wouldn't be capable of making the transition from opposition to government. The choices would be too sharp, the decisions too hard. The Liberal Democrats, it was said, are a party of protest, not power. Well two years on, the critics have been confounded. Our mettle has been tested in the toughest of circumstances, and we haven't been found wanting. We have taken the difficult decisions to reduce the deficit by a quarter and have laid the foundations for a stronger, more balanced economy capable of delivering real and lasting growth. But conference, our task is far from complete, our party's journey far from over. I know that there are some in the party - some in this hall even - who, faced with several more years of spending restraint, would rather turn back than press on. Break our deal with the Conservatives, give up on the Coalition, and present ourselves to the electorate in 2015 as a party unchanged. It's an alluring prospect in some ways. Gone would be the difficult choices, the hard decisions, the necessary compromises. And gone too would be the vitriol and abuse, from Right and Left, as we work every day to keep this Government anchored in the centre ground. But conference, I tell you this. The choice between the party we were, and the party we are becoming, is a false one. The past is gone and it isn't coming back. If voters want a party of opposition - a "stop the world I want to get off" party - they've got plenty of options, but we are not one of them. There's a better, more meaningful future waiting for us. Not as the third party, but as one of three parties of government. There's been a lot of discussion on the fringe of this conference about our party's next steps; about our relationship with the other parties; and about what we should do in the event of another hung parliament. It's the sort of discussion politicians love - full of speculation and rumour. But I have to tell you, it is all based on a false, and deeply illiberal, assumption: that it is we, rather than the people, who get to decide. In a democracy, politicians take their orders from the voters. So let's forget all the Westminster gossip and focus on what really matters: not our relationship with the other parties, but our relationship with the British people. Imagine yourself standing on the doorstep in 2015 talking to someone who hasn't decided who to vote for. This is what you'll be able to say: we cut taxes for ordinary families and made sure the wealthiest paid their fair share. We put more money into schools to give every child a chance. We did everything possible to get people into work - millions of new jobs and more apprenticeships than ever before. And we did the right thing by our older people too - the biggest ever cash rise in the state pension. But most importantly, we brought our country back from the brink and put it on the right path. Then ask them: are you ready to trust Labour with your money again? And do you really think the Tories will make Britain fairer? Because the truth is, only the Liberal Democrats can be trusted on the economy and relied upon to deliver a fairer society too.  And to help get that message out there, I can announce today that Paddy Ashdown has agreed to front up our campaign as chair of the 2015 General Election team. I must admit, I'm not quite sure I'm ready for all those urgent e-mails and 5am phone calls. But I can't think of anyone I'd rather have by my side. Paddy, it's great to have you back. Fifty, sixty years ago, before I was born, small groups of Liberal activists would meet up to talk politics and plan their campaigns. Stubborn and principled, they ignored the cynics who mocked them. They simply refused to give up on their dreams. They refused to accept that Liberals would never again be in government. And they refused to accept that Liberalism, that most decent, enlightened and British of creeds, which did so much to shape our past, would not shape our future. We think we've got it tough now. But it was much, much tougher in their day. It was only their resolve, their resilience and their unwavering determination that kept the flickering flame of Liberalism alive through our party's darkest days. At our last conference in Gateshead, I urged you to stop looking in the rear view mirror as we journey from the party of opposition that we were, to the party of government we are becoming. But before we head off on the next stage of our journey, I want you to take one last look in that mirror to see how far we've come. I tell you what I see. I see generations of Liberals marching towards the sound of gunfire. And yes, I see them going back to their constituencies to prepare for government. It took us a while but we got there in the end. These are the people on whose shoulders we stand. They never flinched, and nor should we. We owe it to them to seize the opportunity they gave us, but which they never had. Taking on the vested interests. Refusing to be bullied. Refusing to give up. Always overturning the odds. Fighting for what we believe in, because we know that nothing worthwhile can be won without a battle. A fair, free and open society. That's the prize. It's within our grasp. So let's go for it.

aVThree years ago \u2013 nearly three and a half \u2013 I walked into the Cabinet Office for my first day as Deputy Prime Minister. Picture it: history in the making as a Liberal Democrat leader entered, finally, into the corridors of power, preparing to unshackle Britain after years of Labour and Conservative rule. Only to arrive and find an empty room and one shell-shocked civil servant promising me we\u2019d get on with things shortly \u2013 but first he had to get us some desks. You saw the calm bit in the rose garden. What you didn\u2019t see was the utter chaos indoors. To say the Coalition caught Whitehall off guard is a massive understatement. The Government machine had no idea how it was going to handle power sharing \u2013 and not just the furniture, this was going to need a complete overhaul of how decisions would be taken and departments would be run. And \u2013 while no one really wanted to admit it at the time \u2013 the truth is, no one was quite sure how it was all going to work. Here we were, this anti-establishment liberal party \u2013 which hadn\u2019t been in power for 70 years \u2013 smack bang in the middle of Her Majesty\u2019s Government: a Government machine built to serve one party, with only one party leader at the centre, now suddenly having to answer to two parties and two party leaders. Alongside us were these Tories, who we had been at war with for the past month \u2013 well, actually, more like the last hundred years. The country was deep in economic crisis, in desperate need of stable Government. And the whole thing was set to a soundtrack of pessimism and naysaying: the Liberal Democrats had signed their own death warrant. The Coalition would fall in a matter of months. Britain would be the next Greece. So let\u2019s just stop and think about where we are now: The country\u2019s economy growing stronger by the day. Stable, successful coalition \u2013 something that seemed impossible now accepted as the norm. And the Liberal Democrats proving that we can be trusted with the biggest responsibility of all \u2013 fixing the economy. I know how hard it has been getting here \u2013 facing down all the vitriol from our opponents. Trust me, there were days I thanked my lucky stars that my children were too young to understand some of the things that were written and said. But every insult we have had to endure since we entered Government, every snipe, every bad headline, every blow to our support: That was all worth it \u2013 because we are turning Britain around. We haven\u2019t won over every critic; we\u2019ll be tested a million more times. But the big question mark that has always hung over the Liberal Democrats \u2013 could we handle Government, and handle it when the going got tough? \u2013 that question mark is now gone. This recovery wouldn\u2019t be happening without us. We have made sure the deficit is being cut at the right pace. We were the ones who said you don\u2019t just get growth by cutting red tape \u2013 Government also needs to invest in things: infrastructure, apprenticeships, regional growth. So I want you to feel proud today. Feel proud that the country\u2019s fortunes are turning. Feel proud that, when we were under pressure to buckle and change course, we held our nerve. Feel proud that we are right here, in the centre of Government and the centre of British politics, standing up for the millions of people in the middle. I have talked to you before about our journey from the comforts of opposition to the realities of Government \u2013 but not anymore. Liberal Democrats \u2013 we are a party of Government now. And just think of what we have achieved in three short years. For the first time ever, our schools get given money \u2013 our Pupil Premium \u2013 to stop children from the poorest families from falling behind \u2013 the first time ever. More than a million men and women have started training as apprentices \u2013 record numbers. Businesses across every region are being given billions to help them grow. We\u2019ve made the biggest investment in our railways since the Victorian times. We\u2019ve created a bank devoted to clean, green industry \u2013 a world first. Elderly people will no longer have to sell their homes to pay for social care because we\u2019ve capped the crippling costs. Mothers will no longer be worse off in retirement because our new simpler, fairer state pension recognises the value of raising a family. Fathers will have the choice of staying at home once their children are born because we\u2019re transforming parental leave. All parents will get free, extra childcare, paid for by the state, when their children turn three or two for the families who need it most. We stopped ID cards. We\u2019ve taken innocent people off the DNA database. We\u2019ve ended child detention in the immigration system. 0.7% of national wealth spent on aid for the world\u2019s poorest \u2013 our party\u2019s policy for years. Not to mention getting the banks in order and helping create over a million new jobs. And, one last one: at a time when millions of people are feeling the squeeze, when every penny counts, we\u2019ve cut income tax bills by £700 and taken almost three million people on low pay out of paying any income tax altogether. The Tories like to claim credit for that one now, don\u2019t they? But do you remember the TV debates? David Cameron turned to me, in front of the whole country, and said:  \u2018I would love to take everyone out of their first £10,000 of income tax Nick, but we cannot afford it\u2019. Well, we can afford it. And we did it. A stronger economy and a fairer society too. Actually, just one more, and my new favourite: just a few months ago, our Government \u2013 our Government \u2013 passed a law that will make Britain a place where we finally celebrate love and commitment equally between couples whether they are gay or straight: Equal Marriage. Three years. Three years. We\u2019re not even done yet. Can you imagine what we could do with five more? You should be able to \u2013we\u2019ve spent the last five days talking about it. This whole week has been about looking forward and one thing is very clear: the Liberal Democrats don\u2019t want to go back to the opposition benches, because we aren\u2019t done yet. Because here\u2019s what\u2019s at stake at the next election: The country is finally emerging from the biggest economic crisis in living memory. The absolute worst thing to do would be to give the keys to Number 10 to a single party Government \u2013 Labour or the Conservatives. All of the sacrifices made by the British people \u2013 the pay freezes, the spending cuts, the lost jobs, the daily grind of austerity \u2013 all of that would be for nothing. Labour would wreck the recovery. The Conservatives would give us the wrong kind of recovery. Only the Liberal Democrats can finish the job and finish it in a way that is fair. In 2015 the clapped out politics of red, blue, blue red threatens everything we have achieved. But, back in Government \u2013 and next time that will mean back in coalition Government \u2013 the Liberal Democrats can keep the country on the right path. Imagine the next round of leaders\u2019 debates everyone watching to see who agrees with whom this time. David Cameron will say to Ed Miliband: you\u2019re irresponsible, you are going to drive the economy to ruin. Ed Miliband will say to David Cameron: you can\u2019t be trusted to help everyone, your party only cares about the rich. For once, I will agree with them both. Because they\u2019re both right: left to their own devices, they\u2019ll both get it wrong. But, Liberal Democrats, we have learned a lot since getting into Government, and one of the main things I have learnt is this: If we\u2019re asking people to put us back in the room next time round, if we want them to know why it\u2019s better to have us round the table when the big decisions are made, they need to be able to make a judgement about what we\u2019ll do there. And that\u2019s as much about values, character, background as anything else. They need to know who we are. Who I am. Why I\u2019m a Liberal Democrat and why I\u2019m standing here today. So, let me start with this: I was part of a generation raised \u2013 in the 70s and 80s \u2013 on a constant diet of aggressive, us-and-them politics. I have so many memories of my brothers, my sister and I watching television and asking our parents why everyone seemed so upset. Angry, shouty Labour politicians. Union leaders gesticulating furiously, next to pictures of rubbish piling up on the streets. And later: stand offs between crowds of miners and rows of riot police. At school I was being taught all about the Cold War \u2013 the backdrop to all of this; I even remember a history teacher telling me and my petrified classmates that we probably wouldn\u2019t make it until Christmas because there was bound to be a Soviet strike. So the world I grew up in was all about stark, polarised choices. Us vs them; East vs West; Left vs Right. An incompetent Labour Government had been replaced by a heartless Conservative Government. All anyone seemed to care about was whose side you were on. So I steered clear of party politics. Then, one day, when I was 22 and studying in America, the phone rang and it was my mum. She had just heard on the News that the Berlin Wall was coming down. So my flatmate and I tuned in our radio, and we sat and listened for hours to reports of people coming out of their homes in the middle of the night and literally hammering away at this symbol of division and hate. And I can remember so clearly the sense of optimism and hope. Anyone here who\u2019s my age will understand: it really felt as though the dark, drab days of angry politics and conflict could now give way to something better. But, in the weeks and months that followed, when I looked to the Government of my country, the British Government, to see if they were raising their sights to help shape this brave new world. All I could see was a bunch of Tories too busy tearing strips off each other \u2013 embroiled, surprise surprise, in rows about European Treaties and widget directives. It was so totally dispiriting: everything I\u2019d come to abhor about the politics with which I\u2019d grown up: insular, petty, polarised. And if that had been the end of the story, I doubt I would have entered politics at all. But it wasn\u2019t. Enter Paddy Ashdown. I met Paddy, for the first time, when he came into a dingy, grey, bureaucratic office I was working in in Strasbourg. It was the middle of a major trade dispute between America and Europe. He marched in, everyone instinctively stood to attention, and in what seemed like the blink of an eye: he ordered a cup of coffee, instructed the room on how to solve the world\u2019s trade wars, issued a series of action points that should have been delivered yesterday, reassured us all it would be alright, and then swept out. This was the first time I\u2019d seen a British politician talking with passion and conviction and without defensiveness or fear about the challenges in the world and the leadership Britain needed to show. The Liberal Democrats seemed so outward looking and forward looking, compared to the tired, old, introverted politics of Labour and the Conservatives. For me, that was it. That\u2019s how I found our party. So I know what it is like to look at the old parties and want more \u2013 to want a party that speaks for big, enduring values. And what the Liberal Democrats gave me 20 years ago. Showing me there was something better than the tired choice between Labour and the Conservatives is something I want us to give to people across Britain today. What do you think Britain would look like today if the Tories had been alone in Whitehall for the last three years? What would have happened without Liberal Democrats in this Government? I haven\u2019t said enough about it. It\u2019s a bit old fashioned, but I always thought it was better, in politics, to tell people about the things you\u2019ve achieved not just the things you\u2019ve stopped. But people do need to know how coalition operates and what we do day in day out inside Government. Ultimately it\u2019s up to the Prime Minister and me to make this work; where there are disagreements, we try and seek compromise, and by doing that we\u2019ve cracked problems that single party Governments have struggled with for decades: social care, pension reform, reducing reoffending, and so on. But sometimes compromise and agreement isn\u2019t possible and you just have to say \u201cno\u201d. Inheritance tax cuts for millionaires - no. Bringing back O\u2019 levels and a two-tier education system - no. Profit-making in schools \u2013 no. New childcare ratios \u2013 no. Firing workers at will, without any reasons given \u2013 no, absolutely not. Regional pay penalising public sector workers in the north - no. Scrapping housing benefit for young people \u2013 no. No to ditching the Human Rights Act. No to weakening the protections in the Equalities Act. No to closing down the debate on Trident. Had they asked us, no to those \u2018go home\u2019 poster vans. No to the boundary changes if you cannot deliver your side of the bargain on House of Lords reform. And if there\u2019s one area where we\u2019ve had to put our foot down more than any other, have a guess. Yep, the environment. It\u2019s an endless battle; we\u2019ve had to fight tooth and nail; it was the same just this week with the decision to introduce a small levy to help Britain radically cut down on plastic bags. They wanted to scrap Natural England, hold back green energy. They even wanted geography teachers to stop teaching children about how we can tackle climate change. No, no and no \u2013 the Liberal Democrats will keep this Government green. I don\u2019t pretend it\u2019s always easy to say no.  Sometimes I\u2019ve had to wrestle with some genuinely difficult dilemmas \u2013 not just Tory party dogma. With the Snoopers\u2019 Charter, I took months listening to Home Office officials, the IT experts, the security services and the police because, as much as I am in Government to protect civil liberties, I also have to go to sleep at night knowing I did my bit to keep people safe. Government ministers, loud voices in the Labour party, the securocrats and Whitehall were all adamant I should say yes. But, when push came to shove, it became clear that the surveillance powers being proposed were disproportionate: they would have massively undermined people\u2019s privacy, but the security gain was neither proven nor clear. It was right for the establishment, but wrong for the people. So I said no. Obviously, we haven\u2019t been in coalition with Labour. I could give you a hypothetical list of bad ideas the Liberal Democrats would have to stop \u2013 but that would involve Labour producing some actual policies. Who here knows Labours plan for our schools? Or welfare? What would they do for the NHS? For industry? To cut crime? Well, Labour may not have an economic strategy, but fortunately we do. A bold plan for growth agreed by conference two days ago, built on sound public finances, with house-building, infrastructure and lending to business at its heart \u2013 Liberal Democrats turning Britain around. The truth is, Labour haven\u2019t set out any kind of vision for Britain because they didn\u2019t think they needed to. They have spent the last three years lazily assuming austerity would drive voters into their laps. For them, 2015 is all about the coalition parties losing rather than Labour having to actually try and win. And that tells you everything about why they act the way they do: their deliberate decision to put tactical victories ahead of long-term reform. Remember the AV referendum? Not a happy memory for the Liberal Democrats, I accept. But do you remember that AV was in fact in Labour\u2019s manifesto? Yet it was Labour figures who were most staunch in the defence of the status quo \u2013 just to score points against us. Lords reform \u2013 something they historically believe in. Yet when they had the chance to vote for it they found excuses not to \u2013 just to score points against us. Even when we hear good news about the economy, they\u2019re miserable \u2013 they\u2019d rather it be bad, just to score points against us. So I have a message for Labour today: you can\u2019t just duck responsibility for the past \u2013 refuse to spell out what you\u2019d do in the future \u2013 and expect people to give you a blank cheque. You can sit and wait for the British people to come back to you, but don\u2019t hold your breath. And if there is one area all of the parties need to put politics aside, it\u2019s Europe, and Britain\u2019s place in it. The Conservatives have this bizarre view that we can turn our back on Europe and still lead in the world. As if we\u2019ll be taken seriously by the Americans, the Chinese, the Indians, all the big superpowers when we\u2019re isolated and irrelevant in our own backyard. But the truth is we stand tall in Washington, Beijing, Delhi when we stand tall in Brussels, Paris and Berlin. I know it because I worked there; I have seen with my own eyes what can be achieved for Britain by engaging with our neighbours and building the world\u2019s largest borderless single market upon which millions of jobs in our country now depend. Of course the European Union needs reform \u2013 no one is saying it doesn\u2019t. But we cannot allow the contorted confusion of the right, the outright isolationism of UKIP, to jeopardise millions of British jobs and diminish Britain\u2019s standing in the world. Liberal Democrats, it falls to us to stand up for the national interest: we will be the party of In. I am an internationalist \u2013 pure and simple; first by birth, then by marriage, but above all by conviction. We may be an island nation, but there\u2019s no such thing as an economic island in an age of globalisation. And Britain is always at its strongest and proudest when we are open to the world \u2013 generous-spirited and warm-hearted, working with our neighbours and a leader on the world stage. That\u2019s the message I will take to New York next week, when I represent the UK at the United Nations General Assembly. There are some in the world who seek to present us as pulling up the drawbridge, following Parliament\u2019s decision not to consider a military intervention in Syria \u2013 but they will hear from me that they are wrong. My views on Syria are well known: I believe the use of chemical weapons \u2013 a war crime under international, humanitarian law \u2013 should be stopped wherever possible. But I understand why some people are wary of another entanglement in the Middle East \u2013 Iraq casts a long shadow \u2013 and we now have the opportunity to work with the UN, the Russians, the Americans, the French and others to put these heinous weapons beyond the reach of Assad\u2019s regime. What matters now is that we are clear that this nation is not heading into retreat. It would be a double tragedy if the legacy of Iraq was a Britain turned away from the world. Others look to our values and traditions for inspiration. Democracy, peaceful protest, equality before the law. That, in itself, confers a leadership role on us. Not as some military superpower. Not out of some nostalgic impulse after the loss of empire. But because we believe in the virtues of law, peaceful dissent, political stability and human rights as enduring liberal values.These are values that my own family \u2013 affected by the wars and conflicts of the past like so many other families \u2013 never took for granted. And Miriam and I try to teach our sons that they shouldn\u2019t take these values for granted either. After Spain moved to democracy in the 1970s, Miriam\u2019s father was the first democratically elected Mayor in a small agricultural town in the middle of the countryside. He single handedly brought better schools, more jobs and better housing to his community. He was hugely proud of being the first Mayor to serve his community through the ballot box. He sadly died some years ago, and there\u2019s a small statue of him today outside the church in Miriam\u2019s village. Our small boys see that statue every holiday and Miriam tells them of the wonderful things he did. And they always ask about why he was elected and no one before him. We teach them that democracy and freedom are a fragile and recent thing in many parts of the world. We teach them \u2013 just as my parents taught me \u2013 that rights and values should never be taken for granted, and if you believe in them, you should stand up for them. And that is the United Kingdom that I want my children \u2013 all children \u2013 to grow up in: a United Kingdom that defends and promotes its values \u2013 our liberal values \u2013 at home and abroad. It is now a year to the day until the Scottish people decide whether or not to leave the UK. The independence referendum. I unambiguously, unequivocally want Scotland to remain in the United Kingdom. The nationalists don\u2019t have a monopoly on passion in this debate. I love the way the UK is made up of different peoples, different traditions, different histories. I\u2019ve sat in rugby grounds shouting my head off for England while the Scottish fans have shouted back just as loud \u2013 and it is a very special thing when good natured rivalry can flourish side by side with a feeling of affinity and closeness that comes from being a family of nations. And on every single level we are stronger together than we are apart. We live in uncertain times, in an uncertain world - these are not days to build walls. They are days to bring them down. The decision in a year\u2019s time does not need to be between breaking the bond or keeping the status quo \u2013 that\u2019s a false choice.\u2018No\u2019 does not mean no change. A Scottish decision to remain within the UK family can and must give way to a new settlement for this nation. The Liberal Democrats have always fought for more powers for Scotland \u2013 and Wales and Northern Ireland too. In Coalition we have overseen the biggest transfer of financial freedoms in 300 years. And, from Gladstone to Grimond to today, we continue to believe in home rule. Ming Campbell has recently produced a superb report setting out how we think home rule will work in the future. Our vision is of a proud and strong Scotland, within the United Kingdom, in charge of its own fate but part of a family of nations too. This is a vision shared by many Scots and, increasingly, the other major political parties. That is why \u2013 once the issue of Scotland\u2019s continued participation in the United Kingdom is hopefully settled next year \u2013 I want to see a new cross party approach to the next advance in Scottish devolution. Willie Rennie has signalled his willingness to work with the Scottish Labour and Conservative leaders ahead of next year\u2019s vote \u2013 and I support him. Delivering Home Rule is a tantalising prospect that is now closer than it has been for a generation. So let\u2019s get out there to win the referendum in favour of keeping our nations together \u2013 and then work with others to deliver the future Scotland wants. I had the pleasure of meeting one of Scotland\u2019s finest this summer - Andy Murray. It was at a reception in the Downing Street garden the day after his stunning Wimbledon victory. David Cameron, Ed Miliband and I were all kind of fluttering around him, trying to ask clever questions about the Djokovic match, when Andy Murray suddenly interrupted with: \u2018you all seem to get along now, why can\u2019t you always be like this?\u2019 A good question that was met with an awkward silence and the three of us shuffling our feet. He was right, it\u2019s true: we can get on. We\u2019re never going to be mates, but I\u2019ve got nothing against them personally \u2013 politically, yes, personally, no. That\u2019s why the constant, breathless speculation about how different party leaders get on kind of misses the point. I\u2019m endlessly asked who I feel more \u2018comfortable\u2019 with \u2013 David Cameron or Ed Miliband? Wouldn\u2019t our party be more comfortable with Labour? Aren\u2019t we more comfortable with our present coalition partners? But I don\u2019t look at Ed Miliband and David Cameron and ask myself who I\u2019d be most comfortable with, as if I was buying a new sofa. In an ideal world, I wouldn\u2019t have to work with either of them because I\u2019d be Prime Minister on my own thank you very much \u2013 and I\u2019d like to think I\u2019d do a better job too. So the best thing would be to put all of the predictions and personalities to one side. Whether or not we have another coalition is determined by the British people \u2013 not me, not you, the people. And if that happens, only their votes can tell us what combination of parties carries the greatest legitimacy. Our job is plain and simple: to get more Lib Dem MPs elected. A liberal commitment to genuine pluralism \u2013 genuine democratic choice \u2013 starts and finishes with the wishes of the public, not the preferences of the political classes. That\u2019s one of the reasons why I\u2019ve never shared the view that the aim of our party should be to realign British politics by joining up with one of the other parties. Roy Jenkins \u2013 someone I admired very much \u2013 believed that if we aligned with a modernising Labour party we could heal the divisions of the centre left. But, for me, joining forces for good with another party simply reduces democratic choice. The Liberal Democrats are not just some subset of the Labour or Tory parties \u2013 we\u2019re no one\u2019s little brother. We have our own values, our own liberal beliefs. We\u2019re not trying to get back into Government to fold into one of the other parties \u2013 we want to be there to anchor them to the liberal centre ground, right in the centre, bang in the middle. We\u2019re not here to prop up the two party system: we\u2019re here to bring it down. My upbringing was privileged: home counties; private school; Cambridge University. I had a lot of opportunities. But I also had two parents who were determined that my brothers, my sister and I knew how lucky we were. On both sides, their families had experienced huge upheavals. My Dutch mother had spent much of her childhood in a prisoner of war camp. My dad\u2019s Russian mother had come to England after her family lost everything in the Russian Revolution. So our home was full of different languages, relatives with different backgrounds, people with different views, music and books from different places. And my mother and father always told us that people\u2019s fortunes can turn quickly \u2013 that good fortune should never be assumed and misfortune can occur suddenly, without warning. I think because of the traumas their parents had been through, while they wanted to give us everything, it was so important to them that we didn\u2019t take things for granted. My brothers and sister and I were always taught to treat everyone the same, not to judge people by their background. We were raised to believe that everyone deserves a chance because everyone\u2019s fortunes can change, often through no fault of their own. And now, as a father with three children at school, I have come to understand even more clearly than before that if we want to live in a society where everyone has a fair chance to live the life they want - and to bounce back from misfortune too - then education is the key. The gifts we give our children \u2013 self-confidence, an enthusiasm to learn, an ability to empathise with others, a joy in forging new friendships \u2013 these are instilled at an extraordinarily young age. That\u2019s why I made social mobility the social policy objective of this Government \u2013 and I will want it to be the same for any Government I\u2019m in. It\u2019s why so much of my efforts over the last three years, and so much of the money available to us, has been invested in those crucial formative years: The £2.5bn Pupil Premium that I first wrote about 10 years ago. The 15 hours of free pre-school help for all three and four year olds, and now two year olds from the homes who need it most. Shared parental leave; new rights to flexible working; tax free childcare. These are the measures I\u2019ve spent more time on than anything else in this Coalition. If you want to know what I really believe in you will find it in these policies. Using the muscle of the state to create a level playing field when it counts most \u2013 when boys and girls are still forming their views, their characters, their hopes and their fears. That\u2019s why I\u2019m delighted to tell you that we are now also going to provide free school meals for all children of infant school age. From next September we\u2019ll give every child in Reception, and Years 1 and 2 a healthy lunch every day \u2013 saving families more than £400 per year, per child. And, for the Liberal Democrats, this is a first step: my ambition is to provide free school meals for all primary school children. Another reason we want to get into Government again next time round. The Conservatives, on the other hand, have made it clear that their priority is to help some families over others, with a tax break for married couples. A tax break for some, funded through the taxes of everybody else - that tells you everything you need to know about their values. We, however, will help all families in these tough times, not just the kind we like best, by helping their young children get the best possible start in life \u2013 and that tells you everything about our values. Providing this kind of help, Liberal Democrats, is now, the most important thing we can do. Aside from anything else, that is how we restore people\u2019s faith in our politics: by delivering for them in ways that are relevant and real. By talking to people about the things they care about, not what the political classes are talking about. It\u2019s so easy to lose sight of those things when you\u2019re stuck in the Westminster bubble. And I want to be honest with you: keeping a balance between politics and normal life isn\u2019t straightforward. Politics these days is a roller-coaster ride of 24 hour news, breathless headlines, lurid tweets, endless polls, constant gossip about who\u2019s up and who\u2019s down. And you have to be really disciplined with yourself about keeping one foot in the real world to keep things in balance. Miriam and I chose not to live behind the Government battlements in Whitehall, so we live in the same home we\u2019ve been in for some years. We try very hard to keep our family life normal and private \u2013 we keep our children away from the cameras. We don\u2019t pretend we\u2019re a model family \u2013 we are who we are. We try to make sure that Westminster doesn\u2019t take over our lives. I know I won\u2019t be in politics forever. What I will be is a father, a husband, a son, an uncle to all those I love in my family for good \u2013 just like anyone else. So, the longer I spend in this job, the more and more I cherish the human, direct and unstuffy way we Liberal Democrats do politics. Our zeal for knocking on doors, making ourselves available, speaking like human beings \u2013 we must never lose that. And, as much as I\u2019m always telling you all to embrace Government, I\u2019m forever looking for ways to try and get out of Whitehall myself. Taking answers on the radio; fielding questions in village halls; trying to help my constituents out when they come to see me in my Sheffield surgery; going out on regional tours; or, when I can\u2019t get away, answering your questions online. Doing things differently must always be part of our identity. I want us to stay in Government \u2013 but I also want us to show that it is possible to be a party of Government without behaving like an establishment party. There was this wonderful moment on the day of the last vote on Equal Marriage. Some of us put pink carnations in our button holes and Alistair Carmichael and I were invited to go outside to meet some of the campaigners. Little did we know that they had set up an impromptu wedding ceremony \u2013 cake and dancing \u2018n\u2019 all \u2013 outside the Palace of Westminster. And we found ourselves standing side by side \u2013 if not quite hand in hand \u2013 in front of the exuberant London Gay Men\u2019s Chorus, singing Abba\u2019s Dancing Queen for us at the top of their voices. Meanwhile, inside the House of Lords, dinosaur opponents of the Bill were having a final go at killing it \u2013 declaring that gay marriage would be the end of civilisation as we know it. And, awkward though I think Alistair and I must have appeared as we lamely clapped along to Abba, at that moment we were exactly where we belonged: on the outside, welcoming in reform. Liberal Democrats, three years ago I told you that we had an opportunity our predecessors would have given anything for. To govern. To turn our liberal principles into practice. Today I tell you that an even bigger opportunity awaits. The cycle of red, blue, blue, red has been interrupted. Our place in this Government has prevented the pendulum swinging back from left to right. We are now where we always should have been: in power; in the liberal centre; in tune with the British people. And every day we are showing that we can govern and govern well. That pluralism works. And if we can do this again \u2013 in Government again in 2015 \u2013 we are a step closer to breaking the two party mould for good. In the past, there were people who would only support us when the future of the country was not at stake. Now there are people who will support us precisely because the future of the country will be at stake. In the past the Liberal Democrats would eke out an existence on the margins of British politics. Now we hold the liberal centre while our opponents head left and right. I have spent my entire life watching the other two mess it up. We cannot stand idly by and let them do it all over again. We are the only party that can finish the job of economic recovery, but finish it fairly.The only party able to build a stronger economy and a fairer society too. Liberal Democrats take that message out to the country. Our mission is anchoring Britain to the centre ground. Our place is in Government again.

aVBefore I say anything else, I\u2019m sure I speak on behalf of all Liberal Democrats when I say that our hearts and condolences go out to the family and friends of Alan Henning and David Haines for their tragic loss. These were good men. In the work they did they stood for hope and compassion \u2013 the things that everyone in this room believes are more important than anything else. We have to take on the cowards who took their lives. We have to defeat their barbarity to help protect the millions of people who now live under the threat and fear of these merciless killers. Britain will not be intimidated. We will not be divided. We will not allow this brutal organisation to pervert Islam. And to Isil we say this: All you have done is unite the people of Britain \u2013 Muslim and non-Muslim, people of all faiths and none \u2013 around a single aim. All you have done is give the British forces who are being deployed to Iraq \u2013 some of the best professionals in the world \u2013 a clear, single objective. We and our allies \u2013 including in the Middle East \u2013 are going to find you, we are going to destroy your bases, we will cut off your supplies, isolate you from your support \u2013 and for the sake of peace, democracy and the freedom of all those you terrorise, we are not going to stop until it\u2019s done. And let\u2019s also take this opportunity to pay tribute to our armed forces \u2013 including the RAF personnel who are being deployed over Iraq, as well as the many men and women helping fight dangerous threats across the world. Our immense gratitude should go without saying \u2013 but it\u2019s important we say it too. Al Murray \u2013 he of Pub Landlord fame \u2013 said a great thing on Trafalgar Square in the days leading up to the Scottish referendum. I was there stood in the crowd with thousands of others and it really stuck in my mind. He said that there is something wonderfully vague about being British. After all, he said, that\u2019s why we call ourselves Brit \u2013 ish. And it\u2019s true. You can be British as well as Scottish, English, Northern Irish, Welsh\u2026ish. At the same time you can be black, white, Asian, Indian, African, European, mixed, not-mixed. You can be gay, straight, bi-sexual, transgender. Christian, Muslim, Jewish, Hindu, Sikh, atheist. The Scottish referendum was not only momentous because it reaffirmed Scotland\u2019s place in the UK \u2013 and for that I will be eternally grateful for the unbelievable efforts of Willie, Alistair, Danny, Jo, Mike, Charles, Ming, the whole Scottish team\u2026 The Scottish referendum was also brilliant because it forced us to hold up a mirror and think about who we are. Four nations, yes, but also 64 million people with identities which are distinct yet overlapping, because these Isles of ours are among the most diverse and inclusive in the world. And yet something very un-British is taking root in our politics. A growing movement of people who want to pull us apart. Salmond, Farage, the bitter tribalism of left and right \u2013 in their different ways they\u2019re all doing the same thing. A growing pick-a-side politics, in a world of us-versus-them. Worried about your job? Your business? Your children\u2019s future? Your way of life? No matter, just blame Europe/Brussels/foreigners/immigrants/the English/the South/professional politicians/Westminster/big business/anybody claiming benefits/even onshore wind farms\u2026 Life is so simple when you know who \u2013 or what \u2013 to blame. It\u2019s seductive and it\u2019s beguiling. That much may even be proved tomorrow, if the people of Clacton give the UK Independence Party an MP. But resentment, the politics of fear, doesn\u2019t pay the bills or create a single job. Claiming to address people\u2019s acute anxiety about the modern world, it provides nothing but the false comfort of grievance. Dressed up as the politics of hope, it is in fact a counsel of despair. Why do you think I took on Nigel Farage in the TV debates at the European elections? Because I thought it would be easy? \u2013 me defending Britain\u2019s membership of the EU, him bashing Brussels. No, I did it for the same reason this party must now come out fighting: Because someone has to stand up for the liberal Britain in which we and millions of decent, reasonable people believe. For tolerance, compassion, openness, unity \u2013 the values this party holds so dear. Labour won\u2019t defend those values. Even after four years in opposition Labour have nothing to say \u2013 or have forgotten to say anything of any value on the economy. The Tories won\u2019t either. We heard all we needed to know last week: compassionate conservatism is dead and buried. If the Liberal Democrat voice is marginalised in British politics our country will be meaner, poorer and weaker as a result. We must not and cannot let that happen. We must make our voice heard. That\u2019s not easy these days. Disenchantment and anger towards the political class is now at an all-time high and, for a lot of people, we\u2019re included in that. The British people no longer feel an automatic deference to their politicians \u2013 and that\u2019s a good thing. Authority everywhere is challenged. And \u2013 in what might be the least fashionable statement made by any party leader this conference season \u2013 politicians of every party have fed this growing cynicism by exaggerating and overstating what government\u2019s can do. We\u2019ve all done it. I\u2019ve been there. When I apologised for the disappointment and anger caused by our inability to scrap tuition fees, I knew we could never, ever make that mistake again. And we won\u2019t. We understand that political parties must show by doing: our promise of more must be built on a record of delivery, not just words. So if you meet someone who doesn\u2019t believe we\u2019ll raise the personal allowance to £12,500, tell them how we already raised it to £10,500. If they\u2019re not persuaded we can help young people with their travel costs to college, tell them we\u2019ve created more apprenticeships than any Government since the war. If they\u2019re cynical about our promises to help with young children, tell them we\u2019re the first party ever to start providing free support to two year olds across the country, tax free childcare and free school meals for infants. And all of it while fixing our broken public finances \u2013 so they can be sure we\u2019ll finish balancing the books fairly too. Danny set it all out on Sunday: Eliminating the deficit in the first three years of the next parliament, and then bringing debt down steadily and sustainably. Running a budget that is balanced overall and \u2013 this is crucial \u2013 doing it in a way that allows us to invest in Britain\u2019s creaking infrastructure too. The Liberal Democrats will borrow less than Labour, but we\u2019ll cut less than the Tories. We\u2019ll finish the job, but we\u2019ll finish it in a way that is fair. And just as we are refusing to saddle our children with mountains of debt, we are determined to hand them on a clean planet too. Both parties in this Government promised we would stick to our green commitments, but it has taken constant pressure from the Liberal Democrats \u2013 not least Ed Davey \u2013 to hold the Tories to their word. And I can tell you now that a sustainable environment will remain at the heart of our vision for Britain\u2019s future \u2013 it\u2019s not green crap to us. A plan that is credible. A party which has learnt from our mistakes. A party proud to have delivered on the commitments we made on the front page of our last manifesto \u2013 remember this? \u2013 and a whole lot more. The biggest change in income tax in a generation \u2013 designed and delivered by Lib Dems. The biggest overhaul of our pensions system \u2013 designed and delivered by Lib Dems. The biggest amount of money going into early years education every year, more than any previous government \u2013 designed and delivered by Lib Dems. The biggest shake-up of parental leave, revolutionising the rules for mothers who want to work and fathers who want to stay at home \u2013 designed and delivered by Lib Dems. The biggest ever commitment to renewable energy \u2013 designed and delivered by Lib Dems. And one of the biggest, proudest achievements for all of us: giving gay couples the same right to marry as everyone else \u2013 designed and delivered by Lib Dems. That is an extraordinary record from anyone, let alone a party that had never been in government before, let alone at a time of upheaval and strife. So when you meet people who still aren\u2019t sure about us, ask them this: How will you judge us? By the one policy we couldn\u2019t deliver in government, or by the countless policies we did deliver in Government? Fixing Britain\u2019s shattered economy, making sure the recovery spreads to every part of the UK, cutting taxes for millions for people, investing in young children and protecting Britain\u2019s schools\u2026Judge us on that record. By the four years we worked tirelessly to make sure public services are safeguarded for future generations\u2026 The environment \u2013 safeguarded for future generations too\u2026Privacy, protected\u2026Civil liberties, defended\u2026Older people, treated with dignity. And all children \u2013 from before they even start at school \u2013 given a chance, so that they can all live out their dreams and all live their lives in full. Judge us on that record. And, while this party has learnt from our mistakes, can the same be said of our opponents? Ed Miliband is now promising a new Nirvana where everyone will be well-off, no one will be out of pocket, we don\u2019t need to cut government spending and the public finances will be miraculously fixed. Sounds great. How does he intend to deliver this? Well, he promised a rise in the minimum wage by 2020 \u2013 which was already going to happen. A one year limit on the increase in child benefit \u2013 which is already in place. And a cut in Ministerial pay \u2013 which this Government introduced in our first week in office. This is a man who was part of the government which wasted their chance and ruined the economy, destroying jobs and slashing incomes \u2013 and yet not a single word on the deficit. A man who was part of the government which obliterated trust in our immigration system \u2013 and yet not a word on how you rebuild it. So much for a radical plan from the official Opposition. David Cameron and George Osborne, meanwhile, say don\u2019t worry: immigration can be slashed, human rights redrawn, taxes lowered, the NHS protected, and we can have all the benefits of being in Europe while opting out of the bits we don\u2019t like. Every worry can be fixed with a big wave of the Union Jack. How do they intend to deliver that? Well, they\u2019ve quietly ditched their commitment to reduce net migration to tens of thousands. Conservative Ministers have dragged their feet in implementing Lib Dem border controls. They want to scrap the universal human rights Brits have enjoyed since the days of Winston Churchill. And they\u2019re prepared to jeopardise Britain\u2019s membership of the EU \u2013 and our prosperity with it \u2013 in order to appease their backbenchers. So much for a credible plan from the Conservative Party. And most astonishingly of all, they have chosen to single out the working-age poor to bear the brunt of the final years of deficit reduction, while refusing to ask the super-rich to make a single additional contribution\u2026 That\u2019s the people scraping by on the minimum wage. The jobseekers who\u2019ve found themselves temporarily down on their luck. The men and women trying to earn their way out of poverty, often working more than one job. \u2026And given the Conservatives are not planning a single tax increase, how will they pay for all their spending commitments? They will have no choice but to cut the services they have not protected like social care, policing, education \u2013 education \u2013 to the bone. No wonder they\u2019ve stopped claiming that we\u2019re all in it together. Say what you will about the Liberal Democrats\u2026We may no longer be untainted, as we were by the freedom of opposition\u2026 I may no longer be the fresh faced outsider\u2026But we still stand for a different kind of politics. Treating people like adults. Not shirking the difficult dilemmas this country faces, but confronting them head on. Not pretending there\u2019s a magic wand answer to every problem when there isn\u2019t. Not doing things just because they\u2019re popular. Not being afraid to court controversy when we have to stand up for something we believe. Trying, every day, to do what lies at the heart of politics at its best \u2013 decent people, driven by decent values, resolving problems which can only be resolved together for the good of all. So our mission now is to give people a reason to reject bitter, us-and-them politics, to shun the politics of blame and fear, and choose something better. To do that, we have to provide the one thing that so many people across Britain still lack and crave: Opportunity. Government can\u2019t do everything for you. It can\u2019t make life perfect \u2013 and no one should pretend it can. But government can strive to level the playing field so that you and your family can look to your future and see the chance to get on. No matter who you are. Opportunity for Everyone. If you can see that you have a fair chance to get on in life, you don\u2019t need to look for someone to blame. If you give people a sense of fair play\u2026The power to shape their own lives and that of their communities\u2026The chance to fulfil their talents, pursue their aspirations, regardless of the circumstances of their birth\u2026 The anger, the powerlessness will wane and the hope of a better future can take root. After the London riots three years ago, I commissioned some research into why some people had rioted and others had not. I\u2019ll never forget hearing about the young men and women who told the researchers: of course I didn\u2019t riot. They wanted to apply for apprenticeships. They\u2019d seen jobs they wanted and didn\u2019t want to ruin their chances. Give people a future and they won\u2019t trash the present. Give people hope and they turn their backs on fear. And yet Britain is still a place where opportunity is handed down like an heirloom, not spread around like a universal right. Educational achievement, professional advancement, wealth, life expectancy \u2013 all our measures of success are still umbilically tied to an individual\u2019s background rather than the talents they possess. So the question is: which political party can do something about it? Look, I\u2019m sure Ed Miliband and David Cameron would say that their parties are parties of opportunity \u2013 no one\u2019s against opportunity. But the point is: they can\u2019t deliver it for everybody. There is no opportunity without a stronger economy \u2013 to give people good jobs, business opportunities, the money to follow their dreams. That\u2019s why Labour is not the answer. And without a fairer society you can\u2019t create opportunity for everyone, instead of just those lucky few at the top. That\u2019s why the Conservatives are not the answer. Fairness without a strong economy does not work. A strong economy without fairness doesn\u2019t work either. And \u2013 as the last few weeks have now put beyond doubt \u2013 there\u2019s only one party with the head and the heart \u2013 the resolve and the compassion \u2013 to deliver both. To deliver opportunity for everyone \u2013 and it\u2019s us. It starts with giving people power over their lives. Powerlessness is the enemy of opportunity. It\u2019s why we care as passionately about civil liberties as we do about good schools. It\u2019s why blocking the so-called snooper\u2019s charter was as important as delivering a massive increase in free childcare. Because a Big Brother state which demands the storage of the websites you visit is as threatening to real freedom and opportunity as a state which fails to help toddlers get the support and care they need. And while we\u2019re on the subject\u2026 I say this to Theresa May: stop playing party politics with national security. Stop playing on people\u2019s fears simply to try and get your own way. Your Communications Data Bill was disproportionate, disempowering \u2013 we blocked it once and we\u2019d do it again. There are times when the state needs to keep its nose out of our lives, to give us the freedom to make the most of our lives. There are times when the state needs to extend a helping hand so that everyone can make the most of their lives. That is a smart, liberal, enabling state. And at its heart are powerful citizens. But, if there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learnt over the last four and a half years, it\u2019s that the hardest thing about being in power\u2026 Is getting vested interests to give up their hold on power. Just look at where we\u2019ve been thwarted. Giving people a democratic say over their lawmakers in the House of Lords \u2013 blocked by Labour and the Conservatives. A clean up of party funding to restrain the influence of big money \u2013 blocked by Labour and the Conservatives. The Conservatives have even told us in the most explicit terms: you can\u2019t have your Mansion tax because our donors won\u2019t wear it. So proud are they of this act of brazen self-interest they even wrote to wealthy homeowners boasting about it \u2013 in the hope of courting more cash. Within hours of the historic Scotland vote, when we were meant to be cracking on with the plan for further devolution \u2013 a plan that this party will not see hijacked, or diluted, or delayed\u2026 They were at it again. The Tories trying to impose an entirely self-serving system of Tory votes for English laws on the House of Commons, in order to give more say to their MPs. Labour ignoring the problem altogether in order to give more say to their MPs. Well they can both forget it: whatever reforms we do will be fair and right by the British people, and that will be guaranteed by our MPs. And they still simply cannot grasp that spreading opportunity means putting people in control \u2013 in Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales, and in communities up and down England too. We\u2019ve done a lot to release Whitehall\u2019s grip: by the time the election is called next year every single part of the UK \u2013 every nation, every City, our towns and villages \u2013 will all have more power than the day the Coalition was formed \u2013 just as we said. But I want us to go so much further, supporting strong, prosperous, empowered communities \u2013 able to shape their own futures. And to anyone who thinks that in the next parliament we should cut our losses and give up on our ambitions for real, meaningful political reform: no way. This country deserves better than the tawdry Westminster politics we get from Labour and the Tories \u2013 and I am going to keep hammering away at the system every single day, because bit by bit that system will break to let the people in. And if power is still hoarded at the centre, the ability for people to liberate themselves from the circumstances of their birth is still denied to too many people. I have fought tirelessly to instil opportunity in the earliest years of a child\u2019s life. Did you know Michael Gove raided the budget for much needed school places in order to fund his Free School obsession? Did you see the frenzied bile from the Tory Right against our plan to give young children at primary school a healthy meal at lunchtime? Have you ever heard the dated snobbery from some Conservatives against the value of vocational qualifications and good quality careers advice? Of all the faultlines which have opened up in this Coalition Government, the one that has been most revealing is the way in which self-proclaimed Conservative educational reformers sought to suffocate almost every single initiative designed to instil opportunity at an early age \u2013 for all children, not just some. A world class education system is one that releases the potential in all children, not just some. My mother worked as a teacher for children with dyslexia when myself, my brothers and sister were growing up. Those days it wasn\u2019t as readily recognised that very bright children can be hampered by learning difficulties which may obscure their talents, but don\u2019t make them any less bright. Those days countless children were discarded by the education system because children were not treated as individuals, they were expected to conform to the rigours of the classroom or be left behind. And my mother drummed into us what seems so obvious today. That you don\u2019t write anyone off. You don\u2019t overlook anyone\u2019s talents. Given half a chance, everyone can shine. For me, that is what our new commitment to expanding childcare to all two, three and four year olds is all about. That is what our new commitment to healthy lunches for all primary school children is all about. That is what our new commitment to helping with the travel costs faced by all college students is all about. That is what our new commitment to a qualified teacher in every classroom is all about. That is what protecting funding from cradle to college \u2013 even as we clear the deficit \u2013 is all about. Education. Opportunity. That is what the Liberal Democrats are all about. Almost exactly thirteen years ago Phil Willis and myself visited a number of schools in Denmark, Holland and Sweden. The idea of the Pupil Premium was born. Today it funds breakfast clubs; homework clubs; it helps involve parents who are otherwise disengaged. It gives teachers the time to focus on children, one on one. And the many wonderful, wonderful teachers I meet across the country, working in the noblest profession of all, tell me the ability to do that is priceless in unlocking the talents of every child. The thrill I get every time I hear from a teacher about how great they think the Pupil Premium is never diminishes \u2013 and it reminds me that in politics being clear about what you want and then doggedly, stubbornly working away until you make it happen is what really counts. We are the party of education and we always will be \u2013 because it is the driver of opportunity. Because if you want to spread opportunity you can\u2019t just stop at today. You have to think about tomorrow too. And for that same reason, our next manifesto will contain something I can guarantee you none of the others will: A commitment to five green laws. Laws that will commit British governments to reducing carbon from our electricity sector\u2026Create new, legal targets for clean air and water\u2026Give everyone access to green space\u2026 Massively boost energy efficiency and renewable energy\u2026 Prioritise the shift to green cars\u2026Bring an end to dirty coal\u2026 Because Liberal Democrats understand that opportunity for everyone means thinking not just of this generation, but of future generations too. There are two other big commitments I want to single out today. For me, they epitomise the way in which we are striving to spread opportunity wherever we can. And \u2013 while I\u2019m not going to get dragged into endless speculation about this or that red line in the event of another hung parliament \u2013 people do have a right to know what our priorities are. Forget talk of deals, let\u2019s just dwell on our values. This isn\u2019t about tactics in a negotiation, this is about what our values are and where we want to take the country. So the next priority I want to highlight is tax: raising the point at which you start paying income tax to £12,500. I know that some people think I bang on too much about our success in raising the personal allowance from where we found it \u2013 just under £6,500 \u2013 to £10,500. But I don\u2019t think we bang on about it enough. It is, in my view, quite remarkable that a party experiencing it\u2019s first stint in government, which only has 9% of the MPs in Westminster, should have succeeded in driving through the biggest and fairest transformation of our income tax system in a generation. If that isn\u2019t something to bang on about \u2013 loud and proud \u2013 I really don\u2019t know what is. Over 3 million people on low pay taken out of paying any tax at all. An £800 tax cut for over 24 million people. And with our new policy of an even higher allowance, nearly a million more people will pay no income tax, and 30 million people will be an additional £400 better off. Labour would never have made this change because it\u2019s all about liberating people through their own hard work rather than making them more dependent on an overweening state. The Conservatives couldn\u2019t have been more explicit that it wasn\u2019t their priority during our Budget negotiations where, year after year, it was frequently referred to as \u2018your tax cut, Nick\u2019. Apparently it\u2019s our tax cut in private, but it\u2019s their tax cut in public. In 2012 \u2013 I\u2019ll never forget this \u2013 Danny and I said: let\u2019s go further and faster to cut people\u2019s income tax. It\u2019s possible now, so why wait? George Osborne turned to me and said: I don\u2019t want to deliver a Liberal Democrat Budget. He insisted instead on the Tory bit of the Budget: a cut to the top rate of tax. I can\u2019t think of a better, simpler illustration of what sets the two coalition parties apart: Tories insisting on tax cuts for the few; Lib Dems insisting on tax cuts for the many. And, when they say now that they\u2019ve signed up to our plan to raise the personal allowance to 12.5k\u2026 just scratch beneath the surface. They\u2019re giving a tax cut worth four times as much to the highest earners. And who pays for their income tax cut? You do. It\u2019s no secret. The Conservatives told you last week what they want to do: Everything they promise will be paid for by cutting the support to the working age poor and cutting further and faster the money which goes to our schools, our police, our social care homes and other unprotected services. We, by contrast, have set out how we\u2019ll fairly fund the first step of raising the personal allowance to £11,000 in the first year of the next parliament. So the choice is clear: unfunded, unfair Tory tax cuts or Lib Dem tax cuts which are funded and fair. The difference is that they want to cut taxes for the wealthiest, paid for by the working age poor\u2026 We want to cut taxes for working people, paid for by the wealthiest. And then there\u2019s one more policy. One I care about passionately. Mental health. The second class status given to mental health in the NHS was the subject of the first question I ever asked at Prime Ministers Questions. I have campaigned to end the Cinderella treatment of mental health services ever since \u2013 because it threatens the opportunities available to hundreds and thousands of our fellow citizens. Anxiety, panic attacks, depression, anorexia, bulimia, self-harm, bi-polar disorder \u2013 these and many other mental health conditions are one of the last remaining taboos in our society, and yet they will affect one in four people. Much progress has been made \u2013 people now speak out in the way they never did before\u2026We have put mental health on the same legal footing in the NHS as physical health\u2026 We\u2019re massively expanding talking therapies and transforming the help children can get as they move into adulthood \u2013 but there\u2019s still a long, long way to go. I want this to be a country where a young dad chatting at the school gates will feel as comfortable discussing anxiety or depression as the mum who\u2019s explaining how she sprained her ankle. There are many brave campaigners who have been leading the way \u2013 not least our very own Paul Burstow and Norman Lamb who deserve medals for all the tireless work they have done in Government. Earlier this year I visited a group of young mental health service users to talk about their experiences of the care they received. They sat round in a circle, away from the television cameras, these brave, articulate young men and women, and with astonishing honesty and candour they told me \u2013 a complete stranger \u2013 all about the things they had been through. The despair, the shame, the bullying, the parents and siblings who didn\u2019t know how to cope with them. And for some of them, the very darkest thoughts imaginable, including attempts to take their own lives. And I heard about their recoveries too; their resolve; with the right treatment their determination \u2013 some of them just teenagers \u2013 to deal with their issues and live full and happy lives. If they can speak out to me\u2026 I can speak up for them. This morning I announced that next year, for the first time ever, we will introduce national waiting times for patients with mental health conditions. Labour introduced waiting times in physical health \u2013 we will do the same for the many people struggling with conditions that you often can\u2019t see, that we often don\u2019t talk about, but which are just as serious. So if you are waiting for talking therapies to help with your depression, you will be seen within six weeks \u2013 18 weeks at an absolute maximum \u2013 just as if you are waiting for an operation on your hip. If you are a young person experiencing psychosis for the first time, you will be seen within 2 weeks, something we are going to roll out across the country \u2013 just as if you suspect you have cancer. If you are having a breakdown, if you are thinking of harming yourself, for any emergency which takes you to A&E, you\u2019ll get the help you need \u2013 just as if you had gone to hospital with chest pains or following an accident. These are big, big changes. And in Government again the Liberal Democrats will commit to completing this overhaul of our mental health services \u2013 ending the discrimination against mental health for good. And while I know not everyone in the party is going to agree, I can tell you now: I want this smack bang on the front page of our next manifesto. One of a small number of top priorities. This is a great liberal cause. Let\u2019s be the first political party to give mental health the status it deserves. For the countless people who are suffering alone; who are failing to get the treatment they need on time and in the right way; who are being denied the chance to get on in their lives. For the families who are being strained to breaking point. For a Britain that is compassionate, open and leads the way. And to make sure this and all other care is properly funded, this week we have set out how we\u2019ll pay for the rising costs of our treasured NHS. Everyone now accepts it needs more money. And it\u2019s a good thing that all of the parties have chosen to talk about this at their Conferences. But it\u2019s still the case that only one party has spelt out a credible plan to pay for it. Not only will the Liberal Democrats protect the NHS Budget in real terms, we will raise an extra £1bn for it every year, by ending three different tax breaks which benefit the highest earners, including scrapping George Osborne\u2019s ludicrous shares for rights gimmick. And, once we have finished the job on the deficit and public spending is rising, we are committing ourselves to ensuring NHS spending rises too. Words in speeches are all well and good \u2013 we all love our NHS. But what it needs is money \u2013 and that\u2019s what the Liberal Democrats will guarantee. Friends, between now and the election our opponents will do everything they can to do us down \u2013 and we\u2019ll give as good as we get. All that\u2019s ok in the rough and tumble of politics. But what isn\u2019t ok is our motives being caricatured. Not me, not you, not our party, not our reasons for wanting to govern again. And we mustn\u2019t allow coalition to be caricatured either. This government has provided the country with the political stability without which the economic recovery and hundreds of thousands of new jobs would never have materialised. I often hear the Conservatives claim that the economic recovery is \u201cGeorge Osborne\u2019s recovery\u201d. \u2026Pretty rich coming from a Treasury where the person responsible for the really tough job of repairing the damage to our public finances is a Liberal Democrat\u2026And people know the truth: After the 2010 election, the Conservatives could not have formed a government and secured this economic recovery without the Liberal Democrats\u2026 and the Liberal Democrats could not have secured this economic recovery without the Conservatives. It\u2019s called Coalition \u2013 and in my judgement it is most likely Britain will have more in the future. That doesn\u2019t mean when there are real disagreements and disputes with our coalition partners we shouldn\u2019t talk about them. On the contrary \u2013 don\u2019t hold back. But that isn\u2019t the same as seeking to wash our hands of the whole thing \u2013 and that is something I will never do. Because I don\u2019t believe the British public would buy it for a second. They know we\u2019ve been in Government for this Parliament and we\u2019re not suddenly going to pretend that it had nothing to do with us. Because I\u2019m immensely proud of what we\u2019ve achieved and I don\u2019t want the Tories claiming all the credit for everything we\u2019ve done. And because I never lose sight of the fact that simply forming a successful coalition unlocks the grip on power of the old, establishment parties. It undermines the soulless pendulum swing of red/blue blue/red politics, and destroys once and for all their desperate claims that single party Government is the only kind of Government fit for our country. As someone who has grown more, not less, impatient with the establishment during my time in office, I have realised that what the vested interests would relish most is to eject us from office before our time is up. What disrupts those same vested interests most is seeing this Government through. So, however tempting it might be, we should never play our opponents game. I will not, no matter how much anyone goads me to do it, seek to distance us from the achievements of this Government, because it would only play into the hands of those who say we should never have been in Government at all. I believe \u2013 despite the febrile, angry mood of our times \u2013 there are millions of our fellow citizens who still long for a politics of reason, of fairness and of decency. In seven months the people of this country will need to make a choice. You can pick a Labour party which has learnt no lessons from the past and which \u2013 left to its own devices \u2013 will jeopardise the economy all over again. You can pick a Conservative party which doesn\u2019t share your values and which \u2013 left to its own devices \u2013 will make poor people poorer while it keeps cutting away at the services everybody needs. Ed Miliband \u2013 you might have forgotten what you did to our economy, but we have not. And the British people don\u2019t want a Labour government running their country, racking up debts for our children and grandchildren to pay. David Cameron \u2013 you can copy our ideas but you will never imitate our values. And the British people don\u2019t want a Conservative Government running their country which only looks after its own kind. It is left to our party, to us, to work our hearts out each and every day to give the people of Britain a stronger economy and a fairer society. We will do everything we can to ensure you and your family have the opportunities to get on. In that Britain we can defeat the politics of blame and grievance and fear. And we have seven short months to tell people, to show people: there is still a party that speaks to the decent, British values they hold. So let our opponents say what they will, after all the knocks, setbacks and bruises we will go to the country with our heads held high. Say what they will, we will go to the country with a plan that builds on everything we have achieved with a credible promise of more. Say what they we will, we are now the only party holding firm to decent, liberal values while anger and blame are on the rise. The only party refusing to trade in fear because we believe what the British people want desperately from their politics is hope. The only party who are as economically competent as we are socially fair \u2013 a party of the head and the heart, of compassion and resolve. The only party who says no matter who you are, no matter where you are from, we will do everything in our power to help you shine.

aVWhen I was growing up my school didn\u2019t have a sixth form.  I guess that\u2019s because most of us didn\u2019t do A levels.  So I went to a separate sixth form college - Runshaw in Leyland - and, in my first week, I joined the Liberal Party. I also joined a band. I\u2019m assuming you may have seen the photos. The only good thing I can say is that because the photos are pre-digital they are so low resolution that you can\u2019t make out the eye-liner. But I\u2019ve got a worse confession\u2026On a Saturday night, I watch X factor\u2026with the kids.  It\u2019s a terrible programme, but strangely compelling. It is a desperately guilty pleasure - I have to cleanse myself by listening to Radio 6 for 2 solid hours afterwards. Anyhow, my mates from the band are still my mates. Our keyboard player rang me up a couple of weeks ago \u2013 he said, \u2018Tim \u2013 we should re-form, enter X factor next year\u2019. I said, one: we\u2019re 45, two: I\u2019m a bit busy, 3: we\u2019re still rubbish. So you will be pleased to learn that my relationship with X factor will remain as being merely a viewer\u2026 just for the kids of course. ****** Time with our children is pretty much my top priority.  Even in the most extreme of circumstances \u2013 like May 8th. Rosie and I got home from the count in Kendal that morning \u2013 just in time to get the kids up, have breakfast with them and get them to school. The kids were in good form.  They were pleased to see us. We\u2019d held Westmorland, Daddy still had a job, but to be honest, it didn\u2019t feel much like victory, not when dozens of friends had lost their seats. The result was utterly devastating.  Politically.  Personally. People who had served their communities as only Liberal Democrat MPs ever do or ever will, swept out on a wave of fear and grievance. ***** But all of that pales in comparison to the much greater tragedy just a few weeks later.  The loss of Charles Kennedy.  Charles\u2019s death has robbed us of the sharpest mind, the wittiest tongue and the nicest bloke. The 23 year old who came from 4th place to gain Ross Cromarty and Skye, that same Charles Kennedy who inspired so many who had doubts to support the merger of Social Democrats and Liberals. Charles, who led us to our largest number of MPs in living memory Charles, who took on every corner of the establishment and led the campaign against the illegal Iraq War. Charles, we are so proud of you, and we will rebuild and we will fight back and we will do it in your honour. ***** Charles\u2019 death may have provided a sense of perspective but back on the morning of 8th May, I didn\u2019t feel much of that. I expected the result to be bad\u2026 just not that bad. And then Nick made that speech. I can honestly say that no political speech has ever moved or motivated me more than Nick\u2019s words that bleak morning. I quoted it on the day I won the leadership election and I make no apology for quoting it again this afternoon. Nick told us: This is a very dark hour for our party but we cannot and will not allow decent liberal values to be extinguished over night. Fear and grievance have won, liberalism has lost.  But it is more precious than ever and we must keep fighting for it. Well the hairs on the back of my neck stood on end.  And it turns out that I wasn\u2019t the only one. Up and down the country 20,000 people chose to stand up and say \u201cNo. Liberalism will not die.  Not on our watch.\u201d They chose not to be powerless dismayed spectators and instead to become active, engaged players. So they joined the Liberal Democrats . I am told 500 of the new members that have joined since the election are here today. We thank you and applaud you. ***** The leadership campaign that followed Nick\u2019s resignation buzzed with the energy created by those new members. I\u2019m sure it was the same for Norman, because I felt fuelled by it. It was tough being in a contest with your friend. Norman, I am inspired by your passion about what we\u2019d achieved in government, and your determination to return us to power so that we can make a difference again. You give politics a good name, and you make me proud to be a Liberal Democrat. Norman and I must have travelled thousands of miles, the length and breadth of Britain, from Aberdeen to St Austell; Cardiff to Colchester, talking to thousands and thousands of members and supporters. And time and again, I heard the same message: We are liberals. We are proud of the Liberal Democrats. We are proud of what we did in Government.  Proud of our record and proud of our party. You know, there are those that would like me to take this opportunity to distance myself from the past five years, to say it was all some dreadful mistake, to say: \u201cI disagree with Nick.\u201d But I don\u2019t\u2026 so I won\u2019t. I came into politics to change things, to make a difference, to make people\u2019s lives better. And to do that, you need the power to bring about change. There is nothing grubby or unprincipled about wanting to win. Nothing noble about defeat \u2013 losing sucks, losing robs you of your chance to make people\u2019s lives better. What\u2019s the point in being right if you never get to put your policies into action? So I am proud of what we did in government and I am determined that we will return to government. Did we make mistakes in Government? Of course, but show me a government that didn\u2019t. When we come to measure our time in Government the scales are heavily weighed in our favour:\u2022Millions of the poorest workers lifted out of paying income tax\u2022Children no longer locked up in immigration detention centres\u2022Thousands of schools better able to support children from the poorest backgrounds\u2022Millions of pupils with a free school meal to help them through the day\u2022And same sex couples, finally getting the freedom to marry the person they love And still more important than any of these victories for ordinary people was our willingness to enter into coalition at all. A coalition that provided the economic stability that Britain so desperately needed -which today is the foundation of the fastest growing economy in the G7. We paid a heavy price for our time in government, but we did right by our country. We showed that we are serious about taking power, Serious about how we exercise power, and Serious about sharing power in the interests of the country and the people. So we will learn from the last 5 years, but we will not disown the last 5 years. Those 5 years where Liberal Democrats made a difference, made Britain more successful: 5 years where we learnt that power is tough\u2026 but worth it. ***** 5 tough years for us, but 5 tougher months for Britain since. Since May, the Government has threatened the human rights act, demonised refugees, penalised working families, abandoned green energy. You know, if ever you doubted the effectiveness of the Liberal Democrats in Government just look at what\u2019s happening without us In the words of Joni Mitchell \u201cDon\u2019t it always seem to go that you don\u2019t know what you\u2019ve got til its gone \u201c Except for one thing - we are not gone. We may not be able to change our country from the top down, just for now, but we can change it from the bottom up\u2026our party must do more than just survive, we must grow, we must thrive, we must rebuild. ***** That is why our mission is to put Liberal Democrats back in power at every level throughout Britain. And we will start with next year\u2019s elections for the Scottish Parliament, for the National Assembly in Wales, for the London Assembly, and for local government across the country. If others wish to abandon serious politics, serious economics, that\u2019s their lookout. But you can be certain that the Liberal Democrats will occupy every inch of that progressive liberal space because you cannot change people\u2019s lives from the glory of self-indulgent opposition. Instead, I want us to be serious about power. We didn\u2019t lose the election because our policies weren\u2019t good enough\u2026. or because our manifesto wasn\u2019t long enough. We lost because people didn\u2019t know who we were, what our values were. So it\u2019s time to tell people who we are.  Let\u2019s be liberals. ***** So why am I a Liberal? My sister and I were brought up in Preston, in a terrace house on a main road in the shadow of the gasworks. Very young parents, then divorced parents, lovely people, both worked hard, neither of them with much money. We lived with my Mum. She was out of work at times, so were most of my mates\u2019 parents.  Looking back, I guess we might have been on or below the breadline from time to time. But that\u2019s the mark of great parents.  We didn\u2019t realise we had it hard until much much later.  Thinking back, I owe both my Mum and my Dad a vast debt. So I don\u2019t want you to feel any pity for me. I certainly didn\u2019t feel poor or disadvantaged \u2013 I had a great childhood. Mostly I saw how hard my parents had to work.  My Dad was full-time in the building trade, and he made ends meet by DJing on Friday and Saturday night. I have inherited all of his passion for music\u2026 and none of his talent. But I learnt that for most people, success only comes from taking responsibility and making your own luck. My Mum worked part-time on the checkout at a department store. She couldn\u2019t get more hours, so she took a risk, did a clerical qualification that took a year and then became a secretary at the local newspaper. After a few years, things were still tight, so Mum took another massive risk.  She went to university, aged 33, not easy with 2 kids. She eventually became a university lecturer, and I\u2019ve never been more proud as the day, a few years later, when I was with her as she got her PhD. She died far too young, but she worked her socks off and she achieved a vast amount against the odds.  With opportunity she was able to succeed and make a better life for herself and us. That\u2019s our liberal challenge, that\u2019s our inspiration: providing people the chance to be the best they can be through opportunity and hard graft. So, there was great poverty in parts of our community. But there was no such thing as the idle poor. All around me where I grew up in Lancashire I saw people who worked dead hard just like my parents - if they had work. And otherwise they worked dead hard just to get work. It was a discipline that was reinforced in us by good schools and great teachers, helping us achieve well beyond what was expected. And I came to understand that individuals had to take responsibility for their own lives. And I came to understand that our job - the Liberal Democrat\u2019s job - is to give those who are able to take responsibility for their own lives, the chance to succeed. But also I realised that inequality means that millions of people don\u2019t have the chance to take that responsibility because they aren\u2019t born to the right parents, in the right town or sent to the right school.  That is utterly wrong. It demeans us collectively Damages us economically and Disadvantages us all\u2026 It is a waste of talent and a wasted opportunity. People deserve better. ***** Many of you have heard me say this before, but its true, so I\u2019m saying it again. When I was 14 I saw a repeat of a film called 'Cathy Come Home'. The film was 18 years old when I watched it first, but it still felt raw. It\u2019s not a feel-good movie, it doesn\u2019t have any CGI, but I can vouch for its special effects. It\u2019s a film about a young woman whose life gets gradually and brutally torn apart for lack of stable housing. Eviction follows eviction until the council eventually take away her kids. All because they couldn\u2019t find a decent home at a rent they could afford. Now that was 50 years ago but not nearly enough has changed. Cathy come home lit a spark in me \u2013 it made me angry, it energised me, it made me want to get up and get involved. And so I did, and I haven\u2019t stopped. I meet Cathys in my surgery most weeks - people in housing need, desperate for a home, desperate to be settled, desperate for dignity. Maybe some in politics can look at this desperation and shrug it off, or ignore it, rationalise it, or tolerate it.  Well I can\u2019t. Maybe this doesn\u2019t feel like anything to do with you. Maybe your housing situation is comfortable. But the chances are that your children\u2019s isn\u2019t, and I bet your grandchildren\u2019s won\u2019t be. Access to affordable housing affects us all because it is the entry ticket to society: to security and stability, to work, health and community. Because without secure, affordable and stable housing how can you be sure that you can send your kids to the same school one term after the next? How can you be confident you can keep your children safe and warm? How can you apply for and hold down a job to feed and clothe them? And, without this confidence, how can you have the peace of mind to concentrate on anything else in life? The worry and the burden of not knowing if you can pay the mortgage, pay the rent, stay in the same place for more than 6 months at a time, is devastating to millions of people. People often talk about moving house being one of the most stressful experiences in life. But for millions of British people, without a stable or affordable home, that stress, that instability, that uncertainty is a debilitating reality, every single day. And I will not accept it. We will not tolerate it, so together we will fix it. Housing is the biggest single issue that politicians don\u2019t talk about.  Well, we are going to talk about it, campaign on it, go on and on and on about it, and make a difference to the millions who have been ignored. ***** We have had enough empty rhetoric on housing. We need action now. Liberal Democrats have a target of building 300,000 homes a year - a massive challenge, but we must be prepared to meet it. And this means bold choices. We will give councils the freedom and power to borrow so they can start building again. We will create 10 new garden cities with the infrastructure they need to thrive. We will create a housing investment bank to bring in much more cash and give the industry the support and security it needs. And we will lead the opposition to the forced sell-off of housing association properties. Communities up and down this country have spent 25 years building housing association homes, picking up the pieces of Mrs Thatcher\u2019s destruction of council housing, and we will not allow David Cameron to destroy that work too\u2026 ***** So like I said, I went to College and then on to University in Newcastle where I wrote a lot of sure-fire electropop masterpieces, and one or two essays. And on leaving university, I got a job in, well, a university \u2013 Lancaster University. I became a grassroots activist, then, in the way of these things, a councillor, and in 1998, the Liberal Democrat candidate for Westmorland and Lonsdale - a seat we hadn\u2019t won since 1906. So that was promising. Every community is special, there is beauty in every part of this country \u2013 but Westmorland is something else. I might be biased, but it\u2019s a blessed place to live, to raise a family, to run up the fells.  To feel miniscule against the open skies, the vast lakes, the towering mountains. And who needs focus groups when you can stand in Kendal market and find out exactly what people think\u2026 even if you don\u2019t ask them. The exploitation of dairy farmers by the supermarkets, brought to life by the young farmer who tells me of her 365 day a year job where she must sell milk for 5 pence a litre less than it costs her farm to produce it. The family terrified because their daughter\u2019s mental health condition is worsening while an appointment with a professional is still weeks away. The 75 year old couple who\u2019ve decided together to stop his cancer treatment because they can\u2019t bear the 100 mile round trip, day after day, week after week to get to the nearest radiotherapy centre. All too often the people of Westminster live in their own little Westminster echo chamber. They\u2019re not bad people, but they see the world only through Westminster eyes. My approach \u2013 our approach - has always been, and will always be, different. It is to be immersed in our communities, to be part of them, so that we can speak for them. To fight with all our energy, to never go native, never be part of the furniture, never lose touch with reality. It is often said that the other parties have vested interests, but that we have none. Not true.  We have vested interests too. They are the people in our streets, our towns, our villages.  The people in Britain who have no one to speak for them. Our job is to speak up for those people.  To defend their homes and their hospitals, their schools and their post offices, and to be their voice. ***** Some of the poorest people I know run their own businesses. They employ half a dozen people, whose families they know by name and to whom they are massively loyal, so loyal that in hard times they will keep those workers on and pay themselves nothing. Liberals must be on the side of business \u2013 ambitious for business \u2013 tearing down the barriers that stop businesses from fulfilling their ambitions. It is unambitious for the government to power down the northern power house by stalling promises to electrify the transpennines route. Instead, we say \u2013 invest in the best rail links in Europe. It is unambitious to pull up the drawbridge and cut ourselves off from the world\u2019s biggest market. Instead, we say - commit our future to being at the heart of Europe, embracing skills, talent and trade. It is unambitious for modern Britain when it takes less time to walk to the post box than it does to upload a document via a steam powered internet connection. Instead, we say -  universal, superfast broadband is an essential investment for business and for all our communities no matter where they are in the UK. So when I say we want an ambitious, active government, prepared to invest in skills, homes and infrastructure, to free individuals to be the very best they can be, it is because I am a liberal, and to be a liberal is to support those with enterprise. And at a time of historic low interest rates, now is the time to lay foundations for future prosperity; making long term capital investments that generate growth, and that our economy and businesses need - in rail, in housing and in broadband. Business needs stable economic conditions to thrive and grow.  A strong, fair, liberal and sustainable economy is the essential core that enables people to succeed, shape their own futures and get support in times of need. The Liberal Democrats are proud of our economic record in Government and we will build on what we have achieved so far to develop a strong and clear liberal vision for the British economy into the future. That\u2019s why we remain committed to the abolition of the structural deficit. Our commitment to clearing the deficit by 2017/18 is right. Not ending the deficit now means leaving the next generation to clear up our mess, and that\u2019s simply unfair. By ignoring economic realities, Britain would be choosing more austerity, not less. But what is equally unfair is to place the burden of ending that deficit on the backs of the poorest and lowest paid \u2013 we must all play our part, based on our ability to pay. That, George, is what \u201cbeing all in it together\u201d really means. So that\u2019s the Liberal Democrat economic approach: Invest in infrastructure, innovation and innovators Pay off our debts and Share our burdens fairly. That\u2019s the common sense approach. Ambitious government, social justice, economic competence. ***** And we must build an economy for future generations \u2013 modern, high-skilled, innovative. The heart of that economy will be green industries: renewable energy, low-carbon transport, green finance \u2013 all areas in which Britain is already a world leader. There are more offshore wind turbines around our coasts than everywhere else in the rest of the world put together. These industries are making products and technologies which a decarbonised world will want to buy. They will bring jobs, exports and prosperity and at same time reduce emissions and tackle climate change. But what is the government doing? Dismantling at breathtaking speed every policy Liberal Democrat ministers put in place to support green industries. Driven by dogma and an obsession with short-term cuts, they are cutting off at the knees a sector which grew at more than 7 per cent a year from 2010 to 2013, compared with less than 2 per cent for the UK economy as a whole. When Al Gore, John Gummer and the boss of the CBI all warn you you\u2019re doing the wrong thing \u2013 which is what happened yesterday \u2013 that chance are, you\u2019re on the wrong track. This government needs to realise it\u2019s making the wrong move at the wrong time for the wrong reasons. Liberal Democrats will fight the government every inch of the way.  ***** But it was so much easier when we were able to promote green industries from within government. An ambition and ability to change things. That\u2019s why I became an MP. But you know, I have never felt so common as the day I entered the House of Commons. I have never met so many well-spoken, expensively educated people.  It doesn\u2019t make them bad people.  But it does make me feel like an outsider. But that\u2019s fine, because Liberal Democrats are outsiders. Even when we are on the inside, we are outsiders: taking the side of the outsider\u2026  are you with me? Right from our foundation, we have identified with the needs and interests of those that do not hold power, who are excluded from privilege, the underdogs, the dispossessed \u2013 the poor, the migrant, the refugee - who simply want the chance to prove themselves on a level playing field. Liberalism\u2019s roots are buried deep in anti-establishment politics, opposing privilege. We speak for the outsiders, for the governed not the governors.  The voiceless and the voteless. ***** As many of you know, during the summer, I went to Calais. I went because I wanted to see what was going on for myself and because my liberal instinct told me to be suspicious when the establishment started pointing the finger at outsiders. I wanted to gauge the scale of the problem, to see whether we were being told the truth, I wanted to see the people and not the label. So I met with people and heard their stories of harrowing risks, dangers fled and desperation for their children. I have to tell you, not a single one of them mentioned coming to Britain to draw benefits. Indeed, more than that.  Not a single one of them had ever heard of Britain\u2019s benefits system. They wanted to come to Britain to be safe, to work, to contribute. They see our country as a place of opportunity, a place where you can make the most of yourself, a place where you can be the best you can be \u2013 a liberal place. Because I tell you frankly: you don\u2019t risk everything clinging to the bottom of a truck if you\u2019re looking for an easy life. I met a 14 year-old boy who had broken both of his legs trying to board a lorry.  He was in a wheelchair pushed by a boy who was 11.  Both had lost their parents, both were alone. And I realised that the UK government was ignoring their humanity, it was just stuck in media management mode, following not leading. And the Government is still following the story.  It\u2019s just a rather different one. It\u2019s the body of a three year old boy face-down in the surf. And what we\u2019ve had from David Cameron is a careful calibration of what it will take to manage that story, the minimum effort for the maximum headlines. And a policy which will not directly help a single one of the hundreds of thousands currently on the move across Europe. It\u2019s pitiful and embarrassing and makes me so angry. Because I am proud to be British and I am proud of Britain\u2019s values, so when Mr Cameron turns his back on the needy and turns his back on our neighbours. I want the world to know, he does not speak for me, he does not speak for us, he does not speak for Britain. ***** You know after the Second World War, Britain offered homes to several thousand children who had survived the death camps but whose parents had been murdered in the Holocaust. Only 700 children came. That was all who were left alive to take up our offer. I know this story because 300 of them were sent to my patch to recuperate and became known as the Windermere boys. This act was not an aberration; this was instinctively consistent with British values. And so I find myself thinking about the Jewish refugees that our grandparents saved in the 1930s. And I think about the Ugandan Asians offered a safe haven by our parents from that murderous tyrant, Idi Amin. And it makes me realise the pride I feel in Britain when we do show such generosity of spirit. But not only that. I realise how much richer \u2013 culturally, socially, economically \u2013 our society is today, because of our generosity then. What a lesson in seeing the best in people and not the worst. What a lesson in liberalism. As the party of outsiders, we will stand up for the outsiders. And I will start today. Winter is coming and the risks and hardships faced by those seeking sanctuary will only increase. If you are shocked by the pictures on our TV screens today, just think how much worse they will look when the snows come to the Balkans. If we don\u2019t act now, many more will die. So I am calling on our Government to opt in now to the EU plan to take our share of the refugees to be relocated throughout the continent. And I call on them to work with our neighbours to establish safe and sustainable reception centres, not only to process claims but to provide the shelter and security which the refugees so desperately need. And I call on the Government to provide the necessary financial support that our local authorities will need to help settle refugees, so as not to set community against community. This is an international solution to an international crisis. This is the Britain Liberal Democrats want to live in. And if that\u2019s the Britain that makes you proud too, then join us, We need you and you need us. ***** So, what makes a liberal? A liberal is someone who looks for the best in people, not the worst.  We believe everyone is of equal value and that people always achieve more together than they do when they are at each others\u2019 throats. That sounds like common sense doesn\u2019t it?  But not everyone agrees with us. In Northern Ireland \u2013 unionists and republicans risk conflict and insecurity for the sake of cheap votes ahead of next May\u2019s elections.  Blaming the other, not seeing the best in each other. And in the rest of the UK, we see nationalists wrapped in the Union Jack, and the Saltire - Blaming the other, not seeing the best in each other. And throughout Britain we see little Englanders seeking to leave the European Union.  Blaming the other, not seeing the best in each other. There is a common theme. From the mouths of too many politicians come words of division and separation, spite and displacement. It\u2019s all the fault of Brussels, or the English, or the Scots, or the immigrants, or the idle poor, or the idle rich or business people, or the young, or the old, or foreigners or anybody else\u2026 If you think that is wrong If you reject the politics of blame and separation. If you say Britain is best when Britain is together. If you say Britain is best when it is outward looking, modern and inclusive Then guess what. You\u2019re a liberal. Embrace that diagnosis.  It is an utterly decent and British condition. And if that\u2019s the case we need you to help us win the most important vote in a generation.  The referendum to keep Britain in Europe The campaign to remain within the European Union \u2013 must be made with the head and the heart. It\u2019s time for Britain to lead, not leave. Our national interest does not end at Dover. Together we are stronger in the fight against the global problems that don\u2019t stop at borders. Together we can fight climate change, together we can stop international crime, and together we can provide hope for the desperate.   I am proud to be part of a united Europe. I grew up, like many here, in the shadow of the cold war and the bomb. Now in the continent, that was wracked by conflict over centuries, countries now sit down and talk to each other around a single table. So be in no doubt: whenever the EU referendum comes, however the other parties split, there will be one party united in its commitment to maintain Britain\u2019s place in Europe. No ifs, no buts.  That party will be the Liberal Democrats. Leaving the European Union would damage every community in Britain.  It would be a killer blow to our prosperity, our security, our stability, our relevance.  It would be staggeringly unpatriotic. There\u2019s been a lot of nonsense written about Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s patriotism following a service at St Paul\u2019s a week ago. Is it a threat to Britain if the leader of the Labour party doesn\u2019t sing the national anthem? Not really. Is it a threat to Britain if the leader of the Labour party is ambivalent about Britain\u2019s future in Europe? Absolutely! In the coming months, if you want to back Britain you need to back the campaign for Britain to remain in the EU. And because this is so important, you can\u2019t afford just to agree with us, you have to join us. Join us because outside Europe Britain is weaker, more isolated and less able to defend its own interests. Join us because this is a once in a generation threat to our economy and our identity as a decent outward looking people. Join us because if you leave it to someone else they maybe leaving it to you. ***** There are millions of people in Britain who know in their hearts that they are liberals. We need to convince them now to become Liberal Democrats. And here\u2019s a thing.  There are thousands of people who are liberals who are currently in other parties. Maybe you are currently a Conservative \u2013 and you see your vote being used to punish working people on low incomes and to punish business by toying with exit from Europe? Maybe you are currently in the SNP \u2013 and you see your vote being used to chase a second referendum while devolved services like the NHS are creaking at the seams. Maybe you are currently in the Labour party \u2013 and you see your vote being used to pedal fantasy economics that will cause greater poverty and austerity. I have this message for you. If you are a liberal, why don\u2019t you join the liberals? If you are a liberally-minded person in another party which is not what you would want it to be, join us. If you have never been involved in politics before but are dismayed by the blame, division, fantasy or fear you see peddled by others, join us. If you have been a Liberal Democrat before and find your passion reignited, join us. Because, now more than ever, being a spectator is not an option.  Action is vital. Go online now - join the Liberal Democrats today. ***** Today, we see threats to our human rights, to our economy, to our planet. But we also see amazing opportunities.  The world is changing so fast with revolutionary new technologies and new ways of doing business. Hardly surprising then, that the political world is changing too, at a pace we can barely contemplate. Today, with four and a half years until the next general election, the Official opposition seems to have left the playing field. Less than 5 months since the worst result for our party in 45 years the circumstances have contrived to make our party more relevant, more central, more essential than we have ever been. Britain needs an opposition that is economically credible, radical, liberal. Britain needs an opposition that is passionate and socially just. Britain needs an opposition that is serious about power to make a difference, to improve all our lives. Under my leadership the Liberal Democrats will be that opposition, because if we do not do this, it is clear now that no one else will. The alternative will be years of a disastrous one-party monopoly. We do not have the right to rest after the trials of government. As Jo Grimond said, \u2018in times of war, in times of doubt Generals were advised to march their troops towards the sound of gunfire\u2019 Well, troops I hear gunfire. Fellow Liberal Democrats, there has never been more space for us, never been more need for us, never been a bigger challenge for us. Against all the odds, we have just been given the chance to take centre stage. We will accept that role. It\u2019s time for Liberal Democrats to win again.
